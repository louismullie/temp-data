## Question

Delayed intracranial bleeding in patients with warfarin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage (DICH) in patients on warfarin after blunt head trauma, including incidence, risk factors, management implications, and how this compares with DOACs and antiplatelet agents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining DICH and the clinical context. Then, I should verify the best estimates of DICH incidence from high-quality studies. Next, I will examine risk modifiers, especially INR, age, and mechanism. After that, I need to review guideline positions and practical ED pathways, including observation and repeat imaging. Finally, I will compare warfarin with DOACs and antiplatelets and synthesize a pragmatic, risk-stratified approach with explicit return precautions and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical context so I don't conflate immediate and delayed bleeding. DICH here refers to new intracranial hemorrhage detected after an initially negative head CT following blunt head trauma, typically within 1–2 weeks, and most often in the setting of anticoagulation; this is the construct used in prospective cohorts and systematic reviews of anticoagulated patients with minor TBI and normal initial imaging [^111zXYhi] [^112eRnJr] [^114fn2W8].

> Now, I should verify the best estimates of DICH incidence in warfarin patients with a normal initial CT. The multicenter prospective study by Nishijima et al. found DICH in 4 of 687 warfarin patients (0.6%; 95% CI 0.2–1.5%) within 14 days of a normal CT, with no neurosurgical intervention required, which anchors the low end of contemporary estimates [^111zXYhi]. A meta-analysis of 1,594 warfarin patients rescanned at 24 hours reported a pooled DICH incidence of 0.6% (95% CI 0–1.2%) with 0.13% risk of neurosurgery or death, supporting the notion that most events are rare and clinically modest in the first day [^112eRnJr]. Hold on, I should double-check broader cohorts: in a large prospective cohort of adults ≥ 55 years, only 1 of 75 warfarin users had DICH, again reinforcing a very low absolute risk after a normal CT [^111w7SK5]. Taken together, the most reliable estimates place DICH around 0.6–1% in warfarin patients with a normal initial CT, with very low rates of intervention or death [^111zXYhi] [^112eRnJr] [^111w7SK5].

> Wait, let me verify older or smaller series that sometimes report higher rates, because heterogeneity exists. Some systematic reviews and observational cohorts cite ranges up to 5–6% or even higher, but these often include mixed anticoagulants, variable definitions of "minor" injury, and heterogeneous imaging protocols; for example, a 2015 systematic review reported 5.8–72 per 1,000 (about 0.6–7.2%), but emphasized population- and methodology-dependent variability and low-level evidence, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize those higher figures to modern, neurologically intact warfarin patients with a normal CT [^114fn2W8]. Similarly, a prospective 24-hour protocol series found 6% new hemorrhage on repeat CT, but that cohort was small and enriched for higher-risk features, so the higher incidence likely reflects selection and ascertainment bias rather than the general ED population [^112MBp9s].

> I need to check which risk factors truly modify DICH risk. Supratherapeutic INR is the most consistently cited predictor: in a prospective 24-hour protocol, an initial INR > 3.0 carried a 14-fold increased risk of delayed hemorrhage, and retrospective data suggest no DICH when INR was < 2.0, though the latter had wide confidence intervals and should be interpreted as supportive rather than definitive [^112MBp9s] [^1169qYd9]. Mechanism matters too; even ground-level falls can cause clinically significant bleeding in older adults, and loss of consciousness or amnesia increases the pretest probability of immediate ICH, which indirectly raises concern for delayed evolution even when the first CT is normal [^114pTnG7] [^113uYaYc]. Age itself is a major driver of baseline ICH risk in anticoagulated elders, and geriatric patients are more likely to harbor subdural hematomas that can evolve slowly, so I should keep a lower threshold for observation in those ≥ 65 years even with a normal CT [^11398HnV] [^113uYaYc].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my recommendations align with consensus. The 2023 ACEP Clinical Policy advises against routine repeat imaging or admission for neurologically intact adults with a normal initial CT who are on anticoagulants, emphasizing that delayed ICH is uncommon and neurosurgical intervention is rare, while still recommending clear return precautions and individualized decisions for higher-risk features such as advanced age or antiplatelet co-therapy [^115FBAy8] [^117DtB6P]. Hold on, I should verify European guidance: Austrian consensus recommends 24-hour observation with neurologic checks and repeat CT only if there is deterioration, reflecting a more conservative stance that still avoids blanket repeat imaging in all-comers [^115nrEMY]. WSES geriatric guidance supports a low threshold for initial CT and structured observation in anticoagulated elders, again underscoring individualized risk assessment rather than universal protocols [^113uYaYc].

> Let me consider practical ED management pathways and where INR fits. If the initial CT is normal and the patient is neurologically intact, discharge with explicit return precautions is reasonable. If INR is > 3.0 or there are high-risk features (age ≥ 65, dangerous mechanism, antiplatelet co-therapy, unreliable follow-up), a 24-hour observation with a single repeat CT before discharge is a reasonable, evidence-informed compromise that balances risk without overuse of resources [^115FBAy8] [^112MBp9s] [^1169qYd9]. I should confirm that routine repeat CT at a fixed interval without clinical change is not mandated; indeed, contemporary policies discourage routine repeat imaging in low-risk, neurologically intact patients after a normal CT, reserving repeat CT for deterioration or selected high-risk scenarios [^115FBAy8] [^117DtB6P].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a DOAC rather than warfarin — does the DICH risk differ? I should double-check comparative data. Meta-analyses and multicenter cohorts consistently show lower immediate ICH risk with DOACs than warfarin, and DICH after a normal CT appears comparably rare with DOACs, with pooled estimates around 1–2% and very low intervention rates; ACEP cites 1.5% for DOACs vs 0.6% for warfarin in pooled analyses, and multicenter studies report similar DICH incidence between DOACs and warfarin with no neurosurgical interventions in DOAC patients who develop DICH [^117DtB6P] [^111P8kFC] [^116gsyQp]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not imply zero risk; rare DICH cases do occur with DOACs, but observational data suggest outcomes are favorable and routine repeat imaging is not generally indicated in neurologically intact patients with a normal initial CT [^111P8kFC] [^116gsyQp].

> I will now examine antiplatelet agents briefly to avoid overgeneralization. Clopidogrel is associated with higher immediate ICH risk than warfarin, but in prospective follow-up of patients with normal initial CTs, delayed ICH was not observed in clopidogrel users, suggesting that DICH risk is low when the first scan is normal; nonetheless, ACEP still flags antiplatelet therapy as a higher-risk feature warranting stronger return precautions and shared decision-making about observation [^111zXYhi] [^117DtB6P]. Let me reconsider aspirin monotherapy: data are mixed, with some studies showing increased ICH risk and others not, so I should individualize based on age, mechanism, and reliability rather than apply a uniform protocol [^112TNRes] [^117DtB6P].

> Next, I should review what to do if DICH is identified or suspected. Immediate neurologic reassessment, stat head CT, and coagulopathy correction are indicated. For warfarin, rapid reversal with 4-factor PCC plus vitamin K is preferred over FFP when available, and although retrospective, data suggest PCC use is increasing and may be associated with less progression, while acknowledging confounding and the lack of randomized data in trauma-specific cohorts [^notfound]. I need to ensure I don't conflate spontaneous ICH guidance with traumatic ICH; ACC guidance on restarting anticoagulation after ICH is primarily derived from spontaneous ICH cohorts and suggests individualized timing, often ≥ 4 weeks, but this cannot be directly imported to traumatic ICH without considering the differing natural history and the competing thrombotic risk, so I should be cautious in extrapolating those intervals to tICH [^1115sZif].

> Finally, I should synthesize a pragmatic approach and confirm it aligns with the evidence. For warfarin patients with minor blunt head trauma and a normal initial CT who are neurologically intact, the risk of DICH is about 0.6–1% and the likelihood of needing neurosurgery is very low; discharge with explicit return precautions is appropriate, with consideration of 24-hour observation and a single repeat CT for those with INR > 3.0, age ≥ 65, dangerous mechanism, antiplatelet co-therapy, or unreliable follow-up, recognizing that routine repeat imaging in all such patients is not supported by high-quality evidence [^111zXYhi] [^112eRnJr] [^115FBAy8] [^117DtB6P]. I should double-check that my plan emphasizes education about delayed symptoms and a reliable caregiver, because most clinically significant delayed events declare themselves within 24–48 hours, and structured precautions are the most reliable safety net when patients are discharged [^115FBAy8] [^117DtB6P].

---

Delayed intracranial hemorrhage (DICH) in warfarin patients is rare but clinically significant, with an incidence of **0.6–1.5%** after a normal initial CT [^111zXYhi] [^112eRnJr], rising to 6% in high-risk subgroups [^115nrEMY]. Risk is highest in the first **24–48 hours** and is strongly linked to supratherapeutic INR (> 3.0) [^112MBp9s] and high-energy mechanisms [^112eRnJr]. Most cases are subdural hematomas and can progress rapidly, so **close observation and early repeat imaging** are essential when risk is elevated [^115nrEMY]. Routine repeat CT is not needed for all patients [^115FBAy8], but those with INR > 3.0, age > 65, or high-risk mechanisms should be observed for 24–48 hours with a low threshold for repeat imaging [^112MBp9s] [^113uYaYc] [^116Ae9Ej] [^115nrEMY]. Management includes immediate warfarin reversal with PCC and vitamin K [^112V1P83] [^116NAC6b], neurosurgical consultation, and structured discharge with clear return precautions [^115FBAy8].

---

## Incidence and timing

- **Incidence**: DICH occurs in 0.6–1.5% of warfarin patients with a normal initial CT [^111zXYhi] [^112eRnJr], with higher rates (up to 6%) in high-risk subgroups [^112MBp9s].

- **Timing**: Most DICH occurs within 24–48 hours [^115nrEMY], but cases have been reported up to 14 days post-injury [^111w7SK5].

- **Hematoma type**: Subdural hematoma is the most common delayed bleed, often expanding rapidly and causing neurological decline [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase **DICH risk** in warfarin patients:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Supratherapeutic INR | INR > 3.0 significantly increases DICH risk [^112MBp9s] [^111n21sW] |
| High-energy mechanism | Greater impact force increases risk [^112eRnJr] |
| Age | Older patients have higher risk [^1169qYd9] |
| Comorbidities | Hypertension, renal impairment, and liver disease increase risk [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical presentation

DICH may present with **nonspecific symptoms**, making early detection challenging:

- **Headache**: Common but nonspecific [^notfound].

- **Neurological decline**: Altered mental status, focal deficits, or seizures [^notfound].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, or dizziness [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Initial CT**: Mandatory for all anticoagulated patients with head trauma [^1116DA4D] [^11398HnV].

- **Repeat CT**: Indicated within 24–48 hours for high-risk patients (INR > 3.0, age > 65, high-energy mechanism) [^112MBp9s] [^113uYaYc].

- **INR monitoring**: Regular checks to guide reversal and management [^113cRcn3].

---

## Management strategies

Immediate management focuses on **rapid reversal** and close monitoring:

- **Reversal of anticoagulation**: PCC and vitamin K are first-line for rapid INR correction [^notfound].

- **Neurosurgical consultation**: Essential for hematoma evacuation or decompressive interventions if indicated [^115JT2Th].

- **Observation**: Continuous neurological monitoring in a critical care setting for high-risk patients [^115nrEMY].

---

## Outcomes and prognosis

Mortality is higher in warfarin-associated DICH than in non-anticoagulated patients, particularly with **supratherapeutic INR** [^117N8g1c]. Neurological outcomes are often poor, with a high risk of permanent deficits or death [^111q3cmX]. Recurrence risk persists as long as anticoagulation continues, necessitating careful risk–benefit assessment when restarting therapy [^1115sZif].

---

## Preventive measures and guidelines

- **Patient education**: Clear instructions on bleeding signs and when to seek care [^115FBAy8].

- **INR monitoring**: Frequent checks to maintain therapeutic range [^113cRcn3].

- **Fall prevention**: Strategies to reduce head trauma risk in elderly patients [^115FBAy8].

- **Individualized care**: Tailor management to patient-specific risk factors and clinical context [^1162oTF1].

---

Delayed intracranial hemorrhage in warfarin patients is rare but potentially catastrophic; **risk stratification, close observation, and rapid reversal** are critical to improving outcomes [^115FBAy8].

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^111yp4AE]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Unden and colleagues have provided a comprehensive management algorithm for patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury. As the authors acknowledge, external validation of these guidelines is necessary before widespread implementation could be considered. The admission guidelines and monitoring routines suggested by the authors are very conservative and may not be feasible in some medical centers struggling with finite health care resources. Additional research is needed to determine the risk of delayed intracranial pathology in patients with risk factors such as shunt-treated hydrocephalus or anticoagulation but normal initial CT imaging.

### Delayed intracranial hemorrhage after blunt head injury with direct oral anticoagulants [^116JJkPN]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) following head injury are frequently evaluated with an initial computed tomography scan (CT) of the brain. Imaging is particularly important in patients who are receiving medications that alter normal blood hemostasis. As an imaging modality, CT has a high negative predictive value when used to rule out clinically significant acute intracranial hemorrhage. Patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy have both an increased risk of initial hemorrhage, as well as an increased risk of mortality above nonanticoagulated patients, should they suffer hemorrhage. Multiple studies of delayed intracranial hemorrhage have placed the risk among the patients taking warfarin at the time of head injury in the range of 0.6–6.0%. However, data regarding the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in patients taking the class of agents referred to as Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) remains limited. This study aims to estimate this risk.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients on DOACs who presented to our Level I trauma center following blunt head injury between January 2017 and August 2018. Patients with a negative initial head CT were selected. From this subset, data regarding demographics, injury characteristics, anticoagulant use, and antiplatelet use were collected.

Results

Overall, 314 patients were included; 129 patients taking rivaroxaban, 182 patients taking apixaban, and four patients taking dabigatran. In approximately 29% of the patients, the sole indication for admission was close monitoring following head injury while taking an anticoagulant agent. The mechanism of injury for the majority of the patients was fall. Of the 314 patients, three were found to have delayed intracranial hemorrhage on the repeated head CT (0.95%). Two of these three patients were on concomitant antiplatelet medication. None of the three individuals required neurosurgical intervention.

Conclusions

at the time of submission, this is the largest study estimating the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage among patients on DOACs. Based on the results of this study, patients who sustain a blunt head injury while taking only DOACs; that is, without concurrent antiplatelet medication, admission, and repeat head CT may not be necessary after confirming a negative initial CT scan.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^114FtAgm]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical equipoise in treatment timing after tICrH, and therefore uncertainty in best course of action, is distributed within the range of current guidelines. Restarting oral anticoagulants after most cases tICrH appears to be supported by broad clinical consensus, but clinical equipoise still exists for the timing, although most clinicians and experts surveyed state they prefer to restart in the first month after injury. The demonstrated existence of competing risks for hemorrhage and thrombosis suggests that there is an optimal timing that can be identified within the time windows offered by current consensus. It is also likely that this timing varies by individual cases' presentation and risk factors. Many of the observational studies described in this review excluded cases with contraindications for anticoagulation such as hematoma expansion on follow-up imaging. Ongoing and planned clinical trials will shed more light on these important clinical questions. The results of these clinical trials offer unique insights, based on the differences in sample criteria and timing of interventions offered.

### Evaluation of the yield of 24-h close observation in patients with mild traumatic brain injury on anticoagulation therapy: a retrospective multicenter study and meta-analysis [^117WtsKE]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) on anticoagulants have an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). However, consensus is lacking on whether to admit them after normal initial cranial CT. We evaluated the yield of 24-h neurological observation.

Methods

Retrospective multicenter study including adult patients admitted over a 5-year period with mTBI on anticoagulation [therapeutic dose heparin, direct oral anticoagulant, or vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 1.7] and reportedly normal cranial CT obtained within 24 h after trauma. Primary endpoint was symptomatic ICH within 24 h of injury. Literature on delayed ICH in patients with mTBI and anticoagulation use was reviewed.

Results

Of 17.643 mTBI patients, 905 met the inclusion criteria (median age 82 years). 97% used VKA (median INR 2.9). None developed delayed ICH within 24 h. Nine patients deteriorated neurologically due to ICH, four within 24 h (0.4%, 95% CI 0.1–1.2) and five on day 2, 18, 22, 36 and 52, respectively. In six patients, including all four that developed symptoms within 24 h, ICH was found upon reevaluation of initial imaging. The meta-analysis comprised of 9 studies with data from 2885 patients. The estimated pooled proportion of symptomatic delayed ICH or delayed diagnosis of ICH within 24 h was 0.2% (95% CI 0.0–0.5).

Conclusions

Delayed (diagnosis of) ICH within 24 h is very rare in mTBI patients on anticoagulants after reportedly normal initial CT. Routine hospitalization of these patients seems unwarranted when the initial cranial CT is scrupulously evaluated.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1115sZif]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) — restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) requires caution due to high baseline risk; nonlobar ICH reinitiation "may be considered", observational data suggest resumption yields "50% to 70% lower" thrombosis and death without more recurrent bleeding versus discontinuation, timing in studies ranges "72 hours to 30 weeks", current guidelines "recommend avoiding anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks" without mechanical valves and using aspirin initially if indicated, and the authors "favor delaying" OAC for "at least 4 weeks" in patients without high thrombotic risk. ICH accounts for "approximately 20%" of spontaneous cases with "30-day mortality rates approaching 50%", recurrence risk is influenced by bleed mechanism, lobar location, microbleeds, and ongoing anticoagulation; DOAC safety after ICH switch "has not been evaluated". A randomized trial of 537 post‑ICH patients restarting aspirin showed a trend to less recurrent ICH (adjusted HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060) without reduction in ischemic events (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65–1.60; p = 0.92), and a large retrospective study reported median OAC restart "approximately 1 month" after bleeding.

### A systematic review of the timing of therapeutic anticoagulation in adult patients with acute traumatic brain injury: narrative synthesis of observational studies [^113UTgJE]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) presents complex management scenarios, particularly in patients requiring anticoagulation for concurrent conditions such as venous thromboembolism (VTE) or atrial fibrillation (AF). A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify relevant studies. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies assessing the effects of anticoagulation therapy on outcomes such as re-hemorrhage, hematoma expansion, thrombotic events, and hemorrhagic events in TBI patients with subdural hematomas (SDH). This systematic review critically addresses two key questions: the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulation therapy and the differential impact of this timing based on the type of intracranial bleed, with a specific focus on subdural hematomas (SDH) compared to other types. Initially screening 508 articles, 7 studies met inclusion criteria, which varied in design and quality, precluding meta-analysis. The review highlights a significant knowledge gap, underscoring the lack of consensus on when to initiate anticoagulation therapy in TBI patients, exacerbated by the need for anticoagulation in the presence of VTE or AF. Early anticoagulation, particularly in patients with SDH, may elevate the risk of re-hemorrhage, posing a clinical dilemma. Evidence on whether the type of intracranial hemorrhage influences outcomes with early anticoagulation remains inconclusive, indicating a need for further research to tailor management strategies effectively. This review underscores the scarcity of high-quality evidence regarding anticoagulation therapy in TBI patients with concurrent conditions, emphasizing the necessity for well-designed prospective studies to elucidate optimal management strategies for this complex patient population.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^113BiTq6]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICrH) is a devastating injury with high morbidity and mortality. For survivors, treating clinicians face the dilemma of restarting oral anticoagulation with scarce evidence to guide them. Thromboembolic risk is high from the bleeding event, patients' high baseline risks, that is, the pre-existing indication for anticoagulation, and the risk of immobility after the bleeding episode. This must be balanced with potentially devastating hematoma expansion or new hemorrhagic lesions. Retrospective evidence and expert opinion support restarting oral anticoagulants in most patients with tICrH, but timing is uncertain. Researchers have failed to make clear distinctions between tICrH and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (sICrH), which have differing natural histories. While both appear to benefit from restarting, sICrH has a higher rebleeding risk and similar or lower thrombotic risk. Clinical equipoise on restarting is also divergent. In sICrH, equipoise is centered on whether to restart. In tICrH, it is centered on when. Several prospective randomized clinical trials are ongoing or about to start to examine the risk-benefit of restarting. Most of them are restricted to patients with sICrH, with antiplatelet control groups. Most are also restricted to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as they are associated with a lower overall risk of ICrH. There is some overlap with tICrH via subdural hematoma, and one trial is specific to restart timing with DOACs in only traumatic cases. This is a narrative review of the current evidence for restarting anticoagulation and restart timing after tICrH along with a summary of the ongoing and planned clinical trials.

Restart following surgical intervention of tICrH

tICrH also frequently requires emergent surgical intervention. These patients are already at elevated risk of hematoma expansion as well as subsequent thromboembolic complications. The decision to perform neurosurgical interventions may further alter the subsequent risk profile of recurrent hemorrhage for anticoagulated tICrH. With regard to pre-injury treatment, anticoagulation increases the risks of surgical intervention. In the near term, pre-injury anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment was not associated with acute, postoperative hemorrhage in a retrospective study of 143 neurosurgical (craniotomy and craniectomy) patients.VKA relative to DOAC, antiplatelets or controls has been associated with greater reversal agent use, hematoma expansion and mortality, but unrelated to the need for surgical intervention. Another study demonstrated that DOAC treatment pre-injury was associated with greater likelihood of neurosurgical intervention. However, a larger study of chronic SDH evacuation demonstrated that cases on preoperative anticoagulation therapy were more likely to experience major hemorrhage during follow-up (OR = 1.93, p = 0.014), and the time to occurrence of either hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications was shorter.

With regard to reinitiation of anticoagulation therapy, the use of DOAC therapy or heparin has been recommended over VKA, based on evidence of lower risk of ICrH in non-bleeding populations. There is a real scarcity of evidence for any relationship between surgical treatment for tICrH and the decision to restart anticoagulation. Here as well, selection bias is an obvious concern with any retrospective, observational research into the question of restart. This may partly explain associations found between reinitiation and reduced risk of hemorrhage in unadjusted analyses. In cases with elevated risk of thromboembolic events, reinitiation as early as 3 days postinjury has also been suggested. However, the overall strategy for how to manage anticoagulant-associated ICrH after surgery is unclear.

### Outcomes associated with resuming warfarin treatment after hemorrhagic stroke or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114ba8qJ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The increase in the risk for bleeding associated with antithrombotic therapy causes a dilemma in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who sustain an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). A thrombotic risk is present; however, a risk for serious harm associated with resumption of anticoagulation therapy also exists.

Objective

To investigate the prognosis associated with resuming warfarin treatment stratified by the type of ICH (hemorrhagic stroke or traumatic ICH).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationwide observational cohort study included patients with AF who sustained an incident ICH event during warfarin treatment from January 1, 1998, through February 28, 2016. Follow-up was completed April 30, 2016. Resumption of warfarin treatment was evaluated after hospital discharge.

Exposures

No oral anticoagulant treatment or resumption of warfarin treatment, included as a time-dependent exposure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

One-year observed event rates per 100 person-years were calculated, and treatment strategies were compared using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for age, sex, length of hospital stay, comorbidities, and concomitant medication use.

Results

A total of 2415 patients with AF in this cohort (1481 men [61.3%] and 934 women [38.7%]; mean [SD] age, 77.1 years [9.1 years]) sustained an ICH event. Of these events, 1325 were attributable to hemorrhagic stroke and 1090 were secondary to trauma. During the first year, 305 patients with a hemorrhagic stroke (23.0%) died, whereas 210 in the traumatic ICH group (19.3%) died. Among patients with hemorrhagic stroke, resuming warfarin therapy was associated with a lower rate of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (SE) (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24–1.02) and an increased rate of recurrent ICH (AHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.68–2.50) compared with not resuming warfarin therapy, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. For patients with traumatic ICH, resuming warfarin therapy also was associated with a lower rate of ischemic stroke or SE (AHR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.15–1.11); however, in contrast to patients with hemorrhagic stroke, therapy resumption was associated with a significantly lower rate of recurrent ICH (AHR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26–0.76). A reduction in mortality was associated with resuming warfarin therapy among patients with hemorrhagic stroke (AHR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37–0.71) and those with traumatic ICH (AHR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.23–0.52).

Conclusions and Relevance

Resumption of warfarin therapy after spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke in patients with AF was associated with a lower rate of ischemic events and a higher rate of recurrent ICH. Among patients with a traumatic ICH, a similar lower rate of ischemic events was found; however, a lower relative risk for recurrent ICH despite resuming warfarin treatment was also revealed.

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. BET 3: observation is unnecessary following a normal CT brain in warfarinised head injuries: an update [^115r9Q1p]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was carried out to determine whether patients on warfarin with a minor head injury can be discharged safely if they have a normal CT scan. 796 papers were found using the reported search, of which seven were considered relevant to the three-part question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses are shown in the accompanying table. It is concluded that the risk of delayed intracranial haemorrhage, at least in patients with an INR < 3, is extremely small and discharge of these patients should be considered.

### Understanding the management of patients with head injury taking warfarin: who should we scan and when? Lessons from the AHEAD study [^1162oTF1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulated patients represent an important and increasing proportion of the patients with head trauma attending the ED, but there is no international consensus for their appropriate investigation and management. International guidelines vary and are largely based on a small number of studies, which provide poor-quality evidence for the management of patients taking warfarin. This article provides an overview of the clinical research evidence for CT scanning head-injured patients taking warfarin and a discussion of interpretation of risk and acceptable risk. We aim to provide shop floor clinicians with an understanding of the limitations of the evidence in this field and the limitations of applying 'one-size-fits-all' guidelines to individual patients. There is good evidence for a more selective scanning approach to patients with head injuries taking warfarin than is currently recommended by most guidelines. Specifically, patients without any head injury-related symptoms and GCS score 15 have a reduced risk of adverse outcome and may not need to be scanned. We argue that there is evidence to support an individualised approach to decision to CT scan in mild head injuries on warfarin and that clinicians should feel able to discuss risks with patients and sometimes decide not to scan.

We investigated the frequency and characteristics of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), the factors associated with the risk of ICH, and outcomes post-ICH overall and by randomized treatment. We identified patients with ICH from the overall trial population enrolled in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation trial who received ≥ 1 dose of the study drug (n = 18140). ICH was adjudicated by a central committee. Cox regression models were used to identify factors associated with ICH. ICH occurred in 174 patients; most ICH events were spontaneous (71.7%) versus traumatic (28.3%). Apixaban resulted in significantly less ICH (0.33% per year), regardless of type and location, than warfarin (0.80% per year). Independent factors associated with increased risk of ICH were enrollment in Asia or Latin America, older age, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, and aspirin use at baseline. Among warfarin-treated patients, the median (25th, 75th percentiles) time from most recent international normalized ratio (INR) to ICH was 13 days (6, 21 days). Median INR prior to ICH was 2.6 (2.1, 3.0); 78.5% of patients had a pre-ICH INR < 3.0. After ICH, the modified Rankin scale score at discharge was ≥ 4 in 55.7% of patients, and the overall mortality rate at 30 days was 43.3% with no difference between apixaban- and warfarin-treated patients. ICH occurred at a rate of 0.80% per year with warfarin regardless of INR control and at a rate of 0.33% per year with apixaban and was associated with high short-term morbidity and mortality. This highlights the clinical relevance of reducing ICH by using apixaban rather than warfarin and avoiding concomitant aspirin, especially in patients of older age. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00412984.

### Therapeutic anticoagulation can be safely accomplished in selected patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage [^115dxymp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Injured patients are at significant risk of both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. These divergent risks create a therapeutic conundrum for trauma surgeons. Use of anticoagulation can lead to potential exsanguination and death, while avoidance of anticoagulation can lead to thrombotic complications and death. Our data represents a novel report that suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation can be safely accomplished in select patients with intracranial hemorrhage.

There is very little to guide trauma surgeons in the safety profile of therapeutic anticoagulation. A recent review by Golob, et. al. evaluated the safety of initiating therapeutic anticoagulation in multi-injured trauma patients. They noted that 21% of patients had complications from the therapy. The most common complication was an acute drop in hemoglobin requiring a blood transfusion; three patients died as a result of hemorrhage. Clinical factors associated with a higher risk of complications were COPD, low platelet count before therapy, and the use of unfractionated hemorrhage. This study, however, did not include any patients with head injuries, so extrapolation to this population is difficult.

Injured patients are at significant risk of thrombotic complications. Patients with multisystem trauma may develop DVT at a rate of 58%, while a quarter of patients with isolated intracranial hemorrhage may develop DVT. This has led to significant study evaluating medical DVT prophylaxis in head injured patients. These studies have evaluated both low dose heparin and low molecular weight heparin. Norwood, et.al. noted that enoxaparin could be safely administered to select patients within 24 h of craniotomy for trauma. In a separate report, this group noted a 3.4% progression rate of intracranial hemorrhage after institution of prophylactic doses of anticoagulants.

These reports were highly important in that they dispelled the traditional viewpoint that prophylactic anticoagulation is unsafe after brain trauma. They do not, however, speak to the safety profile of therapeutic anticoagulation. Traditional recommendations suggest that therapeutic anticoagulation is unsafe after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Textbooks have noted that anticoagulation should be delayed for 3 days to 6 weeks after injury "depending on local customs" (although no references were cited to support this recommendation). Our data suggests that anticoagulation in the earlier portion of this window may be safe.

Three other studies focus on the immediate postacute period in patients with tICrH. Divito et al retrospectively analyzed 112 patients with tICrH, skewing severe with 29% requiring neurosurgical intervention. Median restart interval was 8 days (range 1–31) (see figure 6). These patients had 88 thromboembolic events: 32 pulmonary emboli (PEs), 44 deep venous thromboses (DVTs), 4 MIs and 2 left ventricular thrombi. To a large extent, the events in Divito drove restart decisions as opposed to starting with a priori secondary prevention in mind, and the population skewed severe with 42% having a Glasgow Coma Score < 9. However, the bleeding risk seen is informative. There were no deaths directly attributable to anticoagulation. One patient developed a chronic subdural hygroma that required surgery 2 weeks later, and one patient died of a hemothorax, but the patient was also in septic shock and the family declined further intervention. Byrnes et al used a similar retrospective model in which the thromboembolic event drove anticoagulation, analyzing 42 patients with tICrH who developed DVT, PE or blunt cerebrovascular injury, 26 of which were anticoagulated. Mean start interval was 11.9 days with a broad range with nearly half restarted between 1 and 2 weeks. Byrnes et al did not report on thromboembolic events after initiation of anticoagulation and found only one case of hematoma expansion, 1–2 mm in an intraparenchymal hemorrhage 6 days after restart that did not affect clinical course. Pandya et al studied 97 patients with tICrH, dividing them into SDH and all other tICrH and correlating start of either anticoagulants 36%, antiplatelets (53%) or both (11%). Start of therapy was 8.8 ± 9.7 days. None of the 'other' tICrH group had hematoma expansion. Five of the SDH (9.1%) had clinically significant expansion; however, only one of these was on an anticoagulant and one on both antiplatelet and anticoagulant (the others were on only antiplatelet therapy). Finally, there is an analysis that suggests a more aggressive approach to restarting. Hawryluk et al extracted data from 63 case reports and series on 492 anticoagulated patients with central nervous system hemorrhage finding a rebleeding rate of 8% and a thromboembolic event rate of 6%. Temporal mapping (see figure 7) showed most rebleeding events occurred before 72 hours, while most thromboembolic events occurred from 3 days to 1 week, suggesting 3 days would be the ideal restart interval. There are several limitations. The analysis is from the warfarin era, only 6.5% of the cases were traumatic, and it is confounded by heterogeneous case report/series reporting bias.

### Antiplatelet therapy is associated with a high rate of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head injuries [^113N2WnH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study of 327 patients taking antiplatelet medications who sustained blunt head trauma, 40.7% were found to have an acute ICH. Nine required neurosurgical intervention and none died during the hospitalization. Only three patients (0.9%) with an initial negative head CT scan were found to have a delayed ICH on repeat head CT. These delayed ICH were all found on routine repeat head CT imaging, and not due to any clinical change. None of these patients required neurosurgical intervention and none died during the hospitalization.

As mounting evidence from the 1960s to the 1980s show low-dose aspirin to be an effective means of reducing cardiovascular risk, its use in adults has become widespread. An epidemiological analysis showed that nearly 30% of all adults aged 40 years or older in the USA self-report taking low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, and the prevalence of aspirin use only increases with age. The US Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends low-dose aspirin use for primary CVD prevention and colorectal cancer. Despite the known association between antiplatelet agents and increased bleeding risk in general, few studies have looked directly at the odds of acute or delayed traumatic ICH in patients taking these medications. Among these studies, rates of ICH in patients on antiplatelet medications presenting with blunt head trauma ranged from 3.6% to 67.3%.

Although our study included all adult patients, our patient population had an average age of 76 years. Our high rate of ICH may be related to this factor. Prior research has shown that the geriatric population suffers from a higher rate of acute ICH. As the brain ages, there is volume loss, making bridging vein more vulnerable to bleeding along with decreased elasticity. The aging US population has led to increased utilization of antiplatelet medications, likely contributing to the increased incidence of bleeds.

The reported incidence of delayed ICH in the antiplatelet patient population is 0%–4%. These studies differed in their methodology and quality, several were retrospective, others were from trauma registries and some included patients on vitamin K antagonists. Our study found that the rate of delayed ICH is 0.9%, on the lower end of the previously reported range. This suggests that admitting all patients taking antiplatelet medications with blunt head trauma and a negative initial head CT may not be warranted. However, it may be prudent to admit nonagenarians, with higher injury severity scores, and lower platelet counts.

### Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients taking dabigatran: report of 3 cases and review of the literature [^115WQThg]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Importance

Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor gaining popularity as a stroke prevention agent in patients with atrial fibrillation. In comparison with warfarin, dabigatran showed superiority in stroke prevention, but lower rates of major hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage. Although warfarin has a well-established reversal strategy, there is far less experience reversing dabigatran.

Clinical Presentation

We present our experience with 3 patients who experienced an intracranial hemorrhage either spontaneously or after low-energy cranial trauma and review the available literature describing dabigatran use in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Conclusion

Intracranial hemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulants and/or antiplatelets can have either a benign or malignant clinical course. At this time, there is little experience with dabigatran reversal; however, several strategies for rapid reversal have been proposed. All patients with intracranial hemorrhage taking dabigatran should be admitted for close neurological monitoring and serial imaging.

### Outcomes of warfarinized patients with minor head injury and normal initial CT scan [^113gUTLb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

We investigated delayed outcomes of patients with minor head injury, warfarin, and a normal initial head computer tomographic (CT) scan finding.

Methods

We conducted a single-center, retrospective study on such patients who were admitted. A second CT was not mandatory. International normalized ratios were classified into subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic ranges. We traced them 2 weeks after discharge for delayed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Primary outcomes were proportions with ICH on second CT, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and/or vitamin K administration, and neurosurgical intervention. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and the proportion with ICH 2 weeks after discharge. We explored differences in proportions of ICH during hospital stay among different strata (age ≥ 65 years, antiplatelet therapy, supratherapeutic international normalized ratio ranges, and FFP administration). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

We recruited 298 patients. Of admissions (N = 295), 11 (3.7%) had a second CT, with one (0.3%) abnormality. There were 7 (2.4%) and 8 (2.7%) patients who received FFP and vitamin K, respectively. One patient (0.3%) required neurosurgical intervention. The median hospital length of stay was 3 (interquartile range, 2) days. No patients reattended 2 weeks after discharge. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of ICH during hospital stay among the 4 strata.

Conclusions

Delayed ICH was rare with no predictive factors. Clinical monitoring before deciding on second CT was safe. The optimal period and mode of observation had yet to be determined.

Vitamin K antagonists versus direct oral anticoagulants

VKA such as warfarin had been the standard of care for decades until the DOACs were approved starting in 2010. With simple dosing, no routine monitoring, and less food and drug interactions, DOACs are rapidly replacing warfarin in non-valvular AF and venous thromboembolism treatment and prevention.DOACs are also associated with a lower ICrH risk. A possible mechanism involves factor VII. Warfarin inhibits factor VII synthesis (along with factors II, IX, X and proteins C and S) by blocking the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. DOACs target factors IIa and Xa, leaving factor VII intact. The brain is rich in tissue factor, an important protective mechanism in an environment where uncontrolled bleeding is fatal. The interaction of activated factor VII with tissue factor causing a thrombin burst is an important hemostatic mechanism as it is the initiation step in both the classic (extrinsic pathway) and cell-based models of coagulation. Lower ICrH risk was seen in all the clinical trials of VKA versus DOACs both in AF and VTE treatment populations. The patient populations that are an exception are those with mechanical valves and ventricular assist devices (VADs). Clinical trials of DOACs in valve patients failed.VKAs are still the standard of care in these patients. The prospective trials in restart and timing are primarily testing DOACs and excluding patients with mechanical valves and VADs. A retrospective analysis of mechanical valve patients with ICrH using a composite outcome found the balance between bleeding and thrombosis was best achieved in valve patients at 6.7 days to restart. In VAD patients, restarting at 10 days may strike the best balance.

When extrapolating warfarin data to DOACs, it important to remember that warfarin anticoagulation onset is delayed 5 days or more, and it is not standard to bridge with heparins except in VTE treatment. The restart and timing of restart literature contains primarily warfarin patients as retrospective databases used stretched back before the DOAC era.

### Antiplatelet therapy is associated with a high rate of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head injuries [^112Pbe6h]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antiplatelet agents are increasingly being used in the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease. Patients taking these medications appear to have an increased risk of traumatic bleeding. When patients suffer head trauma, an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) can occur acutely or delayed. A number of studies have looked at acute traumatic ICH in patients taking an antiplatelet agent, with ICH occurring in approximately 3.6%–67.3% of patients on antiplatelet therapy and 1.6%–50.5% of patients not on this therapy. The reported risk of delayed ICH after head injury has varied in the literature from 0% to 4%.

Several clinical guidelines highlight the risk of traumatic delayed ICH in patients taking antiplatelet agents. According to the 2014 National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines on head injury, for patients on aspirin or clopidogrel, 'the reference standard should include CT head scan and a follow-up period of sufficient duration to capture delayed bleeding, for example, at 7 days and 1 month'. Nonetheless, neither The American College of Surgeons Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient, sixth edition released in 2014 nor the Recommendations of the National Expert Panel on Field Triage published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011 include head trauma or fall in a patient taking an antiplatelet as a criterion for trauma activation. In addition, the current American College of Emergency Physicians' clinical guidelines do not specifically list antiplatelet medications as a risk factor for traumatic ICH.

With the limited amount of available research regarding the risk of both acute and delayed ICH, and the varying methodology and quality of the literature in patients taking antiplatelet agents, the objective of our study was to assess the odds of acute and delayed ICH among head trauma victims with pre-injury exposure to antiplatelet agents.

### Antiplatelet therapy is associated with a high rate of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head injuries [^115pRvAd]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

The findings of our study suggest that antiplatelet use increases the odds for the development of acute ICH after head trauma, with low risk for delayed ICH. Therefore, we recommend that all patients on antiplatelets with head injury have immediate head CT imaging. These results are generalizable to patients on the trauma service with head injury, who are potentially sicker than the overall emergency department population. However, even in these patients, we do not recommend routine admission for observation or repeat head CT imaging on asymptomatic patients with negative initial head CT imaging. These patients can safely be discharged home with outpatient follow-up and strict return precautions.

Our research adds to the previously conflicting evidence, demonstrating the need for additional investigation in this area. If future prospective studies confirm the increased rate of ICH in patients on antiplatelet medications with head injury, trauma activation guidelines may need to be amended to include these patients. In addition, identifying risk factors for ICH in patients taking antiplatelet agents may better inform physicians regarding the risk-benefit analysis in deciding on antiplatelet therapy.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with mild traumatic brain injury: approved by ACEP board of directors, February 1, 2023 clinical policy endorsed by the emergency nurses association (April 5, 2023) [^115FBAy8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACEP clinical policy — adult emergency department (ED) patients with minor head injury taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication: For patients with a normal baseline neurologic examination and an initial head computed tomography (CT) without hemorrhage, Level A recommendations are none specified. Level B recommendations state, "Do not routinely perform repeat imaging in patients after a minor head injury who are taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication and are at their baseline neurologic examination, provided the initial head CT showed no hemorrhage", and "Do not routinely admit or observe patients after a minor head injury who are taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications, who have an initial head CT without hemorrhage, and who do not meet any other criteria for extended monitoring". Level C recommendations are to "Provide instructions at discharge that include the symptoms of rare, delayed hemorrhage after a head injury (Consensus recommendation)" and "Consider outpatient referral for assessment of both fall risk and risk/benefit of anticoagulation therapy (Consensus recommendation)". Potential benefits include "A decrease in medical costs by avoiding unnecessary medical imaging or hospital observation, or admission", "Avoid inpatient health care-associated complications by avoiding excessive duration of stay in the ED or hospital", and "A decrease in length of stay for patients who could go home early from the ED without repeat imaging or prolonged observation". A potential harm is "A missed case of posttraumatic intracranial hemorrhage that could have benefited from early intervention".

Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) — risk and common management practices: The incidence of significant intracranial injuries after blunt head trauma is higher in patients on warfarin than in nonanticoagulated patients (3.9% versus 1.5%), and non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have a lower incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) than vitamin K antagonists (2.6% versus 10.2%). Because missing early hemorrhage has serious consequences, the threshold for initial imaging after minor head trauma in patients on either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents is very low. Concern about delayed ICH, cited to be as high as 6%, drives varied approaches; European guidelines suggest that all patients on anticoagulants should undergo routine observation after head injury, and many physicians repeat brain imaging after a brief period (4 to 6 hours) of observation before discharge. This clinical policy seeks to clarify whether a single CT scan is adequate to exclude ICH after blunt head trauma.

Evidence: natural history of anticoagulated tICrH and hematoma expansion

The literature on anticoagulated tICrH is cross-contaminated with sICrH data. Investigators have not rigorously applied specific nomenclature. The abbreviation ICH has been applied to intracranial hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic and spontaneous, all of the above and various subsets. (We use the preferred specific nomenclature: intracerebral hemorrhage is ICH, intracranial hemorrhage is ICrH. These are preceded by t or s for traumatic or spontaneous.) While there is considerable variation within sICrH and tICrH, it is becoming clear there is also a distinct natural history between them. There is less data on tICrH, but what exists seems to indicate a lower risk of recurrent hemorrhage than sICrH and a higher rate of thromboembolism. The possible exception is subdural hematoma (SDH) (see figure 3), which may carry a higher rebleeding risk than other tICrH. The natural history of tICrH as a disease is important in this context for understanding when the acute event ends, that is, the cessation of hematoma expansion and stabilization of clot. Anticoagulants do not break fibrin bonds. They prohibit the deposition of new fibrin by inhibiting various factors in the clotting cascade. Hematoma expansion in tICrH is very common in the first 24 hours, much less so by 48 hours and rare by 72 hours.SDHs occasionally expand later, several days to weeks, or develop into chronic SDH/hygroma, although late surgical intervention is required with diminishing frequency the longer it remains stable. It is clear from the literature that preinjury anticoagulation is associated with worse outcome, double the risk of death, increased risk of hematoma expansion (early and delayed) generally meaning after 24 hours. However, there was evidence from a small (n = 63), prospective observational study of traumatic intracerebral hemorrhages that hematoma expansion slows from 24 to 72 hours, and may not extend beyond 3–4 days.

### A surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part one: warfarin and new direct oral anticoagulant medications [^116HwxHZ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Warfarin is often a contributor to bleeding events requiring hospitalization. Warfarin, alone or in combination with other mediations, was implicated in one-third of emergency hospitalizations for medication-related adverse events in the elderly between 2007 and 2009. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or retroperitoneal hemorrhage leading to hospitalization is as high as 16% per year, and the risk of fatal bleeding is as high as 3%. As warfarin use is relatively common, preinjury warfarin use in trauma victims is frequently encountered. In trauma patients aged 65 and older admitted to US trauma centers, roughly 1 in 10 can be expected to be on warfarin therapy at the time of injury, complicating management. Not surprisingly, patients on warfarin therapy at the time of traumatic injury are at higher risk of mortality.

The risk of warfarin-associated hemorrhage is correlated with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the international normalized ratio (INR), with the risk of bleeding increased by a factor of 1.43 for each 0.5 unit increase in INR. For warfarin to be effective and relatively safe, the therapeutic window for the medication is between an INR of 2 and 3 (or slightly higher for mechanical valves). However, INR levels outside of this therapeutic window over the course of warfarin therapy are commonplace, increasing thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk. Factors contributing to a supratherapeutic INR include interactions with other medications (particularly antibiotics), acute medical illness and traumatic brain injury or other trauma-related hemorrhage.

### Characterizing the delays in adequate thromboprophylaxis after TBI [^113Nw9Gc]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Compared with patients without traumatic brain injury (TBI), those with TBI are at a higher risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). This increased risk may be partially attributed to delayed initiation of pharmacological prophylaxis secondary to the concern for progression of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In addition, despite broad research that favors enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis after TBI instead of unfractionated heparin, practice patterns for pharmacological prophylaxis remain widely variable. One study suggested unfractionated heparin dosed at 5000 U three times a day was proposed as 'non-inferior' to enoxaparin, although more recently, enoxaparin 30 mg two times per day was considered superior at the prevention of VTE.

The early initiation of enoxaparin is safe and associated with lower VTE rates. Given that patients with TBI are at risk of ICH progression, the appropriate dosing of pharmacological prophylaxis remains elusive. The aim of this study was to compare the delay in reaching the target anti-Xa levels in trauma patients with and without TBI, as well as the median dose of enoxaparin required to achieve adequate VTE prophylaxis in patients with TBI. Our hypothesis was patients with TBI have significant delays in the initiation of adequate pharmacological prophylaxis and require higher doses of enoxaparin than currently recommended.

### Low incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in geriatric emergency department patients on preinjury anticoagulation presenting with blunt head trauma [^113A76oB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Delayed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) after head injury in older patients taking anticoagulants has been reported to be as high as 7.2%. Other studies suggest much lower rates. Its incidence and clinical management are controversial, with some recommending observation and repeat head imaging at 24 h.

Objective

Our study aims to assess the incidence of delayed ICH in geriatric Emergency Department (ED) head trauma patients prescribed preinjury anticoagulants.

Methods

We performed a prospective cohort study conducted at two hospital EDs from August 2019 to July 2020. All patients aged 65 years or older with acute head injury were eligible for enrollment. We conducted telephone follow-up at 14 and 60 days, and a chart review at 90 days. The primary study outcome was incidence of delayed ICH, which was defined as an initial negative head computed tomography scan followed by subsequent ICH believed to be caused by the initial traumatic event. We compared the rates of delayed ICH between patient cohorts based on anticoagulant use.

Results

There were 3425 patients enrolled: 2300 (67.2%) were not on an anticoagulant, 249 (7%) were on preinjury warfarin, 780 (22.7%) were on a direct-acting oral anticoagulant, and 96 (2.8%) were on enoxaparin or heparin. The median age was 82 years (interquartile range 65–107), the majority were female (55.2%), and almost all were Caucasian (84.3%). An acute ICH was identified in 229 of 3425 (6.7%, 95% confidence interval 6–8%) and delayed ICH in 13 (0.4%, 95% confidence interval 0.2–0.6%). There were no differences in rates of delayed ICH between those who had been prescribed anticoagulants vs. those who had not (p = 0.45).

Conclusions

The incidence of delayed ICH is very low in older ED head trauma patients on prescribed pre-injury anticoagulants. Our data have important clinical implications for the management of blunt head trauma among older ED patients on anticoagulants.

### Worsening head bleeds in elderly blunt head trauma patients taking antithrombotics: delayed CT head fails to change management [^117DKZP3]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Most elderly trauma patients suffer blunt head injury and many utilize antithrombotic (AT) medications. The utility of delayed CT-head (D-CTH) in neurologically intact elderly patients using AT who have an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on presentation is unknown. We hypothesized that D-CTH would not alter clinical management and aimed to evaluate the role of D-CTH in this population.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed. Patients ≥ 65 years sustaining blunt head injuries from January 2010 to July 2017 were identified using our level 1 trauma center database. AT-patients presenting with ICH who underwent D-CTH were included. Patients with worsened ICH were compared to those with stable to improved ICH on D-CTH. AT-patients were compared to a cohort of non-AT patients. Fisher's Exact and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized and a power analysis conducted.

Results

137AT and 34 non-AT patients were identified. There was no difference in hemorrhage progression or appearance of new ICH. No patient had a change in management from D-CTH in either cohort. AT-patients were slightly older (p < 0.001), but cohorts were otherwise similar. 50 AT-patients with worsened ICH were compared to 87 with stable ICH. There was no difference in cohort demographics. Hemorrhage progression did not vary with type of AT used but did increase if multiple types of synchronous ICH were present (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our data supports abstaining from routine D-CTH of elderly ICH patients with an intact neurologic examination who are utilizing aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin. Conclusions cannot be drawn regarding new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) given low enrollment. Further multicenter study is required to provide adequate power and detect small levels of management change.

### Incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in older patients after blunt head trauma [^111w7SK5]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines conflict on the management of older adults who have blunt head trauma taking anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications. This is partially due to the limited data comparing patients who are taking these medications with those who are not.

Objective

To investigate the incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in older adults with head trauma, including those taking anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective observational cohort study included patients 55 years and older who had blunt head trauma and were transported via emergency medical services between August 1, 2015, and September 30, 2016. The setting was a multicenter study conducted at 11 hospitals in northern California. Patients were excluded if they had traumatic intracranial hemorrhage on the initial cranial computed tomographic scan, did not have a cranial computed tomographic scan performed at the initial emergency department visit, refused consent for a follow-up telephone call, or did not have reliable means of follow-up.

Main Outcome and Measure

The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage within 14 days of injury.

Results

Among 859 patients enrolled in the study, the median age was 75 years (interquartile range, 64–85 years), and 389 (45.3%) were male. A total of 343 patients (39.9%) were taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication. Three patients (0.3%; 95% CI, 0.1%-1.0%) had a delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Of the 3 patients, 1 of 75 patients (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.0%-7.2%) who were taking warfarin sodium alone and 2 of 516 patients (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.1%-1.4%) who were not taking any anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication had a delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Thirty-nine patients (4.5%; 95% CI, 3.2%-6.2%) were lost to follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

Overall, the incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in older adults who have blunt head trauma is low, including patients taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication. These findings suggest that routine observation and serial cranial computed tomography may not be necessary in these patients.

### Direct oral anticoagulant treatment and mild traumatic brain injury: risk of early and delayed bleeding and the severity of injuries compared with vitamin K antagonists [^116Ae9Ej]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the differences in the risk of developing early, delayed, and comprehensive bleeding after MTBI among patients treated with DOACs as compared with those treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs).

Methods

All MTBI patients taking oral anticoagulants in our emergency department between June 2017 and August 2018 were included. All patients on oral anticoagulants underwent immediate cerebral computed tomography (CT) and a second CT scan after 24 h of clinical observation.

Results

There were 451 patients enrolled: 268 were on VKAs and 183 on DOACs. Of the DOAC-treated patients, 7.7% (14/183) presented overall intracranial bleeding, compared with 14.9% (40/268) of VKA-treated patients (p = 0.026). Early bleeding was present in 5.5% (10/183) of DOAC-treated patients and in 11.6% (31/268) of VKA-treated patients (p = 0.030). Multivariable analysis showed that VKA therapy (odds ratio [OR] 2.327), high-energy impact (OR 11.229), amnesia (OR 2.814), loss of consciousness (OR 5.286), Glasgow Coma Scale score < 15 (OR 4.719), and the presence of lesion above the clavicles (OR 2.742) were associated with significantly higher risk of global ICH. A nomogram was constructed to predict ICH using these six variables. Discrimination of the nomogram revealed good predictive abilities (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.817).

Conclusions

DOAC-treated patients seem to have lower risk of posttraumatic intracranial bleeding compared with VKA-treated patients.

### Predictors of outcome in warfarin-related intracerebral hemorrhage… [^111q3cmX]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Four patients also received recombinant factor VII in addition to fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. Median INR at admission was 3.
2. In 17 patients, INR was not normalized because of early death or family request for restriction of care. In the remainder of patients, the median time to reversal of INR was 7. 3 hours. Fifty patients survived for 30 days after ICH, including 47 who survived longer than 1 year. Four patients had no long-term follow-up. At univariate analysis, initial GCS, initial ICH volume, percentage of ICH expansion, and glucose concentration at admission were significantly associated with long-term outcome. In this analysis of outcome predictors in patients with warfarin-associated ICH, we found that stupor or coma and larger hematoma volume were the main determinants of poor functional outcome.

Detailed radiologic analysis of ICH volume showed that in patients with poor functional outcome, hematoma enlargement was common but often lower than one-third of baseline volume. Early hyperglycemia was more common in patients who died or recovered poorly. Conversely, neither INR nor time to correction of INR correlated with mortality, functional outcome, or enlargement of the ICH. Parenchymal perihematomal edema did not have any correlation with functional outcome. We identified no correlation between mortality and initial INR or time to reversal of INR, contrary to a previous study that concluded that intensity of anticoagulation correlated with the risk of early death. 3 This might be explained by possible bias generated by exclusion of 17 patients who died before INR reversal.

In addition, conventional reversal of INR with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma therapy requires hours, and it is not known whether ultrarapid correction of INR with recombinant factor VII or prothrombin complex concentrate could have a beneficial effect on mortality or morbidity. Warfarin-associated ICH is a growingly and daunting problem for which therapies are limited. The current focus on rapid reversal of anticoagulation therapy may be justified on the basis of previous data; however, time to reversal of INR using conventional hemostatic therapies did not affect outcome in our patients. Further studies are needed to identify modifiable factors that might influence outcome in these patients.

### Delayed intracranial hemorrhage in the anticoagulated patient: a systematic review [^114fn2W8]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A significant population of elderly Americans on warfarin is at risk for immediate and delayed intracranial hemorrhage. This qualitative systematic review ascertains the delayed intracranial hemorrhage risk associated with minor head injury and preinjury warfarin use.

Methods

A systematic review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed in August 2014. Cohort studies evaluating delayed intracranial hemorrhage in patients with minor head injuries on warfarin were eligible for inclusion. The definition of delayed hemorrhage was any intracranial bleeding detected subsequent to initial negative brain imaging result following the head injury. Three authors screened and abstracted the data and evaluated methodological quality. Data abstraction also included clinical characteristics that could identify risk factors for delayed intracranial hemorrhage.

Results

The search retrieved 294 unique articles, of which 5 studies constituted the final review. The studies included data on 1,257 patients. Among higher-quality studies, the incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage ranged from 5.8 to 72 per 1,000 cases of patients on warfarin with minor head injury. Population age was an influential factor in this range of incident rates. International normalized ratio levels had no clear association with individual risk for delayed intracranial hemorrhage.

Conclusion

The incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage is low among patients on warfarin with minor head injury. Trauma centers should consider the characteristics of the population they serve compared with the published studies when determining management strategies for these patients.

Level Of Evidence

### Mild traumatic brain injury in elderly patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JtPnU]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

The aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting on the risk of traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (tICH), the course of tICH, and its treatment and mortality rates in elderly mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). We consulted PubMed and Embase for relevant cohort and case-control studies with a control group. Two authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted outcome data. Estimates were pooled with the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method. We identified 16 articles comprising 3671 elderly mTBI patients using DOACs. Use of DOACs was associated with a reduced risk of tICH compared to the use of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; odds ratio [OR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29–0.65; I² = 22%) and a similar risk compared to the use of antiplatelet therapy (APT; OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.39–2.44; I² = 0%). Reversal agent use and neurosurgical intervention rate were lower in patients using DOACs compared to patients using VKAs (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06–0.16; I² = 0% and OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21–0.67; I² = 0%, respectively). There was no significant difference in neurosurgical intervention rate between patients who used DOACs versus patients who used APT (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.15–2.21; I² = 41%) or no antithrombotic therapy (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.20–2.86; I² = 23%). ICH progression, risk of delayed ICH, and TBI-related in-hospital mortality were comparable among treatment groups. The present study indicates that elderly patients using DOACs have a lower risk of adverse outcome compared to patients using VKAs and a similar risk compared to patients using APT after mTBI.

### Low risk of late intracranial complications in mild traumatic brain injury patients using oral anticoagulation after an initial normal brain computed tomography scan: education instead of hospitalization [^116DYfaj]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common neurological disorder. Whether oral anticoagulation (OAC) use is a risk factor for secondary deterioration in mTBI patients after a normal computed tomography (CT) scan is unclear. Therefore data were retrospectively collected on patients with mTBI who used OAC to determine the incidence of secondary clinical deterioration after an initial normal head CT scan.

Methods

This was a retrospective single-centre patient record study. All patients with an mTBI who presented at the emergency department between January 2007 and October 2011 were selected. Inclusion criteria were mTBI and at least 1 week of OAC use resulting in an international normalized radio > 1.1. CT scans were re-evaluated for this study.

Results

A total of 211 mTBI patients using OAC and with an initial CT scan without abnormalities were included in the analysis. In five patients a secondary deterioration was found. One patient developed a subdural hematoma after 15 h of clinical observation. The other four patients became symptomatic between 2 and 28 days after trauma.

Conclusions

A low risk of secondary deterioration within 24 h in mTBI patients taking OAC with a normal first head CT scan was found. Our study does not support the recommendation of the current guidelines that these patients should be clinically observed for at least 24 h. The fact that in our series the majority of secondary deteriorations occurred between 2 and 28 days after trauma underscores the importance of patient instructions upon discharge from the hospital.

### Choosing the best approach to warfarin reversal after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage [^112V1P83]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients on warfarin with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage often have the warfarin effects pharmacologically reversed. We compared outcomes among patients who received 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or no reversal to assess the real-world impact of PCC on elderly patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of 150 patients on preinjury warfarin. Data were manually abstracted from the electronic medical record of an academic level 1 trauma center for patients admitted between January 2013 and December 2018. Outcomes were ICH progression on follow-up computed tomography scan, mortality, need for surgical intervention, and trends in the use of reversal agents.

Results

Of 150 patients eligible for analysis, 41 received FFP, 60 PCC, and 49 were not reversed. On multivariable analysis, patients not reversed [OR 0.25 95% CI (0.31–0.85)] and women [OR 0.38 95% CI (0.17–0.88)] were less likely to experience progression of their initial bleed on follow-up computed tomography while subdural hemorrhage increased the risk [OR 3.69 95% CI (1.27–10.73)]. There was no difference between groups in terms of mortality or need for surgery. Over time use of reversal with PCC increased while use of FFP and not reversing warfarin declined (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Male gender and using a reversal agent were associated with progression of ICH. Choice of reversal did not impact the need for surgery, hospital length of stay, or mortality. Some ICH patients may not require warfarin reversal and may bias studies, especially retrospective studies of warfarin reversal.

### Clinical outcomes following early versus late pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wafYh]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) presents a serious yet manageable morbidity and mortality risk. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to pool the current literature to evaluate whether or not pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (PTP) administered early after traumatic ICH significantly changes incidence of VTE or hemorrhagic progression when compared to late administration. Systematic searches of seven electronic databases from their inception to July 2018 were conducted following the appropriate guidelines. One thousand four hundred ninety articles were identified for screening. Outcomes of interest were pooled as odd ratios (ORs) and analyzed using a random-effects model. Eleven comparative studies satisfied selection criteria, yielding a total of 5036 cases. Overall, mean age was 47.6 years and 36% patients were female. PTP was administered early (≤ 72 h from admission) in 2106 (42%) patients and late (> 72 h from admission) in 2922 (58%) cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hemorrhagic progression (OR, 0.86; P = 0.450) or all-cause mortality (OR, 0.83; P = 0.347) between the early versus late PTP patient groups. However, incidence of VTE was significantly less in the early PTP patient group (OR, 0.58; P = 0.008). The early administration of PTP after traumatic ICH does not appear to confer a worse prognosis in terms of hemorrhagic progression. However, it seems to confer superior VTE prophylaxis, when compared to late PTP administration. We suggest that early PTP should not be prematurely discounted for patients with ICH in TBI on the assumption of aggravating hemorrhagic progression alone.

### Risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in anticoagulated patients with mild traumatic brain injury: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112eRnJr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed intracranial hemorrhage is a potential complication of head trauma in anticoagulated patients.

Objective

Our aim was to use a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage 24 h after head trauma in patients who have a normal initial brain computed tomography (CT) scan but took vitamin K antagonist before injury.

Methods

EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Library were searched using controlled vocabulary and keywords. Retrospective and prospective observational studies were included. Outcomes included positive CT scan 24 h post-trauma, need for surgical intervention, or death. Pooled risk was estimated with logit proportion in a random effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Seven publications were identified encompassing 1,594 patients that were rescanned after a normal first head scan. For these patients, the pooled estimate of the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage on the second CT scan 24 h later was 0.60% (95% CI 0–1.2%) and the resulting risk of neurosurgical intervention or death was 0.13% (95% CI 0.02–0.45%).

Conclusions

The present study is the first published meta-analysis estimating the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage 24 h after head trauma in patients anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonist and normal initial CT scan. In most situations, a repeat CT scan in the emergency department 24 h later is not necessary if the first CT scan is normal. Special care may be required for patients with serious mechanism of injury, patients showing signs of neurologic deterioration, and patients presenting with excessive anticoagulation or receiving antiplatelet co-medication.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^113KPRrK]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Geriatric head injury imaging — head computed tomography (CT) prioritization and monitoring: The threshold to obtain a head CT in this population is very low, and the guidance states, "Perform a head CT on the patient with any type of head injury, especially if taking anticoagulant medication". Patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents with a normal head CT should be observed "for a minimum of 4–8 hours", and clinicians should "have a low threshold for a follow up head CT to delineate a delayed bleed or the bleeding progression of a known closed head injury".

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^116Txd33]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence and discussion

Underlying cardiac, respiratory, or renal dysfunctions associated with previous drugs administration, can significantly alter the fluid management and product resuscitation goals in a bleeding elderly trauma patient.

Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. The reported annual incidence of any bleeding is 25.8%, major bleeding ranges from 1.3 to 7.2%, while intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is up to 2.5%. In the largest study, after adjusting for covariates, warfarin use was associated with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.32 (1.05–1.65) for trauma-related mortality.

Collins et al. evaluated a cohort of Medicare patients with head trauma and found that pre-injury warfarin increased the odds of intracranial hemorrhage by 40%, and doubled the risk of mortality. These data highlight the importance of obtaining accurate medication histories, so anticoagulated patients could be identified, and reversal strategies considered. Based on the patient's history and results from the primary survey and physical examination, radiographic studies should be performed to identify occult injuries that could also be complicated by the patient's anticoagulation status. Generally, the risk of bleeding increases simultaneously with an increase in the international normalized ratio (INR). Therefore, appropriate laboratory testing should be done to establish the degree of coagulopathy on presentation. In an emergency setting, the strategy for oral anticoagulant reversal depends on the type of drug; the presence, location, and level of bleeding; and the need for surgery.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^112TNRes]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The discrepant results in the above studies may reflect the differences in patient- and region-related factors, perioperative continuation or short (48–72 h) interruption of the APA and the lack of a confounding factor analysis. The possible explanations for the low risk of bleeding in patients receiving clopidogrel found in some studies include individual responsiveness to the agent and interactions with other drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors, administered perioperatively.

The role of pre-injury APA treatment in the genesis of ICH in patients with blunt head trauma is also controversial. A meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies found that APA (mainly clopidogrel) use was associated with an increased risk of ICH in patients with head injury and the association was most relevant in patients with mild TBI, thus supporting the addition of the APA-use criterion to improve the out-of-hospital identification of older adults requiring trauma-centre care. The risk of subdural haematoma is particularly marked for the combined treatment of clopidogrel with a VKA. However, due to the limited literature, the association with traumatic ICH could not be established in patients receiving aspirin monotherapy. Interestingly, aspirin and not clopidogrel use was significantly associated with intracranial bleeding in older patients (> 60 years) admitted after ground level fall in one study. In contrast, a prospective study performed in head-injured older adults transported by Emergency Medicine Services in 11 US hospitals found no difference in the incidence of ICH between those with or without pre-injury anticoagulant or APA use and a longer period of observation for delayed ICH in patients on APA or anticoagulant medication is not supported. Another prospective cohort study showed a low incidence of traumatic ICH after ground level fall and no difference in patients on APA or anticoagulants.

Traumatic brain injury — anticoagulation and antiplatelet management: Carefully assess patients on warfarin or direct- acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and initiate drug- specific reversal therapy for those requiring emergent surgery for life-threatening bleeding; consider restarting anticoagulation no later than 14–90 days after TBI based on thrombosis/bleeding risk, avoid routine platelet transfusion to reverse antiplatelet effects, use clinical judgment for low platelet counts around procedures, and restart antiplatelet agents as early as 4 days after injury based on individualized risk.

Should severity of TBI influence timing and dosage of chemoprophylaxis?

Recommendation

Timing of prophylaxis initiation in TBI should be individualized and based on multiple factors, including injury severity.

Discussion

Severity of TBI is an incompletely understood factor in the timing of VTE prophylaxis, given the heterogeneity of head injury types. In surrogate, the Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) and modified Berne-Norwood criteria provide guidance on classification of TBI and risk of ICH progression. Categorized as BIG 1–3, only patients meeting BIG 3 criteria (> 8 mm ICH) required neurosurgical intervention. Furthermore, the Berne-Norwood criteria suggest that, in the absence of multiple contusions, for isolated subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage and subdural/epidural ≤ 8 mm prophylaxis may safely be initiated at 24 hours postinjury pending stability of head CT. Additional stratification of TBI into moderate-risk and high-risk groups follows with a 72-hour delay in VTE prophylaxis initiation and consideration of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, respectively. While unfractionated heparin (UFH) and the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin are most commonly dosed at 5000 units every 8 hours and 30 mg every 12 hours, respectively, in TBI evaluation with the antifactor Xa assay allows for assessment of LMWH within a targeted range without increased risk of ICH progression.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^115H42BU]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

Little is known about the effects of antiplatelet agents (APAs), mainly aspirin and clopidogrel, on traumatic bleeding. Data from non-elective orthopaedic procedures show both increased peri-operative blood loss in patients taking APAs before surgery or no effect. The increase in blood transfusion in orthopaedic patients on APAs is also controversial. However, the pre-injury use of APAs did not affect morbidity and mortality in retrospective studies in patients with pelvic fractures or general trauma without brain injury, but did have an effect in patients with hip fractures. On the contrary, even mild head trauma (GCS 14 to 15) while on APAs is associated with a high incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and a risk of delayed ICH in this group of patients mandates a longer period of observation. Moreover, observational studies found a five-fold increase in traumatic ICH in patients on APAs. The relationship between outcome and pre-injury APAs in the setting of ICH is conflicting in both the trauma and stroke literature, and a systematic review of the latter has shown that pre-ICH APA users experienced only modestly increased mortality (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.47) and little or no increase in poor clinical functional outcome (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29).

### Risk of delayed intracranial haemorrhage after an initial negative CT in patients on DOACs with mild traumatic brain injury [^116gsyQp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Repeat head CT in patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy (DOACs) with minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI) after an initial CT scan without injury on arrival in the Emergency Department (ED) is a common clinical practice but is not based on clear evidence.

Aim

To assess the incidence of delayed intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in patients taking DOACs after an initial negative CT and the association of clinical and risk factors presented on patient arrival in the ED.

Methods

This retrospective multicentre observational study considered patients taking DOACs undergoing repeat CT after a first CT free of injury for the exclusion of delayed ICH after MTBI. Timing between trauma and first CT in the ED and pre- or post-trauma risk factors were analysed to assess a possible association with the risk of delayed ICH.

Results

A total of 1426 patients taking DOACs were evaluated in the ED for an MTBI. Of these, 68.3% (916/1426) underwent a repeat CT after an initial negative CT and 24 h of observation, with a rate of delayed ICH of 1.5% (14/916). Risk factors associated with the presence of a delayed ICH were post-traumatic loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia and the presence of a risk factor when the patient presented to the ED within 8 h of the trauma. None of the patients with delayed ICH at 24-h repeat CT required neurosurgery or died within 30 days.

Conclusions

Delayed ICH is an uncommon event at the 24-h control CT and does not affect patient outcome. Studying the timing and characteristics of the trauma may indicate patients who may benefit from more in-depth management.

Anticoagulated blunt head trauma — warfarin or clopidogrel users (Nishijima et al., 2012) was a multicenter prospective observational study of ≥ 18 y patients regardless of loss of consciousness assessing delayed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) at 14-day follow-up. In 930 patients with initial normal head CT, delayed ICH occurred 4 of 687 (0.6%, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.5%) for warfarin and 0 of 243 (0%, 95% CI 0 to 1.5%) for clopidogrel; 83% of eligible patients were enrolled, 43 of 1,064 patients were on aspirin, and 1 patient who died in the clopidogrel group was lost to follow-up; delayed hemorrhage was only in warfarin patients and, although 2 of 930 died, none received neurosurgical intervention.

Risk of recurrent ICrH

With the exception of the relatively rare cases of traumatic pseudoaneurysm, the primary recurrent bleeding risk in tICrH beyond the acute period is the same as the primary cause of the index event: falls. Fall risk is a common reason clinicians withhold anticoagulation, but there is little evidence that it should preclude treatment. While approximately 5% of fall cases were readmitted for the same reason within 6 months, anticoagulation treatment was not associated with likelihood of a second fall or hemorrhage related to the fall in a nationally representative readmission registryas well as a Medicare database. However, anticoagulation was associated with disproportionate mortality in those who bled from secondary fall events (21.5% vs 6.9%). Secondary analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial (n = 16 491) of apixaban and warfarin revealed that prior history of falls resulted in elevated risk of major hemorrhage, including ICrH, and death (adjusted HR (aHR) (95% CI) = 1.39 (1.05 to 1.84), 1.87 (1.02 to 3.43), 1.70 (1.36 to 2.14), respectively) in anticoagulated subjects. Fall risk assessed during the ENGAGE-AF-TIMI48 trial of edoxaban and warfarin was associated with major bleeding, life-threatening bleeding and all-cause mortality (aHR (95% CI) = 1.30 (1.04 to 1.64), 1.67 (1.11 to 2.50), 1.45 (1.23 to 1.70), respectively). In another study, however, elevated fall risk was not found to be associated with likelihood of major hemorrhage in a prospective cohort study of 515 patients taking oral anticoagulation. The risk of major hemorrhage after initiation of oral anticoagulation has been estimated numerous ways, but Donzé et al found that all major hemorrhages related to falls comprised just 0.6 of the 7.5 major hemorrhages per 100 person-years of follow-up. A study of 1245 Medicare beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation (AF) and at high risk for falls found a rate of 2.8 ICrHs per 100 person-years, 2.0 of which were traumatic in nature. This was significantly elevated above the rates for patients with AF not at risk of falls, of 1.1 and 0.34 per 100 person-years, respectively.

### Incidence of intracranial bleeding in anticoagulated patients with minor head injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies [^1116DA4D]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines advise performing a computed tomography head scan for all anticoagulated head injured patients, but the risk of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) after a minor head injury is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the incidence of ICH in anticoagulated patients presenting with a minor head injury and a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. We followed Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies guidelines. We included all prospective studies recruiting consecutive anticoagulated emergency patients presenting with a head injury. Anticoagulation included vitamin-K antagonists (warfarin, fluindione), direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran and edoxaban) and low molecular weight heparin. A total of five studies (including 4080 anticoagulated patients with a GCS of 15) were included in the analysis. The majority of patients took vitamin K antagonists (98.3%). There was significant heterogeneity between studies with regards to mechanism of injury and methods. The random effects pooled incidence of ICH was 8.9% (95% confidence interval 5.0–13.8%). In conclusion, around 9% of patients on vitamin K antagonists with a minor head injury develop ICH. There is little data on the risk of traumatic intracranial bleeding in patients who have a GSC 15 post-head injury and are prescribed a direct oral anticoagulant.

Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury with anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy — after an initial negative computed tomography (CT), delayed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in neurologically intact adults is uncommon and neurosurgical intervention is rare; representative incidences include warfarin: N = 687 with delayed ICH 4 (0), 0.6% (0.2% to1.5%); NOACs: N = 916 with 14 (0), 1.5% (0.9% to 2.6%); and aspirin: N = 100 with 4 (1), 4% (1.6% to 9.8%). Anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists [VKA] and non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [NOACs]), and to some extent antiplatelet agents, are associated with a higher risk of ICH after mild head trauma. Initial neuroimaging should be sufficient to exclude any clinically significant injuries in patients who appear otherwise neurologically intact at baseline, and based on the lack of increased delayed ICH, patients who are neurologically intact can be safely discharged without the need for repeat imaging or observation admission specifically for a head injury. Because of the potential for up to approximately 5% of these patients to develop delayed ICH, clear discharge instructions with return precautions are warranted, and with the low incidence of delayed ICH there is not a strong argument for withholding these medications if the patients are not suspected to be supratherapeutic. Patients at higher concern — especially elderly individuals on antiplatelet agents as opposed to anticoagulants and with high risk features (loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, or Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] < 15) — may require some sort of observation if the choice is made to avoid repeat CT scanning, and these patients should have someone who can assist them with following discharge care instructions and/or helping provide a safe environment during their recovery.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^115x2eeN]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulant therapy — initial and follow-up head CT considerations — The use of anticoagulant therapy further complicates recommendations for brain imaging. For this group of patients, the incidence of intracranial bleeding is likely higher, and a more liberal use of early initial brain CT scanning is warranted. While many patients will have no injury, it is impossible to differentiate between patients with and without an intracranial injury without head CT imaging. The recommendations for follow up imaging of patients on anticoagulant therapy are even less evidence based, and no published prospective, randomized controlled trials address this issue. Several factors, including the presence or absence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on the initial CT, the type of pre-injury anticoagulant/antiplatelet agent used, and degree of drug-induced coagulopathy, are important elements to consider when making the decision to perform repeat head CT in this cohort of patients.

### Efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112imwu1]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Subgroup analyses should be cautiously interpreted, especially regarding all-cause stroke or systemic embolism where the main results showed no difference between NOACs and warfarin. The reduction in major bleeding events and mortality by NOACs compared with warfarin seemed more pronounced in younger patients at lower stroke risk. Importantly, neither the elderly, patients at higher stroke risk, nor any other subgroup appeared to benefit more from warfarin than from NOACs for any of those safety outcomes.

A substantially higher risk for intracranial haemorrhage and haemorrhagic strokes with warfarin than NOAC has consistently been shown. The present finding of a pronounced reduction in subdural haematomas and traumatic intracranial bleeding events is intriguing. A potential explanation is the different effects on coagulation system. At sites of cerebral vascular injury, exposed tissue factor induces thrombin generation that can overcome the inhibitory effects of NOACs whereas the markedly reduced levels of FVIIa by warfarin will impair this response and increase the likelihood of a severe bleeding even by a modest trauma to the head, although this hypothesis remains to be proven and further studies exploring traumatic intracranial bleedings in patients with oral anticoagulants are warranted.

Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Anticoagulated or antiplatelet-treated adults with minor TBI — Class II observational study outcomes: In a multicenter retrospective study of adults 18 years and older with blunt traumatic injury, 1,064 patients were enrolled; 932 (87.6%) met minor TBI criteria with a GCS score of 15 and 752 (70.7%) had head trauma above the clavicles. Of 1,064 patients, 1,000 (94%) received head CT, including 43 with concomitant aspirin. All 930 patients with normal initial CT scans were followed for 14 days. Among 687 patients on warfarin, 4 (0.6% [95% CI 0.2% to 1.5%]) had delayed ICHs (none requiring neurosurgical intervention), but 2 cases resulted in death. None of the 243 patients on clopidogrel had delayed ICH, with one death due to an unknown cause. The authors concluded that delayed ICH after a negative initial head CT scan is very rare in patients on warfarin or clopidogrel and that these patients do not warrant admission for observation or immediate reversal of anticoagulation.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^111KCgWp]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Restarting antiplatelet agents after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) should be individualized. Consider the reason for antiplatelet therapy when determining if and when to restart antiplatelet therapy in patients after traumatic ICH. Studies support restarting antiplatelet therapy as early as 4 days postinjury, because most posttraumatic hemorrhages occur within 3 days. Risks for acute and delayed ICH after restarting antiplatelet agents must be weighed against the morbidity of thrombotic complications that can have significant clinical consequences, and individual assessment of risk versus benefit must be made for restarting antiplatelet therapy.

### Repeat computed tomography head scan is not indicated in trauma patients taking novel anticoagulation: a multicenter study [^111P8kFC]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of trauma patients on prehospital novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is increasing. After an initial negative computed tomography of the head (CTH), practice patterns are variable for obtaining repeat CTH to evaluate for delayed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH-d). However, the risks and outcomes of ICH-d for patients on NOACs are unclear. We hypothesized that, for these patients, the incidence of ICH-d is low, similar to that of warfarin, and when it occurs, it does not result in clinically significant worse outcomes.

Methods

Five level 1 trauma centers in Northern California participated in a retrospective review of anticoagulated trauma patients. Patients were included if their initial CTH was negative. Primary outcomes were incidence of ICH-d, neurosurgical intervention, and death. Patient factors associated with the outcome of ICH-d were determined by multivariable regression.

Results

From 2016 to 2018, 777 patients met the inclusion criteria (NOAC, n = 346; warfarin, n = 431), 54% of whom received a repeat CTH. Delayed intracranial hemorrhage incidence was 2.3% in the NOAC group and 4% in the warfarin group (p = 0.31). No NOAC patient with ICH-d required neurosurgical intervention or died because of their head injury. Two warfarin patients received neurosurgical intervention, and three died from their head injury. Head Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 3 was associated with increased odds of developing ICH-d (adjusted odds ratio, 32.70; p < 0.01).

Conclusion

The incidence of ICH-d in patients taking NOAC is low. In this study, patients on NOACs who developed ICH-d after an initial negative CTH did not need neurosurgical intervention or die from their head injury. Repeat CTH in this patient population does not appear necessary.

### Incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in older patients after blunt head trauma… [^113vLdBL]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question What is the incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in patients 55 years and older with blunt head trauma. Findings In this multicenter study of 859 adults 55 years and older with blunt head trauma, 3 patients had a delayed intracranial hemorrhage. Of the 3 patients, 1 of 75 was taking warfarin sodium before injury, and 2 of 516 were not taking any anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication. Of the 3 patients, 1 of 75 patients who were taking warfarin sodium alone and 2 of 516 patients who were not taking any anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication had a delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Thirty-nine patients were lost to follow-up. Three of the 859 patients had a delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Of the 3 patients, 1 of 75 patients who were taking warfarin alone and 2 of 516 patients who were not taking any anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications had a delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. This includes 8 patients taking warfarin alone, 7 patients taking DOAC medications alone, 11 patients taking aspirin alone (7 had died, and 4 were lost to follow. Unlike prior studies11–13 that evaluated the incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, this study included patients taking a broad range of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications, as well as patients not taking any of these medications. We found that less than 1% of older adults with head injuries with an initial cranial CT scan with normal results have a delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage within 14 days of the index ED visit.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^113uYaYc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Head trauma in the geriatric patient carries a greater risk of intracranial injury irrespective of ISS, together with an increased mortality and morbidity (two-fold and four-fold, respectively) compared to the younger population. This is due to the increased risk of hemorrhage in all the intracranial compartments, but particularly the subdural compartment. Even in cases of serious intracranial injury, geriatric patients are less likely to manifest neurologic signs of raised intracranial pressure because of brain atrophy. It is estimated that around 3% of geriatric trauma patients have intracranial injury without clinical signs, history of loss of consciousness, focal neurology, or change in GCS. Therefore, consensus documents currently recommend performing head CT scan in all geriatric patients with head injury, included those who report minor trauma. There is greater probability that geriatric patients with head trauma will return to independent living if early detection and treatment of traumatic injuries did occur and if they are treated promptly. Patients who are under anticoagulants, and those with hematologic conditions or liver disease are at increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage after trauma. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication also cause coagulopathy. Prompt head CT of geriatric trauma patients who take anticoagulation medication should be carried out, even in those with minor head trauma. If CT images are positive for intracranial injury, coagulopathy should be reversed as soon as possible because the risk from head injury generally outweighs the benefit of anticoagulation therapy. If CT images are negative for hemorrhage the patient's coagulopathy does not require reversal, but the patient should be monitored closely within a protocol of 24-h of observation followed by repeat CT to identify occurrences of delayed bleeding. The threshold for performing follow-up CT should be low in these patients if there is any evidence of clinical deterioration. Protocols suggest that all patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage who are treated conservatively undergo follow-up CT at 4–6 h, or earlier if there is clinical deterioration.

### Management of minor head injury in patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy: a prospective study of a 24-hour observation protocol [^112MBp9s]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Patients receiving warfarin who experience minor head injury are at risk of intracranial hemorrhage, and optimal management after a single head computed tomography (CT) scan is unclear. We evaluate a protocol of 24-hour observation followed by a second head CT scan.

Methods

In this prospective case series, we enrolled consecutive patients receiving warfarin and showing no intracranial lesions on a first CT scan after minor head injury treated at a Level II trauma center. We implemented a structured clinical pathway, including 24-hour observation and a CT scan performed before discharge. We then evaluated the frequency of death, admission, neurosurgery, and delayed intracranial hemorrhage.

Results

We enrolled and observed 97 consecutive patients. Ten refused the second CT scan and were well during 30-day follow-up. Repeated CT scanning in the remaining 87 patients revealed a new hemorrhage lesion in 5 (6%), with 3 subsequently hospitalized and 1 receiving craniotomy. Two patients discharged after completing the study protocol with 2 negative CT scan results were admitted 2 and 8 days later with symptomatic subdural hematomas; neither received surgery. Two of the 5 patients with delayed bleeding at 24 hours had an initial international normalized ratio greater than 3.0, as did both patients with delayed bleeding beyond 24 hours. The relative risk of delayed hemorrhage with an initial international normalized ratio greater than 3.0 was 14 (95% confidence interval 4 to 49).

Conclusion

For patients receiving warfarin who experience minor head injury and have a negative initial head CT scan result, a protocol of 24-hour observation followed by a second CT scan will identify most occurrences of delayed bleeding. An initial international normalized ratio greater than 3 suggests higher risk.

### Can anticoagulated patients be discharged home safely from the emergency department after minor head injury? [^111vy8SZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulated patients have increased risk for bleeding, and serious outcomes could occur after head injury. Controversy exists regarding the utility of head computed tomography (CT) in allowing safe discharge dispositions for anticoagulated patients suffering minor head injury.

Clinical Question

What is the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in anticoagulated patients with minor head injury and a normal initial head CT scan?

Evidence Review

Four observational studies were reviewed that investigated the outcomes of anticoagulated patients who presented after minor head injury.

Results

Overall incidence of death or neurosurgical intervention ranged from 0 to 1.1% among the patients investigated. The studies did not clarify which patients were at highest risk.

Conclusion

The literature does not support mandatory admission for all anticoagulated patients after minor head injury, but further studies are needed to identify the higher-risk patients for delayed bleeding to determine appropriate management.

### Restart TICrH: an adaptive randomized trial of time intervals to restart direct oral anticoagulants after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage [^114AwjXS]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis and death in patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) but also increase bleeding risk. The benefit/risk ratio favors anticoagulation in most of these patients. However, some will have a bleeding complication, such as the common trip-and-fall brain injury in elderly patients that results in traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Clinicians must then make the difficult decision about when to restart the anticoagulant. Restarting too early risks making the bleeding worse. Restarting too late risks thrombotic events such as ischemic stroke and VTE, the indications for anticoagulation in the first place. There are more data on restarting patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, which is very different than traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage increases the risk of rebleeding because intrinsic vascular changes are widespread and irreversible. In contrast, traumatic cases are caused by a blow to the head, usually an isolated event portending less future risk. Clinicians generally agree that anticoagulation should be restarted but disagree about when. This uncertainty leads to long restart delays causing a large, potentially preventable burden of strokes and VTE, which has been unaddressed because of the absence of high quality evidence. Restart Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage (the "r" distinguished intracranial from intracerebral) (TICrH) is a prospective randomized open label blinded end-point response-adaptive clinical trial that will evaluate the impact of delays to restarting direct oral anticoagulation (1, 2, or 4 weeks) on the composite of thrombotic events and bleeding in patients presenting after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Traumatic brain injury imaging — delayed ICH after a negative initial head CT in patients on pre-injury oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy has been reported in less than 1.5 to 2 percent, with none requiring intervention; patients on warfarin with supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) levels (greater than 3) have increased risk, and a meta-analysis of 1,594 warfarin patients with a normal initial head CT estimated a 0.6 percent pooled incidence of delayed ICH after 24 hours with a 0.3 percent risk of neurosurgical intervention or death; neurosurgical intervention is rare, and no data exist to support discharging these patients from the ED based on a single head CT scan.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent venous thromboembolism in traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a decision analysis [^1134J9De]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is estimated that more than 1.5 million people in the United States sustain traumatic head injury each year. Radiologic evidence of intracranial hemorrhage at the time of presentation is present in up to 45% of cases and is associated with a markedly poorer prognosis. Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage encompasses cerebral contusion, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hematoma and intracerebral hemorrhage. These are characterized by a relatively high risk of bleeding progression, especially within the first 24 hours.

Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage is also associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications. This risk is related to the immobility of head-injured patients arising from the underlying neurologic lesion itself, concomitant injuries following trauma, or the use of sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents. The reported incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ranges between 18 and 58% in the absence of anticoagulant prophylaxis. DVT is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including risk of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE).

Anticoagulant prophylaxis to prevent DVT is recommended for trauma patients without intracranial or other serious hemorrhage. This therapy is also effective in post-operative neurosurgical patients undergoing brain tumour excision. Only one small quasi-randomized clinical trial has studied anticoagulant prophylaxis versus pneumatic compression devices in patients with intracranial hemorrhage following trauma. This trial found no benefit or harm associated with use of anticoagulant prophylaxis, but only had sufficient sample size to detect very large differences in rates of venous thromboembolism or intracranial hemorrhagic progression. One observational study reported rates of hemorrhagic progression in 150 patients with intracranial hemorrhage that were treated with low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis 24 hours after the initial head injury. One quarter already had radiological evidence of intracranial hemorrhagic progression at the time anticoagulant prophylaxis was started, but only six patients (4%) subsequently developed progression in the 24 hours following initiation of anticoagulation prophylaxis. The study lacked a control group limiting inferences regarding the safety and efficacy of this therapy.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^114EPit2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

US trauma centers care for > 18 000 anticoagulated traumatic intracranial hemorrhages (tICrHs) per year, although this likely understates the disease scope as many tICrH cases are cared for in non-trauma centers. Failure to restart anticoagulation in tICrH survivors contributes to an enormous thromboembolic burden in strokes, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and other events. The risk–benefit in the naïve state usually favors anticoagulation by an order of magnitude, but this relationship shifts once ICrH has occurred, when clinicians must cease or reverse anticoagulation to stabilize the patient. At some time point, most patients with tICrH return to a state which again favors anticoagulation. A survey of neurosurgeons found nearly half encounter the tICrH restart question once a week or more. There is already broad consensus that most patients with tICrH should be restarted. The unanswered question is when. In the absence of randomized trials and a definitive time target, restart practice in tICrH is highly variable — from 3 days to several months to never. Cumulative thromboembolic risk rises with time and is a combination of baseline risk, the bleeding episode itself, any reversal agents used and immobility afterwards. Rebleeding risk is high early when clots are forming and stabilizing and falls with increasing time (see figure 1), eventually to a baseline, which may be informed/adjusted by the type of index bleeding episode for any additional rebleeding risk. Importantly, ICrH is at least two diseases with different natural histories. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), such as lobar ICH with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, may heighten the patient's risk for recurrent bleeding and alter the baseline risk–benefit for anticoagulation. In contradistinction, after tICrH, the index hemorrhage is less likely to affect the patient's baseline bleeding risk. Several trials are in planning or actively enrolling to address anticoagulation restart and restart timing questions. Numerous retrospective cohorts have found benefit with minimal increased risk of recurrent hemorrhage in patients with restarted tICrH. This narrative review summarizes the retrospective evidence for restart and timing of restart of oral anticoagulants after tICrH, the guidelines and the prospective trials on this topic.

### Incidence of intracranial bleeding in mild traumatic brain injury patients taking oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116H2VsX]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. Most TBI cases occur in older people, because they are at a higher risk of accidental falling. As the population ages, the use of anticoagulants is increasing. Some serious complications of TBI, such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), may occur even in mild cases. According to the current guidelines regarding managing mild TBI patients, a CT head scan is recommended for all patients receiving anticoagulation. We aim to assess the incidence of ICH in patients with mild TBI taking oral anticoagulants.

Methods

Our systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024503086). Twenty-eight studies evaluating patients with a mild TBI from ten countries with a total sample size of 11,172, 5671 on DOACs, and 5501 on VKAs were included in our meta-analysis.

Results

The random-effects overall incidence of ICH among oral anticoagulated patients with mild TBI was calculated to be 9.4% [95% CI 7.2–12.1%, I² = 89%]. The rates of immediate ICH for patients taking DOACs and VKAs were 6.4% and 10.5%, respectively. The overall rate of immediate ICH in anticoagulated mild TBI patients was 8.5% [95% CI 6.6–10.9%], with a high heterogeneity between studies (I² = 88%). Furthermore, the rates of delayed ICH in patients with mild TBI taking DOACs and VKAs were 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively. The overall incidence of delayed ICH among oral anticoagulated mild TBI patients was 1.7% [95% CI 1–2.8%, I² = 79%]. The overall rate of ICH among mild TBI patients taking DOAC was calculated to be 7.3% [95% CI 5.2–10.3%], with significant heterogeneity between studies (I² = 79%). However, the overall ICH rate is higher in patients who take only VKAs 11.3% [95% CI 8.6–14.7%, I² = 83%]. Patients on DOACs were at lower risk of ICH after mild TBI compared to patients on VKAs (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.48–0.86, p < 0.01, I² = 28%).

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis confirms the need for performing brain CT scan in patients with mild TBI patients who receive oral anticoagulants before injury. Due to limited data, further multi-center, prospective studies are warranted to confirm the true incidence of traumatic ICH in patients on anticoagulants.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach in adult patients with traumatic brain injury receiving oral anticoagulant therapy: an Austrian interdisciplinary consensus statement [^117RV7Hf]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical question: Should therapeutic anticoagulation be resumed after hemorrhagic TBI? If yes, what is the optimal timing?

There is insufficient evidence to support or discourage the resumption of therapeutic antithrombotic treatment following TBI. Expertise from a multidisciplinary team with experience of clinical practice should be sought to guide decision-making on a case-by-case basis.

After hemostasis is achieved and traumatic ICH has stopped, decisions on resuming anticoagulation therapy can be challenging because of the potential to increase the risk of hemorrhagic progression in the acute phase and the risk of bleeding in any future TBI. There is a paucity of evidence regarding the optimal timing for resuming oral anticoagulation after TBI. This uncertainty is reflected by the results of a survey of practice patterns in patients with central nervous system hemorrhage and a history of atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke. The most common times for restarting anticoagulation after the index hemorrhage were 1 month (43.5%) followed by 1 week (33.7%), respectively. Only 13.3% of respondents indicated they would prefer an earlier restart time (3 days), and 8% indicated they would not restart anticoagulation. Interestingly, 47.7% of respondents indicated that they face dilemmas at least once per week concerning anticoagulation restart time and intensity, and 59.4% stated that they relied predominantly on intuition or past experience.

In a retrospective study, Albrecht et al. compared the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events in patients who did or did not restart warfarin therapy during the 12-month period following hospitalization for TBI. Resumption of warfarin treatment was associated with decreased risks of thrombotic events (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.88) and hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.96). Although there was also an increased risk of hemorrhagic events (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.29–1.78), the authors concluded that recommencing anticoagulation provided an overall net benefit for most patients. A more recent retrospective study showed that there is no additional risk of neurological deterioration related to the administration of anticoagulation within 60 days after injury. In this study, intravenous heparin was the most commonly used agent (70.8%) for therapeutic anticoagulation.

Restart studies specific to tICrH

There are analyses and meta-analyses using billing data and prescription databases to establish the risk–benefit of restarting anticoagulation after ICrH in general and tICrH specifically. A recent large retrospective analysis underscores the potential benefit. Nielsen et al gathered a sample of 1325 patients with sICrH and 1090 patients with tICrH. Resuming anticoagulation in patients with sICrH was associated with a 51% decrease in stroke or systemic embolism but a 31% increase in recurrent ICrH (neither statistically significant). Resuming anticoagulation in patients with tICrH was associated with a 60% reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (not statistically significant) and a 55% reduction in recurrent ICrH, which was statistically significant (aHR 0.45; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.76). Both groups saw significant reductions in all-cause mortality, 49% and 55% in sICrH and tICrH, respectively (sICrH aHR 0.51; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71) and (tICrH aHR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.52). A reduction in recurrent ICrH with anticoagulation may seem non-sensical. It probably represents selection bias of restarting lower bleeding risk patients, but it certainly is more reassuring than a null or increased bleeding risk finding in this biased setting. Albrecht et al used Medicare claims data to identify anticoagulated patients with traumatic brain injury and restarting outcomes. They found a decreased risk of thrombotic events (relative risk (RR) 0.77 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.88)), an increased risk of hemorrhagic events (RR 1.51 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.78)) and a decreased risk of combined hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.96)). Prescription data were unable to speak to timing with any precision. Park et al retrospectively analyzed 428 patients with AF with a history of ICrH, including SDH and epidural hemorrhage (EDH), although they did not distinguish whether intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages were spontaneous, traumatic or mixed. The analysis did allow some inference on timing for a bleeding and thrombosis composite outcome (see figure 5), although with the usual caveats about retrospective design and selection bias and that it is a combination of patients with sICH and tICrH. Another retrospective study of antithrombotic treatment restart in 85 patients with traumatic brain injury showed that the lowest rate of secondary clinical events occurred in those started between 7 and 14 days, with the highest rate of events in those cases that never resumed treatment.

Clinical guidelines

Current trauma guidelines do not address the use of anticoagulant treatment after ICrH. The 2014 update to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for stroke prevention in stroke and temporary ischemic attack includes a special section on the use of antithrombotic therapy after ICrH. These guidelines clearly demonstrate shortcomings of the available evidence as they endorse individualized assessment of the restart decision. To this end, they advise consideration of the risks of subsequent thromboembolism, recurrent ICrH and overall 'patient status'. It subsequently suggests that cases with higher risk of recurrent ICH relative to cerebral infarction may consider antiplatelet therapy instead of anticoagulation. With regard to timing of anticoagulation reinitiation, 'the optimal timing is uncertain. For most patients, however, it might be reasonable to wait ≥ 1 week'. None of the evidence provided rises above class IIb, level B in strength.

The European Stroke Organization also released guidelines in 2014 for sICH, which recognize a lack of trial evidence on this subject. The guidelines state that a firm recommendation about whether or when to resume antithrombotic medication after ICH cannot be made, and rate the evidence as 'very low' quality. The timing suggestions reviewed by that committee range from 14 days up to 30 weeks.

An Austrian expert-consensus panel focused exclusively on traumatic brain injury found that there was 'insufficient evidence to support or discourage the resumption' of oral anticoagulation following tICrH and that clinical decisions should be made on a 'case-by-case basis'. In spite of this, the practice of restarting anticoagulation in tICrH is far more common than with spontaneous cases as the decision of whether to resume treatment appears already to have been answered in most patients with tICrH and transformed into clinical practice.

### The effect of direct oral anti-coagulants on delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage after mild traumatic brain injury: a systematic review [^1167CmWX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of anticoagulant medications leads to a higher risk of developing traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICH) after a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The management of anticoagulated patients can be difficult to determine when the initial head computed tomography is negative for tICH. There has been limited research on the risk of delayed tICH in patients taking direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications.

Objective

Our aim was to determine the risk of delayed tICH for patients anticoagulated with DOACs after mTBI.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and searched several medical databases to examine the risk of delayed tICH in patients on DOACs.

Results

There were 1252 nonduplicate studies that were identified through an initial database search, 15 of which met our inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in our analysis after full-text review. A total of 1375 subjects were combined among the 15 studies, with 20 instances of delayed tICH after mTBI. Nineteen of the 20 patients with a delayed tICH were discharged without any neurosurgical intervention, and 1 patient on apixaban died due to a delayed tICH.

Conclusions

This systematic review confirms that delayed tICH after mTBI in patients on DOACs is uncommon. However, large, multicenter, prospective studies are needed to confirm the true incidence of clinically significant delayed tICH after DOAC use. Due to the limited data, we recommend using shared decision-making for patients who are candidates for discharge.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^116DVPBF]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The evidence for this review was obtained through searches of PubMed between January 1, 2010 and January 1, 2020, supplemented with a review using Google Scholar (Alphabet). The systematic search excluded evidence from prior to 2010 because this evidence would focus almost exclusively on treatment and reversal with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment. The searches were conducted using the structured search terms: traumatic AND (intracranial OR intracerebral) AND hemorrhage OR "traumatic brain injury" AND anticoagulation within all available searchable fields.

Titles and abstracts were reviewed for inclusion in the review based on relevance to the central research questions. Included articles addressed anticoagulation-associated ICrH presentations and treated the question of treatment reinitiation within the results reported in the abstract. The review excluded search results that did not address the principle questions in this review, addressed conditions other than ICrH without stratified analysis of this condition, did not consider anticoagulation or exclusively considered antiplatelet treatments or did not evaluate treatment reinitiation (either decision or timing). The review excluded case studies, series, and qualitative research studies as well.

In addition, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for clinical guidelines relevant to the clinical topic. This search was conducted using the structured search terms: "guidelines"[Title] AND ("intracranial hemorrhage" OR "intracerebral hemorrhage" OR "traumatic brain injury"). Guidelines obtained were reviewed to confirm that they represented national or international experts and that the committees were represented by appropriate professional organizations. Trials were identified at international meetings and through personal contacts and confirmed as registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.

### The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have worse outcomes compared with warfarin in patients with intracranial hemorrhage after TBI [^1162eRFE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) use is increasing in trauma patients. The reversal of these agents after hemorrhage is still evolving. The aim of our study was to evaluate outcomes after traumatic brain injury in patients on NOACs.

Methods

3-year (2014–2016) analysis of our prospectively maintained traumatic brain injury (TBI) database. We included all TBI patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on anticoagulants. Patients were stratified into two groups, those on NOACs and on warfarin, and were matched in a 1:2 ratio using propensity score matching for demographics, injury and vital parameters, type, and size of ICH. Outcome measures were progression of ICH, mortality, skilled nursing facility (SNF) disposition, and hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS).

Results

We analyzed 1,459 TBI patients, of which 210 patients were matched (NAOCs, 70; warfarin, 140). Matched groups were similar in age (p = 0.21), mechanism of injury (p = 0.61), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (p = 0.54), Injury Severity Score (p = 0.62), and type and size of ICH (p = 0.09). Patients on preinjury NOACs had higher rate of progression (p = 0.03), neurosurgical intervention (p = 0.04), mortality (p = 0.04), and longer ICU LOS (p = 0.04) compared with patients on warfarin. However, there was no difference in hospital LOS (p = 0.22) and SNF disposition (p = 0.14). On sub-analysis of severe TBI patients (GCS ≤ 8), rate of progression (p = 0.59), neurosurgical intervention (p = 0.62), or mortality (p = 0.81) was similar in both groups.

Conclusions

The use of NOACs generally carries a high risk of bleeding and can be detrimental in head injuries with ICH. NOAC use is associated with increased risk of progression of ICH, neurosurgical intervention, and mortality after a mild and moderate TBI. Primary care physicians and cardiologists need to reconsider the data on the need for anticoagulation and the type of agent used and weigh it against the risk of bleeding. In addition, development of reversal agents for the NOACs and implementation of a strict protocol for the reversal of these agents may lead to improved outcomes.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^116yo17Y]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The role of pre-injury APA in the genesis of ICH in patients with blunt head trauma is controversial as well. One observational study found a fivefold increase in traumatic ICH in patients on APA. Even mild head trauma (GCS 14–15) while on APA was associated with a high incidence of ICH, mandating a longer period of observation for delayed ICH in this group of patients. Others failed to demonstrate the association, however, pre-injury use of clopidogrel was significantly associated with ICH following minor trauma (OR 16.7; 95% CI 1.71 to 162.7).

The relationship between outcome and pre-injury APA in the setting of ICH is conflicting in both the trauma and stroke literature. In the setting of non-trauma-related ICH, a recent retrospective cohort analysis indicated that pre-injury APA administration was an independent risk factor for death within 7 days (OR 5.12; P = 0.006) and within 90 days (HR 1.87; P = 0.006), but a systematic review, which did not include the latter study, showed that pre-ICH APA users experienced only modestly increased mortality (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.47) and little or no increase in poor clinical functional outcome (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29). In patients with blunt head trauma, a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies showed only a slight and non-significant increased risk of death in patients who were taking pre-injury APA. However, the effect of pre-injury APA on traumatic ICH is still controversial as more recent studies found both an association of worsening of the lesion and need for neurosurgical intervention or no influence on survival and need for neurosurgical intervention.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^115N48Fg]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Warfarin reversal and bridging after restart — high-risk warfarin patients receiving high doses of vitamin K for reversal (> 2.5 mg) appear to have similar time and magnitude of INR reduction, but the vitamin K will likely delay warfarin's therapeutic effect for several weeks after restart; in such cases, anticoagulation using LMWH or unfractionated heparin is needed until the effects of the vitamin K have worn off.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients with intracerebral hemorrhage [^114tHvFL]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients presented with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of stroke, and prophylactic treatment with oral anticoagulants (OAC) is central to the management of this common arrhythmia. The increase in AF prevalence and change in guideline recommendations have increased the proportion of patients with AF at risk of bleeding related to OAC treatment. The most feared bleeding complication related to OAC is intracranial bleeding (including intracerebral hemorrhage), which is associated with a poor prognosis of functionality and a 30-day mortality up to 40%. OAC treatment will usually be discontinued immediately in patients with OAC-related intracranial bleeding. If OAC is to be reintroduced in these clinically complicated patients with AF, the risk of ischemic stroke should be balanced against the risk of recurrent intracranial bleeding.

Previous observational studies have indicated a clinical benefit of resuming OAC treatment in patients with AF sustaining an intracerebral hemorrhage or a trauma-induced intracranial bleeding. – Common for these investigations was that the antithrombotic treatment options included vitamin K antagonists or antiplatelet therapy, and all showed lower risk of ischemic stroke if warfarin treatment was resumed.

The landmark non–vitamin K antagonist OAC (NOAC) trials showed a clear benefit over warfarin in terms of lower risk for intracerebral hemorrhage. Nevertheless, a universal exclusion criteria for all 4 trials were patients with prior intracranial hemorrhage (including both trauma-induced bleeding events and intracerebral hemorrhages). – Thus, no evidence exists for whether the efficacy and safety for NOAC versus warfarin are maintained in patients with AF sustaining an intracerebral hemorrhage. To guide clinical practice, we investigated the comparative effectiveness and safety of NOACs versus warfarin in patients with AF sustaining an intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent venous thromboembolism in traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a decision analysis [^115oNwtW]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Patients with traumatic brain injury associated with intracranial hemorrhage are at high risk for developing venous thromboembolism

- Anticoagulation prophylaxis is proven to decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism in other patient groups, but may increase the risk of progression of intracranial hemorrhage

- The decision to provide anticoagulation prophylaxis to these patients therefore represents a trade-off that can be examined using decision analysis techniques

- Our decision analysis model showed no clear advantage to providing or withholding anticoagulant prophylaxis for thromboembolic prophylaxis at 24 hours after traumatic brain injury associated with intracranial hemorrhage

- Randomized controlled trials of this study question are justifiable and needed to guide clinicians

### Bleeding complications with warfarin use… [^113cRcn3]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

The anticoagulant warfarin sodium is approved for the prevention and/or treatment of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation and/or cardiac valve replacement and to reduce the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and thromboembolic events after myocardial infarction. A review article published in December 20025 reported that the incidence of major bleeding in patients prescribed warfarin ranged from 0% to 16%, and the incidence of fatal bleeding was 0% to 2. 9%. Variations in the frequency of bleeding in studies depend on many factors including, for example, definitions of bleeding and major bleeding, patient mixes with various indications and risks of bleeding, targeted international normalized ratios and treatment protocols, treatment settings, and lengths of follow-up.

However, the frequency of major bleeding with warfarin use, which is estimated to be as high as 10% to 16%, 4, 5 contrasts with much lower frequencies for known serious adverse events of most drugs. In a 1993 review of randomized trials of patients with any of 4 indications, bleeding occurred in 14% of 3931 warfarin-treated patients compared with 3% of 3583 patients not. The boxed warning reminds physicians prescribing warfarin about the risk factors for bleeding, 4, 27–33 including high intensity of anticoagulation, age 65 years or older, highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal tract bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, serious heart disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal insufficiency, concomitant drugs, and long duration of warfarin therapy.

It suggests that regular monitoring of INR be performed on all treated patients and that those at high risk may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shorter duration of therapy. It also suggests that physicians take particular care to instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report immediately to physicians signs and symptoms of bleeding. Educational brochures designed for patients prescribed warfarin such as the one designed by the Cleveland Clinic34 and the Medication Guide, 35 which is required to be handed out with each prescription, should help reinforce this message.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^111Kct2N]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Based on the Scandinavian guidelines, admission is recommended for all patients receiving anticoagulation. It is not our current practice to admit patients on anticoagulation who are neurologically intact with normal CT imaging. In a prospective study of 768 patients with a head injury who were on warfarin, four patients (0.6%) had delayed intracranial hemorrhage (days 1 to 7), resulting in two deaths. If these patients were observed for 24 hours, only one of the delayed hemorrhages would have occurred during admission. A retrospective review found a similar rate of delayed hemorrhage in patients on warfarin of 1%, none of which were clinically significant. Given this information, it is likely reasonable to discharge a reliable patient on anticoagulation after a normal CT scan.

### An analysis of predictive markers for intracranial haemorrhage in warfarinised head injury patients [^115KekvC]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Minor head injury in older patients on warfarin may present in a variety of ways that often fall outside the remit of conventional guidelines. The aim of this study was to determine the relative risks for intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in patients with subtherapeutic, therapeutic and supratherapeutic INR levels, in addition to the relative risks for the common symptoms at presentation.

Methods

The notes were retrospectively reviewed of all patients who had a CT scan requested by the emergency department over a 2-year period (January 2008 to December 2009) and from these warfarinised head injuries were identified.

Results

82 warfarinised head injury patients were identified from 3338 requested CT scans. 12 of these patients (15%) had evidence of ICH on the CT. 72 patients had their INR checked (88%) and the RR of ICH for the INR subgroups were calculated: INR < 2 (RR 1.89; 95% CI 0.65 to 5.55); INR 2–3 (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.27 to 2.64); and INR > 3 (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.29). The greatest proportion of those with ICH (42%) had a subtherapeutic INR. 2 out of the 12 patients (17%) were found to have intracranial bleeding despite not meeting the criteria for a CT scan according to the NICE guidelines.

Conclusion

The results of the INR subgroup analysis suggest that a subtherapeutic INR may not be protective against ICH in patients with minor head injury.

### Geriatric trauma management [^113o8GAx]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Warfarin reversal with vitamin K/fresh frozen plasma (FFP) — efficacy and risks — are described: one study suggests that immediate transfusion of 2 units of unmatched FFP followed by 2 units of matched FFP decreases the time to reversal from 4.3 to 1.9 hours; progression of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in treated patients dropped from 40% to 11% with a reduction in mortality from 50% to 10%; however, the volume of FFP required for reversal may range from 2–4 liters and transfusion-associated circulatory overload was the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality in the US between 2013 and 2017.

### Immediate and delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head trauma and preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use [^111zXYhi]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Patients receiving warfarin or clopidogrel are considered at increased risk for traumatic intracranial hemorrhage after blunt head trauma. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and the cumulative incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in these patients, however, are unknown. The objective of this study is to address these gaps in knowledge.

Methods

A prospective, observational study at 2 trauma centers and 4 community hospitals enrolled emergency department (ED) patients with blunt head trauma and preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use from April 2009 through January 2011. Patients were followed for 2 weeks. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and the cumulative incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage were calculated from patients who received initial cranial computed tomography (CT) in the ED. Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as traumatic intracranial hemorrhage within 2 weeks after an initially normal CT scan result and in the absence of repeated head trauma.

Results

A total of 1,064 patients were enrolled (768 warfarin patients [72.2%] and 296 clopidogrel patients [27.8%]). There were 364 patients (34.2%) from Level I or II trauma centers and 700 patients (65.8%) from community hospitals. One thousand patients received a cranial CT scan in the ED. Both warfarin and clopidogrel groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics, although concomitant aspirin use was more prevalent among patients receiving clopidogrel. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher in patients receiving clopidogrel (33/276, 12.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.4% to 16.4%) than patients receiving warfarin (37/724, 5.1%; 95% CI 3.6% to 7.0%), relative risk 2.31 (95% CI 1.48 to 3.63). Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was identified in 4 of 687 (0.6%; 95% CI 0.2% to 1.5%) patients receiving warfarin and 0 of 243 (0%; 95% CI 0% to 1.5%) patients receiving clopidogrel.

Conclusion

Although there may be unmeasured confounders that limit intergroup comparison, patients receiving clopidogrel have a significantly higher prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage compared with patients receiving warfarin. Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage is rare and occurred only in patients receiving warfarin. Discharging patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications from the ED after a normal cranial CT scan result is reasonable, but appropriate instructions are required because delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage may occur.

### Antiplatelet therapy is associated with a high rate of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head injuries [^113cApF4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

While the association between anticoagulation and increased risk of traumatic ICH is well established in the literature, there are fewer studies quantifying the incidence of traumatic ICH in patients taking antiplatelet medications. Several studies have reported no increased risk for bleeding, mortality or neurosurgical interventions with antiplatelet medications. However, a meta-analysis with over 20 000 patients showed a pooled OR of 1.87 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.74) with increased odds of ICH for patients on all antiplatelet therapy, although not for patients on aspirin alone. This conflicting evidence highlights the need for more prospective trials on the effects of antiplatelet medications on ICH and the risk to patients. This information would be valuable as clinicians weigh the risks and benefits of antiplatelet medications, especially in patients who are older with risk factors for falls.

Our results should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, as patients were enrolled retrospectively into this study from trauma registries, there likely were patients with head injuries who presented to the ED and were not seen by the trauma services. Second, antiplatelet use by patients was based on documentation in the medical records. Analysis with platelet function testing was not routinely performed, so it is unclear if patients were compliant with their antiplatelet medications. Third, the protocol for repeat head CT imaging was not universally applied. Many patients did not receive a repeat head CT, limiting the ability to quantify the rate of minor subclinical delayed ICH. Fourth, no follow-up was performed after the hospitalization. Some patients may have had an acute ICH and were discharged to hospice, and others may have had a delayed ICH that occurred after hospital discharge. Although most delayed cases of ICH occur within the first 24 hours, some do occur up to 10 days after the initial head injury which would lead to under reporting of these cases. Finally, this study was not designed to have a control group with patients not on antiplatelets. Therefore, we could only perform comparisons between antiplatelet groups, rather than examine the effects of the individual agents on rates of ICH. Additionally, patients on antiplatelet agents may be more likely to receive a head CT compared with those who are not, which may lead to an increase in the ICH rate of limited clinical significance.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^111sWmzu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Even considering the potential for elevated risk of major hemorrhage, ICrH and associated mortality, studies suggest that the benefits of treatment with anticoagulation outweigh any harms. A theoretical, clinical decision-analytic model was used to parse the optimal treatment strategy in a population of elderly patients with AF at risk for falling. Controlling for age and baseline stroke risk, implementing warfarin therapy (the only treatment available at that time) was associated with > 2.5 greater quality-adjusted life-years than withholding antithrombotic treatment in elderly patients. Their analysis showed that a patient would need to fall approximately 295 times in a year to exceed the benefit of stroke prevention from anticoagulation therapy. In the optimization model, fall risk was not a relevant factor in the clinical decision to start treatment.

There are scales to quantify the bleeding risk in the anticoagulated patients, such as HAS-BLEDand HEMORR 2 HAGESand others. Creators note that the scales were primarily created to identify modifiable risk factors, for example, excessive alcohol use, not to exclude patients from anticoagulation treatment.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^1173VW3j]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) — restarting anticoagulation after intracranial bleeding lacks definitive timing guidance; the available evidence is insufficient to recommend the optimal timing to restart anticoagulation, and available guidelines suggest waiting 2 weeks or less for patients at high risk and 7–8 weeks for low-risk patients, but not more than 90 days after the bleeding event.

### The effect of warfarin and intensity of anticoagulation on outcome of intracerebral hemorrhage… [^117N8g1c]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Although 68. 0% of all warfarin-related hemorrhages occurred at an international normalized ratio of
3. 0 or less, increasing degrees of anticoagulation were strongly associated with increasing risk of death compared with no warfarin use. Conclusions Patients taking warfarin had a doubling in the rate of intracerebral hemorrhage mortality in a dose-dependent manner. The data suggest that careful control of the INR, already known to limit the risk of warfarin-related ICH, may also limit its severity. Warfarin sodium remains a highly effective therapy for prevention of thromboembolic strokes in common clinical situations, especially atrial fibrillation. 1–4 This protective effect of anticoagulation is in part offset by the risk of hemorrhagic complications, particularly intracerebral hemorrhage, the deadliest stroke subtype.

Because of the poor outcome associated with warfarin-related ICH, this complication has a large effect on the clinical decision of whether to administer anticoagulants. Our results indicate that warfarin use increases risk of death from ICH and that intensity of anticoagulation independently predicts 3-month mortality for patients with warfarin-ICH. Although warfarin even at the most commonly used therapeutic levels of anticoagulation appears to increase risk of fatal outcome, our data indicate that this risk rises further as the INR increases. Careful control of the INR may therefore reduce not only the risk of developing ICH25, 26 but also the mortality of those hemorrhages that occur.

In addition, the link between intensity of anticoagulation and clinical outcome may support the possibility that rapid reversal of warfarin effect through emergency administration of vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, or clotting factor concentrates may improve the otherwise dismal outcome of warfarin-ICH. 27–29. Our data confirm the devastating effect of warfarin use on ICH outcome and suggest that rapid correction of coagulopathy may be of benefit in the severe setting. In addition, these results can play a role in clinical decision making for patients being considered for warfarin therapy. The outcome data in the present study provide empiric information necessary for the development of decision-analysis models that can be used to evaluate various clinical scenarios involving anticoagulation, such as whether to offer anticoagulant therapy to ICH survivors who are at high risk for thromboembolic stroke. 20.

### Management of anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhage: an evidence-based review [^113A4Hrq]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Resumption of anticoagulation

Whether and when to resume anticoagulation are other important questions that haunt clinicians managing AICH. Again there is no straightforward and definitive answer to this dilemma. Very few data are available to guide clinicians on this important issue, and most of what we know is generated by small case series. The decision of whether to restart anticoagulation should take into consideration the recent anticoagulant-related hemorrhage and the need for anticoagulation. The evidence that supports use of anticoagulation in the disease process should be considered; and the urgency with which anticoagulation needs to be restarted and the risk of trauma/falls leading to rebleeding should also be a factor. The presence of microbleeds on brain magnetic resonance imaging might portend a higher risk of developing recurrent AICH once anticoagulation is restarted. Finally, the availability of alternative approaches, in lieu of anticoagulation, to prevent progression of or complications from a thromboembolic disease process should be sought (for example, newer anticoagulants, temporary vena cava filter devices).

Claassen and colleagues reviewed medical records of 52 consecutive patients with WRICH. Warfarin was restarted after a median of 10 days (range 7 to 28 days) in 23 patients; one-half of these had mechanical heart valves. During follow-up there were five cases of recurrent major bleeding in the group on warfarin, and five thromboembolic events in those not restarted on warfarin. In another retrospective study, Majeed and colleagues identified 234 patients with WRICH, 177 of whom had long-term follow-up. Of these 177 patients, 59 resumed warfarin after a median of 5.6 weeks. Recurrent ICH occurred in eight patients who restarted warfarin and in 10 patients who did not. The combined risk of recurrent WRICH or ischemic stroke reached its nadir when warfarin was resumed 10 to 30 weeks after the incident WRICH.

Bleeding risk by intracranial hemorrhage subtype. SDH. subdural hematoma; sICrH, spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage; tICrH, traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Trauma investigators have developed a decision rule to risk stratify patients with tICrH for early chemoprophylaxis (see figure 4). While this rule has only been tested in a pilot trial of low-risk patients with stable CT images for early VTE prevention (prophylactic dose heparins, not full oral anticoagulation), it is useful to conceptualize risk of hematoma expansion in the setting of anticoagulant considerations. It is also telling that the study of 62 patients had no clinically significant hematoma expansion at 48 hours after injury. Ongoing changes in hemorrhage based on follow-up imaging may offer an important criterion for evaluating patients for treatment reinitiation.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^111HSCdk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The review of PubMed returned 509 articles, with 17 retained following title and abstract review. Searching available clinical guidelines provided 3 relevant guidelines (out of 184 results) and 12 additional references. The remaining references (24) were identified from review of pertinent bibliographies and Google Scholar.

Equipoise

Much of the available evidence on restart of anticoagulation therapy after ICrH comes from sICrH data. In this context, the equipoise is on whether (rather than when) to restart anticoagulation. In tICrH, primarily cared for by trauma surgeons and neurosurgeons, the equipoise is shifted to when to resume anticoagulation in most patients. Clinicians who care for tICrH see the traumatic episode as largely isolated, perhaps influenced by fall risk, although only to a very small degree (295 falls per year to offset anticoagulant benefit). Otherwise, it is largely disconnected from the baseline risk–benefit ratio for anticoagulation. A global survey of 228 neurologists, neurosurgeons and thrombosis experts found 98% believed patients with tICrH should be restarted (see figure 2) but demonstrated wide variability as to when, noting 'randomized trials are direly needed in this population'. In another neurosurgical survey, approximately 80% chose restart timing intervals of 1 week or 1 month (vs never or longer) in central nervous system hemorrhage. The differing equipoise in sICrH and tICrH is illustrated in the prospective trial designs (see 'Prospective randomized trials' section for details). The one tICrH trial is focused on timing of restart without a non-anticoagulated control, while the several sICrH trials all have a control group.

### Utility of INR for prediction of delayed intracranial hemorrhage among warfarin users with head injury [^1169qYd9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage (DICH) in patients on warfarin has been controversial. No previous literature has reported the utility of international normalized ratio (INR) in predicting traumatic DICH.

Objectives

Utilizing INR to risk stratify head trauma patients who may be managed without repeat imaging.

Methods

This was a retrospective study at a Level II trauma center. All patients on warfarin with head injuries from March 2014 to December 31, 2017 were included. Each patient underwent an initial head computed tomography scan (HCT) and subsequent repeat HCT 12 h after. Patients presenting > 12 h after head injury received only one HCT. Two blinded neuroradiologists reviewed each case of DICH. Statistical analysis evaluated Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), age, and platelet count.

Results

There were 395 patients who qualified for the protocol; 238 were female. Average age was 79 years. Seventy-seven percent of patients underwent repeat HCT. Five resulted in DICH (INR 2.6–3.0), three of which might have been present on initial HCT; incidence rate of 0.51–1.27%. One patient required neurosurgical intervention. Among 80 patients with INR < 2, no DICH was identified, resulting in high sensitivity, but with a wide confidence interval; sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 47.8–100), specificity 21% (95% CI 16.6–28.9). Correlation of factors: ISS (p = 0.039), GCS (p = 0.978), HR (p = 0.601), SBP (p = 0.198), age (p = 0.014), and platelets (p = 0.281).

Conclusion

No patient with INR < 2 suffered DICH, suggesting that warfarin users presenting with INR < 2 may be managed without repeat HCT. For INR > 2, patients age and injury severity can be used for shared decision-making to discharge home with standard head injury precautions and no repeat HCT.

### Recommendations for research assessing outcomes for patients with anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds [^112Zpykq]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral bleeds related to anticoagulant use have a poor prognosis and substantial risk of disability and death. Recent publications evaluating replacement or reversal therapies for anticoagulants lack consistency in controlling for key factors that significantly influence outcomes. In an effort to guide future research by providing a framework to improve consistency and reduce the potential for confounding in this dynamic and highly time-dependent brain insult, we provide here a brief overview of variables we consider critical in studies evaluating the risk and the reversal of anticoagulant therapies in anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds. Hematoma expansion stands out as one of the few potentially modifiable risk factors and its early control could mitigate secondary brain injury, and it, therefore, requires careful categorization. In addition to the baseline demographic, clinical, and radiological predictors of hematoma expansion, we specifically highlight time-dependent factors such as the time from the last dose, time from symptom onset and time to treatment, the computed tomography angiography spot sign, and the limitation of early care as especially critical predictors of outcomes in anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a condition that requires fast diagnosis and treatment, especially when associated with anticoagulants. The advent of therapies with rapid reversal of anticoagulation open the opportunity to assess the scale to which faster reversal of anticoagulation modifies hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes. Thus, comprehensive assessment and reporting of these important potential confounding factors, particularly the critical time variables, is crucial to improving research and treatment of intracerebral hemorrhages.

### A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial of anticoagulation in low-risk traumatic brain injury: the delayed versus early enoxaparin prophylaxis I (DEEP I) study [^115bWCZF]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Our group has created an algorithm for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after traumatic brain injury (TBI), which stratifies patients into low, moderate, and high risk for spontaneous injury progression and tailors a prophylaxis regimen to each arm. We present the results of the Delayed Versus Early Enoxaparin Prophylaxis I study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot trial on the low-risk arm.

Methods

In this two-institution study, patients presenting within 6 hours of injury with prespecified small TBI patterns and stable scans at 24 hours after injury were randomized to receive enoxaparin 30 mg bid or placebo from 24 to 96 hours after injury in a double-blind fashion. An additional computed tomography scan was obtained on all subjects 24 hours after starting treatment (and therefore 48 hours after injury). The primary end point was the radiographic worsening of TBI; secondary end points were venous thromboembolism occurrence and extracranial hemorrhagic complications.

Results

A total of 683 consecutive patients with TBI were screened during the 28 center months. The most common exclusions were for injuries larger than the prespecified criteria (n = 199) and preinjury anticoagulant use (n = 138). Sixty-two patients were randomized to enoxaparin (n = 34) or placebo (n = 28). Subclinical, radiographic TBI progression rates on the scans performed 48 hours after injury and 24 hours after start of treatment were 5.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7–19.7%) for enoxaparin and 3.6% (95% CI, 0.1–18.3%) for placebo, a treatment effect difference of 2.3% (95% CI, -14.42–16.5%). No clinical TBI progressions occurred. One deep vein thrombosis occurred in the placebo arm.

Conclusion

TBI progression rates after starting enoxaparin in small, stable injuries 24 hours after injury are similar to those of placebo and are subclinical. The next Delayed Versus Early Enoxaparin Prophylaxis studies will assess efficacy of this practice in a powered study on the low-risk arm and a pilot trial of safety of a 72-hour time point in the moderate-risk arm.

### Routine repeat head CT does not change management in trauma patients on novel anticoagulants [^1171W2P6]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guidelines for imaging anticoagulated patients following a traumatic injury are unclear. Interval CT head (CTH) is often routinely performed after initial negative CTH to assess for delayed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH-d). The rate of ICH-d for patients taking novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is unknown. We hypothesized that the incidence of ICH-d in patients on NOACs would be similar, if not lower to that of warfarin, and routine repeat CTH after initial negative would not change management, and thus, may not be indicated.

Materials and Methods

Anticoagulated patients presenting with blunt trauma to a level I trauma center between 2016 and 2018 were evaluated. Exclusion criteria included: positive initial CTH and those taking nonoral anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents alone (without warfarin or NOAC). Outcomes included: ICH-d, discharge GCS, administration of reversal agents, neurosurgical intervention, readmission, and death. Multivariable regression was performed to evaluate patient factors associated with the development of ICH-d.

Results

A total of 332 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into a warfarin group (n = 191) and NOAC group (n = 141). The incidence of ICH-d in the warfarin group was 2.6% (5/191) and 2.1% (3/141) in the NOAC group (P = 0.77). There were no reversal agents administered, neurosurgical interventions, readmissions, or deaths in the NOAC group.

Conclusions

Little is known about the impact of NOACs in the setting of trauma, especially regarding risks of ICH-d following traumatic injury. In the NOAC group, ICH-d occurred only 2.1% of the time. In addition, there were no reversal agents given, neurosurgical interventions, or deaths. These data, taken together, suggest the limited utility of repeat imaging in this patient population.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach in adult patients with traumatic brain injury receiving oral anticoagulant therapy: an Austrian interdisciplinary consensus statement [^115nrEMY]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical question: Should a patient with a normal CCT scan be admitted for monitoring of the neurological state? If yes, for how long and what kind of monitoring should be used?

All patients with TBI and potential or known intake of oral anticoagulants with a normal CCT should be admitted and observed for at least 24 h after trauma. A follow-up CCT is indicated only in case of neurological deterioration (changes in GCS and pupil responses or FOUR score, as determined by specialists in neurology, trauma surgery, neurosurgery, or intensive care medicine). Neurological examinations should be performed every hour during the first 4 h, every 2 h during the following 8 h and every 6 h during the next 12 h.

Patients whose antithrombotic therapy comprises ASA monotherapy only may be discharged immediately under the following conditions: normal initial CCT scan, GCS 15, absence of other risk factors, and guaranteed observation by nursing home staff or suitably instructed close family/friends.

Due to numerous cases of delayed ICH in anticoagulated TBI patients with normal initial neurological examination and CCT scan findings, we recommend admission and observation for at least 24 h. Patients who have ASA treatment as their only risk factor and meet the above conditions do not require admission after a normal CCT, due to a lack of studies showing increased risk for delayed ICH or mortality in these patients.

ICH can occur days or weeks after trauma, meaning that no protocol will be fully effective. Delayed bleeding has been reported to affect 0.2–6% of TBI patients on VKAs or clopidogrel with normal findings upon repeat CCT. Observation for 24 h after trauma appears sufficient to detect the majority of clinically significant bleeding episodes.

For TBI patients on anticoagulants whose initial CCT findings are normal, routine performance of a repeat CCT appears to be of little benefit, hence the recommendation to scan only patients with neurological deterioration. GCS and pupil responses or the FOUR Score are suitable for neurological evaluation.

Clinical question: How should I proceed with patients with a normal CCT scan who cannot be examined neurologically?

All patients with TBI and potential or known intake of oral anticoagulants with a normal CCT scan who cannot be examined neurologically (e.g. due to intubation, sedation, or dementia) require a follow-up CCT within 6–24 h after trauma.

If the patient cannot undergo sufficient neurological examination (e.g. because they are intubated, sedated or demented), we recommend a repeat CCT within 6–24 h after trauma. The decision on exact timing may be influenced by underlying risk factors for delayed ICH or findings of the initial CCT scan.

### Increased relative risk of delayed hemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulant / antiplatelet medications with concurrent aspirin therapy: implications for clinical practice based on 3-year retrospective analysis in a large health system [^112S1DGj]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The incidence of delayed posttraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (DH) in patients on anticoagulant (AC) and antiplatelet (AP) medications, especially with concurrent aspirin therapy, is not well established, with studies reporting disparate results with between 1–10% risk of DH and 0–3% mortality. The purpose of this 3-year retrospective study is to evaluate the true risk of DH in patients on AP/AC medications with or without concurrent aspirin therapy.

Methods

One thousand forty-six patients taking AP and AC medications presenting to network emergency departments with head trauma who had repeat CT to evaluate for DH were included in the study. Repeat examinations were typically performed within 24 h (average follow-up time was 21 h and 99% were within 3 days). Mean time to DH was 20 h. All positive studies were reviewed by two board-certified neuroradiologists. Patients were excluded from the study if hemorrhage was retrospectively identified on the initial examination. Cases were reclassified as negative if hemorrhage on the follow-up examination was thought to be not present or artifactual. Cases were considered positive if the initial examination was negative and the follow-up examination demonstrated new hemorrhage.

Results

Overall, there was 1.91% incidence (20 patients) of DH and 0.3% overall mortality (3 patients). The group of patients taking warfarin or AP agents demonstrated a significantly higher rate of DH (3.2% compared to 0.9%) and higher mortality (0.9% compared to 0.0%) compared to the DOAC group (p < 0.01). The risk of DH in patients taking AC or AP agents with aspirin (13/20 cases) was significantly higher (RR 3.8, p < 0.01) than that of patients taking AC or AP alone (7/20 cases).

Conclusion

The risk of DH was significantly higher in patients taking aspirin in addition to AC/AP medications. Repeat imaging should be obtained for trauma patients taking AC/AP agents with concurrent aspirin. The rate of DH was also significantly higher in patients taking warfarin or AP agents when compared to patients taking DOACs. Repeat examination should be strongly considered on patients taking warfarin or AP agents without aspirin. Given the relatively low risk of DH in patients taking DOACs alone, repeat imaging could be reserved for patients with external signs of trauma or dangerous mechanism of injury.

### Intracranial bleeds after minor and minimal head injury in patients on warfarin [^114pTnG7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is little evidence to guide physicians on management of patients who sustain head injuries while on warfarin.

Objectives

Our objective was to determine the rate of intracranial bleeding in anticoagulated patients with minor and minimal head injuries and the association with clinical features and international normalized ratio (INR).

Methods

We conducted a historical cohort study of adult patients, taking warfarin, at two tertiary care emergency departments over 2 years with minor (Glasgow Coma Score 13–15, with loss of consciousness, amnesia, or confusion) or minimal (Glasgow Coma Score 15 without loss of consciousness, amnesia, or confusion) head injuries. Patients with penetrating injuries, INR < 1.5, or a new focal neurological deficit were excluded. Our outcome, intracranial bleeding, was determined by the radiologist's final computed tomography (CT) report for imaging performed within 2 weeks.

Results

There were 176 patients enrolled, of which 157 (89.2%) had CT and 28 (15.9%) had intracranial bleeding. Comparing patients with and without intracranial bleeding found no significant differences in INR, and loss of consciousness was associated with higher rate of intracranial bleeding. The rate of intracranial bleeding in the minor and minimal head injury groups was 21.9% and 4.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

The rate of intracranial bleeding in patients on warfarin is considerable. Loss of consciousness is associated with high rates of intracranial bleeding. This study supports a low threshold for ordering CT scans for anticoagulated patients with head injuries.

### Risk factors for progression of intracranial hemorrhage after initiation of VTE chemoprophylaxis: an evaluation of 1390 TBI patients [^111oeQxs]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective review, we found ICH progression to be an uncommon event (3%) following early administration of VTE CP. ICH progression was associated with older age, midline shift or subdural hematoma on initial CT, or progression on 6-hour stability head CT. These findings were consistent with our hypothesis of a low progression rate following CP initiation and factors that were similar to those of spontaneous progression. Notably, among those who exhibited continued progression of ICH after CP initiation, only 4 patients (0.3%) required intervention. Morality in the progression group was 12% (5 patients).

Delayed initiation of pharmacological prophylaxis beyond 72 hours has been shown to increase the risk of VTE threefold. More recent literature underscores that each hour of delay escalates the likelihood of VTE by 1.5%. Pulmonary embolism is the leading cause of preventable mortality in trauma patients after 24 hours making timely CP paramount. Not only is VTE associated with high mortality and morbidity for the patients in which they occur, but it is also a significant economic burden. For patients who develop VTE, one in four will experience additional VTE-related events necessitating hospitalization, incurring thousands of additional dollars to an average health plan cost. The benefits associated with the mitigation of VTE in patients with ICH through early CP must be weighed against the risk of further bleeding. In our study, we noted that the factors associated with progression following CP align with those for spontaneous progression, raising the suspicion that in some patients, ICH progression may be independent of early CP.

### Emergency management of minor head injury in anticoagulated patients [^116miAci]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately 1% of the UK population receives anticoagulation with warfarin. Head injury accounts for some 1.4 million emergency department attendances in the country. Therefore, significant numbers of patients with head injury have a therapeutic coagulopathy. This review aims to examine the existing evidence for optimal management of warfarinised head injured patients, particularly with respect to the need for early CT imaging and the use of reversal agents in cases of proved haemorrhage.

### Delayed intracranial hemorrhage in anticoagulated geriatric patients after ground level falls [^111mWyB3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The reported risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in a trauma patient on warfarin is estimated to be between 0.6% and 6%. The risk of delayed ICH in trauma patients taking novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is not well-defined.

Objective

We hypothesized that there was a significant number of delayed presentations of ICH in patients on NOACs.

Methods

A retrospective review of our trauma registry was performed on geriatric patients (age older than 64 years) who were initially evaluated at our level I trauma center, had fall from standing height or less, and were anticoagulated (warfarin or NOACs), from April 2017 to March 2018.

Results

Seventy-seven patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 80 ± 7.7 years and 46% of patients were male. The admission head computed tomography scan was positive in 20.8% of patients. Positive scans were more common in patients on warfarin vs. NOACs (30% vs. 14%; p = 0.074) and had a significantly higher Injury Severity Score (median [interquartile range]: 9 [3–15] vs. 5 [1–9]; p = 0.030) and Abbreviated Injury Scale-Head score (median [interquartile range]: 1 [0–3] vs. 1 [0–2]; p = 0.035). The agreement between loss of consciousness (LOC) and ICH was 72% (κ = -0.064; p = 0.263). Fifty-one percent of patients had a repeat head CT. New ICH was diagnosed in 9.6% of patients. All of these patients were on NOACs.

Conclusions

A fall from standing or less in anticoagulated geriatric patients is a significant mechanism of injury resulting in ICH. The absence of LOC does not eliminate the possibility of ICH. There is a significant risk of delayed ICH for patients on NOACs and repeat evaluations should be performed. A prospective multicenter evaluation of this finding is warranted.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^11398HnV]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Geriatric head injury imaging and anticoagulation — have a very low threshold for requesting a head computed tomography (CT) in geriatric patients for all head injuries, especially if they are taking anticoagulant medication, and clinicians are more liberal with imaging because of minimal risks related to radiation exposure and greater risk for an unknown injury. Because elderly adults are often prescribed daily anticoagulant and/or antithrombotic therapy, patients taking these medications have higher rates of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and subsequent mortality compared to elderly adults with similar injuries not on anticoagulant therapy (21.9 vs. 15.2 percent, respectively, p = 0.04). A best practice is to obtain a coagulation profile in all geriatric trauma patients taking these medications and to obtain a head CT as soon as possible after admission.

### Supratherapeutic warfarin and risk of intracranial hemorrhage in geriatric patients with blunt head trauma [^112ydwEV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of our study is to assess whether a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) is associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in geriatric ED patients prescribed preinjury warfarin that suffer head trauma.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of a prospective study of geriatric head trauma patients presenting to two EDs over a one-year period. Geriatric ED patients presenting with a head injury were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were patients who sustained a ground level fall. Exclusion criteria were patients taking non-warfarin anticoagulants or patients taking antiplatelet agents not on warfarin. The primary study outcome was an ICH diagnosed on CT scan. Data included demographics, anticoagulant use, antiplatelet use, physical examination findings and head CT results. The main outcome measure was significant head injury based on therapeutic versus supratherapeutic INR.

Results

Of 5776 patients identified, 2686 met inclusion criteria. There were 2423 in the No ACAP group and 263 in the warfarin. The patients in the no anticoagulants or antiplatelet group (No ACAP) were younger than the Warfarin: mean age 80.2 versus 85.3 years (p < 0.5). The groups also differed by gender with 60.2% females in the No ACAP and 40% females in the Warfarin. When comparing ICH rates in patients on warfarin versus NO ACAP with an INR > 3.0, there were no significant differences.

Conclusion

In older ED patients prescribed preinjury warfarin, elevated INR levels do not appear to be a risk factor for acute ICH.
