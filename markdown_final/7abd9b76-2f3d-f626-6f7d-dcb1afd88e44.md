## Question

Hypothyroid management in elderly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hypothyroidism management in the elderly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define the clinical problem and frame the key questions. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and thresholds in older adults. Next, I will examine treatment indications for overt versus subclinical hypothyroidism, including TSH cutoffs and antibody status. After that, I need to check dosing strategies, titration, and monitoring, including age-adjusted TSH targets. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety, and a practical algorithm, and I will double-check areas of controversy and correct any misstatements as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and key questions. Hypothyroidism in older adults spans overt disease with low free T4 and elevated TSH, and subclinical disease with normal free T4 and mildly elevated TSH, and management differs by severity, comorbidity, and life expectancy; I need to ensure I address who to treat, how to dose, what TSH targets to aim for, and how to monitor safely over time.

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, but wait, let me verify the thresholds that change with age. TSH rises with age even in healthy individuals, so a TSH up to about 7.5–10 mIU/L may be physiologic in patients over 80, and using a uniform reference range can overcall subclinical hypothyroidism; I should confirm persistence with repeat testing in 2–3 months because up to 40% normalize spontaneously, and I must exclude non-thyroidal illness and medication effects that confound interpretation in the elderly [^notfound] [^cc6ebde5] [^09ea4246].

> Next, I should review overt hypothyroidism; hold on, I should verify treatment indications and dosing. Overt hypothyroidism should be treated in essentially all older adults given cardiovascular and neurocognitive risks of untreated disease, but dosing must be conservative: start 12.5–25 mcg/day if there is coronary artery disease or significant cardiac risk, and 25–50 mcg/day if there is no heart disease, titrating by 12.5–25 mcg every 6–8 weeks to a TSH in the age-appropriate range; I need to ensure I account for lower levothyroxine requirements in older adults, roughly 20–25% less per kilogram than in younger patients [^28946c71] [^5e4b3938] [^4bde2cf9].

> Now, subclinical hypothyroidism is where I should be cautious; let me think about the TSH strata and evidence. For TSH less than 7 mIU/L, I should not treat because randomized trials show no symptomatic benefit and potential harm signals in older adults; for TSH 7–10 mIU/L, treatment may be considered if there are symptoms, positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies, or cardiovascular disease, recognizing the evidence is observational; for TSH 10 mIU/L or higher, treatment is generally recommended due to higher risks of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, though I should confirm persistence and individualize by comorbidity and life expectancy [^a020af86] [^100a06fa] [^0802b8e8].

> Wait, I initially thought the BMJ 2019 guideline applied broadly to all adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, but I should double-check the age context. The BMJ strong recommendation against thyroid hormone therapy was based on trials largely in younger or mixed-age populations and explicitly does not apply to patients over 65 with TSH above 10 mIU/L, so I should not overgeneralize that recommendation to older adults in higher TSH strata where observational and guideline data support treatment [^a020af86].

> I need to ensure dosing and titration are safe in frailty and multimorbidity. In patients over 80 or with limited life expectancy, I should target a higher TSH, often 4–6 mIU/L, to avoid overtreatment; in those with cognitive impairment or adherence issues, liquid or softgel formulations and simplified regimens can help, and I should recheck TSH about 6 weeks after any dose change, then extend intervals once stable; I should also remember that many older adults need 20–25% less levothyroxine than younger patients, so I must titrate slowly and watch for angina or arrhythmias [^28946c71] [^ff11340f] [^a5f629d7].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence and what to do when TSH is unstable. Annual monitoring is reasonable in stable older adults, but if TSH fluctuates, I should reassess adherence, timing with food or calcium/iron, and consider malabsorption or drug interactions; if repeated TSH values remain above the reference range despite apparent compliance, switching to liquid or softgel levothyroxine can improve absorption without changing dose, and I should avoid chasing small dose adjustments for quality-of-life complaints once TSH is already in the age-appropriate range [^ff11340f] [^af64cc26] [^1829ce08].

> Let me consider special populations and safety signals. In central hypothyroidism, TSH is unreliable, so I should target free T4 in the upper half of normal, often using lower targets in older adults; in amiodarone-associated hypothyroidism, I should treat overt cases but avoid treating subclinical disease in the elderly unless there is progression; and I must actively avoid overtreatment because suppressed TSH under 0.1 mIU/L in older adults triples atrial fibrillation risk and increases fractures, so I should lower the dose promptly if TSH is too low [^318324c9] [^943eca3b] [^885eb1b1].

> I should double-check the practical algorithm to ensure it aligns with evidence. Confirm hypothyroidism with repeat TSH and free T4, exclude non-thyroidal illness and interfering drugs, classify overt versus subclinical, and stratify by TSH bands; treat overt disease with conservative starts and slow titration; for subclinical disease, observe if TSH is under 7, consider treatment if 7–10 with risk factors, and treat if 10 or higher; set age-appropriate TSH targets, favoring 4–6 mIU/L in patients over 80 or with limited life expectancy; monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually if stable, and reassess adherence and absorption if TSH drifts [^a020af86] [^28946c71] [^ff11340f].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite a normal TSH in the age-appropriate range. I need to check for alternative causes such as sleep apnea, depression, anemia, or polypharmacy; combination LT4/LT3 therapy may be tried selectively in expert hands after excluding other etiologies, but I should avoid it in older adults with cardiac disease and discontinue if there is no clear benefit, given limited and mixed evidence and higher risk of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis [^b2c45664] [^ff65aacc].

> In summary, I should confirm that my approach is individualized: treat overt hypothyroidism in all older adults with cautious dosing, avoid treating mild subclinical disease, treat higher TSH thresholds when cardiovascular risk is present, and accept higher TSH targets in the oldest old to minimize harm from overtreatment; I will monitor closely, optimize formulation and adherence, and continuously re-evaluate the net clinical benefit as the patient's context evolves [^a020af86] [^28946c71] [^ff11340f].

Management of hypothyroidism in the elderly centers on **conservative levothyroxine dosing** and **individualized TSH targets** to balance benefits and risks. Start low (12.5–25 mcg/day) and titrate slowly (12.5–25 mcg every 6–8 weeks) to avoid cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias [^5e4b3938]. In patients ≥ 70 years, target TSH 4–6 mIU/L; in those ≥ 80 years, up to 7.5–10 mIU/L may be acceptable to reduce overtreatment risks [^28946c71] [^cc6ebde5]. Treat overt hypothyroidism promptly, but **avoid treating subclinical hypothyroidism unless TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or symptoms are significant** [^a020af86] [^c8eb015b]. Monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually; reassess if clinical status changes or new medications are added [^4881bc8a] [^5e4b3938].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **Atypical symptoms**: Elderly patients often present with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, depression, weight gain, constipation, and cold intolerance, which can be easily attributed to aging or comorbidities [^7887c54e].

- **Diagnostic challenges**: The diagnosis relies on biochemical confirmation with serum TSH and free T4. However, age-related physiological changes, comorbidities, and medications can confound thyroid function tests, necessitating careful interpretation [^09ea4246].

- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: Defined as elevated TSH with normal free T4, is common in the elderly. The decision to treat depends on TSH level, symptoms, and cardiovascular risk [^a020af86].

---

## Treatment principles

### General approach

Levothyroxine (LT4) is the **standard replacement therapy**. Management should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^29437850].

---

### Initial dosing

- **Low starting dose**: Begin at 12.5–25 mcg/day, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or significant comorbidities [^5e4b3938].

- **Gradual titration**: Increase by 12.5–25 mcg every 6–8 weeks based on TSH levels and clinical response [^5e4b3938].

- **Full replacement dose**: In elderly patients without cardiovascular disease, a starting dose of 50 mcg/day may be considered, with careful monitoring [^44d26ec4].

---

### Monitoring and adjustment

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check TSH every 6–8 weeks after any dose change until stable, then annually or as clinically indicated [^4881bc8a].

- **Individualized TSH targets**: In patients ≥ 70 years, target TSH 4–6 mIU/L; in those ≥ 80 years, up to 7.5–10 mIU/L may be acceptable to minimize overtreatment risks [^28946c71] [^cc6ebde5].

- **Clinical reassessment**: Regularly reassess symptoms, cardiovascular status, and bone health to adjust therapy accordingly [^4e552c61].

---

## Special considerations

### Cardiovascular disease

In patients with coronary artery disease or significant cardiac risk, **start low and titrate slowly** to avoid precipitating ischemia or arrhythmias [^5e4b3938]. Monitor for angina, palpitations, or exacerbation of heart failure during titration [^notfound].

---

### Cognitive impairment and frailty

Cognitive impairment and frailty may blunt symptom expression; therefore, **use conservative dosing and monitor closely** for adverse effects [^notfound].

---

### Polypharmacy and drug interactions

Polypharmacy is common; medications such as proton pump inhibitors, calcium, iron, and bile acid sequestrants can impair LT4 absorption, necessitating **careful timing and monitoring** [^3a9edc59].

---

## Subclinical hypothyroidism management

- **TSH < 7 mIU/L**: Observation without treatment is recommended, as benefits are unclear and overtreatment risks are significant [^a020af86].

- **TSH 7–10 mIU/L**: Consider treatment if symptomatic, positive thyroid antibodies, or cardiovascular risk factors are present [^100a06fa].

- **TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L**: Treatment is generally recommended due to increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and cardiovascular events [^0802b8e8].

---

## Risks of overtreatment

Overtreatment can cause **iatrogenic hyperthyroidism**, leading to atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and increased mortality. Suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mIU/L) is particularly harmful in the elderly [^885eb1b1].

---

## Alternative therapies

Combination LT4/LT3 therapy is **generally not recommended** in the elderly due to limited evidence and increased risk of adverse effects. Reserve for select cases with persistent symptoms despite optimized LT4 therapy, and use with caution [^ff65aacc].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Overt hypothyroidism | - Start LT4 12.5–25 mcg/day <br/> - Titrate every 6–8 weeks <br/> - Target TSH 4–6 mIU/L (≤ 7.5–10 mIU/L if ≥ 80 years) |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH < 7 mIU/L) | Observe, no treatment |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 7–10 mIU/L) | Consider treatment if symptomatic or cardiovascular risk factors |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L) | Treat with LT4 |
| Cardiovascular disease | - Start low (12.5–25 mcg/day) <br/> - Titrate slowly <br/> - Monitor closely |
| Cognitive impairment/frailty | - Conservative dosing <br/> - Close monitoring |

---

Effective management of hypothyroidism in the elderly requires **conservative dosing**, **individualized TSH targets**, and **careful monitoring** to balance symptom control with the risks of overtreatment.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults [^4669e892]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Thyroid dysfunction is common in older adults and poses diagnostic and management challenges for clinicians. In this narrative review, we present published data focusing on special considerations in the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in older adults. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted from January 2000 to December 2024 to identify pertinent articles in English for this narrative review. Results: Due to significant cardiovascular risk if untreated, both overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism should be treated in older adults. Findings from observational studies do not support treating older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with a thyrotropin (TSH) < 7 mIU/L. However, observational data have demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and stroke in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 7.0–9.9 mIU/L and of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure in those with TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, suggesting levothyroxine treatment in these individuals should be considered. Data from clinical trials failed to show improvement with levothyroxine in hypothyroidism symptoms or fatigue in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with placebo. Over- and under-replacement with thyroid hormone is common and should be avoided, as population-based studies have shown associations with adverse cardiovascular and skeletal events. Subclinical hyperthyroidism with a TSH < 0.1 mIU/L should be treated in older individuals as it has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and bone density loss based on observational data. Randomized controlled trials have shown that long-term low-dose methimazole is a viable alternative to radioactive iodine in older adults with hyperthyroidism. Conclusions: A personalized approach should be undertaken in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults. Multiple factors should be considered, including physiological age-related changes in thyroid function, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. Care should be taken to maintain euthyroidism in order to avoid adverse events.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^28946c71]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Discussion of the clinical literature — elderly hypothyroidism management indicates that in elderly persons (those older than 65–70 years) who are without known heart disease or without major risk factors for heart disease, LT4 therapy can be initiated at the full dose, although the method of starting with a low dose and increasing it slowly is still preferred by some experts. The final LT4 dose that normalizes the serum TSH is generally lower in the elderly compared to younger persons. In addition to the lower dose requirements related to T4 metabolism, the target serum TSH should likely be raised in older persons, especially the oldest old (patients > 80 years), and, based on current evidence, it is reasonable to raise the target serum TSH to 4–6 mIU/L in persons greater than age 70–80 years. If maintaining a regular daily schedule of LT4 therapy is problematic in an elderly individual, consideration could be given to a guardian or visiting nurse giving all the LT4 pills once weekly (or half the pills twice weekly), if appropriate.

Special Populations PATIENTS OLDER THAN 60 YEARS AND PATIENTS WITH ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE In older adults, hypothyroidism may have a subtle or more nonspecific presentation. Few older patients with confirmed hypothyroidism have overt symptoms to suggest disease. 30 Thyroid hormone has known inotropic effects on cardiac tissue and can increase myocardial oxygen demand. For older patients or those with coronary artery disease, levothyroxine therapy should be started at 25 to 50 mcg per day, with titration of 25 mcg every three to four weeks until a target dosage is achieved to decrease the potential for adverse effects from thyroid excess. For combination treatment, T 3 is given at the same time as levothyroxine and dosed at 5 to 20 mcg, then 2. 5 to 10 mcg every eight hours until clinical improvement. Lower dosages are appropriate in older adults and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.

Stress-dose glucocorticoids should be administered until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out. Serum FT 4 and T 3 should be monitored every one to two days, with samples drawn at least one hour after dosing T 3. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25. Subclinical hypothyroidism is common in patients 65 years and older. Despite observed associations with depression, cognitive impairment, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, there is no evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism improves outcomes. A study of 737 patients who were 65 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism found no improvement in quality of life or clinical outcomes with levothyroxine titrated to achieve a normal TSH level compared with patients who received placebo with sham titration.

7 In patients 65 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism and TSH levels less than 10 mIU per L, treatment with levothyroxine can increase mortality. 35 The benefit of treating subclinical hypothyroidism in many populations is uncertain. One randomized controlled trial found that treating middle-aged adults with levothyroxine compared with a control medication decreased tiredness.

### Thyroid nodule evaluation and management in older adults: a Review of practical considerations for clinical endocrinologists [^dc9092ef]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Contextualizing the evaluation of older adults with thyroid nodules is necessary to fully understand which management strategy is the most appropriate. Our goal was to summarize available clinical evidence to provide guidance in the care of older adults with thyroid nodules and highlight special considerations for thyroid nodule evaluation and management in this population.

Methods

We conducted a literature search of PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE from January 2000 to November 2020 to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles published in English. References from the included articles as well as articles identified by the authors were also reviewed.

Results

The prevalence of thyroid nodules increases with age. Although thyroid nodules in older adults have a lower risk of malignancy, identified cancers are more likely to be of high-risk histology. The goals of thyroid nodule evaluation and the tools used for diagnosis are similar for older and younger patients with thyroid nodules. However, limited evidence exists regarding thyroid nodule evaluation and management to guide personalized decision making in the geriatric population.

Conclusion

Considering patient context is significant in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules in older adults. When making management decisions in this population, it is essential to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of thyroid nodule diagnosis and treatment, in view of older adults' higher prevalence of high-risk thyroid cancer as well as increased risk for multimorbidity, functional and cognitive decline, and treatment complications.

### Clinical aspects of thyroid function during ageing [^7887c54e]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Globally, populations are ageing at a rapid rate. The increase in the number of older citizens is accompanied by an increased prevalence of thyroid dysfunction, one of the most common disorders in older people. However, the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in older people is hindered by several factors, including the scarcity of thyroid dysfunction symptoms in older people. We describe the physiological changes in thyroid function that occur with increasing age, focusing on literature regarding changes in thyroid function test results in older populations. We also discuss treatment considerations for clinical and subclinical thyroid dysfunction according to international guidelines for older people. Finally, we discuss the relationship between variations in thyroid function and common diseases of old age including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cognitive impairment, and frailty and suggest directions for future research.

### Hypothyroidism [^29437850]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hypothyroidism, the deficiency of thyroid hormone, is a common condition worldwide. It affects almost all body systems and has a wide variety of clinical presentations from being asymptomatic to, in rare cases, life threatening. The classic symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, lethargy, weight gain, and cold intolerance; however, these symptoms are non-specific and the diagnosis is typically made on biochemical grounds through serum thyroid function tests. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), although other causes, including drugs (such as amiodarone, lithium, and immune checkpoint inhibitors), radioactive-iodine treatment, and thyroid surgery, are frequent. Historically, severe iodine deficiency was the most common cause. Reference ranges for thyroid function tests are based on fixed percentiles of the population distribution, but there is increasing awareness of the need for more individualised reference intervals based on key factors such as age, sex, and special circumstances such as pregnancy. Levothyroxine monotherapy is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism; it is safe and inexpensive, restores thyroid function tests to within the reference range, and improves symptoms in the majority of patients. However, 10% of patients have persistent symptoms of ill health despite normalisation of thyroid function tests biochemically and a substantial proportion of patients on levothyroxine have thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations outside the reference range. Ongoing symptoms despite levothyroxine treatment has led to some patients using liothyronine or desiccated thyroid extract. Taken together, these factors have led to intense debate around the treatment thresholds and treatment strategies for hypothyroidism. In this Seminar, we review the epidemiology, genetic determinants, causes, and presentation of hypothyroidism; highlight key considerations and controversies in its diagnosis and management; and provide future directions for research.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^5e4b3938]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — L-thyroxine dosing, monitoring, and cardiac disease precautions are outlined as follows: When medications affecting absorption, binding, or metabolism are introduced or discontinued, thyroid hormone levels should initially be checked within 4–8 weeks, with testing at least every 4–8 weeks until stable indices on the same dose are documented. Elderly patients often require 20–25% less L-thyroxine per kilogram daily than younger patients. Patients older than 50–60 years without coronary heart disease (CHD) may be started on 50 μg daily, whereas among those with known CHD, the usual starting dose is 12.5–25 μg/day, and clinical monitoring for the onset of anginal symptoms is essential. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting in unstable angina or left main occlusion may be safely performed while moderately to severely hypothyroid, but elective surgery should be performed after the patient has become euthyroid.

### Diagnosis and management of subclinical hypothyroidism in elderly adults: a review of the literature [^aa766234]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

The estimated prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in the general population is 3% to 8%. As the average age of the population in the United States and other countries continues to increase, the overall prevalence of SCH may also be expected to increase. Although age-related changes in thyroid function are well described, normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference limits, derived for age-specific populations, are not routinely used to identify thyroid dysfunction in elderly adults. Therefore, currently accepted values for the upper limit of normal of TSH may be inappropriate for diagnosing SCH in individuals aged 65 and older, resulting in potential overestimation of the prevalence of SCH in this population. This review discusses the current evidence of the effects of SCH on cardiovascular health and neuropsychiatric function in older adults. Although the results of some studies are conflicting, the overall evidence suggests that the consequences of SCH may be different for elderly adults than for younger populations. Treatment of SCH in older individuals requires special consideration with regard to thyroid hormone replacement therapy and expected clinical outcomes. Although careful identification of individuals with persistent SCH who could benefit from levothyroxine treatment is necessary, current evidence suggests that individuals with TSH levels greater than 10 mIU/L who test positive for antithyroid antibodies or are symptomatic may benefit from levothyroxine treatment to reduce the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism, decrease the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, and improve their quality of life. After treatment is initiated, careful monitoring is essential.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^3a37b02b]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism may be delayed in elderly patients because symptoms such as fatigue and constipation, and other early manifestations of thyroid failure may be attributed to aging itself. The high prevalence of thyroid failure and the difficulty of making an early clinical diagnosis in older persons suggest that screening for hypothyroidism might be useful in this group, especially since a simple test, the serum TSH level, is available. Recommendations about thyroid screening, however, have been inconsistent. Currently, no organizations recommend routine universal screening. For example, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. 2 has recommended that asymptomatic adults not be screened because evidence of clinical benefit is insufficient. More recently, some authors 3 have recommended testing in women more than 40 years of age and in patients in geriatric facilities.

Danese and co-workers 4 demonstrated through a decision model that TSH screening every five years, starting at age 35, was cost-effective because progression to overt hypothyroidism was prevented, serum cholesterol levels were reduced and symptoms were relieved with early treatment of hypothyroidism. 8 In selected cases, the risk of progression to overt disease may be closer to 20 percent per year. 9 Consideration of these possible outcomes affects the decision about whether to treat or to observe without treatment. Treatment Treatment is similar to that recommended in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is the agent of choice, rather than a preparation containing tri-iodothyronine, since T 3 has a short half-life and requires multiple daily doses to maintain blood levels in the normal range.

Levothyroxine, however, has a long half-life and is partially converted to T 3 in the body, resulting in a constant physiologic blood level of both T 4 and T 3 with a single daily dose.
15. In patients with overt hypothyroidism, the average daily replacement dosage of levothyroxine is 75 to 125 μg, or 50 to 100 μg in the elderly, or about

1. 6 μg per kg per day. Treatment is commonly initiated with 25 to 50 μg daily and raised by increments of 25 to 50 μg, according to TSH measurements at six- to eight-week intervals. In patients who are elderly or debilitated, or who have heart disease, lower starting dosages and slower increases are advisable.

### Shared decisionmaking in the treatment of hypothyroidism [^8b7e4507]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, affects millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and metabolic slowdowns. It is most prevalent in women and older adults, with causes including autoimmune thyroiditis, surgical thyroidectomy, and certain medications.

Standard Of Care and Limitations

The standard treatment involves synthetic levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, which alleviates symptoms by converting to the active hormone, T3. However, some patients continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and poor quality of life despite normalized TSH levels. This persistence of symptoms may stem from misdiagnosis, inadequate dosing, or incomplete normalization of thyroid hormone signaling.

New Findings

Research suggests that LT4 monotherapy may not fully restore T3 levels, leading to suboptimal symptom control. Consequently, combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3) has been proposed as an alternative, aiming to balance T4 and T3 levels more effectively. Although randomized controlled trials have not identified significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between LT4 monotherapy and combination therapy, they indicate that patients may prefer the latter.

Conclusion

Guidelines from leading endocrinology organizations now recommend considering combination therapy for patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate LT4 dosing. A patient-centered approach, emphasizing shared decision-making and individualized treatment plans, is essential for optimizing outcomes in hypothyroidism management. Further research is needed to refine dosing strategies and identify the patients who would benefit most from combination therapy.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in older individuals [^a020af86]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism, which is defined as a thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration higher than the reference range (generally 4.5 mIU/L or higher) with normal free thyroxine concentrations, is frequently found in older individuals. International guidelines differ in recommendations for management of subclinical hypothyroidism in older individuals. We assessed published data during the past decade on the clinical significance and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in individuals aged 65 years and older. Meta-analyses, randomised clinical trials, and cohort studies are discussed in this narrative Review. Studies showed no significantly increased incidence in adverse cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, or cognitive outcomes in individuals aged 65 years or older when serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration was 4.5–7.0 mIU/L versus a euthyroid group. Moreover, in older individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism, symptoms of hypothyroidism and cardiac and bone parameters did not improve after levothyroxine treatment. These data suggest that treatment with levothyroxine should be considered for individuals aged 65 years or older with subclinical hypothyroidism when thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is persistently 7 mIU/L or higher and to not initiate treatment with thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations of less than 7 mIU/L. Levothyroxine doses should be personalised according to age, comorbidities, and life expectancy.

Hypothyroidism — thyroxine dosing and cardiac considerations are described as follows: Thyroxine therapy is thought to reverse cardiovascular changes, and in older patients or those with known or suspected ischemic heart disease or cardiac dysfunction the initial dose should be "≈25% to 50% of the anticipated replacement dose, and the dose should then be increased in stepwise fashion at 6- to 8-week intervals". Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is noted as controversial but "from a cardiac perspective, treatment appears to offer benefit with minimal risk", with case reports of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) improving on thyroid hormone replacement; however, despite small trials showing cardiac function improvement with short-term T3, "trials evaluating clinical outcomes in HF patients are not available".

### Treatment of hypothyroidism… [^ec85bf05]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

INITIATING TREATMENT Most otherwise healthy adult patients with hypothyroidism require thyroid hormone replacement in a dosage of 1. 7 μg per kg per day, with requirements falling to 1 μg per kg per day in the elderly. Thus, levothyroxine in a dosage of 0. 10 to
0. 15 mg per day is needed to achieve euthyroid status. For full replacement, children may require up to 4 μg per kg per day. 9 In young patients without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, thyroid hormone replacement can start close to the target goal. In most healthy young adults, replacement is initiated using levothyroxine in a dosage of 0. 075 mg per day, with the dosage increased slowly as indicated by continued elevation of the TSH level. Levothyroxine should be initiated in a low dosage in older patients and those at risk for the cardiovascular compromise that could occur with a rapid increase in resting heart rate and blood pressure. 9 In these patients, the usual starting dosage is 0.

025 mg per day. This dosage can be increased in increments of 0. 025 to
0. 050 mg every four to six weeks until the TSH level returns to normal. 4 levels are monitored annually in most patients with hypothyroidism, although no data support this practice. Generally, once a stable maintenance dosage of levothyroxine is achieved, that dosage will remain adequate until patients are 60 to 70 years of age. With age, thyroid binding may decrease, and the serum albumin level may decline. In this setting, the levothyroxine dosage may need to be reduced by up to 20 percent. 13, 14 Although less frequent than annual monitoring could be justified in younger adult patients whose weight is stable, annual monitoring in older patients is necessary to avoid overreplacement.
15. 1 In contrast, patients with a higher TSH level progress to overt hypothyroidism at a rate of 1 to 20 percent per year.

1 Thyroid hormone replacement may have some benefits in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, but there is also a potential for adverse effects, particularly in older patients. Some studies have shown that supplementation of thyroid hormone accelerates bone mineral loss in older women with subclinical hypothyroidism, and that estrogen replacement therapy does not counteract this effect.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^824d4918]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### The impact of age in the management of hypothyroidism: results of a nationwide survey [^69201097]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Evidence exists that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) increases with age and lowering the TSH goal in older patients on thyroid hormone may cause over-treatment. Risks of overtreatment include cardiac and skeletal events. We assessed practice patterns regarding TSH goals and explored factors influencing physicians' decision making when managing hypothyroidism.

Methods

Members of the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Practice, and the Endocrine Society were surveyed to determine goal TSH when treating hypothyroidism.

Results

Fifty-three percent of physicians reported factoring patient age into their decision making when managing hypothyroidism. Patient age was prioritized third (53%), following patient symptoms (69.2%) and cardiac arrhythmias (65.7%). In multivariable analysis, endocrinologists (P = 0.002), internists (P = 0.049), physicians in academic settings (P = 0.003), and high-volume physicians (P = 0.021) were more likely to consider patient age when determining goal TSH. When presented with scenarios differing in patient gender and age, 90% of physicians targeted a TSH ≤ 3.0 mIU/L in 30-year-old patients. Fifty-three percent of respondents targeted a TSH ≤ 3.0 mIU/L in octogenarians, but 90% targeted a TSH > 1.5 mIU/L in this group. Regardless of gender, physician-reported TSH goal ranges (0.1 to 0.5, 0.6 to 1.5, 1.6 to 3.0, and 3.1 to 5.0 mIU/L) increased in a direct relationship to patient age (P < .001).

Conclusion

Just over half of physicians consider patient age when determining TSH goal. When presented with scenarios differing in patient age and gender, physicians targeted a higher TSH goal in octogenarians. This may indicate an attempt to avoid overtreatment in this group. Consensus is needed among physicians regarding the role of patient age in hypothyroidism management.

### Thyroid dysfunction in the elderly [^09ea4246]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is common in the general population, and mild or subclinical forms can be present in more than 10% of individuals aged > 80 years. The diagnosis of abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations in people aged > 60 years poses a challenge, as the clinical presentation of thyroid dysfunction is usually nonspecific, and ageing is associated with a number of physiological changes that can affect thyroid function test results. Furthermore, the presence of acute or chronic nonthyroidal illnesses and the use of medications that interfere with thyroid function tests are common confounders in the determination of thyroid status in the elderly. Early diagnosis and treatment of overt thyroid dysfunction is crucial in this population in view of the marked effects of abnormal circulating thyroid hormone levels on a number of organ systems, including the heart, the skeleton and the neurological system. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity remains uncertain, and the need for treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. A number of large epidemiological studies have identified associations between mild thyroid dysfunction and short-term as well as long-term adverse outcomes, and a small but increasing number of randomized controlled intervention studies have been reported. Guidelines recommend treatment of thyroid dysfunction on the basis of the degree of abnormal serum TSH concentrations, patient age and associated comorbidities. This Review describes the current evidence on the prevalence, diagnosis, management and long-term consequences of thyroid dysfunction in the elderly.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^b2bf2570]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

### Stopping thyroid hormone replacement in the elderly… [^75065d68]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of hypothyroidism in both studies was confirmed by a thyroid-stimulating hormone level above 10 μU per mL. Previously published research data indicated that many patients from community-dwelling settings were taking thyroid hormone replacement therapy inappropriately. Some elderly patients may have begun therapy before new assays for TSH were available or as treatment for fatigue, hair loss or hyperlipidemia. Coll and Abourizk recently performed a study to determine if thyroid hormone replacement therapy could be withdrawn from adult patients without producing any adverse effects. A TSH assay was obtained for eligible patients, and those with a level above 7 μU per mL were excluded from the study. Patients with a TSH level below 7 μU per mL had their current dosage of thyroid hormone reduced by as close to one half as practical. Twenty-two patients were ultimately included in the study.

Their mean age was 78 years, and 20 participants were women. On completion of the study, 11 of the 22 participants were successfully withdrawn from thyroid replacement therapy. Patients who were taking more than 50 μg per day of thyroid hormone were more likely to exhibit a significant increase in TSH level following dosage reduction. The authors conclude from the results of this study that thyroid hormone therapy can be withdrawn in a significant number of nursing home patients. Their findings are similar to those from studies of patients in community-based settings. The authors note * that it was previously reported that over-treating with thyroid hormone may adversely affect patients' myocardial contractility and decrease bone density. editor's note: This study should encourage physicians who care for elderly patients — especially those in nursing homes — to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism by appropriate use of a sensitive TSH assay.

One of the geriatricians in our practice has taken this a step further and at times has boldly suggested stopping all medications in select elderly patients, many of whom are concurrently taking 10 or more prescription and over-the-counter medications, and reassessing which medications they truly need. — j. t. k.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

Subclinical hypothyroidism — observational treatment and cohort findings include that in a U.K. general practitioner database of over 3000 individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH between 5.01 and 10 mIU/L) aged between 40 and 70 years and over 1500 individuals older than 70 years followed for a median of ~8 years, the ~50% treated group (87.4% women) had a reduced hazard ratio for ischemic heart disease events compared to untreated (~50%; 82.5% women) (0.61, CI 0.49–0.92), but this reduction was not evident in those older than 70 years (84.6% vs 75.6% women); additional cohorts reported increased risk with TSH levels of 10 mIU/L or greater and with TSH values between 6 and 15 mIU/L, including 3000 patients 65 years or older and across 11 prospective cohorts, with increased heart failure in six prospective cohorts with over 2000 patients up to 80 years of age.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^cc6ebde5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### How should we manage patients with mildly increased serum thyrotrophin concentrations? [^61739e45]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

A mildly increased serum thyrotrophin (TSH) is usually because of mild thyroid failure, and the most common aetiology in iodine-replete communities is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. It is more common in women, and the prevalence increases with age in both men and women and is associated with the presence of antithyroid antibodies. The majority will have serum TSH levels between 5–10 mIU/l, normal free thyroxine (T4) levels and relatively few symptoms. In 2004, US evidence-based consensus guidelines concluded that there were no adverse outcomes of a mildly increased serum TSH other than a risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and few data to justify levothyroxine therapy. There is still debate as to what constitutes an increased serum TSH, particularly in older subjects. Although some subjects will progress to overt hypothyroidism, recent data suggest a significant proportion revert to a serum TSH within the reference range without treatment. Two recent meta-analyses have suggested that the possible cardiovascular risks may be more significant in younger adults. Other data suggest that mild thyroid failure may be the only reversible cause of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. No appropriately powered prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded interventional trial of levothyroxine therapy for a mildly increased serum TSH exists. However, treatment in subjects who are symptomatic, pregnant or preconception, aged less than 65 years and older subjects with evidence of heart failure appear justified.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^318324c9]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### Management practices among primary care physicians and thyroid specialists in the care of hypothyroid patients [^0ffe6203]. Thyroid (2001). Low credibility.

Prospective studies are not available to address various issues commonly encountered in the management of hypothyroid patients. We have conducted a case-based mail survey of American Thyroid Association (ATA) members and primary care providers (PCP) regarding hypothyroidism management issues. A majority of ATA members and a minority of PCPs used antithyroid antibody testing in the evaluation of hypothyroidism. Approximately 2/3 of all respondents indicated that they would treat patients with mild thyroid failure when antithyroid antibodies are negative; 77% of PCPs and 95% of ATA members recommended treatment when antibodies are positive. For a young patient with mild thyroid failure, 71% of ATA members would initiate a full levothyroxine (LT4) replacement dose of 1.6 microg/kg per day or slightly lower; PCPs were more likely to start with a low dose and titrate upwards. For a young patient with overt hypothyroidism, 42% of PCPs and 51% of ATA respondents recommended an initial full LT4 replacement dose. The majority of all respondents would start with a low LT4 dose and adjust the dose gradually in an elderly patient, regardless of the severity of thyroid hormone deficiency. More than 40% of ATA respondents chose a target thyrotropin (TSH) range of 0.5–2.0 microU/mL for a young patient while 39% favored a goal of 1.0–4.0 microU/mL for an elderly patient. PCPs more often chose a broader TSH goal of 0.5–5.0 microU/mL. In conclusion, the current practice patterns of PCPs and ATA members that were elicited in this survey differ significantly in regard to the evaluation and management of hypothyroidism.

Excessive levothyroxine (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis) — harms and threshold: "The deleterious health effects of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis include atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis". Accordingly, "we recommend avoiding thyroid hormone excess and subnormal serum thyrotropin values, particularly thyrotropin values below 0.1 mIU/L, especially in older persons and postmenopausal women. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence". Over-treatment is common; "In one study of older individuals taking LT4, 36% of patients over age 65 years had a subnormal serum TSH (233)". Adverse outcomes increase when "serum TSH < 0.1 mIU/L", including atrial fibrillation: "patients older than age 65 years with serum TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L… had a threefold increase in the risk of atrial fibrillation over a 10-year observation period". Skeletal risks are higher in postmenopausal women, "especially if the serum TSH levels are undetectable", and cardiovascular, dysrhythmia, and fracture admissions and deaths "were higher for those with suppressed TSH values".

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

Conclusion

Treated hypothyroid patients require regular clinical and biochemical surveillance. Annual surveillance is currently recommended with no evidence to support this practice. Our study has shown that 18 monthly surveillance may be adequate in the long term follow-up of patients less than 60 years of age on a stable thyroxine dose of 100–150 μg/day. Implementing this strategy has potential for cost saving and reduction of workload in health services.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^eedaa8c8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- **Epidemiology**: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- **Disease course**: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

### Is subclinical hypothyroidism a cardiovascular risk factor in the elderly? [^3801fa1e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

The negative impact of subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT) on cardiovascular risk, widely recognized in young adults (aged < 55–60 y), is still debated in the elderly (> 65 y), especially in the oldest olds (> 80 y).

Evidence Acquisition

We searched Medline for reports published with the following search terms: "hypothyroidism", "subclinical hypothyroidism", "ageing", "elderly", "L-thyroxin", "thyroid", "guidelines", "treatment", "quality of life", "cardiovascular risk", "heart failure", "coronary heart disease" (CHD), "atherosclerosis", and "endothelial dysfunction". We limited our search to reports in English published after 1980, although we incorporated some reports published before 1980. We supplemented the search with records from personal files, textbooks, and relevant articles. Analyzed parameters included the epidemiology of thyroid failure, the effect of thyroid hormone on the aging process, cardiovascular function, and CHD risk factors. We also included the potential benefits of L-T4 therapy on the quality of life, cardiovascular events, and survival.

Evidence Synthesis

TSH levels increase with age, even in older people without thyroid disease. Most longitudinal studies show an increased risk for CHD events and mortality in sHT participants. This increase is less evident in the elderly, mainly in cases of serum TSH values above 10 mIU/L. Lower mortality rate in a cohort of the oldest olds (> 85 y) has been reported.

Conclusions

sHT in older people should be not regarded as a unique condition, and moderately old patients (aged < 70–75 y) could be considered clinically similar to the adult population, albeit with a higher optimal TSH target value. Conversely, the oldest old subjects should be carefully followed with a wait-and-see strategy, generally avoiding hormonal treatment. The decision to treat elderly people is still an unresolved clinical challenge — first, due to a lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials of L-T4 in sHT patients, examining cardiovascular hard endpoints in various classes of age; and second, because of the negative effects of possible overtreatment.

### Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists statement-replacement therapy for primary hypothyroidism: a brief guide for clinical practice [^ff65aacc]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothyroidism requires life-long thyroid hormone replacement therapy in most patients. Oral levothyroxine (LT4) is an established safe and effective treatment for hypothyroidism, but some issues remain unsettled.

Methods

The Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists appointed a panel of experts to provide an updated statement for appropriate use of thyroid hormone formulations for hypothyroidism replacement therapy. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists' protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines was followed.

Results

LT4 is the first choice in replacement therapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be maintained between 1.0 and 3.0 mIU/L in young subjects and at the upper normal limit in elderly or fragile patients. Achievement of biochemical targets, patient well-being, and adherence to treatment should be addressed. In patients with unstable serum TSH, a search for interfering factors and patient compliance is warranted. Liquid or gel formulations may be considered in subjects with hampered LT4 absorption or who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals and LT4 replacement. Replacement therapy with LT4 and L-triiodothyronine (LT3) combination is generally not recommended. A trial may be considered in patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism only after co-existent nonthyroid problems have been excluded or optimally managed. LT3 should be administered in small (LT4:LT3 ratio, 10:1 to 20:1) divided daily doses. Combined therapy should be avoided in elderly patients or those with cardiac risk factors and in pregnancy.

Conclusion
