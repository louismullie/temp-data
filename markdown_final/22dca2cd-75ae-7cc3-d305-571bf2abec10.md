## Question

A 29-year-old woman with a 5-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to your clinic expressing her desire to become pregnant within the next year. She has not yet achieved optimal glycemic control and has not previously received any specific counseling regarding pregnancy. She asks what steps she should take before conceiving and what kind of healthcare team she should expect to be involved in her care. Additionally, you are seeing a 32-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 26 weeks' gestation. She lives in a rural area and asks about the possibility of using telehealth for some of her diabetes management visits.

Based on current guidelines, what interprofessional team members should be involved in the preconception care of the first patient, and what is the recommended approach to visit types (in-person vs. telehealth) for the management of gestational diabetes in the second patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about preconception care for a 29-year-old with type 1 diabetes and telehealth use for gestational diabetes management in a rural patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core preconception goals and glycemic targets. Then, I should verify the recommended interprofessional team and their roles. Next, I will outline a practical preconception checklist and medication review. After that, I need to consider implementation and equity barriers. Finally, I will evaluate telehealth for GDM, including evidence, logistics, and safety considerations, and close with a concise, actionable plan for both patients.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stakes and glycemic targets for preconception type 1 diabetes. Poor glycemic control before and during early gestation increases risks of congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, so the goal is to achieve an A1C as close to normal as safely possible, ideally less than 6.5% before conception, while avoiding hypoglycemia, and to maintain even tighter targets during pregnancy when feasible [^0df7dbbb] [^a8eb48c9] [^30767b3d].

> I need to verify the interprofessional team composition. Current ADA Standards recommend interprofessional preconception care that includes an endocrinology healthcare professional, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, a registered dietitian nutritionist, and a certified diabetes care and education specialist, with additional team members as appropriate such as ophthalmology, nephrology, cardiology, behavioral health, pharmacy, and primary care, and this team-based approach is echoed by endocrine society guidance emphasizing multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes [^2aeadcd3] [^251fe00e] [^d2a1c23b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about roles without specifying them. The endocrinologist leads glycemic optimization, insulin regimen adjustments, and technology decisions; maternal-fetal medicine coordinates obstetric risk stratification, surveillance, and delivery planning; the dietitian provides nutrition counseling to support A1C targets and pregnancy nutrition; the diabetes educator delivers self-management training and preconception education; ophthalmology screens for retinopathy; nephrology assesses kidney function; behavioral health addresses anxiety, depression, and fear of hypoglycemia; pharmacy reviews teratogenic medications; and primary care ensures vaccinations, folate, and general health maintenance are up to date [^2aeadcd3] [^251fe00e] [^a0c62616] [^fbdcdf10].

> Next, I should review a practical preconception checklist. I need to ensure we cover shared decision-making about timing and contraception until A1C is at goal, medication reconciliation to stop teratogens like ACE inhibitors, ARBs, statins, and some noninsulin agents, initiation of folic acid 5 mg daily for those with diabetes, screening for retinopathy, nephropathy, hypertension, thyroid disease, and cardiovascular risk, vaccination updates per ACOG, and a plan for intensified glucose monitoring with consideration of CGM and pump or hybrid closed-loop if appropriate, all aligned with ADA and endocrine guidance [^21c849c3] [^a8eb48c9] [^e7b9ac7d].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for team-based preconception care. Observational and meta-analytic data show that structured preconception care is associated with substantially lower first-trimester A1C and a marked reduction in congenital anomalies, supporting the value of this multidisciplinary approach despite the limited RCT data, and implementation studies highlight feasibility with attention to barriers and equity [^4c93e0c1] [^1b4830c8].

> I should double-check implementation and equity considerations. Barriers include limited access to specialty teams, time constraints, cost, and psychosocial factors; solutions include proactive screening for pregnancy intention at every visit, direct referrals, telehealth for education and some consultations, and navigation support, with particular attention to underserved populations to reduce disparities in preconception and pregnancy outcomes [^41fac789] [^b930b20f] [^ea78bcc5].

> Now, for the second patient with GDM at 26 weeks in a rural setting, I need to check the stance on telehealth. ADA 2025 explicitly recognizes that telehealth visits combined with in-person care can improve outcomes compared with in-person care alone for GDM, and this is supported by broader diabetes standards endorsing coordinated telehealth within team-based care, especially relevant for rural access and continuity [^35eac48c] [^42c9cfb7] [^fbdcdf10].

> Let me consider the practical mix of visits. A reasonable approach is alternating in-person and telehealth visits, reserving in-person visits for initial assessment, glucose meter or CGM setup, medication initiation or titration, and any urgent issues, while using telehealth for follow-up counseling, glucose review, and lifestyle support; this hybrid model maintains clinical oversight while reducing travel burden and has been associated with improved engagement and outcomes in GDM programs [^35eac48c] [^42c9cfb7].

> But wait, what about safety and logistics. I should confirm that patients have reliable home glucose monitoring, clear escalation criteria, and access to prompt in-person care if targets are not met or if there are red flags; telehealth workflows should include secure data sharing, structured education, and a plan for insulin initiation if lifestyle fails to achieve glycemic goals, consistent with GDM management standards [^4b98a477] [^b24de7ea].

> In summary, for the 29-year-old with type 1 diabetes, I recommend establishing a multidisciplinary preconception team now, targeting A1C less than 6.5% before conception, completing a structured preconception checklist, and addressing barriers proactively. For the 32-year-old with GDM in a rural area, I recommend a hybrid model with telehealth integrated alongside in-person visits to improve access and outcomes, with explicit safety protocols and escalation plans [^2aeadcd3] [^0df7dbbb] [^35eac48c] [^42c9cfb7].

For the 29-year-old with type 1 diabetes planning pregnancy, the preconception team should include **endocrinology, maternal-fetal medicine, a registered dietitian, and a certified diabetes care and education specialist** to optimize glycemic control, screen for complications, and provide education and contraception until A1C is < 6.5% [^2aeadcd3] [^0df7dbbb] [^a0c62616]. For the 32-year-old with GDM at 26 weeks, **telehealth combined with in-person visits is recommended** to improve access, engagement, and outcomes, with in-person visits for initial assessment, medication starts, and urgent issues, and telehealth for follow-up, education, and glucose review [^35eac48c] [^42c9cfb7] [^a726030e].

## Preconception care for type 1 diabetes mellitus

### Essential steps before conception

- **Optimize glycemic control**: Target A1C < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) to reduce congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, macrosomia, and preterm birth [^0df7dbbb] [^a0c62616].
- **Medication review**: Discontinue teratogenic drugs (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, statins) and adjust insulin regimens [^a8eb48c9] [^0bb0a9a5].
- **Screen for complications**: Retinopathy, nephropathy, hypertension, and thyroid dysfunction [^a8eb48c9] [^21c849c3].
- **Folic acid supplementation**: 5 mg daily to reduce neural tube defects [^902bd4f4].
- **Contraception**: Use effective contraception until A1C is optimized [^a0c62616] [^d2a1c23b].

### Benefits of multidisciplinary preconception care

Multidisciplinary preconception care is associated with **lower A1C at the first prenatal visit** and a **reduced risk of congenital anomalies** [^4c93e0c1]. It also improves adherence to glycemic targets and enhances patient engagement and self-management [^notfound].

---

## Management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with telehealth

### Current guidelines on telehealth for GDM

Current ADA guidance recommends **telehealth combined with in-person visits** for GDM management, as this approach can improve outcomes compared with in-person care alone [^35eac48c] [^42c9cfb7]. Telehealth is particularly beneficial for rural patients, improving access, engagement, and adherence [^notfound].

---

### Recommended approach to visit types

- **Initial assessment**: In-person visit for baseline assessment, glucose monitoring setup, and education [^notfound].
- **Follow-up visits**: Telehealth for routine follow-up, glucose review, and lifestyle counseling [^notfound].
- **Urgent issues**: In-person visits for medication adjustments, severe hyperglycemia, or complications [^notfound].

---

### Benefits of telehealth for GDM management

Telehealth offers **improved access** — especially for rural patients — and supports **enhanced patient engagement** through convenient, flexible care [^notfound]. It also enables timely adjustments and closer monitoring, which can improve glycemic control and reduce adverse outcomes [^notfound].

---

### Limitations and considerations

Key limitations include **technology barriers** (internet access, digital literacy) and the need for **clinical judgment** to determine when in-person care is required. Privacy and security must also be ensured [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Preconception care**: A multidisciplinary team (endocrinology, maternal-fetal medicine, dietitian, diabetes educator) is essential for optimizing outcomes in type 1 diabetes [^2aeadcd3].
- **GDM management**: Telehealth combined with in-person visits is recommended to improve access, engagement, and outcomes, especially in rural settings [^35eac48c] [^42c9cfb7].
- **Individualized care**: Tailor the care plan to patient preferences, resources, and clinical needs to maximize effectiveness [^da26461b].

---

These recommendations align with current ADA and endocrine society guidelines and emphasize **coordinated, patient-centered care** to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.

### Type 1 diabetes: management in women from preconception to postpartum [^2ac6bd41]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

This review presents an up-to-date summary on management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) among women of reproductive age and covers the following time periods: preconception, gestation, and postpartum.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic search and review of the literature for randomized controlled trials and other studies evaluating management of T1DM before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and postpartum was performed.

Evidence Synthesis

Preconception planning should begin early in the reproductive years for young women with T1DM. Preconception and during pregnancy, it is recommended to have near-normal glucose values to prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including fetal demise, congenital anomaly, pre-eclampsia, macrosomia, neonatal respiratory distress, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

Women with T1DM can have healthy, safe pregnancies with preconception planning, optimal glycemic control, and multidisciplinary care.

1.0 Preconception care of women with diabetes

Preconception counseling

1.1. We recommend that preconception counseling be provided to all women with diabetes who are considering pregnancy. (1|⊕⊕○○)

1.1. Evidence

Women with diabetes who receive preconception counseling have better preconception glycemic control and are more likely to have favorable pregnancy outcomes, including lower rates of congenital anomalies and spontaneous abortions. By the time that a woman knows she is pregnant, much fetal organogenesis has typically been completed.

1.1. Remarks

Preconception counseling can optimally be provided by a multidisciplinary team that includes the diabetes specialist, diabetes educator, dietitian, obstetrician, and other healthcare providers, as indicated. If possible, and with the patient's consent, the woman's partner can be included as part of a supportive and mentoring therapeutic relationship. Preconception counseling should include a discussion regarding 1) the need for pregnancy to be planned and to occur only when the woman has sufficient glycemic control, has had appropriate assessment and management of comorbidities including hypertension and retinopathy, has discontinued potentially unsafe (during pregnancy) medications, and has been taking appropriate folate supplementation beforehand (see the recommendations and evidence that follow in this section); 2) the importance of smoking cessation; 3) the major time commitment and effort required by the patient in both self-management and engagement with the healthcare team, both preconceptionally and during pregnancy; and 4) the importance of notifying the healthcare team without delay in the event of conception.

Preconception glycemic control

1.2. We suggest that women with diabetes seeking to conceive strive to achieve blood glucose and HbA1C levels as close to normal as possible when they can be safely achieved without undue hypoglycemia. (2|⊕⊕○○) (See Recommendations 3.2a–d.)

Abstract

Objective

Our objective was to formulate a clinical practice guideline for the management of the pregnant woman with diabetes.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, 5 additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and innumerable e-mail communications enabled consensus for all recommendations save one with a majority decision being employed for this single exception.

Conclusions

Using an evidence-based approach, this Diabetes and Pregnancy Clinical Practice Guideline addresses important clinical issues in the contemporary management of women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes preconceptionally, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum setting and in the diagnosis and management of women with gestational diabetes during and after pregnancy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to postpartum care (general principles), ES/ESE 2025 guidelines recommend to consider providing postpartum endocrine care, including diabetes management, for patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus, including those with pregnancy loss or termination, in addition to usual obstetric care:

- prioritize immediate postpartum care for patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus to manage glycemic levels, support healing, promote lactation, and facilitate the transition to interpregnancy and long-term diabetes management, in addition to routine obstetric care

- deliver postpartum diabetes care through a multidisciplinary team that includes physicians specializing in diabetes and/or endocrinology, as well as nurses, dietitians, and certified diabetes care and education specialists; ensure this team supports ongoing, long-term established follow-up

- recognize that postpartum care often serves as preconception care for a future pregnancy; approximately half of all deliveries occur among patients who already have at least one child, highlighting the opportunity for postpartum care to contribute meaningfully to preconception care.

Abstract

Background

Preexisting diabetes (PDM) increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to and during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that preconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, reduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy outcomes demonstrated in real-world data highlight the need to further optimize prenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve that goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM. The increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the importance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing medications during prenatal care for PDM.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that lead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.

Methods

The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant questions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and after pregnancy. The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment options, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations.

Results

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, where PCC — including contraception as a key component — showed a clinically significant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate of congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy terminations with the use of contraception.

In individuals with T2DM, we suggest discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on limited data on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy.

In pregnant individuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for gestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the risk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related to changes in body composition.

In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a carbohydrate-restricted diet (< 175 g/day) or usual diet (> 175 g/day) during pregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the available evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate intake cutoff of 175 g/day.

In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting superiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals with T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes for individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals with T2DM.

In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a single 24-hour CGM target < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting < 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L).

In individuals with T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated improvement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI −4.24 to 11.86) and reduced time below range (MD −0.85%; CI −1.98 to 0.28) with the use of hybrid closed-loop pump technology.

In individuals with PDM, we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing.

In individuals with PDM (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.

Conclusion

The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low certainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM and their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research on timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.

The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment options, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations.

Results

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations. In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, where PCC-including contraception as a key component-showed a clinically significant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate of congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy terminations with the use of contraception. In individuals with T2DM, we suggest discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on limited data on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy. In pregnant individuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for gestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the risk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related to changes in body composition. In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a carbohydrate-restricted diet (< 175g/day) or usual diet (> 175g/day) during pregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the available evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate intake cutoff of 175g/day. In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting superiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals with T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes for individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals with T2DM. In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a single 24-hour CGM target < 140mg/dL (7.8mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting < 95mg/dL (5.3mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial < 140mg/dL (7.8mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7mmol/L) (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126mg/dL (7mmol/L). In individuals with T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated improvement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI -4.24 to 11.86) and reduced time below range (MD -0.85%; CI -1.98 to 0.28) with the use of hybrid closed-loop pump technology. In individuals with PDM, we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing. In individuals with PDM (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.

Conclusion

The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low certainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM and their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research on timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.

### Updates in the management of type 1 diabetes in pregnancy [^67720f5f]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The care of pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus has experienced significant advancements in recent years. Preconception counseling has re-emerged as a core dimension of management. Continuous glucose monitoring plays an increasingly useful and beneficial role in gestational glycemic monitoring, a practice informed by improved maternofetal outcomes. While studies have not shown that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is superior to multiple daily injections of insulin for glycemic control, recent work has signaled that hybrid closed-loop systems with pregnancy-specific targets could meaningfully improve glycemic control and potentially ameliorate maternofetal outcomes while reducing self-care burden.

### Management of pregnant and postnatal women with pre-existing diabetes or cardiac disease using multi-disciplinary team models of care: a systematic review [^6d83532e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetes

Pre-pregnancy planning was considered in three papers for women with pre-existing diabetes. The Cochrane review of pre-conception care for diabetic women reported evidence of benefit was equivocal, based on one small trial with 53 women, and recommended need for further large trials. The CEMACH national enquiry into diabetes in pregnancy highlighted the importance of women having access to a pre-conception service with a MDT to minimise the risk of fetal malformation. It recommended that MDTs should include as a minimum, an obstetrician, diabetes physician, diabetes specialist nurse, diabetes midwife and dietician. Of the 442 women whose cases were reviewed by the enquiry, 28% had attended for preconception care in an adult diabetes clinic, 15% with their GP and 26% in a hospital-based MDT clinic but it was unclear if this included a maternity component. No information on pre-conception care was available for just under a third of cases reviewed. The enquiry panel assessors found that 73% of 267 women (87% of 133 cases and 60% of 134 controls) had received suboptimal preconception care, defined by panel assessors as lack of: pre-conception advice, contraceptive advice, provision of higher dose folic acid, appropriate screening and management of diabetes complications and MDT involvement. Women who received suboptimal preconception care were more likely to have a poor pregnancy outcome (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.7–10.1, adjusted for maternal age and deprivation) with additional case–control analysis showing an association with fetal congenital anomaly.

The NICE guidance for diabetes in pregnancy and the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society consensus guidelines for the management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy also recommended that women planning pregnancy should be offered pre-conception care and advice to raise awareness of potential problems. NICE diabetes guidance recommended a structured education programme, with pregnant women offered immediate contact with a joint diabetic and antenatal clinic but did not define the structure or membership of such a clinic or how often it should meet. McElduff et al. cited the meta analysis by Ray et al. reporting a significantly lower prevalence of major congenital abnormalities in the babies of diabetic women who attended pre-pregnancy counselling, compared to those who did not attend (Relative Risk 0.36; 95% CI, 0.22–0.59; absolute risk, 2.1% v 6.5%).

### Effectiveness of a regional prepregnancy care program in women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: benefits beyond glycemic control [^b8e453d9]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We documented the potentially modifiable risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and established an interdisciplinary regional prepregnancy care team. We also performed a qualitative study to identify women's barriers to accessing prepregnancy care, namely beliefs that strict glycemic targets were unrealistic, poor relationships with health professionals, and desire for a less-medicalized pregnancy.

Prepregnancy care promotion

A theoretically guided preconception leaflet (the East Anglican Study for Improving Pregnancy Outcomes in Women with Diabetes [EASIPOD] leaflet) with advice and telephone contacts for a prepregnancy care coordinator was mailed annually to all women aged 16–45 years identified from specialist and primary-care diabetes registers. We targeted health professionals including nurses, general practitioners, retinal-screening teams, health visitors, midwives, community pharmacists, and disseminated information via pharmacist medicine use reviews, structured education programs, local enhanced service agreements, and patient support groups.

Prepregnancy and antenatal care delivery

Prior to pregnancy, women with type 2 diabetes were predominantly cared for by primary-care teams in community settings and women with type 1 diabetes by specialist teams in hospital settings. Referrals were accepted from specialist providers, primary care, and directly from women who received the EASIPOD leaflet. Prepregnancy care was delivered in specialist clinics without additional funding using a standardized proforma (see the online appendix, available at). The content was standardized throughout the study period (10 January 2006 through 31 September 2009) but delivered by different health care providers (diabetes physician, specialist nurse, midwife, or obstetrician). Joint clinics with diabetes and obstetric input were held in three larger units (≥ 30 deliveries per year), whereas smaller units provided appointments with individual nurses or physicians. The same specialist multidisciplinary health care teams provided antenatal care to women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during pregnancy.

Data collection

Pregnancies were registered as soon as contact with the antenatal team was established. A data collection proforma was completed for all registered pregnancies within 3 months of pregnancy completion. The project coordinator facilitated timely data collection, validation of data, and entry onto a study database.

### Preconception care for diabetic women for improving maternal and infant health [^e0a8dd9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Infants born to mothers with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of congenital anomalies, perinatal mortality and significant morbidity in the short and long term. Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes are at greater risk of perinatal morbidity and diabetic complications. The relationship between glycaemic control and health outcomes for both mothers and infants indicates the potential for preconception care for these women to be of benefit. This is an update of the original review, which was first published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects of preconception care in women with diabetes on health outcomes for mothers and their infants.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (31 January 2017) and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of preconception care for diabetic women. Cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We checked data for accuracy and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 254 adolescent girls with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with an overall unclear to high risk of bias. The three trials were conducted at diabetes clinics in the USA, and assessed the READY-Girls (Reproductive-health Education and Awareness of Diabetes in Youth for Girls) programme versus standard care. Considering primary outcomes, one trial reported no pregnancies in the trial period (12 months) (very low-quality evidence, with downgrading based on study limitations (risk of bias) and imprecision); in the other two trials, pregnancy was an exclusion criterion, or was not clearly reported on. None of the trials reported on the other primary maternal outcomes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and caesarean section; or primary infant outcomes, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, death or morbidity composite, or congenital malformations. Similarly, none of the trials reported on the secondary outcomes, for which we had planned to assess the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (maternal: induction of labour; perineal trauma; gestational weight gain; long-term cardiovascular health; infant: adiposity; type 1 or 2 diabetes; neurosensory disability). The majority of secondary maternal and infant outcomes, and outcomes relating to the use and costs of health services were not reported by the three included trials. Regarding behaviour changes associated with the intervention, in one trial, participants in the preconception care group had a slightly higher score for the actual initiation of discussion regarding preconception care with healthcare providers at follow-up (nine months), compared with those in the standard care group (mean difference 0.40, 95% confidence interval -0.02 to 0.82 (on a scale of 0 to 4 points); participants = 87) (a summation of four dichotomous items; possible range 0 to 4, with 0 being no discussion).

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient RCT data available to assess the effects of preconception care for diabetic women on health outcomes for mothers and their infants. More high-quality evidence is needed to determine the effects of different protocols of preconception care for diabetic women. Future trials should be powered to evaluate effects on short- and long-term maternal and infant outcomes, and outcomes relating to the use and costs of health services. We have identified three ongoing studies that we will consider in the next review update.

### Call to action for a life course approach [^b7067fd3]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Gestational diabetes remains the most common medical disorder in pregnancy, with short-term and long-term consequences for mothers and offspring. New insights into pathophysiology and management suggest that the current gestational diabetes treatment approach should expand from a focus on late gestational diabetes to a personalised, integrated life course approach from preconception to postpartum and beyond. Early pregnancy lifestyle intervention could prevent late gestational diabetes. Early gestational diabetes diagnosis and treatment has been shown to be beneficial, especially when identified before 14 weeks of gestation. Early gestational diabetes screening now requires strategies for integration into routine antenatal care, alongside efforts to reduce variation in gestational diabetes care, across settings that differ between, and within, countries. Following gestational diabetes, an oral glucose tolerance test should be performed 6–12 weeks postpartum to assess the glycaemic state. Subsequent regular screening for both dysglycaemia and cardiometabolic disease is recommended, which can be incorporated alongside other family health activities. Diabetes prevention programmes for women with previous gestational diabetes might be enhanced using shared decision making and precision medicine. At all stages in this life course approach, across both high-resource and low-resource settings, a more systematic process for identifying and overcoming barriers to preventative care and treatment is needed to reduce the current global burden of gestational diabetes.

Recommendation 10

In individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remark
In addition to routine obstetric care, immediate postpartum care for individuals with PDM should prioritize glycemic management to support healing, promote lactation, and facilitate the transition to interpregnancy and long-term diabetes management.
Ideally, postpartum diabetes care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team that includes physicians specializing in diabetes and/or endocrinology, as well as nurses, dietitians, and certified diabetes care and education specialists. This team should also support ongoing, long-term established follow-up.
In many cases, postpartum care also serves as preconception care (PCC) for a future pregnancy. Approximately half of all deliveries occur among individuals who already have at least one child, highlighting the opportunity for postpartum care to contribute meaningfully to PCC. There is strong evidence that preconception care improves several pregnancy outcomes in individuals with PDM.

### Management of diabetes mellitus complicating pregnancy [^0059a38b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus complicates 3–5% of all pregnancies and is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality, as well as maternal morbidity. The availability of a variety of new insulins, the insulin pump, and self-monitoring of blood glucose have revolutionized the care of the pregnancy complicated by diabetes mellitus. However, challenges remain in caring for the pregnant patient with pregestational diabetes. Relatively few women receive preconceptional counseling, and major fetal malformations as a result of poor glucose control before and during the early weeks of gestation have emerged as the major cause of perinatal mortality. When the patient has diabetic vasculopathy, the obstetrician, maternal-fetal specialist, and/or endocrinologist and other members of the health care team must perform a challenging balancing act that promotes fetal health while minimizing maternal risk. As obesity increases in this country and our population becomes more diversified, the rate of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) will rise. Although there is controversy regarding which diagnostic standards to use for GDM, there is agreement that excellent blood glucose control, with diet and, when necessary, insulin will result in improved perinatal outcome. Finally, the goal of our educational programs should be not only to improve pregnancy outcome but also to promote healthy lifestyle changes for the mother that will last long after delivery.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^269c5ccd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes in pregnancy guideline summary — prevalence, risks, preconception care, and technology: Using an evidence-based approach, this guideline addresses management of individuals with preexisting type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus across the preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum periods. The prevalence of preexisting diabetes mellitus has grown exponentially in the last 2 decades, with increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes including preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, macrosomia, and congenital defects. Preconception care is very important to minimize the risk of congenital defects and to maintain good glycemic control, and during pregnancy, pregnancy-specific diabetes care is required to reduce negative outcomes. Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump technology have shown benefit by simplifying glycemic monitoring and insulin administration; improvements in glycemia and perinatal outcomes have been reported with CGM compared with self-monitoring of blood glucose, and hybrid closed-loop pump systems combine CGM and insulin pump technologies with increasingly sophisticated algorithms. Optimization of glycemia, correct dietary advice, safe medication regimens, and careful attention to comorbid conditions can help mitigate risks and ensure quality diabetes care before, during, and after pregnancy.

### Pregestational diabetes in pregnancy [^e2dc3226]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a common chronic condition in women of reproductive age. Preconception care is crucial to reducing the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, such as hypertensive disorders, abnormal fetal growth, traumatic delivery and stillbirth, associated with poor glycemic control. Insulin is the preferred medication to optimize glucose control in women with pregestational diabetes. Frequent dose adjustments are needed during pregnancy to achieve glycemic goals, and team-based multidisciplinary care may help. Postpartum care should include lactation support, counseling on contraceptive options, and transition to primary care.

### Periconceptional care of women with diabetes mellitus [^f630c755]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Pregestational diabetes is a common complication of pregnancy that can be associated with severe maternal and fetal morbidity. In addition, some women could have progression of diabetic complications secondary to pregnancy. Preconception care can significantly reduce pregnancy complications with a dramatic impact on the diabetic mother and her infant. For those women whose condition could be hastened by conception education, better understanding and an improved decision should be available to them and their families. Because unplanned pregnancy is common among diabetic women, they should be counseled early for the importance of preconception care in the progression of this disease.

### Management of pregnant and postnatal women with pre-existing diabetes or cardiac disease using multi-disciplinary team models of care: a systematic review [^e8458ced]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

A Cochrane review of preconception care for diabetic women (based on one trial involving 53 women) which did not report on pre-specified areas of interest for the current review, was included, as was the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health national enquiry into diabetes in pregnancy and NICE guidance on management of diabetes in pregnancy. The CEMACH enquiry presented findings from three programmes of work: a survey of diabetes maternity services for women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; a descriptive study of 3808 pregnancies among women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the same UK countries, identified at booking between 2002 and 2003 with follow up to 28 days post-birth; and a national confidential enquiry including a case control analysis with cases selected from the descriptive study sample, to review demographic, social and lifestyle factors and clinical care in 442 pregnancies to women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and association with pregnancy outcome. A paper describing the national Australian consensus guidance on diabetes in pregnancy was also included. National guidance and consensus papers for cardiology included the RCOG good practice guideline and study group statement and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the management of cardiac disease in pregnancy. The following sections present the findings relevant to each of the primary and secondary review questions.

Primary questions

What models of management of pre-existing diabetes and cardiac disease in pregnant/postnatal women have been evaluated and what outcomes are they associated with?

No studies were identified which had evaluated models of management of pregnant or postnatal women with the conditions of interest. Studies which were included only referred to cardiac disease, and only to management and pregnancy outcome in single site settings. These provided a low level of evidence (level 3) and risk of bias from use of retrospective designs. None of the studies referred to women's experiences of care or impact on their psychological and other aspects of their physical health and well-being or health professionals' experiences of MDT care.

List of Recommendations

Question 1. Should a screening question about pregnancy intention vs no screening question be used in every healthcare provider appointment for individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant?

Recommendation 1

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent should also be addressed at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remarks
There are no data supporting a specific timing or frequency of screening.
A critical component of preconception care (PCC) is optimization of glycemia to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital malformations. The Guideline Development Panel suggests that for screening for pregnancy intent to be effective, 3 actions are required: Provision of basic counseling about the benefits of PCC Evaluation of contraception needs and/or family planning referral Referral for PCC to achieve goals of therapy
This recommendation applies to individuals with all types of PDM, including type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Question 2. Should contraception vs no contraception be used in individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant?

Recommendation 2

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | ⊕⊕OO).

Technical remark
Clinician counseling about contraception should be noncoercive and patient centered. Shared decision making should prioritize an individual's autonomy and be informed by the clinician's expertise.

Question 3. Should discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist before pregnancy vs glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester be used in individuals with preexisting type 2 diabetes?

Recommendation 3

In individuals with type 2 diabetes, we suggest discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO).

Women with diabetes who are contemplating pregnancy should be evaluated and, if indicated, treated for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and CVD. (E)

Major congenital malformations remain the leading cause of mortality and serious morbidity in infants of mothers with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Observational studies indicate that the risk of malformations increases continuously with increasing maternal glycemia during the first 6–8 weeks of gestation, as defined by first-trimester A1C concentrations. There is no threshold for A1C values below which risk disappears entirely. However, malformation rates above the 1–2% background rate of nondiabetic pregnancies appear to be limited to pregnancies in which first-trimester A1C concentrations are > 1% above the normal range for a nondiabetic pregnant woman.

Preconception care of diabetes appears to reduce the risk of congenital malformations. Five nonrandomized studies compared rates of major malformations in infants between women who participated in preconception diabetes care programs and women who initiated intensive diabetes management after they were already pregnant. The preconception care programs were multidisciplinary and designed to train patients in diabetes self-management with diet, intensified insulin therapy, and SMBG. Goals were set to achieve normal blood glucose concentrations, and > 80% of subjects achieved normal A1C concentrations before they became pregnant. In all five studies, the incidence of major congenital malformations in women who participated in preconception care (range 1.0–1.7% of infants) was much lower than the incidence in women who did not participate (range 1.4–10.9% of infants). One limitation of these studies is that participation in preconception care was self-selected rather than randomized. Thus, it is impossible to be certain that the lower malformation rates resulted fully from improved diabetes care. Nonetheless, the evidence supports the concept that malformations can be reduced or prevented by careful management of diabetes before pregnancy.

10 Postnatal and Interconception Care

The postpartum period provides a platform for preparing for a possible next pregnancy and identifying women with, or at higher risk of, NCDs such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or GDM, addressing contraceptive needs, reversal of excess gestational weight gain, and addressing nutritional requirements. 21, 75 For example, a study from the USA detected low rates of follow‐up glucose testing in women with GDM, especially in the postpartum period (5.8%), although this improved slightly after a year (21.8%) and at 3 years (51%). 76 Contact with primary care after delivery was also very low. Several experts have called for recognizing the importance of, and providing, continuity of care in the "fourth trimester" 77 taking into account the mother's physical and mental health in the postpartum period.

Key service providers for infant health such as pediatricians, general practitioners, and health visitors have an important role in discussing interconception health, not only for the next pregnancy but also for the long‐term health of the mother. Not addressing these issues before the next pregnancy, especially for mothers with a history of outcomes such as low birthweight or medical comorbidities, is a missed opportunity for improving the woman's health and outcomes of subsequent pregnancies. 75 FIGO recommends the extension of preconception care into the postpartum stage to increase the window of opportunity and access women with nutritional needs, thus providing an integrated continuum of care for women. 1, 77

Recommendation 1

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remarks
There are no data supporting a specific timing or frequency of screening.
A critical component of preconception care (PCC) is optimization of glycemia to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital malformations. The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) suggests that for screening for pregnancy intent to be effective, 3 actions are required: Provision of basic counseling about the benefits of PCC Evaluation of contraception needs and/or family planning referral Referral for PCC to achieve goals of therapy.
This recommendation applies to individuals with all types of PDM, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Summary of Evidence

The meta-analysis results, a detailed summary of the evidence, and Evidence to Decision (EtD) tables can be found online at:

Benefits and Harms

The systematic review did not identify any randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the effects of a screening question about pregnancy intention in individuals with diabetes on the following outcomes:

Contraception prescription
Referral for PCC
Unplanned pregnancy
Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit
Congenital malformations

The GDP found indirect evidence for the effects of PCC on HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations. The GDP also found indirect evidence for the benefits of a screening question asking about pregnancy intention and contraceptive use on documentation of contraceptive use but not on contraception prescribing. The GDP found no indirect evidence for the outcomes of unplanned pregnancy or referral for PCC.

The indirect evidence supporting this recommendation includes multiple studies that demonstrate the association of PCC on HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformation in individuals with diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 36 studies (34 cohort studies) with 8199 participants demonstrated that PCC was associated with a lower HbA1c in the first trimester by an average of −1.27% (mean difference, −1.27%; 95% CI: −1.33 to −1.22; 4927 participants; 24 studies; moderate certainty evidence) and with a lower rate of congenital malformations (risk ratio [RR], 0.29 [0.21–0.40]) with high certainty (25 studies; 5903 participants).

Specific Settings and Populations

Pregnancy

Preconception Counseling and Care

To minimize risks associated with pregnancy and type 1 diabetes, preconception counseling and care are critical. Preconception care with tight glycemic control improves outcomes including lower cesarean rates, decreased perinatal mortality, and decreased congenital malformations. Although there is some evidence that childbearing may be reduced, in general, fertility should be assumed to be normal, and all young women with type 1 diabetes should receive preconception counseling covering diabetes and general topics, including use of prenatal vitamin, discontinuation of potentially teratogenic medications, and the importance of glycemic control to reduce the risk of congenital malformations.

Preconception care (PCC) implementation in diabetes — feasibility, barriers, and facilitators: The implementation of the intervention was judged as likely feasible but with some challenges, and pregnancy planning is described as feasible by some women and as unrealistic by others, with clinicians reporting unease with contraception prescription in this population. A systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions aimed at improving post-partum contraception use in the general population reported limited success, with no difference in repeat pregnancies or induced abortions during the year following childbirth, leading the authors to conclude that more feasible strategies are needed. Policy changes including the US Affordable Care Act's elimination of cost sharing for contraception, the availability of OTC COCs, and the expanded prescribing by pharmacists will likely improve the PCC intervention in the United States. However, a recent quality initiative to provide PCC for women with T1DM and T2DM observed no difference in contraception prescription despite contraception being discussed more often during the visit, and most (80%) of health care clinicians identified inadequate time during visits as the main reason for not providing this care.

### The top 10 research priorities in diabetes and pregnancy according to women, support networks and healthcare professionals [^92862303]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Approximately one in every 10 women will experience a pregnancy complicated by either pre‐existing or gestational diabetes. Rates are increasing as a result of increased rates of obesity and pregnancy at a later age. Although most women have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies, diabetes increases the risk of complications during pregnancy and birth, and can have long‐term effects. Compared to the maternity population without diabetes, the risks are two to six times greater for adverse outcomes such as congenital anomalies, stillbirth, preterm birth, infant death within the first month of life, together with long‐term risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in both mothers and children.

Many pregnant women with diabetes report a lack or inconsistency of information, leaving many of their questions unanswered. National guidelines and high‐quality systematic reviews highlight variable quality, heterogeneity and reliability of research. Consequently, treatment guidelines are insufficiently evidenced in line with current context and available healthcare options. However, with limited funding and resources available for research, it is important to ensure that the research that is undertaken is of highest value and impact.

Healthcare research led by industry and researchers often does not address the issues that are most important for people living with the condition, or those who support them. The James Lind Alliance (JLA), a UK‐based initiative established in 2004, aims to address this mismatch. Through Priority Setting Partnerships (PSP), the JLA supports the identification of the research questions that matter most to patients and the healthcare professionals that care for them. Sharing the outputs of PSPs with health research funders helps to align the work they fund towards addressing the areas of need prioritised by those directly affected and involved.

Previous successful PSPs have been conducted in diabetes in the UK. The type 1 diabetes PSP identified two questions in pregnancy, but both fell outside the top 10 priorities: 'What impact do changing hormones, for example, during menstruation, pregnancy and menopause, have on blood glucose levels in women with type 1 diabetes?'; 'Is it safe to continue insulin analogues in preconception and pregnancy in type 1 diabetes? ' No priorities specific to pregnancy were identified in the type 2 diabetes PSP top 10. There have also been prioritisation exercises using different but overlapping methodology to PSPs in Canada and ​the USA but focussing on gestational diabetes. However, women's health and pregnancy, particularly in relation to diabetes, are not prioritised, despite being consistently identified as an area of much needed research.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^fbdcdf10]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this clinical practice guideline is to provide updated and new evidence-based recommendations for the comprehensive care of persons with diabetes mellitus to clinicians, diabetes-care teams, other health care professionals and stakeholders, and individuals with diabetes and their caregivers.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology selected a task force of medical experts and staff who updated and assessed clinical questions and recommendations from the prior 2015 version of this guideline and conducted literature searches for relevant scientific papers published from January 1, 2015, through May 15, 2022. Selected studies from results of literature searches composed the evidence base to update 2015 recommendations as well as to develop new recommendations based on review of clinical evidence, current practice, expertise, and consensus, according to established American Association of Clinical Endocrinology protocol for guideline development.

Results

This guideline includes 170 updated and new evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for the comprehensive care of persons with diabetes. Recommendations are divided into four sections: (1) screening, diagnosis, glycemic targets, and glycemic monitoring; (2) comorbidities and complications, including obesity and management with lifestyle, nutrition, and bariatric surgery, hypertension, dyslipidemia, retinopathy, neuropathy, diabetic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease; (3) management of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy and glycemic targets, type 1 diabetes with insulin therapy, hypoglycemia, hospitalized persons, and women with diabetes in pregnancy; (4) education and new topics regarding diabetes and infertility, nutritional supplements, secondary diabetes, social determinants of health, and virtual care, as well as updated recommendations on cancer risk, nonpharmacologic components of pediatric care plans, depression, education and team approach, occupational risk, role of sleep medicine, and vaccinations in persons with diabetes.

Conclusions

This updated clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to assist with person-centered, team-based clinical decision-making to improve the care of persons with diabetes mellitus.

Preconception counseling — Starting at puberty and continuing in all people with diabetes and child-bearing potential, preconception counseling should be incorporated into routine diabetes care. Family planning should be discussed, and effective contraception (with consideration of long-acting, reversible contraception) should be prescribed and used until an individual's treatment plan and A1C are optimized for pregnancy. Preconception counseling should address the importance of achieving glucose levels as close to normal as is safely possible, ideally A1C < 6.5% (< 48 mmol/mol), to reduce the risk of congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth, and other complications.

Preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) — postpartum care recommendation: In individuals with PDM (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management) in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕⊕OO). Technical remarks specify that immediate postpartum care for PDM should prioritize glycemic management, and that postpartum diabetes care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team including endocrinology/diabetes specialists, nurses, dietitians, and certified diabetes care and education specialists with long-term follow-up. Indirect evidence cited includes a meta-analysis of preconception care (PCC) showing reduced preterm delivery by 15% (risk ratio [RR] 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73–0.99), perinatal mortality (RR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.30–0.73), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions (RR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.67–0.84). In a retrospective Atlantic-DIP review, first-trimester HbA1c decreased (7.8% to 7.1%; P < .001), PCC uptake increased (49% vs 23%; P < .001), and congenital malformations decreased (5% to 1.8%; P = 0.04) after program initiation. Additional postpartum support evidence includes an RCT of hybrid closed-loop vs sensor-augmented pump therapy in which participants (n = 18) in the closed-loop arm had less time below range, 1.7% vs 5.5% (P < .001) and 0.3 vs 1.1% (P = 0.001), with no episodes of severe hyper- or hypoglycemia reported.

### Quality of guidelines on the management of diabetes in pregnancy: a systematic review [^7776cf93]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes during pregnancy can lead to severe risks for both mother and fetus when it is not managed properly. The use of rigorously developed guidelines with a robust implementation process can have a positive influence on the management of diabetes during pregnancy. This study aims to compare recommendations and assess the quality of clinical guidelines on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pre-existing diabetes mellitus during pregnancy.

Methods

Guidelines were selected by searching PubMed, the Guideline Clearing House and Google. All guidelines developed since 2000 on diabetes during pregnancy in English or Dutch were considered. Recommendations of the guidelines were compared. Furthermore, the quality was assessed by two authors independently, using the AGREE instrument.

Results

Eight guidelines were included. According to the AGREE instrument, the quality of most guidelines was low. The domains editorial independence, stakeholder involvement and rigour of development had the lowest scores. Recommendations were mainly comparable on glycemic control, preconceptional counseling and prenatal care and labour. Differences between recommendations were found for screening on GDM and induction of labour.

Conclusions

The quality of most guidelines concerning the management of diabetes during pregnancy needs to be improved. A more systematic approach in the development of these guidelines, more attention for updating procedures and piloting of the guidelines and involvement of target users and patients is recommended.

### Management of pregnant and postnatal women with pre-existing diabetes or cardiac disease using multi-disciplinary team models of care: a systematic review [^58682b9c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetes

Possible barriers to timely identification of women with pre-existing diabetes were reported by the CEMACH national enquiry. Less than a fifth of maternity units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland provided structured multidisciplinary preconception care for women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes based on findings from the CEMACH national survey. Furthermore the enquiry noted poor documentation of pre-pregnancy counselling. With respect to care in pregnancy, communication deficiencies between clinical disciplines were noted. Of 338 women whose notes were reviewed, the notes of 222 (56%) women were identified as indicating communication problems between health professionals. With specific reference to problems within the MDT, a lack of dedicated joint clinics and poor sharing of information between obstetricians and diabetes physicians was identified. Poor communication between health professionals and women was noted in 169 (47%) of 360 women for whom notes were available with particular reference to lack of discussion about plans for care during pregnancy. The enquiry assessors also highlighted that in around 10% of these women, social and lifestyle issues, including non-attendance at planned appointments, unplanned pregnancies, language difficulties, difficult domestic circumstances and erratic or busy lifestyles also contributed to poorer pregnancy outcomes.

How has using information and communication technology (ICT) supported decision making when caring for pregnant/postnatal women with pre-existing diabetes and cardiac disease?

No primary or secondary research studies were identified which had specifically evaluated the use of information and communication technology. None of the included opinion papers, guidelines or consensus papers referred to this issue.

What are the potential economic costs and benefits of multidisciplinary teams to meet the needs of pregnant/postnatal women who have pre-existing diabetes and cardiac disease?

No primary or secondary research studies were identified which had evaluated the potential economic costs and benefits of MDTs, and no references were made to these areas in the included opinion papers or guidelines.

Preconception care (PCC) and reproductive intention screening in diabetes — process outcomes and acceptability are summarized as follows: Documentation of contraceptive use increased from a baseline of 23% to 57% in the intervention group while remaining 28% in controls (P < .001), and for visits involving teratogenic medications increased from 14% to 48% versus a decrease from 24% to 26% in controls (P < .001); the intervention had minimal impact on documented provision of family planning services. Potential harm evidence was very low certainty for first-trimester maternal hypoglycemia with PCC (RR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.07–1.79; 3 studies; 686 participants) with heterogeneity (I2 = 76%). Acceptability was high in a systematic review that identified 7 studies measuring acceptability and participant satisfaction, both high in all 7; another review identified 53 US-based studies using 22 screening tools, including five studies with adolescents with T1DM or T2DM. In a single-site quality improvement initiative, contraception discussion increased from 4% to 18% (P = 0.03), whereas contraception prescription (from 0% to 2%) and PCC (from 0% to 6%) increases were not significant.

### Optimizing diabetes-in-pregnancy outcomes requires a care continuum [^dc6ca770]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to assess the strengths, limitations, opportunities, and threats presented by diabetes-in-pregnancy. We review the improvements in maternal and fetal mortality since the advent of insulin therapy, evaluate current health challenges, and identify opportunities for preventing increased mortality due to diabetes-in-pregnancy. Prior to 1922, women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) of childbearing age were discouraged from becoming pregnant as the maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality rates were extremely high. Starvation-level dietary restriction was the only "treatment", with limited success in managing the disease. The discovery of insulin coupled with careful clinical management presented the possibility of successful pregnancies for women with T1dm. Over the course of the next half-century, maternal survival increased from 54 to 97%. However, the gains made in reducing adverse outcomes of diabetes in pregnancy are eroding due to modern challenges. The global obesity epidemic has led to an increase in type 2 and gestational diabetes mellitus (DM). T1DM also is on the rise. Together, the rise in the prevalence of pregestational diabetes has increased the risks for adverse outcomes. Here we review the ongoing challenges as well as opportunities for research to improve outcomes. We suggest that overweight, obesity, and diabetes management must be coupled with preconception counseling and education and must include, in addition to, Ob/Gyns, primary care, nutrition, weight management, and other experts to ensure that those at risk of pregnancy complications due to diabetes have the best possible outcomes. KEY POINTS: · Diabetes in pregnancy is affecting more people. · The obesity epidemic is fueling an increase in pregestational diabetes. · Research is needed to reduce inequities in diabetes in pregnancy outcomes. · Blood glucose control should start prior to pregnancy.

Pregestational diabetes mellitus — prepregnancy counseling should be encouraged and any health care visit should be used as an opportunity to address diabetes management and contraception, because less than one third of women with diabetes mellitus seek prepregnancy counseling. Prepregnancy counseling should focus on the importance of euglycemic control before pregnancy, the adverse obstetric and maternal outcomes from poorly controlled diabetes, and the specific risk of fetal embryopathy related to glycemic control; recommended glucose levels are usually lower in pregnancy and glycemic management changes frequently throughout gestation, and these differences should be discussed with patients considering pregnancy.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^8ab41a0e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Rates of breastfeeding are much lower in women with PDM for various reasons, including a higher rate of postpartum complications, fear of hypoglycemia, lapses in postpartum diabetes care with resultant variability in maternal glycemia, and lapses in lactation support. Additionally, lapses in care resulting in hyperglycemia and decreased uptake of contraception and pregnancy planning could lead to increased risk of congenital malformations and miscarriage in a future pregnancy.

Management of maternal glycemia postpartum is challenging, as this period is characterized by dramatic changes in insulin requirements, increasing the risk of both hypo- and hyperglycemia. Insulin demand decreases dramatically with delivery of the placenta, followed by a gradual increase in insulin resistance in the weeks following delivery. Hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal, is recognized as a problem in lactating women, and this is cited as a reason some chose not to breastfeed. Advances in diabetes technology may help reduce hyper- and hypoglycemia; diabetes care increasingly relies on advanced technology (continuous glucose monitors [CGMs] and hybrid closed-loop [HCL] pumps) as well as a rapidly evolving array of oral and injectable pharmaceuticals. This complexity highlights the importance of expert diabetes care in the postpartum period

Question 10. In postpartum individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), should postpartum endocrine care (comprehensive diabetes management) in addition to usual obstetric care vs usual obstetric care be used?

Recommendation 10

In individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remarks
In addition to routine obstetric care, immediate postpartum care for individuals with PDM should prioritize glycemic management to support healing, promote lactation, and facilitate the transition to interpregnancy and long-term diabetes management.
Ideally, postpartum diabetes care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team that includes physicians specializing in diabetes and/or endocrinology, as well as nurses, dietitians, and certified diabetes care and education specialists. This team should also support ongoing, long-term established follow-up.
In many cases, postpartum care also serves as preconception care (PCC) for a future pregnancy. Approximately half of all deliveries occur among individuals who already have at least one child, highlighting the opportunity for postpartum care to contribute meaningfully to PCC. There is strong evidence that preconception care improves several pregnancy outcomes in individuals with PDM.

### Effect of pregnancy planning on maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes [^902bd4f4]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Approximately half of women in the UK describe their pregnancy as unplanned or are ambivalent towards it 1. There are a range of behaviours that are known to be detrimental during pregnancy, including smoking and alcohol use 2, 3, many of which are associated with pregnancies that are unplanned. Such behaviours may contribute to the increased risks associated with unplanned pregnancy 2, 4. Planning a pregnancy is considered particularly important for women with diabetes, as they are at increased risk of a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including fetal malformation, stillbirth and pre‐eclampsia 5, 6. Poor glucose control in the preconception period and early pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of adverse outcomes 7.

From adolescence, it is recommended that all women with diabetes, regardless of pregnancy intention, receive preconception counselling 8. This is a discussion between women and their healthcare professionals about the importance of planning for pregnancy and should inform women of the need for pre‐pregnancy care prior to conception. Pre‐pregnancy care is specialist care delivered by the multidisciplinary diabetes care team to help ensure a woman is prepared for pregnancy, and includes optimization of glycaemic control 8, the prescription of high‐dose folic acid supplements (5 mg) and review of their current medications.

Despite these recommendations, ~60% of women with diabetes still do not plan their pregnancy 9, 10, and enter pregnancy unprepared, increasing their risk of adverse outcomes. The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) reported an increased risk of poor pregnancy outcomes in women with unplanned pregnancies 9. The effect of pre‐pregnancy care on adverse outcomes in women with diabetes has been studied in some detail. Evidence shows that attending pre‐pregnancy care is associated with decreased HbA 1c levels in early pregnancy and with a reduced incidence of adverse outcomes, including congenital malformations, preterm birth and perinatal mortality 11, 12.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of pregnancy planning on maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with Type 1 diabetes.

Table 15.1 — Checklist for preconception care for people with prediabetes, diabetes, or a history of gestational diabetes mellitus — preconception education should include comprehensive nutrition assessment and recommendations and lifestyle recommendations (regular moderate exercise, avoidance of hyperthermia [hot tubs], adequate sleep), comprehensive diabetes self-management education, counseling on diabetes in pregnancy per current standards, and supplementation including folic acid supplement (400–800 μg /day routine) and appropriate use of over-the-counter medications and supplements. Health assessment and plan should include general evaluation of overall health and evaluation of obstetric or gynecologic history including history of cesarean section, congenital malformations or fetal loss, current methods of contraception, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, preterm delivery, previous macrosomia, Rh incompatibility, and thrombotic events (DVT/PE). Screening should include diabetes complications and comorbidities in individuals with preexisting diabetes, including comprehensive foot exam, comprehensive ophthalmologic exam, and ECG in individuals starting at age 35 years who have cardiac signs or symptoms or risk factors and, if abnormal, further evaluation, as well as lipid panel, serum creatinine, TSH, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio; genetic carrier status (based on history) such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, thalassemia, and others if indicated. Preconception plan should include immunizations (per ACOG guidelines), a nutrition and medication plan to achieve glycemic goals prior to conception including blood glucose monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring (if indicated and appropriate) and pump technology (if indicated and appropriate), a contraceptive plan to prevent pregnancy until glycemic goals are achieved, and a management plan for general health, gynecologic concerns, comorbid conditions, or complications, if present.

### Management of preexisting diabetes in pregnancy: a review [^a8eb48c9]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The presence of preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes in pregnancy increases the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, such as preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, macrosomia, and congenital defects. Approximately 0.9% of the 4 million births in the United States annually are complicated by preexisting diabetes.

Observations

Women with diabetes have increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and similar risks are present with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both forms of diabetes require similar intensity of diabetes care. Preconception planning is very important to avoid unintended pregnancies and to minimize risk of congenital defects. Hemoglobin A1c goals are less than 6.5% at conception and less than 6.0% during pregnancy. It is also critical to screen for and manage comorbid illnesses, such as retinopathy and nephropathy. Medications known to be unsafe in pregnancy, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins, should be discontinued. Women with obesity should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea, which is often undiagnosed and can result in poor outcomes. Blood pressure goals must be considered carefully because lower treatment thresholds may be required for women with nephropathy. During pregnancy, continuous glucose monitoring can improve glycemic control and neonatal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes. Insulin is first-line therapy for all women with preexisting diabetes; injections and insulin pump therapy are both effective approaches. Rates of severe hypoglycemia are increased during pregnancy; therefore, glucagon should be available to the patient and close contacts should be trained in its use. Low-dose aspirin is recommended soon after 12 weeks' gestation to minimize the risk of preeclampsia. The importance of discussing long-acting reversible contraception before and after pregnancy, to allow for appropriate preconception planning, cannot be overstated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Preexisting diabetes in pregnancy is complex and is associated with significant maternal and neonatal risk. Optimization of glycemic control, medication regimens, and careful attention to comorbid conditions can help mitigate these risks and ensure quality diabetes care before, during, and after pregnancy.

### Management of pregnant and postnatal women with pre-existing diabetes or cardiac disease using multi-disciplinary team models of care: a systematic review [^27cda2e6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

In addition to the limited evidence of models of MDT and impacts of MDT management on processes and outcomes of interest, the review found no evidence of what an optimal MDT model should include. If suggestions for MDT membership were made in any of the papers reviewed, this was based on assumption that this would be the most appropriate team composition, with no evidence to support how teams should be structured, operationalized on a day to day basis or how its structure and organisation impact on outcomes evaluated.

A recent large prospective mixed methods study of 12 MDTs (for different chronic medical conditions) in general population groups in London and the North Thames region of England which collected data from meetings, interviews with 53 MDT members and over 2,000 patient records concluded that for the different disease groups not all team meetings necessarily resulted in more effective decision making. MDT benefits could not be assumed for every chronic condition. The researchers also found that the addition of more professional groups to the MDT led to a reduction in implementation of treatment plans for some disease groups, with adjusted odds of implementation reduced by 25% for each additional professional group represented at the MDT meeting. Having a good 'team climate' as measured using a team measure inventory and team skill mix positively impacted on the implementation of treatment plans. A review of evidence regarding team effectiveness in healthcare teams suggested that factors at individual (staff/patient characteristics), team (structure and processes) and organisational (structure, rewards, training) levels should be considered.

Boon and colleagues developed a conceptual framework to support the description, comparison and evaluation of team-based health care practices in Western health systems. Their framework identifies seven different models of team-oriented practice ranging on a continuum from 'parallel' at one end of the continuum (defined as a model of team care characterised by independent health clinicians working in a common setting) to 'integrative' at the other end (defined as comprising among other facets, an interdisciplinary team approach guided by consensus building and shared vision of health enabling each clinician and patient to contribute their particular knowledge and skills within the context of a shared, synergistically charged plan of care). Application of this classification to the current diverse models of MDT working for pregnant and postnatal women and examining relationships with process (timeliness of decisions) and outcomes for the woman and her infant would be extremely valuable to support decisions regarding the organisation of care for high risk pregnancies.

### Prepregnancy care: a shared responsibility [^ea78bcc5]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Thus, a care gap exists between "desired" and "real" prepregnancy care. The suggested reasons for this gap include socioeconomic deprivation, ethnic differences in the risks and use of the health care system, or difficulties with health literacy (,–). Murphy et al. observed that some women became pregnant faster than expected after discontinuing contraception or instituting lifestyle changes and thus had not yet achieved optimal control or changed medications. Logistical and financial concerns also played roles as well as previous negative relationships with health professionals. There was also a fear of disappointment or a desire for minimal medical input to maximize positive pregnancy experiences.

Only about half of women with type 1 diabetes receive prepregnancy care with little evidence of improved outcomes over the last 10 years. The normal glucose values in pregnancy (mean A1C 5.3% and upper limit of normal under 5.7%) are achieved by few women, and the goal A1C of under 6% remains elusive. Achievement of this level of glucose control without hypoglycemia requires a truly expert and experienced health care team and a highly motivated and knowledgeable woman with type 1 diabetes. The significant knowledge and attention to detail needed concerning nutrition, insulin self-adjustment, and use of frequent glucose monitoring information with frequent injections and/or pump therapy can prove to be beyond the woman's capabilities; others lack the needed motivation to intensify their management adequately. Indeed, such demands of knowledge and motivational methods may prove to be even beyond the abilities of their team of health professionals. Not all women will have access to adequately experienced teams in specialized centers who can work with them to achieve such control or family support integral to effective self-care. Additionally, advanced technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring and pump therapy may be required in order to safely achieve such normal glucose levels, and these technologies may be unavailable for economic or pragmatic reasons to many women with type 1 diabetes.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^67338660]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Screening for chronic medical conditions — diabetes — providers should screen adults ages 35 years and older with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes in accordance with U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations, and providers should offer or refer individuals with prediabetes and diabetes to effective prevention and treatment interventions. People with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to see a provider before trying to get pregnant because diabetes increases risk of cesarean birth, large-for-gestational age babies, and children developing obesity or Type 2 diabetes in the future, and blood sugar goals are lower in pregnancy so education and adjustments to medical management may be required. People with a history of gestational diabetes should be screened for Type 2 diabetes ideally within the first year postpartum, and every three years afterwards, for a minimum of 10 years after pregnancy.

### Preconception counseling and care [^d496888c]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary care for women and other patients with similar reproductive potential can include a discussion about pregnancy and, depending on the patient's intent, contraceptive care or preconception care. Folic acid supplementation of at least 400 mcg per day is recommended to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, because many pregnancies are unplanned. Having a body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg per m2 before pregnancy also reduces complications. Patients with a history of bariatric surgery should delay pregnancy for at least 12 months post-procedure and ensure that their nutritional status is adequate before conception. It is essential to review the patient's medications and chronic medical conditions to avoid teratogens and optimize treatment before conception to reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Having a prepregnancy A1C level of less than 6.5% is strongly recommended for patients with diabetes mellitus to minimize congenital anomalies and complications. Vaccinations should be updated to prevent adverse outcomes related to infections. Infectious disease screenings should be updated before conception to allow for treatment, prophylaxis, or timing of pregnancy to avoid complications. Screening and counseling should be provided for substance use and potential environmental exposures to identify and mitigate detrimental exposures before pregnancy.

Other Evidence to Decision Criteria and Considerations

Hypoglycemia and fear of hypoglycemia in the postpartum period, at times leading to cessation of breastfeeding, emerged as an overriding concern among individuals in several studies. Furthermore, studies suggest that individuals with diabetes would prefer more support, including from diabetes specialists, in the postpartum period.

There are no publications on the cost or cost-effectiveness of additional endocrine-focused postpartum care. Postpartum care could potentially be cost saving if it reduced rates of readmissions, increased rates of breastfeeding, and reduced rates of congenital malformations in future pregnancies. The cost-effectiveness of PCC is supported by a systematic review.

Factors associated with nonattendance of postpartum visits include younger age, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, Medicaid insurance, mental health disorders, lower socioeconomic status, decreased access to prenatal care, adverse pregnancy outcomes, limited resources (eg, lack of access to care, limited childcare), and low health literacy, suggesting significant inequity in postpartum care. Higher rates of follow-up were associated with specialist (including endocrinologist) provider vs primary care suggesting that if postpartum specialist visits were widely available to all individuals, postpartum endocrine care might reduce inequities among individuals with diabetes. Offering 2 postpartum visits (at 2 and 6 weeks) instead of only one at 6 weeks improved overall attendance at one visit for minority individuals in a RCT.

Justification for the Recommendation

The GDP based its recommendation on very low certainty indirect evidence suggesting that postpartum endocrine care could result in reductions in maternal hypoglycemia as well as in urgent visits and readmissions in the immediate postpartum period and moderate to high certainty evidence that PCC can reduce HbA1c and congenital malformations in subsequent pregnancies. Additionally, evidence suggests concerns about diabetes management and desire for support from individuals. The GDP judged that the risk of undesirable effects is low. Therefore, the GDP concluded that the balance of effects probably favors the intervention and that the evidence suggested it would be acceptable to individuals. Costs would be moderate, but, based on the indirect evidence of a preconception meta-analysis, it might be cost-effective. Feasibility and equity would vary.

Comments

Individuals who experience a pregnancy loss are even less likely to receive postpartum care, despite being at increased risk for adverse outcomes in the acute period (such as depression) and in future pregnancies. Ditosto et al provides a useful review of implementation strategies (such as virtual reminders, mHealth applications, medical home model, patient navigation, and postpartum transition clinics) for postpartum care in this especially vulnerable population.

Screening for Pregnancy Intention

Background

Unfavorable pregnancy outcomes are common in individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) and are related to modifiable factors such as maternal hyperglycemia and body mass index. For outcomes such as congenital malformations or miscarriage, the exposure period begins weeks before the pregnancy is recognized. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines preconception care (PCC) as "a set of interventions that are to be provided before pregnancy, to promote the health and well-being of women and couples, as well as to improve the pregnancy and child-health outcomes". The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines PCC as "a set of interventions that aim to identify and modify biomedical, behavioral, and social risks to a woman's health or pregnancy outcome through prevention and management". As pregnancies are often unplanned, PCC, including a focus on optimizing maternal glycemia, is necessary to improve maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes. Therefore, understanding the effect of screening for pregnancy intention was deemed a priority.

Screening for pregnancy intention in the general population includes initiatives such as the ONE KEY QUESTION® (OKQ), developed by the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health. This initiative proposes that primary care clinicians ask individuals "Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?". For those who answer "yes", the clinician offers preconception counseling and screenings to ensure that modifiable risk factors are addressed before pregnancy. For those who answer "no", the clinician provides counseling on the full range of contraceptive options to ensure that the method they use is optimal for their circumstances. This approach is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Question 1. Should a screening question about pregnancy intention vs no screening question be used in every healthcare provider appointment for individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant?

Research considerations for screening for pregnancy intention in diabetes — study designs and priority outcomes — are specified: "Direct evidence from pragmatic RCTs is needed to evaluate the benefit of the intervention of a screening question in individuals with diabetes who could become pregnant. Implementation studies are also needed". Suggested evaluations include changes in rates of "1) contraception prescription or referral to a family planning clinic, 2) referral for PCC, 3) unplanned pregnancy, 4) HbA1c at first prenatal visit, and 5) congenital malformations", and assessing whether paired screening questions increase contraception use and decrease HbA1c at the first prenatal visit. Further priorities include "comparing the outcomes of interest and associated costs/savings" across automated reminder/communication approaches, testing "different models of screening (eg, annually)" and "ideal healthcare settings (eg, primary care, urgent care)", and "Addressing the knowledge gap of endocrinologists and primary care clinicians regarding safe and effective contraceptive prescribing".

Consensus statement.

A comprehensive examination by a panel of experts (i.e. consensus panel) of a scientific or medical issue related to diabetes. A consensus statement is typically developed immediately following a consensus conference at which presentations are made on the issue under review. The statement represents the panel's collective analysis, evaluation, and opinion at that point in time based in part on the conference proceedings. The need for a consensus statement arises when clinicians or scientists desire guidance on a subject for which the evidence is contradictory or incomplete. Once written by the panel, a consensus statement is not subject to subsequent review or approval and does not represent official Association opinion. A list of recent consensus statements is included on p. S96 of this supplement.

### Comparison of guidelines available in the United States for diagnosis and management of diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy [^5326e8b5]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Women with preexisting diabetes are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and birth defects. Women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for adverse outcomes, including neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, macrosomia, increased risk of obesity and diabetes in the offspring later in life, and increased risk for other maternal comorbidities. Studies have shown that tight glycemic control before and during pregnancy can decrease the risk for adverse outcomes, congenital malformations, and maternal complications resulting from maternal preexisting diabetes. It is important to identify women with gestational diabetes and provide interconception care to minimize the risk of a future pregnancy complicated by type 2 diabetes. To reduce the risk of adverse consequences for both the woman and her baby, it is important to effectively manage diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy. Several professional organizations have developed guidelines in an effort to establish some consistency in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and to decrease the risk of adverse outcomes. The objectives of this paper are to (1) compare the guidelines for women with preexisting (types 1 and 2) and gestational diabetes available to healthcare providers in the United States, highlighting the similarities and differences among them, and (2) discuss how differences among the guidelines might affect efforts to address the challenges of controlling and preventing diabetes and resulting complications during pregnancy.

1 INTRODUCTION

In line with the rising global prevalence of diabetes, the number of pregnancies complicated by pre‐existing type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes and by gestational diabetes mellitus is increasing in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

Women with diabetes in pregnancy are at greater risk of maternal and neonatal complications compared to those without diabetes. A recent population‐based cohort study of 17,375 pregnancies between 2014 and 2018 among women with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes in England and Wales reported high rates of preterm birth, and of infants born large for gestational age. Higher than average perinatal deaths, particularly in women with type 2 diabetes, who now account for more than 50% of pregnancies complicated by pre‐existing diabetes, were also reported. The obstetric and neonatal complications associated with gestational diabetesinclude large for gestational age infants, complications in labour and delivery and neonatal hypoglycaemia, as well as long‐term implications for both mother and child.

The importance of pre‐pregnancy care is underpinned by the potential to improve already established suboptimal health behaviours and risk factors for pregnancy complications before a woman conceives. We previously reported that UK women in general are not adequately prepared for pregnancy, with suboptimal health behaviours including smoking, lack of folic acid supplementation, alcohol consumption, low levels of physical activity and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake.

Planning for pregnancy through tailored pre‐pregnancy care, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, is particularly important for women who have pre‐existing diabetes, to minimise risk before conception. Optimising glycaemic management and appropriate medication use, for example, stopping potentially teratogenic medication and commencing higher dose (e.g. 5 mg) folic acid, among other preparatory actions, is known to improve pregnancy outcomes in this high‐risk group. In contrast, for women who have experienced a previous pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes, there are no preconception‐specific guidelines, only postpartum recommendations for diagnostic testing for diabetes and type 2 diabetes risk reduction. This is despite the well‐recognised risk of gestational diabetes recurring in a subsequent pregnancy.

Data on health behaviours in women with pre‐existing diabetes are limited and to the best of our knowledge, there are no such data in women with previous gestational diabetes. The aim of this study was to examine pre‐pregnancy health behaviours and pregnancy risk factors in women with pre‐existing diabetes or previous gestational diabetes, who completed a questionnaire incorporated into a digital pregnancy planning advisory tool. An additional aim was to document the reach of such a digital tool among high‐risk women.

### Prevalence and changes in preexisting diabetes and gestational diabetes among women who had a live birth-United States, 2012–2016 [^b4390371]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In 2016, the crude national prevalences of preexisting and gestational diabetes were 0.9% and 6.0%, respectively. §§ From 2012 to 2016 among 40 jurisdictions with continuously available data, the age- and race/ethnicity-standardized prevalence of preexisting diabetes remained stable (< 0.1 percentage point change), and the prevalence of gestational diabetes increased by 0.4 percentage point. Changes in preexisting and gestational diabetes reported here extend findings from two studies using hospital discharge data from 19 states; these studies found the age-adjusted prevalence of preexisting diabetes increased from 0.7% to 0.9% from 2000 to 2010, and the prevalence of gestational diabetes increased from 3.7% to 5.8%. Observed increases in the prevalence of preexisting and gestational diabetes might reflect, in part, recent increases in the prevalence of prepregnancy obesity. Estimates of preexisting diabetes may be leveling off compared to what has been seen in recent years. The high prevalence of gestational diabetes in Asian women is consistent with previous literature. Preconception care and lifestyle interventions before, during, and after pregnancy might provide opportunities to control, prevent, or mitigate health risks associated with diabetes during pregnancy.

Preconception care refers to health care before pregnancy that optimizes a woman's health and pregnancy-related outcomes, should a pregnancy occur. * Preconception care provides an opportunity to reinforce the importance of diabetes management among reproductive-aged women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and might reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes by improving glycemic control before critical developmental stages of the fetus early in pregnancy. Because prepregnancy overweight and obesity are strongly associated with developing gestational diabetes, preconception care offers an opportunity to provide all women with recommended BMI screening and to refer women with obesity to intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions. †††

Gestational diabetes strongly predicts the development of future type 2 diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes are recommended to receive testing for type 2 diabetes 4–12 weeks postpartum and, if diabetes is detected, referred for follow-up care; lifelong monitoring is recommended for women with normal results. §§§ Although national estimates of postpartum diabetes testing are unavailable, some studies report suboptimal testing rates, suggesting missed opportunities to provide health care for women with diabetes and those at risk for developing diabetes.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Search results

A total of 320 records were identified (Figure 1). Twenty‐eight duplicates were removed, and 53 records were excluded before screening due to a lack of access. A total of 231 records were available for screening. On the first round of screening, 70 records were excluded (four were not in English, 35 were not related to type 1 diabetes and 31 were not related to preconception or pre‐pregnancy). A further 137 records were excluded as they did not evaluate pre‐pregnancy clinic attendance, leaving 31 articles for full‐text review.

### Recommendations for preconception counseling and care [^771ed8d7]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Given that nearly one-half of pregnancies are unintended, preconception care should be considered an integral part of primary care for women of reproductive age. Common issues in preconception care include family planning, achieving a healthy body weight, screening and treatment for infectious diseases, updating appropriate immunizations, and reviewing medications for teratogenic effects. Women who want to become pregnant should take folic acid supplements to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Control of chronic diseases is essential for optimizing pregnancy outcomes. Family physicians should work with patients to control conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and seizure disorders while simultaneously offering family planning services to avoid unintended pregnancies. Bariatric surgery is increasingly common and may improve fertility in many women with previous insulin resistance. Family physicians should counsel women undergoing bariatric surgery to prevent pregnancy during rapid weight loss and provide assistance with contraception. In addition, patients have special nutritional requirements after bariatric surgery.
