## Question

Normal tsh and elevated t4 low t3

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a thyroid profile showing normal TSH with elevated T4 and low T3, and what steps to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pattern itself and whether it fits a recognizable syndrome. Then, I should verify assay interference and pre-analytical pitfalls. Next, I will review common non-thyroidal causes that produce this pattern, followed by rare genetic and acquired causes. After that, I should check medication exposures, including amiodarone and T4 monotherapy. Finally, I will consider clinical significance and outline a practical diagnostic and management plan, including when to treat versus observe, and when to refer or test for resistance syndromes or central etiologies.

> Let me first confirm the pattern: normal TSH with high T4 and low T3 is discordant and not a routine primary thyroid disorder, so I need to be cautious before labeling it. Initially, I wondered if this could be T3 toxicosis, but wait, let me verify — T3 toxicosis typically presents with suppressed TSH and normal or high T3, sometimes with normal T4, which is the opposite of low T3 here, so that initial thought is off and I should correct it now [^112AZiH6] [^114fiaqB]. This discordant profile with elevated T4 and low T3 plus non-suppressed TSH suggests a non-thyroidal illness pattern, impaired T4-to-T3 conversion, assay interference, or a resistance or transport defect rather than classic primary hyper- or hypothyroidism [^114Ub1fK] [^113Tp6Js].

> I should double-check for assay interference and pre-analytical issues before anything else because spurious results can mimic disease. I need to ask about biotin use, as high-dose biotin can artifactually elevate free T4 in streptavidin-based immunoassays and leave TSH unchanged or falsely low; if suspected, I should stop biotin for several days and repeat testing on a different platform or send to a reference lab for equilibrium dialysis free T4 and free T3 to confirm authenticity [^114fiaqB]. I also need to review whether total versus free hormones were measured and ensure the lab used validated methods, since some free T3 assays are less reliable and total T3 is often preferred in this context [^117W8kM1] [^112JchAm].

> Next, I should review non-thyroidal illness as the most common cause of high T4 and low T3 with normal or low-normal TSH. Hold on, I should verify the mechanism — critical illness and chronic systemic disease reduce peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion via downregulation of type 1 deiodinase and upregulation of type 3 deiodinase, which shunts T4 to reverse T3 and lowers circulating T3; TSH may be low or inappropriately normal due to central suppression, and rT3 is typically elevated in this setting [^117WaSrD] [^113XpJMe]. I need to check for intercurrent illness, recent surgery, heart failure, liver disease, or catabolic states, and consider measuring reverse T3 if the diagnosis remains uncertain and it will change management, recognizing that treatment of the underlying illness — not thyroid hormone — is indicated [^113Tp6Js].

> I will now examine medication-induced causes, especially amiodarone, which frequently produces exactly this pattern: high T4, low T3, and normal or mildly elevated TSH due to inhibition of type 1 deiodinase and complex pituitary effects. Wait, let me verify the time course — changes can appear within weeks and persist after discontinuation. If amiodarone is present, I should correlate clinically and avoid reflexively treating thyroid hormone abnormalities unless there is true amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis by the drug's own mechanisms [^113XpJMe].

> But wait, what if the patient is on levothyroxine monotherapy? I need to check for iatrogenic T4 excess with impaired peripheral conversion. LT4-treated athyreotic patients can have normal TSH yet relatively low T3 and a higher T4:T3 ratio, reflecting reduced D2 activity and variable tissue euthyroidism; some data suggest persistent symptoms correlate with lower T3 despite normalized TSH, though routine T3 testing is not standard in hypothyroidism care [^116Mwy9b] [^116jiqMd]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical context — if symptoms persist and other causes are excluded, a carefully supervised trial of LT4/LT3 combination may be considered in select cases, acknowledging mixed and limited evidence and the need to avoid overtreatment risks [^116jiqMd] [^112igscD].

> Next, I should review rare genetic and acquired causes that can produce a high T3-to-T4 ratio with normal TSH and low T4, which is the inverse of this pattern, but I need to ensure I don't miss exceptions. Resistance to thyroid hormone alpha presents with low or low-normal T4, high-normal or high T3, and normal TSH, reflecting tissue-specific hypothyroidism in TRα-expressing tissues; MCT8 deficiency shows elevated T3, low T4, and normal TSH due to impaired neuronal T3 transport; these are not a direct match for high T4 with low T3, but they remind me to consider receptor and transporter defects when the TFTs are persistently discordant and the phenotype fits [^116errD2] [^notfound]. If the pattern were reversed with high T3 and low T4 plus normal TSH, I should pursue targeted genetic testing and specialist referral, but in the current high T4, low T3 case, these are less likely [^111LvjMZ].

> I should confirm that central hypothyroidism is not being masked here. Central hypothyroidism typically shows low or inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4; if TSH is truly normal and FT4 is high, that argues against central hypothyroidism, but I need to ensure FT4 is genuinely elevated and not an assay artifact before concluding this [^116Rq9QT] [^112SDVCZ]. If FT4 were low with normal TSH, I would reconsider pituitary disease and follow guideline-based evaluation for central hypothyroidism, but that is not the pattern described here [^116Rq9QT].

> Let me consider clinical significance and urgency. In non-thyroidal illness, the low T3 state is generally an adaptive response and thyroid hormone therapy is not indicated. The focus should be on treating the underlying condition, with thyroid tests repeating toward normal as the patient recovers [^113Tp6Js] [^113XpJMe]. In medication-induced patterns like amiodarone, I should avoid treating numbers unless there is true amiodarone-induced hypo- or hyperthyroidism by established criteria; in LT4-treated patients with persistent symptoms and low T3, shared decision-making about a cautious, time-limited LT4/LT3 trial is reasonable in select cases, balancing potential benefit against risks of overtreatment and arrhythmia [^116jiqMd] [^112igscD].

> Now, I should outline a practical diagnostic approach. First, repeat TFTs after excluding biotin and using reliable platforms, preferably measuring total T3 and free T4, and consider rT3 if non-thyroidal illness is suspected. Second, review medications meticulously, especially amiodarone, glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, and LT4 dosing. Third, assess for acute or chronic illness, surgery, or catabolic states. Fourth, if the pattern persists and the phenotype suggests it, consider targeted evaluation for resistance or transport defects with specialist input and genetic testing where indicated [^117W8kM1] [^114fiaqB] [^111LvjMZ]. I should double-check that I am not missing pregnancy, which alters reference ranges and assay interpretation, and adjust thresholds accordingly if relevant [^114PrnPb].

> For management, I need to ensure I do not treat the test in isolation. If non-thyroidal illness is present, treat the underlying disease and avoid thyroid hormone. If amiodarone is causal, manage per amiodarone thyroid protocols rather than adjusting thyroid hormones reflexively. If the patient is on LT4 with persistent symptoms and low T3, consider a supervised, time-limited LT4/LT3 combination trial with close monitoring and clear stop criteria. If a resistance syndrome is suspected, refer to endocrinology for dynamic testing and genetic evaluation rather than empiric therapy [^117W8kM1] [^116jiqMd] [^111LvjMZ]. Hold on, I should verify that any intervention is individualized and evidence-discussed with the patient, given the limited and heterogeneous data for combination therapy and the potential risks of overtreatment [^116jiqMd] [^112igscD].

> In summary, normal TSH with elevated T4 and low T3 is a discordant pattern that most often reflects non-thyroidal illness, medication effects such as amiodarone or LT4 monotherapy, or assay interference. True thyroid disease is less likely but should be reconsidered if the abnormality persists after correcting confounders. I need to ensure I verify authenticity with repeat testing, review the clinical context and medications, and tailor management to the underlying cause rather than the numbers alone, reserving advanced testing for persistent, unexplained discordance or a phenotype suggestive of resistance or transport defects [^114Ub1fK] [^117W8kM1] [^114fiaqB].

The combination of normal TSH, elevated free T4, and low T3 is most often due to **amiodarone or other drugs** that inhibit type 1 deiodinase [^113XpJMe], causing high T4 and low T3 with preserved TSH. Other causes include **T4 therapy excess** [^116Mwy9b], **acute psychiatric illness** [^113XpJMe], and rare entities such as RTHα or MCT8 deficiency [^111LvjMZ]. Evaluation should include repeating TFTs, reviewing medications, and checking for assay interference [^114fiaqB]; if persistent, assess for central causes, thyroid hormone resistance, or non-thyroidal illness [^116Rq9QT]. Management is cause-specific: stop or adjust offending drugs, reduce T4 dose if excessive, and treat underlying illness; thyroid hormone therapy is not routinely indicated unless there is true hypothyroidism or a specific resistance syndrome.

---

## Physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms can explain **normal TSH with elevated T4 and low T3**:

- **Amiodarone and other drugs**: Inhibition of type 1 deiodinase reduces T4-to-T3 conversion, raising T4 and lowering T3 while TSH remains normal or mildly elevated [^113XpJMe].

- **Exogenous T4 therapy**: LT4 monotherapy can yield higher T4 and lower T3 than in euthyroid individuals, especially with impaired conversion [^116Mwy9b].

- **Acute psychiatric illness**: Transient elevations in T4 with low T3 and normal TSH can occur in acute psychiatric states [^notfound].

- **Rare genetic disorders**: Resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTHα) and MCT8 deficiency can present with low T4, high T3, and normal TSH, though patterns vary [^1151wBvN].

## Clinical conditions associated with normal TSH, elevated T4, and low T3

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Amiodarone therapy | Inhibition of type 1 deiodinase | - High T4 <br/> - Low T3 <br/> - Normal TSH <br/> - May be asymptomatic or cause hypothyroid symptoms [^113XpJMe] |
| Exogenous T4 therapy | Excess T4 administration | - High T4 <br/> - Low T3 <br/> - Normal TSH <br/> - Often asymptomatic [^116Mwy9b] |
| Acute psychiatric illness | Transient hormonal changes | - High T4 <br/> - Low T3 <br/> - Normal TSH <br/> - Reversible [^113XpJMe] |
| Resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTHα) | Genetic mutation in THRA | - Low T4 <br/> - High T3 <br/> - Normal TSH <br/> - Hypothyroid features [^1151wBvN] |
| MCT8 deficiency | Mutation in SLC16A2 | - Low T4 <br/> - High T3 <br/> - Normal TSH <br/> - Severe neurodevelopmental delay [^111LvjMZ] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **systematic approach** is essential:

- **Repeat thyroid function tests**: Confirm persistence of the abnormality and exclude assay interference [^1172q5sC].

- **Review medications**: Identify drugs that alter thyroid hormone metabolism or assay results [^113XpJMe].

- **Assay interference**: Consider biotin, heterophile antibodies, or analytical errors [^114fiaqB].

- **Evaluate for central causes**: Pituitary or hypothalamic disease if TSH is inappropriately normal with abnormal T4/T3 [^116Rq9QT].

- **Genetic testing**: Consider RTHα or MCT8 mutations if phenotype suggests [^111LvjMZ].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Amiodarone-induced changes**: Often no treatment needed; monitor and adjust therapy if symptomatic or persistent [^notfound].

- **Exogenous T4 therapy**: Reduce dose if excessive; consider LT4/LT3 combination if symptoms persist and conversion is impaired [^116jiqMd].

- **Acute psychiatric illness**: Usually reversible; monitor and treat the psychiatric condition [^113XpJMe].

- **RTHα or MCT8**: Specialist management; thyroid hormone analogs (e.g. TRIAC) may be considered in RTHα [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic significance

The prognostic impact depends on the **underlying cause**. Amiodarone-related changes are often benign but warrant monitoring; persistent low T3 in non-thyroidal illness correlates with worse outcomes, whereas transient abnormalities in psychiatric illness typically resolve without sequelae [^113XpJMe].

---

Normal TSH with elevated T4 and low T3 most commonly reflects **drug effects** (especially amiodarone), **excess T4 therapy**, or **transient psychiatric illness**; rare causes include RTHα or MCT8 defects. Confirm with repeat testing, review medications, and tailor management to the cause; thyroid hormone therapy is not routinely indicated unless true hypothyroidism or a resistance syndrome is present.

Laboratory Tests — Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) frequency and causes — SH has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population; in older persons TMNG is probably the most common cause, with other etiologies including GD, solitary autonomously functioning nodules, and various forms of thyroiditis. Other causes of a suppressed TSH with normal estimated free T4 and T3 include corticosteroid therapy, central hypothyroidism, and nonthyroidal illness. Once SH has been detected, it is important to document persistence by repeating the serum TSH at 3 or 6 months, and scintigraphic studies suggesting autonomous thyroid function would favor SH.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the combined preparation of levothyroxine plus sustained-release liothyronine; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^115bXReC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Levothyroxine monotherapy is considered the standard of care for hypothyroidism by professional organizations, whereby the patients achieve the state of euthyroidism through the normalization of TSH, a reliable proxy of euthyroidism. In euthyroid individuals, 80% of T3 (25 µg) is generated from T4 to T3 conversion in kidney and liver cells and 20% (5 µg) is secreted from the thyroid gland. Using levothyroxine (L-T4) alone is expected to be a suitable strategy owing to the peripheral conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the hormonally active T3 by the deiodinase. Of interest, while this treatment modality is safe, well-tolerated, and extremely effective in normalizing TSH, it may not be sufficient to account for the normal thyroidal secretion of T3 and T4. Approximately 10% lower serum T3 levels in LT4-treated patients compared to euthyroid individuals with similar serum TSH values have been reported previously, leading to the skewed T3:T4 ratio toward an increase of T4, while serum T3 levels are normal to low. The clinical significance of these deviations in thyroid hormones in LT4-treated patients is not clear.

Clinically, a sizable minority of patients adequately treated with LT4 complain of residual symptoms. Higher T4 and lower T3 serum levels reflect a relative imbalance in the thyroid hormone axis homeostasis may be responsible for the persistence of hypothyroid symptoms in some patients. It is unclear to what extent lower serum T3 levels may contribute to the persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients; however, in an experimental study on thyroidectomized rats with evident tissue hypothyroidism in peripheral cells, tissue euthyroidism occurred only following normalization of serum T3.

The above-mentioned evidence led to the growing interest in combination therapy with LT4 plus liothyronine(LT3); however, multiple randomized controlled clinical trials addressing objective and subjective clinical outcomes did not provide conclusive results. The non-conclusive results, besides heterogeneity in the study population, design, and dosage, may be attributed to the concerns and challenges regarding available oral T3 preparations stemming from the short half-life of T3 with rapid T3 absorption followed by fast metabolization. Despite the lack of definite evidence for the superiority of combination therapy, this strategy remains a common practice in hypothyroid patients who remained dissatisfied with LT4 monotherapy, while the use of LT4 + SR-T3 was suggested.

### Pediatric obesity-long-term consequences and effect of weight loss [^111Ckemw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Other endocrine alterations

Thyroid

Elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as a sign of disturbed thyroid function are regularly observed in individuals with obesity. Usually, thyroid hormone levels, T3 and T4 are within the normal range and weight loss results in normalization of the TSH levels. The situation is similar in children. The mechanisms are unclear but a modest and reversible obesity‐induced thyroid gland dysfunction or an increased turnover of thyroid hormones might contribute. Elevated TSH among children with obesity is associated with cardiometabolic markers in childhood and later cardiovascular disease. TSH may have other effects in the body beyond the stimulation of thyroid hormone production but based on the present knowledge, there are no signs of a causal association between increased TSH levels in childhood and later disease.

Vitamin D

Low vitamin D levels are often found in children with obesity. Vitamin D deficiency in childhood has been associated with the development of several diseases such as MS and prediabetes, that is, two conditions also associated with obesity. Whether supplementation of vitamin D affects T2D, prediabetes, and the metabolic syndrome has been investigated, but with contradictory results and the pathophysiological significance of vitamin D deficiency for the development of T2D is unclear. A large double‐blind intervention study in adults failed to identify any beneficial effect on glucose metabolism of vitamin D substitution whereas a modest effect has been noted in children and adolescents. Yet, most likely the association between vitamin D insufficiency and disturbed glucose metabolism in obesity is primarily due to that similar factors contribute to both low vitamin D levels and insulin resistance, that is, sedentary indoor life and unhealthy food intake.

The mechanisms behind low vitamin D levels are unknown. Both increased storage in the adipose tissue and increased metabolism have been proposed and it has been suggested that there is no true deficiency since the levels are low due to increased accumulation in the adipose tissue. It has also been suggested that the metabolism of vitamin D is disturbed. Vitamin D can be metabolized in the adipose tissue and the expression of 25‐hydroxylase CYP2J2 and the 1a‐hydroxylase CYP27B1 are decreased in subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese subject. But as mentioned, both indoor activities and poor eating habits probably contribute as well.

Thyroid disease — biochemical characterization of hypothyroidism and resistance: Hypothyroidism is characterized by the relative or absolute reductions in serum levels of thyroxine (T4), and serum levels of total or free triiodothyronine (T3) are not reliable markers of hypothyroidism; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated in primary hypothyroidism but is typically low or inappropriately normal in central hypothyroidism due to pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary) disorders, and patients with generalized thyroid hormone resistance usually have high concentrations of T3 and T4 with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH and variable degrees of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid symptoms.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^115qw3iZ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that results from pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance. The worldwide prevalence is 9.1%, equating to 415 million adults suffering from the disease. T2DM is a complex disease arising from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Recently, evidence has suggested that low circulating levels of thyroid hormone, even within the normal reference concentrations, may be related to an elevated risk of developing T2DM, especially within the prediabetes population.

Like diabetes, thyroid dysfunction results from dysregulated hormone secretion. Recent data from the Colorado Thyroid Disease Prevalence study showed that 9.5% of 25,862 participants had an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); conversely, 2.2% had low TSH. The thyroid hormone axis includes TSH, thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3), all of which are required to maintain the normal functioning of the thyroid. The imbalance of these hormones may lead to metabolic overactivity (hyperthyroidism; excess thyroid hormone) or underactivity (hypothyroidism; inadequate thyroid hormone). Based on the severity of the imbalance, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be diagnosed as either clinical or subclinical, of which the latter is the more prevalent. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is commonly defined as having an abnormal TSH but normal T4 concentration. The presence or absence of symptoms may be independent of T4 levels. Despite being mild, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been linked to several complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease, and type 1 diabetes in children.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155cNLx]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

fT4 is not the active thyroid hormone at the cellular nuclear level. The strong relationships of parameters, especially AF (risk increased up to 9 × across the normal reference range (30)), with levels of fT4 indicate that the active intracellular triiodothyronine generated by thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases appears to be, at least in the heart, proportional to circulating fT4. Any discrepancy, indicating local regulation of thyroid effect, may be more prominent in more severe pathophysiological circumstances, and therefore more relevant in the circumstances of multisystem entities such as frailty, death, and metabolic disturbance.

Our results do not imply that no information can be gleaned from the presence of an abnormal TSH level. In the presence of normal thyroid hormone levels, such TSH levels indicate that the thyroid gland physiology is abnormal. However, for the function of other tissues and organs, the TSH level required to maintain a given level of thyroid hormones appears generally not to be relevant.

It remains possible too that additional analyses might find that TSH levels are providing an additional signal to fT4 levels, in some populations for some conditions. It has been suggested that TSH itself may have physiological effects apart from the stimulation of thyroid hormone levels, and such effects rather than via the reflection of thyroid status might explain such a TSH signal. Empirically, thus far, the evidence suggests that any of these TSH effects are small.

The association of thyroid hormone and particularly fT4 levels, rather than TSH levels, with clinical features has been noted by many authors, covering many individual parameters. In particular, the meta-analysis regarding AF noted the association with fT4 but not with TSH. Authors also previously found evidence of associations of clinical parameters with fT4 in the absence of an association with subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently diagnosed. One of these studies also showed associations with TSH.

What is known?

Euthyroid sick syndrome; defined as low fT3, normal or low fT4 and normal or low TSH and subclinical hypothyroidism (SH); defined as a serum TSH concentration above the reference range with normal serum fT4 and fT3 levels were documented in patients with chronic liver disease in adults.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^113Fad1b]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Thyroid and aging [^113bqae9]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Review physiologic thyroid function changes with aging and emphasize careful interpretation of tests in the aging population.

Methods

Literature review.

Results

Using age-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges should minimize or avoid the unnecessary diagnosis of thyroid disease in elderly patients. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and abnormal TSH with normal thyroid levels may improve with time, so careful monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. Overt thyroid disease should always be treated.

Conclusion

Clinical judgement is always warranted to decide how and when to treat subclinical thyroid disease in the elderly.

### Prognostic significance of low TSH concentration in patients with COVID-19 presenting with non-thyroidal illness syndrome [^112HPRc2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

The prognostic effects of NTI on critically ill patients have been extensively studied and recognized, but associations of altered thyroid tests and mortality in patients with NTI are contradictory. In a study focusing on patients with sepsis presenting with NTI, a worse prognosis was observed for patients with combined low T3 and T4 levels compared with those with low T3 levels alone. In a study from Turkey, low FT3 levels and increased FT4 levels were found to be independent predictors of long-term mortality risks in chronic patients with NTI, and TSH levels were not significantly associated with mortality. Another study in Germany found that high TSH, T3 and T4 levels were related to a better prognosis in patients with acute liver failure.

For patients with COVID-19, NTI has been found to be significantly associated with the disease condition. In a study conducted in Italy, Ilaria Muller's team compared patients with and without COVID-19 in a high ICU, and no significant difference was observed in FT3 levels, indicating that the NTI rate might not be increased for patients with COVID-19 treated in the ICU. Lower TSH levels and higher FT4 concentrations were also detected in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the high ICU compared with patients with COVID-19 admitted to the low ICU. The study by Min Chen et al analysed thyroid function in patients with COVID-19. Lower TSH and FT3 concentrations were shown to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 (p < 0.001), and TSH levels were significantly lower in severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 control patients. In the study conducted by Lania et al. the mortality was higher and the duration of hospitalization was longer in thyrotoxic in-hospital patients with COVID-19 as compared to those with normal thyroid function. Here, mortality and critical illness rates were significantly higher in the low TSH group than in the normal TSH group, and low TSH levels were independently related to 90-day mortality (hazard ratio = 2.78, P = 0.003). In addition, the mortality rate was significantly higher in the low FT4 group, but no significant difference in the critical illness rate was found. Although thyrotoxicosis might occur in patients with COVID-19, low FT3-FT4 levels or low FT3-TSH levels suggested a worse prognosis. Critically, severely and mildly ill patients with COVID-19 complicated with NTI were all included in this study, and the analysis of the effects of TSH and FT4 levels on the prognosis was based on low FT3 levels, which partially explained the difference in our results from other findings.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

Conclusions — practice implications and laboratory–clinician interface: over the past five decades, testing for TSH and thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) has greatly improved in selectivity and sensitivity. Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement, and there is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. Laboratories often receive requests missing clinical and pharmacological information; the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interpretations and should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges. Standardization, quality, performance, and harmonization of assays (TSH, T4, T3) need to be maintained and improved to enable exchange, application, and interpretation of test results within clinical standards.

Overcoming Low Circulating T3

Another rationale for using nonprescribed TH includes rectifying the low concentrations (or expected reduction) of serum T3 seen in the energy deficit status of some elite athletes undergoing extremes of training and/or diet. Such reversible functional changes in circulating THs are consistent with the concept of Relative Energy Deficit in Sports (RED-S), introduced by the International Olympic Committee in 2014 to broaden the scope of the previously defined (female) athlete's triad, originally described in females as functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, extending to include men manifesting low serum testosterone as well as to a wider range of exercise performance and nutritional states. Although criticized by defenders of the original concept of the female athlete's triad, this expanded concept is gaining wider recognition when referring to athletes with impaired physical function due to an energy deficit that is not sufficient to maintain normal physiological function and that can lead to secondary amenorrhea and impaired bone health. Analogous findings are reported in other catabolic states due to severe reduction in calorie intake (eg, severe undernutrition) and/or energy drain (eg, excessive exercise intensity) culminating in weight loss as a pathophysiological response to energy deficit states. Energy deficit syndromes including RED-S lead consistently to low serum T3, increased reverse T3, but less consistent, if any, changes in serum T4 as well as serum TSH, which is sometimes mildly lowered but not undetectable.

These manifestations of a catabolic state are also consistent with the reversible changes in thyroid function tests seen more broadly in the sick euthyroid (or non-thyroidal illness) syndrome. These may represent an adaptive hypothalamic response to environmental stress during almost any severe or chronic non-thyroidal illness. This syndrome exhibits characteristic, reversible changes in thyroid function tests featuring characteristically reduction in serum T3, increases in reverse T3 but without consistent changes in serum T4 or TSH. While some controversy remains, it is widely accepted that these biochemical features are not indicative of a TH deficiency state nor is there sound evidence to warrant TH replacement therapy. Hence while elite athletes may exhibit aberrant thyroid function tests as part of a catabolic state due to intense exercise with or without diet-related nutritional deficits, this functional state does not represent hypothyroidism, so that TH treatment is not required or indicated. Nor is there convincing evidence that TH supplementation improves muscle function, endurance, or weight loss but supplemental TH use in the absence of diagnosed hypothyroidism risks adverse bone and cardiac health.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and the risk of cancer incidence and cancer mortality: a systematic review [^112FCgkz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between thyroid function and cancer has been a subject of debate for more than 200 years, with studies showing conflicting results. In vitro studies have shown that thyroid hormones not only regulate body metabolism but they also play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation in normal tissues. Thyroid hormones consist of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which is the active form of the thyroid hormone. Both enter cells via transporter proteins whereby T4 becomes converted to T3 by deiodinases. T3 subsequently binds to thyroid hormone receptors, which then forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to induce transcription of a number of target genes with thyroid response elements.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a form of thyroid dysfunction that is highly prevalent, with a reported prevalence of 5 to 10% of the population worldwide. SCH is defined by elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal T4 levels. Given that the T4 level is within normal range, patients with SCH usually do not experience hypothyroid symptoms. However, given that studies have shown an increased risk of heart failure associated with SCH whereby the TSH levels are > 10 mIU/L, it is recommended that patients with SCH and this extent of TSH elevation receive levothyroxine replacement. Currently, there is no consensus as to whether patients with SCH with a TSH level of < 10mIU/L should be treated with levothyroxine as there is uncertainty regarding the clinical benefits of therapy in these cases. According to some studies, less than 50% of patients with SCH receive hormone replacement.

Given that thyroid hormone has been shown to play a role in cancer pathogenesis, further studies assessing the association between thyroid dysfunction and its effects on carcinogenesis are needed. This is particularly true for SCH, where the clinical benefits of levothyroxine treatment are unclear. The objective of this study is therefore to determine the influence of thyroid dysfunction, namely SCH, on cancer incidence and cancer mortality via systematic review of the evidence available to date.

Pregnancy-related thyroid function test interpretation describes that serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy, especially in gestational weeks 9–13, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit of normal for TSH in the pregnant population can be used. Free T4 and T3 measured in an equilibrium dialysis or an ultrafiltrate of serum may be slightly higher (5%–10%) than nonpregnancy values early in gestation, then gradually decrease so that late third trimester values are lower than in nonpregnant women. Serum total T4 and T3 reference ranges increase at a rate of 5% of nonpregnant values per week over the 10-week period of gestation weeks 7–16, after which this 50% increase stabilizes and reference range limits remain 1.5 times above nonpregnancy ranges over the remaining weeks of pregnancy.

T3 Measurement

T3 is predominantly protein bound (99.7%) and a direct measurement of fT3 is theoretically a better marker of thyroid function than TT3. However, the concentration of T3 in the circulation is lower than that of T4, and the binding affinity of T3 to carrier proteins in serum is weaker than that of T4. Consequently, fT3 measurements are more susceptible to interference by free fatty acids and drugs present in the circulation. As a result, the precision and reproducibility of fT3 immunoassays are less than that for fT4.

Consequently, many laboratories prefer to run TT3 assays rather than fT3 due to these concerns regarding fT3 immunoassay reliability. As T3 concentration can often be maintained within the reference interval in hypothyroidism, T3 measurement in patients with suspected hypothyroidism or with increased TSH is of limited clinical value. In hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4. Consequently, the analysis of T3 can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH.

The deiodinase enzymes 1 and 2 are responsible for the conversion of T4 to T3 and most of the T3 in circulation. The activity of these enzymes can be altered in patients with intercurrent illness, resulting in the low T3 concentrations that are characteristic of the nonthyroidal illness syndrome. Occasionally modification of the activity of deiodinase enzymes 1, 2, and 3 in patients on T4 replacement can also result in lower levels of circulating T3. In addition, circulating T3 can be reduced by increased activity of deiodinase enzyme 3 that can metabolize both T3 and T4.

As a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark of nonthyroidal illness, measurement of T3 is unlikely to be of diagnostic relevance in this context. However, T3 measurement can be useful in some clinical situations such as patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease. Here T3 measurement may help distinguish between hyperthyroidism and the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or to identify the coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness (Box 3).

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

Laboratory Tests

Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1151wBvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T3 and T3/T4 Ratio With Nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal/high circulating FT3 and low-normal/low FT4 concentrations, computing to a raised T3/T4 ratio, with normal TSH levels.

Dyshormonogenesis

Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations, with chronic deficiency causing goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio has been reported in the context of mild, dyshormonogenic CH due to partial, loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects, with hypersecretion of T3 being attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

Resistance to thyroid hormone α

Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism, but associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal/low FT4, high-normal/high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency

Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for transport of THs into the central nervous system, cause a disorder (Allan–Herndon Dudley syndrome) with psychomotor retardation, elevated circulating FT3, low or low-normal FT4, and normal TSH concentrations.

Table 5 illustrates how entities sharing this pattern of TFTs can be differentiated, using a combination of clinical features and key biochemical measurements (eg, urinary iodine, serum thyroglobulin, and reverse T3).

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### The role of supporting and disruptive mechanisms of FT3 homeostasis in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis [^114BGp6q]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

It follows that, while TSH and FT4 concentrations are sensitive markers of thyroid gland failure in primary hypothyroidism, FT3 levels are more informative about the functional state of the rest of the body. Guidelines have partly addressed this conundrum by separating therapeutic targets from diagnostic criteria. Advances in the understanding of HPT regulation should encourage both a more accurate diagnostic paradigm and inclusive re-definition of contentious entities, such as 'subclinical hypothyroidism'.

We show that the rescue mechanisms of FT3 homeostasis, built into the intact HPT axis regulation, are strongly operative. Conversely, if disrupted, athyreotic patients on LT4 monotherapy solely depend on efficient T4–T3 conversion. However, when compromised in the absence of facilitating TSH-feedforward, this mechanism may fail, as modelled here. In a portion of patients, escalating the LT4 dose may therefore prove unsuccessful to restore the FT3 levels to their pre-surgical homeostatic level and resolve persistent symptoms. In such situations, targeted LT3 supplementation, similar to the natural homeostasis, may correct FT3 disequilibrium and also avoid potentially unfavourable effects of FT4 excess. The latter has been linked, even within the euthyroid range, to adverse cardiovascular outcomes and direct T4 effects (type 4 signalling), unrelated to T3 signalling, including malignant growth. In secondary hypothyroidism, pituitary TSH is deficient, which, in turn, affects TSH-feedforward, TSH–FT4 balance and FT3 homeostasis. Again, replacement guided by FT4 measurement alone may miss the optimum FT3 target. In the non-thyroidal illness syndrome, the low-FT3 is mainly due to a disturbed balance in the HPT regulation between peripheral type 1 and central type 2 deiodinase activities and intracellular T3 levels, whose net effect strengthens FT3 feedback inhibition on TSH, and weakens TSH-feedforward on FT3. This is mostly regarded as a beneficial energy-conserving mechanism, and treatment with thyroid hormones is contentious.

### Using hashimoto thyroiditis as gold standard to determine the upper limit value of thyroid stimulating hormone in a Chinese cohort [^112uevkd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism have normal level of serum thyroid hormones (T4, T3, FT3, FT4) and elevated TSH. These patienshave a higher incidence of lipid abnormalities, coronary heart disease, psychiatric disorders and pregnancy complications, although their clinical symptoms are very mild. Proper screening and treatment of these patients may help to improve the adverse outcome of the involving diseases. Therefore, to define the upper limit of TSH precisely had an important role in detecting patients who had mild thyroid dysfunction and might benefit from early intervention.

The upper limit of reference range for "normal" TSH has been the focus of debate in the recent decade. Some authors insisted on the conventional value of 4.0–5.0 mU/L as the upper limit of normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), others suggested it narrowed to 2.5–3.0 mU/L. As mentioned in the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) guideline, more than 95% of normal individuals had TSH below 2.5 mU/L. There were even data showing that African-Americans had very low incidence of HT with a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/L This value maybe the "true normal" upper limit for TSH, because African-Americans have very low prevalence of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) to elevate TSH.

Another question was put forward that which was the true set point of normal upper limit. Which centile (90, 95 or 99th) should be the real normal limit? The approximate questions related to glycemic threshold for diagnosing diabetes were already answered by using diabetic retinopathy (DR) as "gold" calibration standard. Referring to that and based on the correlation between HT (as end-point) and TSH value, we tried using the prevalence of HT as the calibration standard to determine the upper limit of TSH.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### The association between serum concentration of thyroid hormones and thyroid cancer: a cohort study [^1171CsQd]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The impact of serum thyroid hormone levels on thyroid cancer risk is unclear. Some studies reported that elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is associated with higher risk for incidence of thyroid cancer, but other studies reported no relationship. We conducted a large cohort study in 164,596 South Korean men and women who were free of thyroid cancer at baseline and underwent health examination with hormone levels of thyroid function. A parametric proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. During 2,277,749.78 person-years of follow-up, 1280 incident thyroid cancers were identified (men = 593, women = 687). Among men, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) for thyroid cancer comparing low levels of TSH with normal levels of TSH was 2.95 (1.67–5.23), whereas the corresponding HR (95% CI) in women was 1.5 (0.88–2.55). High levels of free T4 and free T3 were also associated with incident thyroid cancer in both men and women. In clinical implication, overt hyperthyroidism is associated with thyroid cancer in both men and women. Within the euthyroid range, the highest tertile of TSH was associated with a lower risk of thyroid cancer than the lowest TSH tertile and the highest FT4 tertile was associated with a higher risk of thyroid cancer than the lowest FT4 tertile in both men and women. Our finding indicates that low levels of TSH and high levels of FT4, even within the normal range, were associated with an increased risk of incident thyroid cancer.

### Defending plasma T3 is a biological priority [^112YExLJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of thyroid hormone is produced predominantly outside the thyroid parenchyma secondary to peripheral tissue deiodination of thyroxine (T4), with < 20% being secreted directly from the thyroid. In healthy individuals, plasma T3 is regulated by the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis and by homoeostatic changes in deiodinase expression. Therefore, with the exception of a minimal circadian rhythmicity, serum T3 levels are stable over long periods of time. Studies in rodents indicate that different levels of genetic disruption of the feedback mechanism and deiodinase system are met with increase in serum T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, while serum T3 levels remain stable. These findings have focused attention on serum T3 levels in patients with thyroid disease, with important clinical implications affecting therapeutic goals and choice of therapy for patients with hypothyroidism. Although monotherapy with levothyroxine is the standard of care for hypothyroidism, not all patients normalize serum T3 levels with many advocating for combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. The latter could be relevant for a significant number of patients that remain symptomatic on monotherapy with levothyroxine, despite normalization of serum TSH levels.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115izZ2e]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism. Table 3 describes rare causes of perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Don't order a total or free triiodothyronine (T3) level when assessing… [^112eqRqg]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

T4 is converted into T3 at the cellular level in virtually all organs. Intracellular T3 levels regulate pituitary secretion and blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, as well as the effects of thyroid hormone in multiple organs; a normal TSH indicates an adequate T4 dose. Conversion of T4 to T3 at the cellular level may not be reflected in the T3 level in the blood. Compared to patients with intact thyroid glands, patients taking T4 may have higher blood T4 and lower blood T3 levels. Thus the blood level of total or free T3 may be misleading; in most patients a normal TSH indicates a correct dose of T4.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Thyroid hormone metabolism in patients with congestive heart failure: the low triiodothyronine state [^116eng6b]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormone has multiple effects on the cardiovascular system, ranging from molecular and cellular effects to the consequent hemodynamic alterations. Consequently, thyroid function has been evaluated in small cohorts of patients with advanced heart failure that indicate a significant prevalence of morphologic or functional thyroid disorders. We sought to determine the prevalence of altered thyroid hormone metabolism in a broad spectrum of ambulatory heart failure patients. Thyroid function tests were evaluated in 132 ambulatory patients (98 males, 32 females, mean age, 67 years) with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF < 35%) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-IV symptoms. Hypothyroidism was defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) > 4.25 U/mL and low triiodothyronine (T3) state was defined as T3 levels < 80 ng/dL, with normal thyroxine (T4) and TSH level. Seven percent of patients were found to have primary hypothyroidism and 34% have a low T3 state. Of patients receiving amiodarone, 21% had elevated TSH levels and 76% had low T3 levels. The prevalence of abnormal thyroid function correlated with NYHA class. There is an unexpectedly high risk of hypothyroidism and low T3 syndrome in patients regardless of treatment with amiodarone, which appears to correlate with disease severity that requires further investigation.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Triiodothyronine (T3) measurement — clinical utility: Total triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is preferred over free T3 measurement, may be useful in the evaluation of patients with suppressed TSH levels, and is not helpful in the evaluation of patients with suspected hypothyroidism; total T3 measurement can be helpful in the management of patients on T4 and T3 combination therapy for the treatment of hypothyroidism, the monitoring of patients on suppressive doses of T4 for treatment of thyroid cancer, and the evaluation of patients on T4 treatment for hypothyroidism with suspected T4 to T3 conversion defects; in Graves' disease, alterations of T3/T4 ratio can be helpful in identifying patients whose disease may remit.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^115ZzzzT]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### Prognostic significance of low TSH concentration in patients with COVID-19 presenting with non-thyroidal illness syndrome [^112kZ9q6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed a serious health threat globally. It plays an important role in disease prevention and control to elucidate the clinical features of COVID-19, identify prognostic predictors and explore potential treatment methods. A study from China found that approximately 27.52% of patients with COVID-19 had non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTI), which is characterized by a decrease in triiodothyronine (T3) levels and/or a decrease in thyroxin (T4) levels without an increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. NTI typically occurs in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and is closely associated with the disease condition and prognosis. The above-mentioned study found that patients with NTI had up to 2.5-fold increased ratio for severe COVID-19.

Low free T3 (FT3) levels in patients with NTI are typically related to a worse prognosis. For example, low T3 syndrome was found to be a strong prognostic predictor of death in patients with cardiac disorders. In addition to FT3 levels, free T4 (FT4) or TSH levels might affect the mortality of patients with NTI. A study reported a worse prognosis for patients with sepsis and NTI presenting low T3 and T4 levels compared with those with low T3 levels alone. According to another study from Turkey, low FT3 levels and increased FT4 levels are considered independent predictors of long-term mortality risks in chronic patients with NTI. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 presenting with low FT3 and TSH levels appear to have a higher mortality rate, which is not completely consistent with previous NTI studies. Researchers have not clearly determined whether FT4 and TSH levels associated with NTI are related to the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The clinical characteristics of NTI in patients with COVID-19 need further elaboration. This study retrospectively analysed the clinical characteristics of NTI and explored whether TSH or FT4 levels were independent risk factors for mortality of hospitalized patients with both COVID-19 and NTI.

LT4 monotherapy biochemical patterns and FT3/TSH relationships — Studies show relatively high free thyroxine (FT4) levels and either an increased FT3/FT4 or FT4/FT3 ratio in LT4-treated patients, but whether these altered biochemical parameters have clinical consequences is unknown. In a prospective study, serum T3 levels were maintained as long as serum TSH was less than 4.5 mIU/L; in one retrospective study, 15% of patients had serum FT3 concentrations below normal; in another, serum FT3 was only maintained if serum TSH was below 0.3 mIU/L; taken together, several nonprospective studies indicate that LT4 monotherapy is characterized by low T3 levels in either some or many patients.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood [^111qrnmf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is defined as an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in association with a normal total or free thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3). It is frequently encountered in both neonatology and general paediatric practice; however, its clinical significance is widely debated. Currently there is no broad consensus on the investigation and treatment of these patients; specifically who to treat and what cut-off level of TSH should be used. This paper reviews the available evidence regarding investigation, treatments and outcomes reported for childhood SH.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113sN3tQ]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Resistance to thyroid hormone syndromes — biochemical patterns and tissue effects: The clinical syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), caused by inactivating mutations in TRα (RTHα) or TRβ (RTHβ) could perhaps also be considered as a very particular example of how TSH may not necessarily reflect thyroid hormone signaling in other tissues than the pituitary and the hypothalamus; patients with RTHα have normal levels of TSH in combination with a low FT4 and a high T3 and suffer from local hypothyroidism in tissues that predominantly express TRα, while patients with RTHβ have normal or elevated levels of TSH despite elevated levels of FT4 and FT3 and suffer from thyroid hormone overexposure in TRα-expressing tissues; the molecular pathology of RTHβ is an unbalanced hormonal signaling due to the combination of defective TRβ and otherwise normal TRα receptors exposed to supraphysiologic levels of thyroid hormone, resulting in a mix of hypothyroid symptoms and signs related to tissues such as the liver where the β-isoform is present in higher concentrations, and hyperthyroid symptoms and signs in tissues enriched with TRα such as the myocardium.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112igscD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results reveal that combined T4 + T3 therapy does not significantly alter TSH levels, yet it influences free T3 levels, aligning with findings from previous research. Our analysis also shows a notably lower total T4 and a higher total T3 with combined therapy. This supports that combined therapy improves T3 levels, which could help patients with issues in the conversion of T4 to T3 in the peripheral tissues. The variable impacts on metabolic parameters and quality of life, as noted in prior studies on T4 + T3 therapy, may be attributed to the subjective nature of quality-of-life assessments and differing metrics utilized across studies. Furthermore, our findings show that TSH and T3 levels change significantly with DTE. This suggests that natural formulations, which contain both T3 and T4, may have different biochemical but not clinical effects when compared to synthetic therapies. These observed discrepancies could stem from heterogeneity in patient populations, study designs, dosing regimens, and the sensitivity of assays used to measure thyroid hormone levels, highlighting the complexity and individual variability in thyroid hormone replacement therapy responses.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- **Epidemiology**: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- **Disease course**: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

### Thyroid function and metabolic syndrome in the population-based lifeLines cohort study [^114EyvF3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of medical conditions that reflects overnutrition, sedentary lifestyles, and resultant adiposity. Metabolic abnormalities such as abdominal obesity, hyperglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia often are present together, suggesting that they are not independent of one another and that they may share underlying causes and mechanisms. Having MetS places a subject at a substantially increased risk to develop serious diseases like type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

In an earlier paper we described results from the population-based PREVEND study, and reported that low normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels were significantly related to a higher prevalence of all five MetS components in a group of almost 2300 people from the general population. From this, we concluded that subjects with thyroid function in the low normal range already are at increased cardiovascular risk.

In recent years, there have been confusing results on the relationship between thyroid hormone levels within the normal range and cardiovascular risk factors and MetS. Several papers have described a relationship between thyroid hormone parameters and components of MetS. However, some authors have reported an association between thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and metabolic risk factors, whereas others have observed that high normal free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels, and the FT3FT4-ratio were related to MetS. One of the largest study until now evaluated 44,196 individuals (of whom 25,147 men), and reported that FT4 in men was significantly associated with blood pressure (BP), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and triglycerides (TG), and in women was associated with BP, HDL-C, FBG, waist circumference (WC). The authors however did not see an association with MetS, when adjusted for age. They did not adjust for smoking or alcohol, two important factors which influence the prevalence of MetS components, like low HDL-C, elevated triglycerides (TG), and -in women- increased WC. Another study from Korea evaluated data from 13,496 middle-aged individuals, and found a relationship between higher T3 and T3/T4 and an unfavourable metabolic profile. And a very recent paper reported in over 132,000 subjects that higher FT3/FT4 ratio was associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome parameters and insulin resistance, adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking status and menopausal status (in women).

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^113XpJMe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Approach to Diagnosis

Considering the clinical context is helpful when evaluating a patient with discordant thyroid function. For instance, objective abnormalities (eg, goiter, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, increased uptake on thyroid isotope scan) can suggest that the observed biochemical hyperthyroidism is genuine. Sedation with chloral hydrate (often undertaken in children) prior to blood sampling is a recognized cause of transient, reversible hyperthyroxinemia. Potential confounding factors, including altered physiological states (eg, pregnancy), intercurrent illness or concurrent medication should be considered (also reviewed in detail in).

Amiodarone Therapy

Changes in TFTs are almost universal in amiodarone-treated patients, with 2% to 24% developing overt thyroid dysfunction. The drug inhibits TH biosynthesis and pituitary type 2 deiodinase activity, prompting an initial rise in circulating TSH (1 week after commencement), which typically normalizes by 12 weeks. Subsequently, the drug blocks hepatic, type 1 deiodinase activity, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 and breakdown of reverse T3, resulting in a TFT profile of raised/high normal T4, low/low-normal T3, and markedly elevated reverse T3. This pattern may be evident as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment and can persist after drug withdrawal, with the changes in TFTs being dose dependent. Due to inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may require T4 replacement in supraphysiologic dosage to normalize TSH and therefore exhibit concurrently raised FT4 and TSH levels.

Nonthyroidal Illness

Prolonged or severe critical illness is often associated with abnormal TFTs; typically, circulating FT3 and FT4 fall (usually to low-normal levels), reverse T3 rises, and TSH values are low or low-normal. The degree of excursion in hormones is related to illness severity. Recovery is heralded by a rise in TSH with subsequent normalization of T4 and T3. Notably, changes in TFTs are not restricted to critical illness, with a low FT3, raised TSH and FT4 pattern being recorded in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery and in the weeks following myocardial infarction.

Acute Psychiatric States

True hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis can be associated with psychiatric abnormalities. Conversely, transient hormonal changes (typically elevated circulating FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH) are seen in patients (∼15%) admitted with acute psychiatric states, with this pattern being short lived, reversible, and not associated with a particular psychiatric condition.

The aims were to establish a gestational-age specific curve for serum total thyroxine (T4) levels and to compare pregnancy outcomes of euthyroid women with those identified to have subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) defined by an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in conjunction with either total T4 or free T4 determinations.

Study Design

Over a 2.5 year period, serum thyroid analytes were measured in all women presenting for prenatal care. After exclusion of women with overt thyroid disorders, the normal distribution of serum total T4 levels were determined by quantile curves for those screened in the first 20 weeks and who were delivered of a singleton infant weighing at least 500 g. Pregnancy outcomes for women with an elevated TSH and normal total T4 concentrations were analyzed and compared with those of women identified to have SCH defined by normal free T4 levels.

Results

Of 17,298 women tested, serum total T4 increased into the second trimester and plateaued around 16 weeks. The upper threshold for total T4 ranged from 12.6 to 16.4 μg/dL, and the lower threshold ranged from 5.3 to 8.0 μg/dL. Women identified to have SCH defined by serum free T4, total T4, or both were at risk for preterm delivery (P = 0.007) and placental abruption (P = 0.013) when compared with euthyroid women.

Conclusion

When combined with elevated TSH levels, free or total T4 determinations are equally sensitive to identify women with SCH who are at increased risk for preterm birth and placental abruption when compared with euthyroid women.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^114rAP4D]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

Thyroid hormone analogs and resistance to thyroid hormone — treatment goals and role of analogs are stated as follows: "The therapeutic goals of the treatment of patients with genetic syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone are to improve the symptoms caused by excessive TRα signaling, while minimizing the symptoms caused by deficient TRβ signaling". Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. "Although preliminary data from small case series suggest that the use of TRIAC in patients with genetic syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone may be promising, more clinical research is needed before the use of thyroid hormone analogs can be recommended for this indication". Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. Mechanistic background notes that resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare genetic disease with increased serum TSH and inappropriately normal or increased FT4; patients with RTHα have normal TSH with low FT4 and high T3, whereas patients with RTHβ have normal or elevated TSH with elevated FT4 and FT3; most forms are autosomal dominant TRβ mutations, and approximately 1000 patients in 350 families with TRβ mutations have been described.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

### FT3 and FT3 / FT4 ratio are decreased and not compensated by levothyroxine treatment in TKI-treated thyroid cancer patients [^113TkG8G]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Increasing the dose of LT4 was effective in restoring both TSH and FT4 to pre-TKI levels in all patients. This indicates that additional doses of LT4 are able to overcome the TKI-induced mechanism underlying the reduction of FT4. However, increasing LT4 doses did not restore FT3 level and FT3/FT4 ratio to baseline levels in 55% of patients. The FT3/FT4 ratio – especially in thyroidectomised patients treated with LT4 – reliably reflects the thyroid status and is the best indicator of the amount of T4 that is converted to T3 by peripheral D2 deiodination. Thus, the return of TSH to its pre-treatment levels does not necessarily correspond to rebalancing the thyroid axis. TSH is effectively inhibited by increasing doses of LT4. However, while the hypothalamic D2 is relatively insensitive to the T4-induced degradation, the peripheral D2 is highly sensitive to T4, which activates its degradation. As a consequence, the excess of T4 needed to suppress TSH secretion may reduce peripheral D2, thus the proportion of tissue conversion of T4 into T3. This may occur and further potentiate the inhibitory effect of the TKI on T3 production.

For this reasoning, in three consecutive patients treated with selpercatinib who showed a treatment-dependent reduction in total T3 and FT3 levels associated with increased TSH levels, we chose to reduce the dose of LT4 and to administer LT3 at an LT4/LT3 ratio of 11:1, lower than what is recommended in the context of hypothyroidism replacement therapy (i.e. 15:1), based on the hypothesis of an altered function of D2 caused by the TKI. This strategy normalised TSH while maintaining an FT3/FT4 ratio similar to baseline thanks to the increase in FT3 levels. In addition, the presence of normal/elevated total serum T4 level even after the reduction of LT4 dose suggests a serum T4 accumulation – probably due to a marked selpercatinib-dependent block in the T4-to-T3 or rT3 conversion. The small number of patients under study does not allow statistical significance to be reached, but these data provide a clear indication of the ability of LT4 + LT3 combination therapy to normalise the FT3/FT4 ratio while maintaining serum TSH levels at target.

### The clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^1151xyer]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) is defined as serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels within their respective reference ranges in the presence of abnormal serum TSH levels. SCTD is being diagnosed more frequently in clinical practice in young and middle-aged people as well as in the elderly. However, the clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. Subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism can have repercussions on the cardiovascular system and bone, as well as on other organs and systems. However, the treatment and management of SCTD and population screening are controversial despite the potential risk of progression to overt disease, and there is no consensus on the thyroid hormone and thyrotropin cutoff values at which treatment should be contemplated. Opinions differ regarding tissue effects, symptoms, signs, and cardiovascular risk. Here, we critically review the data on the prevalence and progression of SCTD, its tissue effects, and its prognostic implications. We also examine the mechanisms underlying tissue alterations in SCTD and the effects of replacement therapy on progression and tissue parameters. Lastly, we address the issue of the need to treat slight thyroid hormone deficiency or excess in relation to the patient's age.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

Thyroid hormone status discordance between pituitary and peripheral tissues — There are specific instances in which there appears to be discordance between the thyroid status of the pituitary gland, as reflected by serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the status of other tissues indicated by biomarkers, and the clinical significance is not known. Mechanistic data indicate tissues can have variable tissue-specific thyroid status and that normalization of TSH does not ensure uniform triiodothyronine (T3) levels across tissues; animal and in vitro/rodent studies show primary changes in type 2 or type 3 deiodinase (D2 or D3) within a tissue can alter thyroid status without affecting circulating T3, thyroxine (T4), or TSH, with reports of relatively T3-deficient tissues despite the same plasma T3 and T4 and sometimes normal serum TSH; human studies have not been reported.

### Infant with suspected congenital hypothyroidism [^116PZGk9]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism — screening approaches, pitfalls, and interpretation: Newborn screening (NBS) for congenital hypothyroidism is jurisdiction-specific with programs using primary thyroxine (T4) screens with backup thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) testing, primary TSH screens with T4 backup testing, or combining both, and sensitivity and specificity vary by assay methodology. If NBS is obtained too early (< 24 hours of life), a false positive result can result due to physiological TSH surge that occurs several hours postnatally. Secondary/central hypothyroidism due to hypopituitarism can lead to falsely normal results in programs with primary TSH screening, and signs suspicious for hypothalamic-pituitary abnormality include midline facial dysmorphology, hypoglycemia, micropenis or visual abnormalities such as nystagmus. Transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity, caused by immaturity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, can result in low T4 levels. Congenital hypothyroidism may be multifactorial and may be primary or secondary. In Primary Hypothyroidism, free thyroxine (FT4) is low or normal and TSH is elevated (noted as "MOST COMMON"), whereas in Central Hypothyroidism FT4 is low but TSH may be normal or low (rare). Total and Free triiodothyronine (T3) are generally not necessary for screening and monitoring, and thyroid imaging (ultrasonography or scintigraphy) is sometimes performed but should never delay initiation of LT4 therapy.

The clinical utility of TSH measurement — serum TSH is widely used for diagnosis and screening, with age-specific interpretation needs; in newborns < 3 days of age results are confounded by the postnatal surge, while in newborns 3 days to 1 month a serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally treated as a clinical cutoff requiring immediate action; primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency; in the elderly the upper bound of the TSH reference interval increases with age; interpretation leverages the log-linear relationship between TSH and free thyroxine (fT4) and must consider factors such as iodine intake, age, sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1141dvkY]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

Levothyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations — clinical significance of within‑reference‑range T3 changes: The significance of perturbations in serum triiodothyronine concentrations within the reference range or of mildly low serum triiodothyronine concentrations is unknown. According to the current model, normalizing serum thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) is generally considered the target of therapy, and serum T3 is typically not measured or monitored, and direct evidence on whether small decrements in plasma T3 have clinically important sequelae is lacking. Some data in humans suggest maintenance of serum T3 concentrations is clinically important; for example, in one study of 15 athyreotic patients taking LT4, a progressive 50% fall in T3 induced by PTU over 8 days led to a doubling of TSH even though T4 was constant.

Hypothyroidism treatment — future research priorities include strategies to avoid iatrogenic thyroid disease in treated individuals and to aid compliance with levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, and a better understanding of maternal-fetal physiology during pregnancy with development of improved titration of LT4 for hypothyroid pregnant patients. Additional needs are further studies of soft gel LT4 capsules; further study and improved standardization of compounded formulations of LT4 and/or liothyronine (LT3); development of additional biomarkers of euthyroidism, which may supplement the use of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as a biomarker; and improved understanding of how triiodothyronine (T3) levels are affected by age and disease status with reference ranges indexed to age and health status, including clarification of the relative importance of maintaining specific serum T3 concentrations. Research is encouraged into the relationship between serum T3 and T3 concentrations in specific tissues; development of more accurate assays to measure serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (FT3), total T3, and free thyroxine (FT4); development of a sustained release T3 preparation that can be prospectively tested in clinical trials, e.g., in combination with LT4 in a physiologic ratio of about 14:1; and, if such a preparation is unavailable, studying when, if ever, the use of LT3 would be beneficial in selected patients with apparent decreased T4 to T3 conversion and disproportionately low serum T3 levels. Long-term outcome research using thyroid extracts that includes documentation of the consequences of excursions in serum T3 concentrations, development of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile, and pursuit of research into developing thyroid stem cells as a potential avenue for understanding thyrocyte physiology and as a possible future treatment for hypothyroidism are also identified.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — thyroid and prolactin assessment: Assessing thyroid function and prolactin levels is important in adolescents and women with FHA, and if a patient has more profound hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin > 100 ng/mL), she will require additional evaluation that is beyond the scope of this guideline; if TSH is low, one should consider a diagnostic assessment for thyrotoxicosis, especially if the free T4 is high, whereas if TSH is high, and free T4 is low or in the lower range of normal, then clinicians must consider subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism, and conversely, a normal or minimally elevated TSH with a low free T4 may indicate central hypothyroidism; in FHA, thyroid function is similar to that seen with any chronic illness, that is, TSH and free T4 levels in the lower range of normal, which generally reverse to normal with weight gain and psychological recovery, and evaluating basal pituitary hormones is usually sufficient to establish hypopituitarism while pituitary stimulation tests often do not determine the causes of the pituitary hypofunction; food, sleep, exercise, coitus, nipple stimulation, breast examination, lactation, and many medications can elevate prolactin concentrations.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Discordant test results between thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels can lead to unnecessary follow-up, patient anxiety, and increased health care costs without clinical benefit. The US Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence for screening asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for thyroid disease. 7 Given the risks of unnecessary treatment and overtreatment, it is critical to use a patient-centered approach. When should thyroid function tests be performed, and when should they be avoided. For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained.

1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. 8 Measuring TSH levels is also recommended as the first-line test for pregnant patients with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, or a clinical concern for thyroid disease. In pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, TSH levels should be maintained between the trimester-specific lower limit and 2. 5 mIU/L, and TSH measurement should be obtained every 4 to 6 weeks to ensure appropriate levels of levothyroxine.
8. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mVjnY]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid function testing (1,23) are based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction with a population prevalence of ∼5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accuracy may be achieved by defining a normal reference range for the combination of thyroid hormones and TSH.

However, any model whereby judgment of the thyroid status includes consideration of the TSH level is anomalous, in that the levels of other physiological parameters are not judged by the levels of their controlling hormones. For example, whether or not an individual has hypoglycemia or hypercalcemia is not determined by reference to insulin or parathyroid hormone levels, respectively. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, though helpful in diagnosing adrenal autonomy, are not considered diagnostic for Cushing's syndrome. In general, the level of a controlling hormone is used to determine the cause of a disturbance rather than identifying whether or not there is a disturbance.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

Child with suspected acquired hypothyroidism — laboratory patterns and screening notes are as follows: In Primary Hypothyroidism (thyroid failure), free thyroxine (FT4) is low or normal and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated, whereas in Central Hypothyroidism (pituitary/hypothalamic cause), FT4 is low but TSH may be normal or low (rare). Thyroid auto-antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibodies) may be helpful in determining underlying etiology of hypothyroidism, and total and free triiodothyronine (T3) are generally not necessary for screening and monitoring. Mildly abnormal TSH levels (< 10 uIU/ml) with normal FT4 are not likely to cause symptoms and can be followed and repeated over time, and a good portion of children with this subclinical hypothyroidism revert back to normal thyroid function over time. Hyperlipidemia may be seen secondary to hypothyroidism; consider screening with TSH, FT4 in dyslipidemia, and consider screening for hypothyroidism in depression especially in setting of poor linear growth. Thyroid ultrasonography is not generally required unless thyroid gland is significantly enlarged and/or asymmetric, or there is suspicion of thyroid nodule. Common obesity is generally exogenous and unlikely to be secondary to hypothyroidism, and screening for thyroid dysfunction is not recommended in absence of symptoms, poor linear growth or other risk factors.

### Serum thyroid hormone balance in levothyroxine monotherapy-treated patients with atrophic thyroid after radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease [^114shraW]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

In athyreotic or atrophic thyroid patients on LT4 after thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment, patients with normal TSH levels had relatively low serum fT3 levels, whereas patients with mildly suppressed TSH levels had normal serum fT3 levels. The question arises as to which of such two patient groups is in a euthyroid condition. The extensive literature on "subclinical hyperthyroidism" has demonstrated an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, as well as low bone density and fractures in patients who have low TSH levels while receiving LT4. Moreover, in the athyreotic patients with normal TSH and low T3 levels, the relatively higher serum T4 levels that accompany LT4 monotherapy seem to result in normal T3 receptor occupancy and TSH in pituitary thyrotrophs. On the other hand, in peripheral tissues, the relatively higher serum T4 levels could impair intracellular T3 production via downregulation of D2. In fact, an animal study has shown that LT4 alone administered to thyroidectomized rats at doses to normalize plasma TSH levels does not normalize T3 contents in some tissues. In another study of rats, Werneck et al. reported that a combination of high serum T4 and low serum T3 levels during T4 monotherapy rats had consequences for thyroid hormone action, as reflected in the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, all of which exhibited indications of hypothyroidism despite normal serum TSH levels. In a previous study conducted in humans, we compared serum levels of lipoproteins, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and bone metabolic markers before and after thyroidectomy. The postoperative serum SHBG and bone alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly increased in the patients with strongly suppressed TSH levels. The postoperative serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly increased and the serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b levels were significantly decreased in patients with normal TSH levels. In patients with mildly suppressed TSH and fT3 levels equivalent to their preoperative levels, all metabolic markers remained equivalent to their preoperative levels. Recently, in a large LT4-treated population with normal serum TSH, participants exhibited lower serum T3 levels and differed in terms of both objective and subjective measures. In addition, a meta-analysis performed by McAninch et al. showed that serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels remain high in LT4-treated euthyroid patients. Overall, the presence of biochemical markers of thyroid function in animal and human studies of LT4-treated athyreotic conditions suggests that patients with normal TSH might not be euthyroid in all tissues, whereas patients with a low TSH are less likely to have hyperthyroid symptoms.
