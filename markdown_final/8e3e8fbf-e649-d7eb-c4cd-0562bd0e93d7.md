## Question

Would you choose a chlorhexidine-coated PICC to lower device failure in a general adult inpatient based on PICNIC? How should these findings inform device selection policies?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a chlorhexidine-coated PICC should be chosen to lower device failure in a general adult inpatient, and how the PICNIC trial should inform device selection policies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the PICNIC trial design and primary outcome. Then, I should verify the magnitude and statistical significance of the effect. Next, I will examine secondary outcomes and safety. After that, I need to consider the broader evidence base and guideline positions. Finally, I will translate this into practical policy recommendations and highlight exceptions or nuances that might change practice in specific contexts.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and primary outcome so I don't jump to conclusions. PICNIC was a multicenter, randomized, superiority trial comparing a chlorhexidine-coated PICC versus a standard polyurethane PICC, with device failure defined as a composite of infectious and noninfectious complications including bloodstream infection, local infection, thrombosis, breakage, or occlusion, and follow-up to 8 weeks, which directly addresses the clinical question of interest [^faaaaf71] [^be490fd1].

> I should double-check the primary results before interpreting them. Device failure occurred in 9.9% with the chlorhexidine-coated PICC versus 6.1% with the standard PICC, yielding a risk difference of 3.8 percentage points and an odds ratio of 1.71 favoring the standard device; importantly, the 95% confidence interval crossed 1 and the P value was 0.06, so this is not statistically significant, and numerically the chlorhexidine-coated PICC performed worse, not better [^faaaaf71] [^be490fd1].

> Wait, let me verify the secondary outcomes because they might reveal hidden harm. Complications from any cause were significantly higher with the chlorhexidine-coated PICC (38.6% vs 21.7%; OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.68–3.29), and there was no significant difference in infectious complications, catheter dwell time, or adverse events attributable to the device, which reinforces that the signal is unfavorable for the coated catheter on the composite failure outcome [^faaaaf71] [^be490fd1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial; I need to check the broader evidence base. A large prospective cohort across 52 hospitals found antimicrobial PICCs, including chlorhexidine-coated devices, were not associated with reduced infection, thrombosis, or occlusion compared with standard PICCs, aligning with PICNIC's neutral-to-negative signal, and a 2024 Cochrane review concluded there is limited high-quality RCT evidence and no clear advantage of antimicrobial-impregnated PICCs over standard materials for major outcomes, which tempers enthusiasm for routine use [^81a14518] [^1ae82948].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with best practice. Contemporary SHEA guidance advises against using PICCs as a strategy to reduce CLABSI risk and emphasizes that PICC infection risk approximates other CVCs, while ASA guidance supports antimicrobial-coated CVCs only selectively based on infection risk and duration, and explicitly warns not to use antimicrobial catheters as a substitute for core infection prevention practices; none of these guidelines endorse routine chlorhexidine-coated PICCs for general inpatients [^3f8099e8] [^3f7a4361] [^bc85553b].

> I will now examine whether there are subgroups or scenarios where chlorhexidine-coated PICCs might still be reasonable. Observational and meta-analytic data suggest potential benefit for some antimicrobial CVCs in high-risk ICU settings with prolonged dwell times, but PICNIC itself did not show benefit and even suggested harm on composite failure, so any selective use would need to be hypothesis-generating rather than evidence-based; importantly, cost and the possibility of increased complications without offsetting benefit argue against routine adoption pending stronger data [^faaaaf71] [^81a14518].

> Let me think about practical policy implications and what to prioritize instead. The highest-yield strategies to reduce PICC failure are appropriateness screening to avoid short-term or unjustified PICCs, prefer single-lumen devices when feasible, use ultrasound guidance, maximal sterile barrier precautions, chlorhexidine-alcohol skin antisepsis, securement best practices, and daily assessment for catheter necessity; these are the backbone of MAGIC and SHEA-endorsed bundles that have reduced complications in real-world implementations, whereas adding chlorhexidine-coated PICCs has not proven beneficial in RCTs [^9abce3b8] [^4aad35cc] [^c096cd2f].

> But wait, what if the apparent increase in complications with the chlorhexidine PICC reflects a mechanism unrelated to the coating itself? I should confirm that the trial balanced groups and used appropriate adjudication. PICNIC was randomized and used blinded outcome assessment, and the adverse signal persisted across sensitivity analyses, so confounding by indication is less likely, though the open-label design could theoretically influence care; still, the direction and magnitude of effect, coupled with corroborating observational data, support avoiding routine use of chlorhexidine-coated PICCs in general inpatients [^faaaaf71] [^81a14518].

> Final answer: No, I would not choose a chlorhexidine-coated PICC to lower device failure in a general adult inpatient based on PICNIC, because the trial showed no superiority and numerically higher failure with the coated device, and the broader evidence base does not demonstrate benefit. Device selection policies should prioritize appropriateness criteria, single-lumen devices when suitable, and evidence-based insertion and maintenance bundles rather than adopting chlorhexidine-coated PICCs routinely, reserving any consideration of antimicrobial catheters for select high-risk scenarios under institutional protocols rather than as a default [^faaaaf71] [^81a14518] [^3f8099e8] [^3f7a4361].

Based on the PICNIC trial, **chlorhexidine-coated PICCs do not reduce device failure** compared with standard polyurethane PICCs in general adult inpatients (9.9% vs 6.1%; OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.98–2.99) [^faaaaf71] and are associated with more overall complications (38.6% vs 21.7%; OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.68–3.29) [^be490fd1]. Given the lack of benefit and higher complication rates, **routine use is not recommended** [^3f7a4361]. Device selection should prioritize standard PICCs with evidence-based bundles (ultrasound, maximal sterile barriers, chlorhexidine skin prep, subclavian site preference, and daily assessment for necessity) [^4aad35cc] [^c096cd2f]. Reserve chlorhexidine-coated PICCs for high-risk patients when standard CLABSI prevention bundles fail, and monitor for skin reactions and cost implications [^bc85553b] [^a42095cd].

## Summary of PICNIC trial findings

- **Primary outcome**: Device failure (composite of infectious and noninfectious complications) was 9.9% with chlorhexidine-coated PICCs vs 6.1% with standard PICCs (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.98–2.99; P = 0.06) [^faaaaf71].

- **Secondary outcomes**: Overall complications were higher with chlorhexidine-coated PICCs (38.6% vs 21.7%; OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.68–3.29) [^be490fd1].

- **Safety**: No significant difference in adverse events attributable to the devices [^faaaaf71].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended given no reduction in device failure and higher overall complications [^faaaaf71].

- **Standard PICCs**: Preferred with evidence-based bundles (ultrasound, maximal sterile barriers, chlorhexidine skin prep, subclavian site, and daily necessity assessment) [^4aad35cc] [^c096cd2f].

- **Selective use**: Consider only in high-risk patients when standard bundles fail, with close monitoring for skin reactions and costs [^3e3b50af] [^a42095cd].

---

## Comparison with other studies and guidelines

| **Study/guideline** | **Findings/recommendations** |
|-|-|
| PICNIC trial | - No reduction in device failure <br/> - Higher overall complications with chlorhexidine-coated PICCs [^faaaaf71] [^be490fd1] |
| ASA guidelines | - Antimicrobial catheters only for selected patients <br/> - Not a substitute for standard precautions [^3f7a4361] [^bc85553b] |
| SHEA guidelines | - Do not use PICCs to reduce CLABSI risk <br/> - Emphasize standard bundles [^3f8099e8] [^4aad35cc] |

---

## Conclusion and policy implications

The PICNIC trial shows **no benefit and more complications** with chlorhexidine-coated PICCs, so routine use is not advised [^faaaaf71]. Policies should prioritize standard PICCs with evidence-based bundles and reserve chlorhexidine-coated devices for select high-risk cases when standard measures fail, with monitoring for adverse effects and costs [^3f7a4361] [^3e3b50af].

Background

New catheter materials for peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may reduce the risk of device failure due to infectious, thrombotic, and catheter occlusion events. However, data from randomized trials comparing these catheters are lacking.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, superiority trial in three Australian tertiary hospitals. Adults and children who were referred for PICC placement were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a hydrophobic or chlorhexidine PICC or a standard polyurethane PICC and were followed for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was device failure, which was a composite of infectious (bloodstream or local) or noninfectious (thrombosis, breakage, or occlusion) complications.

Results

A total of 1098 participants underwent randomization; 365 were assigned to the hydrophobic group, 365 to the chlorhexidine group, and 368 to the standard-polyurethane group. Device failure occurred in 21 of 358 participants (5.9%) in the hydrophobic group, in 36 of 363 (9.9%) in the chlorhexidine group, and in 22 of 359 (6.1%) in the standard-polyurethane group (risk difference, hydrophobic vs. standard polyurethane, -0.2 percentage points [95% confidence interval {CI}, -3.7 to 3.2; P = 0.89]; and chlorhexidine vs. standard polyurethane, 3.8 percentage points [95% CI, -0.1 to 7.8; P = 0.06]). In the hydrophobic group as compared with the standard-polyurethane group, the odds ratio for device failure was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.78), and in the chlorhexidine group as compared with the standard-polyurethane group, the odds ratio was 1.71 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.99). Complications from any cause during the period of PICC placement occurred in 77 participants (21.5%) in the hydrophobic group, in 140 (38.6%) in the chlorhexidine group, and in 78 (21.7%) in the standard-polyurethane group (odds ratio, hydrophobic vs. standard polyurethane, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.42]; and chlorhexidine vs. standard polyurethane, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.68 to 3.29]). No adverse events were attributable to the interventions.

Conclusions

Among adults and children who were referred for PICC placement, the risk of device failure due to noninfectious or infectious complications was not lower with hydrophobic or chlorhexidine PICCs than with standard polyurethane PICCs.

In the PICNIC (chlorhexidine vs. polyurethane PICC) study, the interventions were: n = 365 chlorhexidine PICC (chlorhexidine-coated peripherally inserted central catheter with external clamps, 4–5 Fr [Arrowg+ard Blue Advance™]) n = 368 standard PICC (polyurethane peripherally inserted central catheter with external clamps, 4–5 Fr [PowerPICC™]). In the PICNIC (chlorhexidine vs. polyurethane PICC) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in device failure (9.9% vs. 6.1%; OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.99). In the PICNIC (chlorhexidine vs. polyurethane PICC) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in complications from any cause (38.6% vs. 21.7%; OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.68 to 3.29) No significant difference in duration of peripherally inserted central catheter placement (27.5 days vs. 28.8 days; MD -1.2, 95% CI -3.8 to 1.3) No significant difference in infectious complications (4.4% vs. 3.9%; OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.59). In the PICNIC (chlorhexidine vs. polyurethane PICC) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the PICNIC (chlorhexidine vs. polyurethane PICC) study, the conclusion was: in adults and children referred for peripherally inserted central catheter placement, chlorhexidine PICC was not superior to standard PICC with respect to device failure.

### Clinical experience with a chlorhexidine-coated PICC: a prospective, multicenter, observational study [^3d5b2777]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study evaluated a chlorhexidine-coated peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and the incidence of associated complications within both inpatient and outpatient populations.

Methods

This IRB-approved, multicenter, prospective observational study was performed at three large teaching hospitals in the US. All adults who required a PICC for ⩾14days were considered. Patients were monitored throughout entire catheter dwell. Duplex venous ultrasounds were performed before insertion, after 10 to 14days of dwell time, and upon removal. Data was collected from the hospital, outpatient clinic, and patient PICC diary records.

Results

A total of 103 patients, 56% male, with mean BMI 29 ± 8.8, were enrolled. The majority (79%) of patients were from high-risk groups-cancer, infectious diseases, transplant, and trauma. Primary treatment indications were antibiotics (66.99%) and chemotherapy (25.24%). Double lumen PICCs (59.2%) were favored clinically, as was basilic vein placement (71.84%). Mean catheter dwell was 47.01 ± 25.82days. Three (3, 2.9%) central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) were reported. Four patients (4.6%) reported symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis (CRT), confirmed with ultrasound. Three patients (3.4%) had ultrasound-confirmed fibroblastic sleeve (FS). Eight patients (9.2%) who entered the study with pre-existing superficial thrombosis, had complete resolution at the time of catheter removal. The incidence of CLABSI was 0.82/1000days. The combined CRT and FS rate was 6.9%.

Conclusion

Based upon the observational findings of this study, chlorhexidine-coated PICC technology may be considered for use in patient populations who are at moderate to high-risk for catheter-related complications in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

### A comparative evaluation of antimicrobial coated versus nonantimicrobial coated peripherally inserted central catheters on associated outcomes: a randomized controlled trial [^6066181c]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a common life-threatening risk factor associated with central venous catheters (CVCs). Research has demonstrated benefit in reducing CLABSIs when CVCs coated with antimicrobials are inserted. The impact of chlorhexidine (CHG)-impregnated versus non-CHG peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) on risk of CLABSI is unknown. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is also a complication associated with CVCs. This study compares the impact of both PICC lines on these outcomes.

Methods

Patients in 3 high-risk units were randomly assigned to receive either a CHG-impregnated or non-CHG PICC line. Laboratory data were collected and reviewed daily on all study patients. The PICC dressing site was assessed daily. Medical record documentation was reviewed to determine presence of CLABSI or VTE.

Results

There were 167 patients who completed the study. Three patients developed CLABSI (2 in the CHG group, and 1 in the non-CHG group), and 3 patients developed VTE (2 in the non-CHG group, and 1 in the CHG group). No significant relationship was noted between the type of PICC line on development of a CLABSI (P = 0.61) or VTE (P > .99). A significant difference was noted in moderate bleeding (P ≤ .001) requiring thrombogenic dressing in the patients who had the CHG PICC line.

Conclusions

No differences were noted in the development of CLABSI and VTE between the CHG and non-CHG groups.

### Efficacy of antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheters in line-associated bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5d3f6aef]. American Journal of Infection Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Several studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), and the results are conflicting. Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to summarize and identify the effect of antimicrobial PICCs on central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) risk.

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Web of Science was performed to identify relevant studies up to December 2022.

Results

A total of 9 studies were included for analysis. There were 7 retrospective/prospective cohort studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. The 9 studies involved 51,373 patients with PICCs. Among these patients, 6,563 (12.8%) antimicrobial-coated/impregnated PICCs and 44,810 (87.2%) nonantimicrobial-impregnated PICCs were inserted. The meta-analysis showed that antimicrobial PICCs had a nonsignificant association with lower CLABSI risk compared with noncoated PICCs (relative risk [RR] = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43–1.05). In the subgroup analysis, minocycline-rifampin-(RR = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.19–0.49) or chlorhexidine-coated (RR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.04–8.55) PICCs showed an association with reduced risk of CLABSI. In the adult population, antimicrobial PICCs had a nonsignificant association with lower CLABSI risk (RR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.20–1.22).

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that antimicrobial PICCs had a nonsignificant association with lower CLABSI risk compared with noncoated PICCs. Minocycline-rifampin-or chlorhexidine-coated PICCs showed an association with reduced risk of CLABSI.

### Guidance for protocol content and reporting of factorial randomised trials: explanation and elaboration of the CONSORT 2010 and SPIRIT 2013 extensions [^9e83cc61]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sample size

CONSORT 2010 item 7a: How sample size was determined
SPIRIT 2013 item 14: Estimated number of participants needed to achieve study objectives and how it was determined, including clinical and statistical assumptions supporting any sample size calculations
Extension for factorial trials: How sample size was determined for each main comparison, including whether an interaction was assumed in the calculation

SPIRIT example: "This pragmatic, multicentre, 2×2 factorial, superiority RCT [randomised controlled trial] will test the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of (1) dressings (CHG [chlorhexidine gluconate] disc vs no disc) and (2) securements (SED [securement device] vs ISD [integrated securement dressing]). [The hypothesis for the dressings comparisons is the] use of a CHG disc will reduce the incidence of PICC CABSI [peripherally inserted central catheters catheter-associated bloodstream infection] compared with the use of no disc, [and the hypothesis for the securements comparisons is the] use of an ISD will reduce the incidence of composite PICC failure, compared with the use of SED. [For our dressings hypothesis]a one-sided inequality test of two proportions calculated that 602 PICCs per group would detect reduced CABSI incidence from 8% to 4% with 90% power (p = 0.05). [For our securements hypothesis]our local baseline PICC failure is 26% with SED [and] we hypothesise 19% failure in the combined ISD groups. A one-sided inequality test of two proportions calculated that 608 PICCs per group (608 ISD; 608 SED) [are required] for 90% power (p = 0.05). Because of the factorial design, we used the comparison that required the larger sample (608 per group), plus 2% for potential attrition, thus 620 per group (total trial 1240). We assumed no interaction effect between the interventions".

### Chlorhexidine plus alcohol versus povidone iodine plus alcohol, combined or not with innovative devices, for prevention of short-term peripheral venous catheter infection and failure (CLEAN 3 study): an investigator-initiated, open-label, single centre, randomised-controlled, two-by-two factorial trial [^27ea626c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Background

Two billion peripheral venous catheters are sold globally each year, but the optimal skin disinfection and types of devices are not well established. We aimed to show the superiority of disinfection with 2% chlorhexidine plus alcohol over 5% povidone iodine plus alcohol in preventing infectious complications, and of closed integrated catheters, positive displacement needleless-connectors, disinfecting caps, and single-use prefilled flush syringes used in combination (innovation group) over open catheters and three-way stopcocks for treatment administration (standard group) in preventing catheter failure.

Methods

We did an open-label, randomised-controlled trial with a two-by-two factorial design, for which we enrolled adults (age ≥ 18 years) visiting the emergency department at the Poitiers University Hospital, France, and requiring one peripheral venous catheter before admission to the medical wards. Before catheter insertion, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) using a secure web-based random-number generator to one of four treatment groups based on skin preparation and type of devices (innovative devices or standard devices; 2% chlorhexidine plus alcohol or 5% povidone iodine plus alcohol). Primary outcomes were the incidence of infectious complications (local infection, catheter colonisation, or bloodstream infections) and time between catheter insertion and catheter failure (occlusion, dislodgment, infiltration, phlebitis, or infection). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03757143.

Findings

1000 patients were recruited between Jan 7, and Sept 6, 2019, of whom 500 were assigned to the chlorhexidine plus alcohol group and 500 to the povidone iodine plus alcohol group (250 with innovative solutions and 250 with standard devices in each antiseptic group). No significant interaction was found between the two study interventions. Local infections occurred less frequently with chlorhexidine plus alcohol than with povidone iodine plus alcohol (0 [0%] of 496 patients vs six [1%] of 493 patients) and the same was observed for catheter colonisation (4/431 [1%] vs 70/415 [17%] catheters among the catheters cultured; adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio 0.08 [95% CI 0.02–0.18]). Median time between catheter insertion and catheter failure was longer in the innovation group compared with the standard group (50.4 [IQR 29.6–69.4] h vs 30.0 [16.6–52.6] h; p = 0.0017). Minor skin reactions occurred in nine (2%) patients in the chlorhexidine plus alcohol group and seven (1%) patients in the povidone iodine plus alcohol group.

Interpretation

For skin antisepsis, chlorhexidine plus alcohol provides greater protection of peripheral venous catheter-related infectious complications than does povidone iodine plus alcohol. Use of innovative devices extends the catheter complication-free dwell time.

### Risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection with peripherally inserted central venous catheters used in hospitalized patients [^d7d1121f]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are now widely used for intermediate and long-term access in current-day health care, especially in the inpatient setting, where they are increasingly supplanting conventional central venous catheters (CVCs) placed percutaneously into the internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins. Data on the risk of PICC-related bloodstream infection (BSI) with PICCs used in hospitalized patients are limited.

Study Objectives

To determine the risk of PICC-related BSI in hospitalized patients.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study using data from two randomized trials assessing the efficacy of chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge dressing and chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis.

Methods

PICCs inserted into the antecubital vein in two randomized trials during from 1998 to 2000 were prospectively studied; most patients were in an ICU. PICC-related BSI was confirmed in each case by demonstrating concordance between isolates colonizing the PICC at the time of removal and from blood cultures by restriction-fragment DNA subtyping.

Results

Overall, 115 patients had 251 PICCs placed. Mean duration of catheterization was 11.3 days (total, 2,832 PICC-days); 42% of the patients were in an ICU at some time, 62% had urinary catheters, and 49% had received mechanical ventilation. Six PICC-related BSIs were identified (2.4%), four with coagulase-negative staphylococcus, one with Staphylococcus aureus, and one with Klebsiella pneumoniae, a rate of 2.1 per 1,000 catheter-days.

Conclusion

This prospective study shows that PICCs used in high-risk hospitalized patients are associated with a rate of catheter-related BSI similar to conventional CVCs placed in the internal jugular or subclavian veins (2 to 5 per 1,000 catheter-days), much higher than with PICCs used exclusively in the outpatient setting (approximately 0.4 per 1,000 catheter-days), and higher than with cuffed and tunneled Hickman-like CVCs (approximately 1 per 1,000 catheter-days). A randomized trial of PICCs and conventional CVCs in hospitalized patients requiring central access is needed. Our data raise the question of whether the growing trend in many hospital hematology and oncology services to switch from use of cuffed and tunneled CVCs to PICCs is justified, particularly since PICCs are more vulnerable to thrombosis and dislodgment, and are less useful for drawing blood specimens. Moreover, PICCs are not advisable in patients with renal failure and impending need for dialysis, in whom preservation of upper-extremity veins is needed for fistula or graft implantation.

### Peripherally inserted central catheters in non-hospitalized cancer patients: 5-year results of a prospective study [^b13f6094]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Our study was a prospective observational study carried out from June 1, 2008, through May 31, 2013, in a 1,200-bed university hospital. The Ethics Committee approved the study protocol. A written informed consent was obtained from each patient. All adult cancer patients with a PICC inserted during the study period were consecutively enrolled and their follow-up continued until the PICC removal. Our unit maintains an ongoing prospective database and coordinates the data gathering related to outpatients and is therefore able to determine the true incidence of complications.

Three types of PICCs were used: (1) 4 Fr single-lumen silicone with a valved tip (Groshong PICC; Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, UT), (2) 4–5 Fr single-lumen polyurethane (Vascu-PICC; MedComp, Harleysville, PA), and (3) 4–5 Fr single-lumen polyurethane power-injectable (Pro-PICC; MedComp and Health Line, San Francisco, CA). All PICCs were inserted by specifically trained nurses or physicians of the hospital Central Venous Access Team in a room exclusively dedicated to PICC placement. PICCs were inserted with maximal barrier precautions and skin antisepsis with 2% chlorhexidine using ultrasound-guided venipuncture of the upper midarm and sutureless devices for securing the catheter. The appropriate central position of the catheter tip (i.e. close to the cavoatrial junction) was consistently verified, either by the intracavitary electrocardiography (EKG) method during the procedure or by chest X-ray after the procedure. According to current guidelines, routine pharmacological prophylaxis of PICC-related venous thrombosis was not adopted. All patients were screened at least once a year by local ultrasound examination or Doppler technology and echocardiography.

### Chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge versus chlorhexidine gel dressing for short-term intravascular catheters: which one is better? [^361590fb]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

Study design

We used the databases from two large RCTs (DRESSING1 and DRESSING2 studies) that both investigated chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings versus standard dressings. The similarities among these RCTs with regard to definitions and inclusion criteria allowed us to merge the two databases. The DRESSING1 study investigated the impact of sponge-dress and frequency of dressing changes for preventing catheter-related infections or catheter colonization. The DRESSING2 study assessed the effect of gel-dress and highly adhesive dressing for preventing catheter-related infections and catheter colonization. Both sponge-dress and gel-dress decreased the rate of intravascular catheter infection. The studies interventions were neither blinded to the investigators nor to the ICU staff, but they were blinded to the adjudication committee and to the microbiologists who processed the samples of blood and catheter cultures. Both studies were approved by the national ethic committees; further ethical consent was not required according to the French law for research. Both RCTs complied with CONSORT guidelines and the current analysis complied with the STROBE guidelines for observational studies.

Study patients

Adult patients (≥ 18 years) who required a CVC or a peripheral arterial catheter (AC) insertion were recruited from 2006 to 2011 in 16 intensive care units (ICU) in France. Among all participating ICUs, three participated to both studies. The characteristics of patients were similar across studies. Patients underwent follow-up until 48 h after ICU discharge or death.

### Peripherally inserted central catheter design and material for reducing catheter failure and complications [^1ae82948]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) facilitate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in health care. PICCs can fail due to infective and non-infective complications, which PICC materials and design may contribute to, leading to negative sequelae for patients and healthcare systems.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of PICC material and design in reducing catheter failure and complications.

Search Methods

The University of Queensland and Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 16 May 2023. We aimed to identify other potentially eligible trials or ancillary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved included trials, as well as relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology assessment reports. We contacted experts in the field to ascertain additional relevant information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PICC design and materials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were venous thromboembolism (VTE), PICC-associated bloodstream infection (BSI), occlusion, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were catheter failure, PICC-related BSI, catheter breakage, PICC dwell time, and safety endpoints. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs involving approximately 2913 participants (one multi-arm study). All studies except one had a high risk of bias in one or more risk of bias domain. Integrated valve technology compared to no valve technology for peripherally inserted central catheter design Integrated valve technology may make little or no difference to VTE risk when compared with PICCs with no valve (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 2.63; I² = 0%; 3 studies; 437 participants; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether integrated valve technology reduces PICC-associated BSI risk, as the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.00; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 257 participants). Integrated valve technology may make little or no difference to occlusion risk when compared with PICCs with no valve (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.38; I² = 0%; 5 studies; 900 participants; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether use of integrated valve technology reduces all-cause mortality risk, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.64; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 473 participants). Integrated valve technology may make little or no difference to catheter failure risk when compared with PICCs with no valve (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.03; I² = 0%; 4 studies; 720 participants; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether integrated-valve technology reduces PICC-related BSI risk (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.32; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 542 participants) or catheter breakage, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.22 to 5.06; I² = 20%; 4 studies; 799 participants). Anti-thrombogenic surface modification compared to no anti-thrombogenic surface modification for peripherally inserted central catheter design We are uncertain whether use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters reduces risk of VTE (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.54; I² = 15%; 2 studies; 257 participants) or PICC-associated BSI, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.00; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 257 participants). We are uncertain whether use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters reduces occlusion (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.04 to 11.22; I² = 70%; 2 studies; 257 participants) or all-cause mortality risk, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.26; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 111 participants). Use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters may make little or no difference to risk of catheter failure (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.54; I² = 46%; 2 studies; 257 participants; low certainty evidence). No PICC-related BSIs were reported in one study (111 participants). As such, we are uncertain whether use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters reduces PICC-related BSI risk (RR not estimable; I² = not applicable; very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters reduces the risk of catheter breakage, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 257 participants). Antimicrobial impregnation compared to non-antimicrobial impregnation for peripherally inserted central catheter design We are uncertain whether use of antimicrobial-impregnated catheters reduces VTE risk (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.88; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 167 participants) or PICC-associated BSI risk, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.20 to 23.53; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 167 participants). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters probably make little or no difference to occlusion risk (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.74; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 1025 participants; moderate certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.75; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 1082 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters may make little or no difference to risk of catheter failure (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 221 participants; low certainty evidence). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters probably make little or no difference to PICC-related BSI risk (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.55; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 1082 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters may make little or no difference to risk of catheter breakage (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.83; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 804 participants; low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited high-quality RCT evidence available to inform clinician decision-making for PICC materials and design. Limitations of the current evidence include small sample sizes, infrequent events, and risk of bias. There may be little to no difference in the risk of VTE, PICC-associated BSI, occlusion, or mortality across PICC materials and designs. Further rigorous RCTs are needed to reduce uncertainty.

### Guidelines for the prevention of bloodstream infections and other infections associated with the use of intravascular catheters: part 1: peripheral catheters [^fc2e1bee]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-related bloodstream infection, more specifically with respect to insertion technique, preparation, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider using either a chlorhexidine-containing or a non-chlorhexidine-containing skin disinfectant before the insertion of peripheral intravenous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^26f00aa5]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Catheter and site selection — use midline catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) instead of short peripheral catheter when the duration of intravenous therapy will likely exceed 6 d (category II). Use fistula or graft in patients with chronic renal failure instead of central venous catheter (CVC) for permanent access for dialysis. Use CVC with the minimum number of ports or lumens essential for management of patient (category IB). No recommendation can be made regarding the use of a designated lumen for parenteral nutrition (unresolved issue). Promptly remove any intravascular catheter that is no longer essential (category IA). Weigh the risks and benefits of placing a central venous device at recommended site to reduce infectious complications against risk for mechanical complications (eg, pneumothorax, subclavian artery puncture, subclavian vein laceration, subclavian vein stenosis, hemothorax, thrombosis, air embolism, and catheter misplacement) (category IA). Avoid using femoral vein for central venous access in adult patients. Use a subclavian site, rather than jugular or femoral site, in adult patients to minimize infection risk for nontunneled CVC placement (category IB). Avoid subclavian site in hemodialysis patients and patients with advanced kidney disease to avoid subclavian vein stenosis (category IA). Use chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine or minocycline/rifampin-impregnated CVC in patients whose catheter is expected to remain in place > 5 d, if, after successful implementation of a comprehensive strategy to reduce rates of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), the CLABSI rate is not decreasing; comprehensive strategy should include at least the following three components: educating persons who insert and maintain catheters, use of maximum sterile barrier (MSB) precautions, and > 0.5% chlorhexidine preparation with alcohol for skin antisepsis during CVC insertion (category IA).

### Efficacy of multifaceted interventions in reducing complications of peripherally inserted central catheter in adult oncology patients [^8ea06170]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of multifaceted interventions in reducing complications of peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) in adult oncology patients.

Methods

Multifaceted interventions were implemented in our department in December 2006. These interventions include: (1) A mandatory nurse reeducation was developed by a multidisciplinary task force; (2) Modification of peripherally inserted central catheter insertion: take a chest X-ray before removal of the guidewire and cutting of the catheter. The guidewire in the catheter facilitates the accurate location of the tip of PICC on chest X-ray and make the malposition correction (withdrawing, reinsertion, even reinsertion following withdrawal) easily; (3) Using a 2% chlorhexidine preparation, replace 10% povidone iodine for skin antisepsis; (4) Maintenance of maximum sterile barrier precautions during PICC insertion and aftercare; (5) Designing of a PICC archive form and establishing a PICC archive for each patient. The PICC complication rates of groups before and after interventions were evaluated and compared.

Results

Sixty-nine PICC lines were inserted before these interventions, and 165 were inserted after implementation of these interventions. Compared with preintervention group, the postintervention group was associated with a 62.14% decrease in the overall complication rate (11.52% vs 30.43% [P = 0.0004]; incidence density, 1.82 vs 4.62 per 1,000 PICC days) with a 67.48% decrease in the infective complications rate (4.24% vs 13.04% [P = 0.015]) with a 58.19% decrease in the noninfective complications rate (7.27% vs 17.39% [P = 0.0199]).

Conclusions

The results suggest that these interventions implemented in this study may be help in reducing complications of PICC in adult oncology patients.

### Prevention of intravascular catheter infection [^fc9ba626]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent evidence supporting the guidelines for preventing catheter-related and catheter-associated infections.

Recent Findings

A series of studies has confirmed, over the past few years, that education-based preventive programmes can reduce these infections by one half to two thirds. The evidence supporting some specific measures has increased for the optimal timing for set replacement, for catheter-site dressing with chlorhexidine-impregnated devices, and for the use of some coated or impregnated intravascular devices.

Summary

Catheter-related and associated infections are largely preventable and should not be viewed as an unaffordable tribute to technical medicine. Improvements in existing techniques and new technologies should all be integrated into a structured process of continuous improvement in the quality of care.

### Peripherally inserted central catheters in non-hospitalized cancer patients: 5-year results of a prospective study [^7c63d12a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The rate of central catheter-related complications has changed: CRBSIs, thrombosis, and mechanical complications are lower than those reported in the last 20 years. Nowadays, the goal of "near zero" CRBSI — the most feared complication — is no longer a dream. In recent years, several technological novelties have considerably improved the safety of PICCs (i.e. ultrasound-guided venipuncture of the upper midarm, novel materials, sutureless devices for catheter securement), whereas new policies have successfully decreased the overall risk of complications (well-defined "bundles" of evidence-based interventions, strict policies on hand washing, proper skin antisepsis, training of healthcare professionals, etc.). In oncology patients, Tian et al. reported that after helpful interventions in reducing complications, the overall PICC complication rate has decreased from 30 to 11% (P = 0.0004). Harnage in a medical center — adopting the multimodality "bundle" for infection prevention — has reported for a huge number of PICCs (i.e. 12,577) an incidence of zero BSI per 1,000 catheter days for a period of 7 years. Recently, a prospective study — with a large proportion of oncologic patients enrolled — has reported zero CRBSI and zero thrombosis in HPN patients with 48 PICCs. Similarly, a prospective study at our institution with a small number of PICCs and a limited follow-up (65 PICCs and 18 months, respectively) reported the same results in cancer patients.

A critical issue is the scenario where the PICC is used because the in-hospital setting is markedly different from the out-hospital one. Chopra et al. clearly demonstrated that PICCs are associated with a lower risk of BSI (0.5%) than central venous catheters (2.1%) in outpatients. Conversely, contradictory data on the rate of PICC-related BSI were described for inpatients (mainly, intensive care unit patients). In this study, a low incidence of CRBSI was reported (0.05 per 1,000 catheter/days) in non-hospitalized cancer patients. The following key components of our PICC management may as well have been the reason for this result: (a) the consistent use of ultrasound guidance and sutureless devices, (b) the exclusive use of single-lumen PICCs, and (c) the consistent use of maximal barrier precautions and skin antisepsis with 2% chlorhexidine.

### Do antimicrobial and antithrombogenic peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) materials prevent catheter complications? An analysis of 42, 562 hospitalized medical patients [^81a14518]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of antimicrobial and antithrombogenic materials incorporated into peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) to prevent bloodstream infection, thrombosis, and catheter occlusion.

Methods

Prospective cohort study involving 52 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. Sample included adult hospitalized medical patients who received a PICC between January 2013 and October 2019. Coated and impregnated catheters were identified by name, brand, and device marketing or regulatory materials. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with robust sandwich standard error estimates accounting for the clustered nature of data were used to identify factors associated with PICC complications in coated versus noncoated devices across general care, intensive care unit (ICU), and oncology patients. Results were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Of 42,562 patients with a PICC, 39,806 (93.5%) were plain polyurethane, 2,263 (5.3%) incorporated antimicrobial materials, and 921 (2.2%) incorporated antithrombogenic materials. Most were inserted in general ward settings (n = 28,111, 66.0%), with 12, 078 (28.4%) and 1,407 (3.3%) placed in ICU and oncological settings, respectively. Within the entire cohort, 540 (1.3%) developed thrombosis, 745 (1.8%) developed bloodstream infection, and 4,090 (9.6%) developed catheter occlusion. Adjusting for known risk factors, antimicrobial PICCs were not associated with infection reduction (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.82–1.64), and antithrombogenic PICCs were not associated with reduction in thrombosis and occlusion (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.92–1.44). Results were consistent across populations and care settings.

Conclusions

Antimicrobial and antithrombogenic PICCs were not associated with a reduction in major catheter complications. Guidance aimed at informing use of these devices, balancing benefits against cost, appear necessary.

### The SIP protocol update: eight strategies, incorporating rapid peripheral vein assessment (RaPeVA), to minimize complications associated with peripherally inserted central catheter insertion [^d04c1ed3]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs) are widely used for administration of chemotherapy, antibiotics, parenteral nutrition, for short-, medium-, and long-term venous access and for frequent blood sampling amongst both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patient populations. The insertion of PICCs is a frequently performed procedure in clinical practice, currently associated with a low risk of complications. – In the last two decades, many factors have improved the safety of this procedure, the most important being the increasingly widespread use of ultrasound (US) in different phases of PICC insertion. Ultrasound is used for preliminary venous assessment, real-time venipuncture, and immediate detection of puncture-related complications (tissue hematomas, intramural hematomas of the vein, etc.); US is also appropriate for "tip navigation" (i.e. to verify the correct direction of the guidewire and/or catheter while the device is advanced into the vascular system), for "tip location" (i.e. to assess the central position of the tip), and for the diagnosis of most late non-infective complications (fibroblastic sleeve, catheter-related venous thrombosis, tip migration, etc.). –

Beyond US, other strategies and technologies, such as the preference for open-ended, non-valved, power injectable, polyurethane catheters, the appropriate choice of the exit site, skin antisepsis with 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol, use of maximal sterile barrier precautions, intracavitary ECG for tip positioning, sutureless securement, and cyanoacrylate glue all have increased the safety profile and the cost-effectiveness of the procedure. –

An insertion bundle consists of several recommendations, based on scientific evidence, capable of acting synergistically to provide maximal safety, positive clinical outcome, and cost-effectiveness of a given procedure. When placing a PICC, the purpose of an insertion bundle is to minimize any complication directly or indirectly related to the procedure, such as accidental arterial injury, incorrect tip location, arrhythmias, catheter-related venous thrombosis, and catheter-related infections.

An insertion bundle was proposed for PICCs several years ago, and more recently, for Centrally Inserted Central Catheters (CICCs)and Femorally Inserted Central Catheter (FICCs). This paper describes a new updated version of the SIP protocol (Safe Insertion of PICCs), including eight different recommendations designed to guarantee a safer, successful, and more cost-effective procedure (Table 1).

Appropriate aseptic technique

The second step concerns the correct antiseptic technique used during the placement of a PICC. Hand hygiene is preferably performed with hydroalcoholic gel. In special cases, or when the hands are visibly dirty, the hydroalcoholic gel must be preceded by washing with soap and water, according to current international guidelines on infection prevention. For skin antisepsis prior to device insertion, 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol should be used. Povidone iodine, in either aqueous or alcohol solution, has a role primarily if there is a known allergy to chlorhexidine. Regarding the application technique of the antiseptic, no clinical difference in microorganism reduction between the concentric circle versus the back-and-forth techniques has been demonstrated when both techniques are used equally on clean and healthy skin.

As recommended by all current guidelines, the risk of bacterial contamination must be reduced by adopting maximal barrier precautions, that is cap, facemask, sterile gown and gloves, full-size sterile drape over the patient, plus sterile cover for the US probe (long enough to cover both the probe and the cable when on the sterile field).

### A prospective, randomized comparison of three different types of valved and non-valved peripherally inserted central catheters [^f6833c1f]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Few randomized studies have investigated the impact of valved and non-valved power-injectable peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in terms of incidence of occlusion, infection, malfunction and venous thrombosis.

Methods

We have prospectively compared three types of third-generation polyurethane PICCs. One hundred and eighty adult patients candidate to chemotherapy were randomized into three groups: power-injectable PICCs with Solo-2 proximal valve (Bard); power-injectable PICCs with PASV (Pressure Activated Safety Valve) proximal valve (Navilyst); and non-valved power-injectable PICCs (Medcomp). All PICCs were single lumen 4Fr, inserted according to a well-defined protocol - maximal barrier precautions, ultrasound guidance, intracavitary electrocardiography (IC-ECG), and so on — and managed according to the recommendations of the most recent guidelines (antisepsis with 2% chlorhexidine, transparent dressing, sutureless device, strict 'scrub the hub' policy, neutral displacement needle-free connectors and so on). All catheters were flushed with 10 mL saline before and after each infusion, or with 20 mL saline after blood sampling or infusion of blood products. No heparin was used.

Results

We detected no complications at insertion; no PICC-related bloodstream infections; no dislocations; five cases of transient occlusion and two cases of persistent withdrawal occlusion, evenly distributed among the groups; one episode of complete irreversible obstruction (group A); four episodes of asymptomatic peripheral venous thrombosis; one episode of symptomatic, severe central vein thrombosis (group B). In 31% of PICCs in group A (19/61) and in 65% of group B (39/60), difficulties with gravity infusion were reported; three PICCs of group A were complicated by rupture of the intravascular tract during pump infusion. Five PICCs were removed because of complications, four in group A (one obstruction; three ruptures) and one in group B (central venous thrombosis).

Conclusion

We found no clinical advantages of valved vs. non-valved PICCs.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^3f8099e8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — device choice at insertion: Do not use peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. Risk of infection with PICCs in hospitalized patients approaches that of other CVCs, and the majority of CLABSIs due to PICCs occur in non-ICU settings. Midline catheters are increasingly being used as an alternative to CVCs for short-term vascular access, with some observational studies suggesting lower bloodstream infection risk associated with midline catheters versus PICCs and versus CVCs, respectively; randomized controlled trials comparing these devices are needed.

Catheters containing antimicrobial agents — For selected patients, use catheters coated with antibiotics, a combination of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine, or silver–platinum–carbon–impregnated catheters based on risk of infection and anticipated duration of catheter use, and do not use catheters containing antimicrobial agents as a substitute for additional infection precautions.

### Is it possible to achieve a target of zero central line associated bloodstream infections? [^e839d017]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in poorer patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Reduced reimbursement for CLABSI events is now provided for hospitalized patients in the United States. Although a zero target is proposed, the feasibility has not been evaluated. The objective of this review is to identify factors contributing to CLABSI and determine whether current evidence supports attainment of a zero infection rate.

Recent Findings

Limitations of current surveillance methods and reporting of aggregate data impact on achieving target CLABSI rates. Standard prevention practices, including physician and patient preparation (e.g. hand hygiene), are frequently incorporated into bundles of care. CVC dwell time has been identified as means of risk stratification. Additional strategies (e.g. chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings, antimicrobial-coated devices) may be better used in patients with expected long dwell times. Non-ICU populations are increasingly targeted with prevention strategies, but expected rates of infection have not been proposed.

Summary

A zero CLABSI rate should be the target only for ICU populations having CVCs with a dwell time of 1–9 days following aseptic insertion. Additional measures should be reserved for patients with expected longer dwell time. Refinement and validation of surveillance methodology is required before target CLABSI rates can be proposed for non-ICU populations.

### 5.0 implementation considerations for patients aged 18 years and older… [^d7f2db31]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance 5. 0 Implementation Considerations for Patients aged 18 Years and Older from the Updated Recommendations on the Use of Chlorhexidine-Impregnated Dressings for Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections. Implementation Considerations for Patients aged 18 Years and Older Select insertion site dressings based on the needs of the patient. Several factors affect both the choice of dressings for patients aged 18 years and older and the decision to add specific dressings to existing CLABSI prevention bundles. These include, but are not limited to, the interval since catheter insertion, insertion site, physical and chemical compatibility of the dressing with catheter components, patient sensitivity to dressings, and facility procurement and supply management.

There are now three different dressings recommended for use with short-term, non-tunneled CVCs in patients < 18 years of age, including the updated recommendations in this report and other recommendations in the. 2011 Guidelines 1 that were not addressed by this update. Most studies of C-I dressings did not use other CDC-recommended interventions that have become routine practice or part of CLABSI prevention bundles. Whether study effect sizes would have been of the same magnitude if these routine practices had been used is unclear. To date, evidence is insufficient to define the elements of the optimal CLABSI prevention bundle or which bundle components, when used in combination, would measurably reduce the rate of infections while minimizing complications. Every healthcare facility in the United States that uses CVCs should track CLABSI outcomes and process measures to identify opportunities to prevent patient harm.

Facilities should ensure high adherence to existing CLABSI prevention policies, practices, and bundles using regular audit and feedback and other means, regardless of which type of dressing is chosen. In healthcare settings that are demonstrating success at preventing CLABSI, the addition of C-I dressings is optional.

### Improving peripherally inserted central catheter appropriateness and reducing device-related complications: a quasiexperimental study in 52 Michigan hospitals [^9abce3b8]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Results

From 1 January 2013 to 13 January 2020, data from 41738 PICCs placed in 38 592 unique patients in 52 hospitals were available for analysis. Across hospitals, a majority of patients that received PICCs were men (51.3%), with a median age of 64 years and a median Charlson comorbidity score of 3. The top three indications for PICC insertion were intravenous antibiotics (51.9%), difficult access/need for blood draws (20.3%) and medications requiring central access (11.7%); the indication for insertion was not documented for 3598 (9.3%) PICCs. Among PICCs sampled, 10 953 (28.4%) were placed in ICU settings. Most PICCs were inserted by vascular access teams (n = 26 644 (69.0%)), but some were placed by interventional radiologists (n = 7171 (18.6%)).

Compared with patients with appropriate PICC use, patients with inappropriate PICC use were younger (63.3 vs 64.5 years), more likely to be black (21.9% vs 18.8%) and women (52.5% vs 43.0%, all p < 0.001). With respect to category of appropriateness, 82.1% of PICCs were inappropriate because multilumen PICCs were inserted where a single lumen device would have been sufficient, 29.2% were placed for ≤ 5 days and 25.9% were placed in patients with CKD (table 1).

### Improving peripherally inserted central catheter appropriateness and reducing device-related complications: a quasiexperimental study in 52 Michigan hospitals [^589ee529]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Our study also has important strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that implementing MAGIC can lead to both improved catheter appropriateness and patient outcomes. Our findings also suggest that reduction in PICC complications across sites may have substantial economic implications for hospitals, with estimated savings from reduced complications potentially summing to over US$8MIn an era of publicly reported measures and resource limitations, the business case to turn to MAGIC as a platform to improving safety and reducing costs in vascular access is therefore compelling. Second, the implementation toolkit used to deploy MAGIC is online and available to the public; it can thus be used by other hospitals, creating a novel and timely resource to improve PICC safety beyond this work. Third, because implementation was associated with reduction in costly complications such as VTE and CLABSI, our findings have substantial quality and safety implications for hospitals struggling with these two events. Finally, we used robust methods to validate our findings including those focused on temporality of outcomes related to the intervention and mixed models taking into account clinically relevant confounders. This rigour gives us confidence that our findings are replicable outside our collaborative, especially if the impetus to improve vascular device outcomes in a given hospital is substantial.

In conclusion, our intervention based on MAGIC led to improved PICC appropriateness and reduced patient harm across thousands of patients. Wider use and adoption of MAGIC as a resource to measure, evaluate and improve PICC safety appears warranted.

### Improving peripherally inserted central catheter appropriateness and reducing device-related complications: a quasiexperimental study in 52 Michigan hospitals [^9f5da891]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Because they can be inserted at the bedside, are safer to insert than other central venous catheters and facilitate transitions of care, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have become one of the most prevalent vascular access devices in US hospitals. Like other central venous catheters, however, PICCs are associated with infectious and non-infectious risks including venous thromboembolism (VTE) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Additionally, PICC occlusion remains one of the most common device-complications and leads to delays in treatment, increase in cost and in some cases, PICC replacement.

One strategy to avoid PICC-related adverse events is to only place the device when it is appropriate: that is, when the benefits of use outweigh risks. The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC) offers an evidence-based strategy to inform clinicians on when it is appropriate to place a PICC. Developed by a multidisciplinary panel, MAGIC provides appropriateness ratings for PICC use, taking into account duration of therapy, the type of infusion being delivered and the indication for treatment. Interventions using MAGIC have demonstrated more appropriate PICC use and a decrease in central line days and device utilisation. However, whether implementing MAGIC reduces device-related complications is not known. Improving PICC appropriateness while also reducing complications would make a compelling case for implementing MAGIC in hospitals.

In partnership with a statewide safety-focused collaborative, we designed a multimodal intervention to assess the impact of MAGIC on PICC appropriateness and device-associated complications.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^1894e449]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 11.13–11.14 — chlorhexidine formulation and dressing material — states there is inadequate evidence for KDOQI to make a recommendation on the specific chlorhexidine formulation to use for infection prophylaxis, and there is inadequate evidence to demonstrate a difference in catheter-related infections with transparent film dressing compared with nontransparent dressing; thus, selection should be based on the clinician's discretion, best clinical judgment, patient circumstances, and local resources.

### Risk factors for peripheral venous catheter failure: a prospective cohort study of 5345 patients [^ac1830ca]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2022). Medium credibility.

Also in this study, the use of heparinized saline for tube sealing compared to normal saline was associated with an increased risk of PVC failure. In accordance with these findings, a previous study showed that increasing concentrations of heparin were associated with increasing risk of phlebitis. The US INS guidelinerecommend the use of preservative-free 0.9% sodium chloride solution as a tube sealing solution in adult patients. A previous prospective, controlled study in patients with gastrointestinal or liver disease compared the effects of normal saline and heparinized saline for tube sealing. Findings showed no significant differences in the incidence of occlusion or other adverse events associated with PVCs in patients who received either normal saline or heparin saline.

Based the results of the present study, we recommend that healthcare providers receive practical training on the venipuncture technique, avoid repeat puncture at the same insertion site, and avoid puncture sites that are associated with the risk of PVC failure. In particular, the site of PVC placement in elderly surgical patients should be continually monitored for early detection of PVC failure. Healthcare providers should have a list of drugs classified as irritants or vesicants so they can monitor patients receiving fluid infusions containing these drugs more frequently. Continuous PVC failures may result in the wrong dose of drug being delivered at the wrong time and vein wasting. An alternative device such as a mini midline, a midline, or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) should be considered for patients receiving large infusions over an extended period of time or irritants or vesicants. Healthcare providers may consider using a vascular access management tool, such as the UK Vessel Health and Preservation (VHP) frameworkor the I-DECIDED clinical decision-making tool, for device selection and replacement or removal of a device.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections [^93fcb86d]. American Journal of Infection Control (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although many catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSIs) are preventable, measures to reduce these infections are not uniformly implemented.

Objective

To update an existing evidenced-based guideline that promotes strategies to prevent CR-BSIs.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE database, conference proceedings, and bibliographies of review articles and book chapters were searched for relevant articles. Studies Included: Laboratory-based studies, controlled clinical trials, prospective interventional trials, and epidemiological investigations.

Outcome Measures

Reduction in CR-BSI, catheter colonization, or catheter-related infection.

Synthesis

The recommended preventive strategies with the strongest supportive evidence are education and training of healthcare providers who insert and maintain catheters; maximal sterile barrier precautions during central venous catheter insertion; use of a 2% chlorhexidine preparation for skin antisepsis; no routine replacement of central venous catheters for prevention of infection; and use of antiseptic/antibiotic impregnated short-term central venous catheters if the rate of infection is high despite adherence to other strategies (i.e. education and training, maximal sterile barrier precautions and 2% chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis).

Conclusion

Successful implementation of these evidence-based interventions can reduce the risk for serious catheter-related infection.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^228f780d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Risk factors for CLABSI emphasize device presence and patient populations: "Patients at risk for CLABSI in acute-care facilities are those with a CVC in place". In the ICU, "The risk of CLABSI in ICU patients is high", with reasons including "the frequent insertion of multiple catheters… the use of specific types of catheters… and the fact that catheters are frequently placed in emergency circumstances, repeatedly accessed each day, and often needed for extended periods". For non-ICU settings, "most CLABSIs occur in hospitalized patients in units outside the ICU or in outpatients". Prevention efforts "should include other vulnerable populations such as patients receiving hemodialysis through catheters, intraoperative patients, and oncology patients". Beyond CVCs, "short-term peripheral catheters, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), midline catheters, and peripheral arterial catheters also carry a risk of infection". Independent risk factors "in at least 2 published studies" include "Prolonged hospitalization before catheterization", "Prolonged duration of catheterization", "Heavy microbial colonization at insertion site", "Heavy microbial colonization of the catheter hub", and "Multilumen catheters".

### Vascular catheter site care: the clinical and economic benefits of chlorhexidine gluconate compared with povidone iodine [^e28bb38d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The use of chlorhexidine gluconate solution for vascular catheter insertion site care reduces the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection by one-half, compared with povidone iodine. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of chlorhexidine gluconate versus povidone iodine. We used data from randomized, controlled trials, meta-analyses, and epidemiologic studies to construct a decision analysis model. We estimated that use of chlorhexidine, rather than povidone, for central catheter site care resulted in a 1.6% decrease in the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection, a 0.23% decrease in the incidence of death, and savings of 113 dollars per catheter used. For peripheral catheter site care, the results were similar, although the differences were smaller. The results were found to be robust on multivariate sensitivity analyses. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate in place of the current standard solution for vascular catheter site care is a simple and cost-effective method of improving patient safety in the hospital setting.

### Improving peripherally inserted central catheter appropriateness and reducing device-related complications: a quasiexperimental study in 52 Michigan hospitals [^be248d8e]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Our study has limitations. First, given the quality improvement nature of the work, we used an observational study design without a control group. Thus, secular trends or unmeasured confounding may influence our findings. However, to counteract this aspect, we used rigorous analysis including assessment of temporarily of change in relation to introduction of the intervention for confirmation. Second, although models were fully adjusted and we used multiple analyses that included hospital and patient characteristics, our data can only show association — not causation between PICC appropriateness and major complications. Third, patients were included from select hospitals in Michigan that agreed to participate in our initiative and received financial compensation for the same. Given the size of our intervention and inclusion of multiple hospitals (representing close to 80% of all hospital beds in Michigan), we have no reason to believe that this would introduce systematic bias in patient outcomes. However, it is possible that hospital engagement and pay for performance amplified the impact of our intervention. As our interventions targeted process issues such as number of lumens and dwell time, payments were relatively small and the included hospitals represent the majority of all acute care settings in the State of Michigan, we believe our findings are generalisable. Finally, we do not know which of our intervention components was the 'active ingredient(s)' in achieving our results; however, qualitative work to better understand this aspect is ongoing.

### Efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate of different concentrations in preventing short peripheral catheter-related infections: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^40cab138]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluation of the efficacy of different concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate in the prevention of short peripheral catheter-related infections.

Methods

This randomized controlled study consisted of 96 patients who had short peripheral catheter. Patients were randomly assigned to apply skin antisepsis with either 1%, 2% and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate or 70% isopropyl alcohol. Microbial cultures were collected at the site surrounding catheter insertion before catheterization, within the first and the 96th hours after catheterization to assess microbial growth.

Results

Compared to the pre-catheterization period, the number of Gram (+) bacteria detected at the 96th hour post-catheterization decreased by 76.4% in 1% chlorhexidine gluconate group, 90% in 2% and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate group and 30% in 70% isopropyl alcohol group in the skin swabs.

Conclusions

2% chlorhexidine gluconate was most effective antiseptic in preventing short peripheral catheter-related infections than other concentrations.

### New developments in the prevention of intravascular catheter associated infections [^9fbaabd9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLA-BSI) are one of the leading causes of healthcare-associated infections, resulting in significant morbidity and substantial excess cost. There is a growing recognition that most CLA-BSIs are preventable. Elimination of preventable CLA-BSI is the focus of a recently released CDC Guideline. Universal preventative measures include collaborative performance improvement using checklists and bundles, education of persons who insert and maintain catheters, maximal sterile barrier precautions, and chlorhexidine skin preparation. Technologic innovations including coated catheters, antimicrobial impregnated dressings, and antimicrobial lock solutions should be considered if the rate of CLA-BSI is not acceptable after application of universal precautions.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^b3fd1d62]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large multihospital study, we found a lower risk of major complications in patients receiving OPAT through a midline catheter compared with a PICC. CRBSI was infrequent, and the incidence of CR-VTE was low among patients with midline catheters. Minor complications and device failure were similar among those that received midline catheters vs PICCs. The lower risk of major complications with midline catheters was more pronounced in devices that dwelled for 14 or fewer days. These findings have important implications in selecting a vascular access device for the millions of patients who receive OPAT today.

The low rates of CRBSI from midline catheters observed in our cohort has been reported in other studies. However, our findings related to the risk of midline catheter–related thrombosis differ from others. One systematic review that pooled results from single-site, retrospective studies reported a greater risk of thrombosis with midline catheters compared with PICCs. Prior analyses using data from multiple sites also suggested greater risk of thrombosis with midline catheters vs PICCs, particularly in patients requiring vascular access for short-term durations, and in patients who received vasopressors through midline catheters. However, a more recent meta-analysis found no difference in rates of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism between device types. To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine this aspect in a cohort of patients transitioning from inpatient to outpatient settings and specifically in those receiving antimicrobials. The low rates of CR-VTE observed in this study may relate to surveillance bias (limited testing in outpatients) or to reduction in risk from differing patient cohorts or less frequent device use as may occur during hospitalization.

### The SIP protocol update: eight strategies, incorporating rapid peripheral vein assessment (RaPeVA), to minimize complications associated with peripherally inserted central catheter insertion [^d12b1025]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

What's new in this 2022 update of the SIP protocol

Compared to the SIP protocol proposed several years ago, several recommendations were added, with the purpose of further reducing the risks and complications associated with PICC insertion:

- A more accurate application of the Rapid Peripheral Vein Assessment (RaPeVA) protocol, which should not be limited to a systematic evaluation of the veins of the arms, but extended also to the deep veins of the cervico-thoracic region;
- A closer focus on the appropriate technique of skin antisepsis, to be obtained by 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol, emphasizing that no clinical difference in microorganism reduction between the concentric circle versus the back-and-forth techniques has been demonstrated when both techniques are used equally on clean and healthy skin.
- The adoption of the RAVESTO protocol, which recommends to tunnel the PICC if the ideal puncture site is in the yellow zone according to the Zone Insertion Method™ (ZIM ™)
- The preference for the use of blunt tunnelers, since they are associated with minimal risk of localized bleeding, even in patients with coagulation disorders or reduced platelet counts.
- The use of ultrasound for tip navigation, and for tip location, preferably using the "bubble test", considering this so-called ECHOTIP protocol may be very useful in association or as an alternative to the IC-ECG method.
- A wider use of subcutaneous anchorage for catheter securement, since this strategy is safer and more effective than stabilization with skin-adhesive sutureless devices, – and that it should be preferred in patient populations at high risk for catheter dislodgment (non-collaborative patients, diaphoresis, etc.). –
- The consistent use of cyanoacrylate for sealing the exit site, so to avoid local bleeding and extraluminal bacterial contamination.
- The consistent use of transparent semipermeable dressings — preferring the membranes with high MVTR — so to ensure optimal protection and breathability of the exit site, additional stabilization of the catheter, and reduction in the risk of skin-related injury.

### The influence of using antibiotic-coated peripherally inserted central catheters on decreasing the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections [^edd5affc]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) has increased over the past few years due to their less serious insertion complications. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether patients receiving PICCs impregnated with minocycline and rifampin had a lower rate of CLABSI compared with a concurrent control group of patients receiving uncoated PICCs.

### Chlorhexidine-impregnated sponges and less frequent dressing changes for prevention of catheter-related infections in critically ill adults: a randomized controlled trial [^9555c694]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Use of a chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated sponge (CHGIS) in intravascular catheter dressings may reduce catheter-related infections (CRIs). Changing catheter dressings every 3 days may be more frequent than necessary.

Objective

To assess superiority of CHGIS dressings regarding the rate of major CRIs (clinical sepsis with or without bloodstream infection) and noninferiority (less than 3% colonization-rate increase) of 7-day vs 3-day dressing changes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Assessor-blind, 2 x 2 factorial, randomized controlled trial conducted from December 2006 through June 2008 and recruiting patients from 7 intensive care units in 3 university and 2 general hospitals in France. Patients were adults (> 18 years) expected to require an arterial catheter, central-vein catheter, or both inserted for 48 hours or longer.

Interventions

Use of CHGIS vs standard dressings (controls). Scheduled change of unsoiled adherent dressings every 3 vs every 7 days, with immediate change of any soiled or leaking dressings.

Main Outcome Measures

Major CRIs for comparison of CHGIS vs control dressings; colonization rate for comparison of 3- vs 7-day dressing changes.

Results

Of 2095 eligible patients, 1636 (3778 catheters, 28,931 catheter-days) could be evaluated. The median duration of catheter insertion was 6 (interquartile range [IQR], 4–10) days. There was no interaction between the interventions. Use of CHGIS dressings decreased the rates of major CRIs (10/1953 [0.5%], 0.6 per 1000 catheter-days vs 19/1825 [1.1%], 1.4 per 1000 catheter-days; hazard ratio [HR], 0.39 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.17–0.93]; P = 0.03) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (6/1953 catheters, 0.40 per 1000 catheter-days vs 17/1825 catheters, 1.3 per 1000 catheter-days; HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.09–0.65]). Use of CHGIS dressings was not associated with greater resistance of bacteria in skin samples at catheter removal. Severe CHGIS-associated contact dermatitis occurred in 8 patients (5.3 per 1000 catheters). Use of CHGIS dressings prevented 1 major CRI per 117 catheters. Catheter colonization rates were 142 of 1657 catheters (7.8%) in the 3-day group (10.4 per 1000 catheter-days) and 168 of 1828 catheters (8.6%) in the 7-day group (11.0 per 1000 catheter-days), a mean absolute difference of 0.8% (95% CI, -1.78% to 2.15%) (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.77–1.28), indicating noninferiority of 7-day changes. The median number of dressing changes per catheter was 4 (IQR, 3–6) in the 3-day group and 3 (IQR, 2–5) in the 7-day group (P < .001).

Conclusions

Use of CHGIS dressings with intravascular catheters in the intensive care unit reduced risk of infection even when background infection rates were low. Reducing the frequency of changing unsoiled adherent dressings from every 3 days to every 7 days modestly reduces the total number of dressing changes and appears safe.

### Dressings and securement devices for central venous catheters (CVC) [^f06c74f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous catheters (CVCs) play a vital role in the management of acute and chronic illness. Dressings and securement devices must ensure CVCs do not dislodge or fall out, provide a barrier protection from microbial colonisation and infection, and be comfortable for the patient. There is a large range of dressing and securement products available for clinicians to use.

Objectives

To compare the available dressing and securement devices for CVCs, in terms of catheter-related bloodstream infection (BSI), catheter colonisation, entry- and exit-site infection, skin colonisation, skin irritation, failed catheter securement, dressing condition and mortality.

Search Methods

In June 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL; six clinical trial registries and reference lists of identified trials. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of dressing and securement devices for CVCs. All types of CVCs were included, i.e. short- and long-term CVCs, tunnelled and non-tunnelled, port-a-caths, haemodialysis catheters, and peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Collaboration methods including independent review of titles and abstracts for relevance, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment of the included studies by two review authors. Results are expressed using risk ratio (RR) for categorical data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For outcomes best presented as a rate-per-time-period, rate ratios and standard errors have been used. We performed multiple treatment meta-analyses to rank the effectiveness of each intervention for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 22 studies involving 7436 participants comparing nine different types of securement device or dressing. All included studies were at unclear or high risk of performance bias due to the different appearances of the dressings and securement devices. The extent of blinding of outcome assessment was unclear in most studies. The quality of evidence varied between different comparisons and outcomes. We mainly downgraded the quality of evidence for imprecision, indirectness, risk of bias and inconsistency. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the rate of catheter-related BSI between securement with gauze and tape and standard polyurethane (SPU) (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.63, low quality evidence), or between chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated (CGI) dressings and SPU (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.05, moderate quality evidence). There is high quality evidence that medication-impregnated dressings reduce the incidence of catheter-related BSI relative to all other dressing types (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93). There is moderate quality evidence that CGI dressings reduce the frequency of catheter-related BSI per 1000 patient days compared with SPU dressings (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.78). There is moderate quality evidence that catheter tip colonisation is reduced with CGI dressings compared with SPU dressings (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.73), but the relative effects of gauze and tape and SPU are unclear (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.77, very low quality evidence). It is unclear if there is a difference in rates of skin irritation or damage when CGI dressings are compared with SPU dressings (moderate quality evidence) (RR 11.17, 95% CI 0.84 to 149.48). A multiple treatment meta-analysis found sutureless securement devices as likely to be the most effective at reducing the incidence of catheter-related BSI (low quality evidence), with CGI dressings ranked second (low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Medication-impregnated dressing products reduce the incidence of catheter-related BSI relative to all other dressing types. There is some evidence that CGI dressings, relative to SPU dressings, reduce catheter-related BSI for the outcomes of frequency of infection per 1000 patient days, risk of catheter tip colonisation and possibly risk of catheter-related BSI. A multiple treatment meta-analysis found that sutureless securement devices are likely to be the most effective at reducing catheter-related BSI though this is low quality evidence. Most studies were conducted in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. More, high quality research is needed regarding the relative effects of dressing and securement products for CVCs. Future research may adjust the estimates of effect for the products included in this review and is needed to assess the effectiveness of new products.

### Complications of peripherally inserted central catheters in adult hospitalized patients and outpatients in the KTFIXPICC study: a randomized controlled trial evaluating a fixation device KT FIX plussystem [^2029dee8]. American Journal of Infection Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Poor securement potentiates Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) complications. A dressing device (KT FIX Plus) offers stronger skin attachment, which may reduce the risk of dressing disruption. We aimed to evaluate this device.

Methods

We conducted a single-center parallel-group open-label randomized controlled trial. Hospitalized and outpatient consecutive adults requiring PICCs were randomized to KT FIX Plus or standard of care (SOC). The primary endpoint was the composite of PICC-associated complications until removal, including occlusion, migration, accidental withdrawal, infection, thrombosis, and hematoma.

Results

No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of complications: 67 (35%) in the KT FIX Plus group vs 36 (37%) in the SOC group (log-rank P = 0.76). In multivariate Cox analysis, independent risk factors for PICC-associated complications were obesity (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.08, P < .001) and diabetes (aHR, 1.85, P = 0.039), adjusting for chronic renal failure, number of lumens, catheter/vein diameter ratio and duration of home-based care. Multiple lumen catheters increased the risk of accidental withdrawal and migration (HR, 2.4, P = 0.008).

Conclusions

In our study, the use of KT FIX Plus did not reduce the risk of complications adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. The number of catheter lumens is one of the modifiable factors to reduce complications. Further studies are required to find the best securement and dressing system.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^f2002a6c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Unresolved issues

Routine use of needleless connectors as a CLABSI prevention strategy before an assessment of risks, benefits, and education regarding proper use – Multiple devices are currently available but the optimal design for preventing infections is unresolved. The original purpose of needleless connectors was to prevent needlestick injuries during intermittent use. No data are available regarding their use with continuous infusions. Needle-free connectors with 3-way stopcocks may increase the risk of catheter infections. Use of silver-coated catheter connectors may be associated with reduced intraluminal contamination in ex vivo catheters and CLABSI. Clinical evidence is limited regarding the risk reduction with their routine use or use of other antimicrobial catheter connectors.
Surveillance of other types of catheters (eg, peripheral arterial or venous catheters), Peripheral arterial catheters, short-term peripheral venous catheters and midline catheters are not included in most surveillance systems although they are associated with risk of bloodstream infection. Future surveillance systems should consider including bloodstream infections associated with these types of catheters. If considering further infection prevention interventions due to concern for an increase in infections, hospitals may want to consider extending their surveillance programs to include all types of catheters used to gauge the size of the problem.
Standard, nonantimicrobial transparent dressings and CLABSI risk A meta-analysis reported an association between CLABSI and transparent dressing use; however, the source studies for the meta-analysis reporting this association were of low quality.
The impact of using chlorhexidine-based products on bacterial resistance to chlorhexidine Widespread use of chlorhexidine-based products (eg, use of chlorhexidine bathing, antisepsis, and dressings) may promote reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility. However, testing for chlorhexidine susceptibility is not standardized. The clinical impact of reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility is unknown.
Sutureless securement The impact of sutureless securement devices in reducing CLABSI is unknown.
Impact of silver zeolite-impregnated umbilical catheters in preterm infants (applicable in countries where it is approved for use in children) One randomized study suggests that antimicrobial-impregnated umbilical catheters appear to be safe and effective in NICU patients.
Necessity of mechanical disinfection of a catheter hub, needleless connector, and injection port before accessing the catheter when antiseptic-containing caps are being used. It is unknown whether the application and removal of an antiseptic-containing cap provides the same benefit to reducing risk of CLABSI as manual disinfection. Future research is needed to determine if using such a cap will obviate the need for manual disinfection before accessing a catheter.

### Practice guidelines for central venous access 2020: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on central venous access [^a42095cd]. Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Insertion site dressings — the literature is insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of transparent bioocclusive dressings to reduce the risk of infection; pooled estimates from randomized controlled trials are consistent with lower rates of catheter colonization with chlorhexidine sponge dressings compared with standard polyurethane (Category A1-B evidence) but are equivocal for catheter-related bloodstream infection (Category A1-E evidence); an RCT reports a higher frequency of severe localized contact dermatitis in neonates with chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings compared with povidone–iodine–impregnated dressings (Category A3-H evidence), and findings concerning dermatitis from RCTs in adults are equivocal (Category A2-E evidence). The consultants and ASA members both strongly agree with the recommendations to use transparent bioocclusive dressings to protect the site of central venous catheter insertion from infection; they agree with the recommendation that dressings containing chlorhexidine may be used in adults, infants, and children unless contraindicated; for neonates, they agree with the recommendation to determine the use of transparent or sponge dressings containing chlorhexidine based on clinical judgment and institutional protocol; if a chlorhexidine-containing dressing is used, they both strongly agree with the recommendation to observe the site daily for signs of irritation, allergy, or necrosis.

CDC then used a modification of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method to assess the quality of the available evidence, to determine the strength of recommendations, and to show the relation between evidence and recommendations. 6, 7, 20. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. For studies that met the inclusion criteria, two reviewers extracted data on: the study author, year, study design, objective, population, intervention, outcome definitions, intervention and control events, hazard ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values. Reviewers contacted authors of selected studies to confirm the skin antisepsis agent and use of daily chlorhexidine bathing if these details were not reported in the article.

The guideline writing group reviewed the findings from the evidence review and formulated recommendations based on the balance of benefits and harms of C-I dressings when used for preventing infections associated with short-term, non-tunneled catheters. The strength of each recommendation was based on the categorization scheme used for previous CDC healthcare infection control guidelines. The writing group did not consider the following issues when formulating recommendations: cost or cost-effectiveness of C-I dressings in healthcare facilities with different underlying rates of catheter use or catheter-related infections; dressing preferences of providers or health systems; provider opinions about ease of dressing application, removal, or inspection for complications; or the impact of dressing use on other aspects of catheter care. Other sources describe additional details of the guideline development process. 21, 22.

CENTRAL LINE-ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS

CLABSIs continue to increase morbidity, mortality, and costs. Like other HAIs, CLABSIs significantly increased in 2020 and 2021. The updated guideline to prevent CLABSIs in acute-care hospitals has now been published. As with the 2014 document, bathing intensive care (ICU) patients more than 2 months with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), using maximum barrier for insertion, using an alcohol CHG preparation for site preparation and maintenance, and ensuring adequate nurse-to-patient ratio in the ICU remained essential practices in the 2022 update. The role of CHG bathing among patients in non-ICU settings was considered unclear despite several good studies. The first was a randomized-cluster trial, which reported a significant reduction in device-associated bacteremia in the CHG-bathing group. Studies in adult hematology patients also suggest similar reductions. Under essential practices, the guideline now promotes the subclavian vein as the preferred site for insertion. The 2014 document recommended avoiding the femoral site, which is still valid, but the 2022 update only states the subclavian site is the preferred site to reduced infection when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting (HIGH). In non-ICU settings, the risk of infection between the different sites is unclear. The use of ultrasound for catheter placement is now classified as HIGH based on additional studies. The use of chlorhexidine-containing dressings is now part of essential practice (HIGH) for patients over 2 months of age instead of a special approach from the 2014 edition. Lastly, the new document now recommends routine replacement of sets not used for blood, blood products, or lipids can be changed up to 7 days instead of 4 days (HIGH).

Under additional approaches, the use of antimicrobial ointment for hemodialysis catheters has been moved to additional practices as this is a recommendation for a special population (HIGH). Antiseptic caps remain an additional approach (MODERATE), as they are not considered better than traditional manual disinfections if done properly, which remains an essential practice.

### Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infection with newer chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine-coated catheters: a randomized controlled trial [^de5bb61f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The indication of antiseptic-coated catheters remains debated.

Objective

To test the ability of the new generation of chlorhexidine-silver and sulfadiazine-coated catheters, with enhanced antiseptic coating, to reduce the risk of central venous catheter (CVC)-related infection in ICU patients.

Design

Multicentre randomized double-blind trial.

Patients and Setting

A total of 397 patients from 14 ICUs of university hospitals in France.

Intervention

Patients were randomized to receive an antiseptic-coated catheter (ACC) or a standard non-coated catheter (NCC).

Measurements

Incidence of CVC-related infection.

Results

Of 367 patients having a successful catheter insertion, 363 were analysed (175 NCC and 188 ACC). Patients had one (NCC = 162, ACC = 180) or more (NCC = 13, ACC = 11) CVC inserted. The two groups were similar for insertion site [subclavian (64 vs 69)] or jugular (36 vs 31%)], and type of catheters (single-lumen 18 vs 18%; double-lumen 82 vs 82%), and mean (median) duration of catheterisation [12.0 ± 11.7 (9) vs 10.5 ± 8.8 (8) days in the NCC and ACC groups, respectively]. Significant colonisation of the catheter occurred in 23 (13.1%) and 7 (3.7%) patients, respectively, in the NCC and ACC groups (11 vs 3.6 per 1000 catheter-days; p = 0.01); CVC-related infection (bloodstream infection) occurred in 10 (5) and 4 (3) patients in the NCC and CC groups, respectively (5.2 vs 2 per 1000 catheter days; p = 0.10).

Conclusions

In the context of a low baseline infection rate, ACC were associated with a significant reduction of catheter colonisation and a trend to reduction of infection episodes, but not of bloodstream infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections [^22623c36]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although many catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are preventable, measures to reduce these infections are not uniformly implemented.

Objective

To update an existing evidenced-based guideline that promotes strategies to prevent CRBSIs.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE database, conference proceedings, and bibliographies of review articles and book chapters were searched for relevant articles.

Studies Included

Laboratory-based studies, controlled clinical trials, prospective interventional trials, and epidemiologic investigations.

Outcome Measures

Reduction in CRBSI, catheter colonization, or catheter-related infection.

Synthesis

The recommended preventive strategies with the strongest supportive evidence are education and training of healthcare providers who insert and maintain catheters; maximal sterile barrier precautions during central venous catheter insertion; use of a 2% chlorhexidine preparation for skin antisepsis; no routine replacement of central venous catheters for prevention of infection; and use of antiseptic/antibiotic-impregnated short-term central venous catheters if the rate of infection is high despite adherence to other strategies (ie, education and training, maximal sterile barrier precautions, and 2% chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis).

Conclusion

Successful implementation of these evidence-based interventions can reduce the risk for serious catheter-related infection.

### The efficacy of daily bathing with chlorhexidine for reducing healthcare-associated bloodstream infections: a meta-analysis [^5d87e83b]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2012). Low credibility.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies to assess the efficacy of daily bathing with chlorhexidine (CHG) for prevention of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (BSIs).

Setting

Medical, surgical, trauma, and combined medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) and long-term acute care hospitals.

Participants

Inpatients.

Methods

Data on patient population, diagnostic criteria for BSIs, form and concentration of topical CHG, incidence of BSIs, and study design were extracted.

Results

One randomized controlled trial and 11 nonrandomized controlled trials reporting a total of 137,392 patient-days met the inclusion criteria; 291 patients in the CHG arm developed a BSI over 67,775 patient-days, compared with 557 patients in the control arm over 69,617 catheter-days. CHG bathing resulted in a reduced incidence of BSIs: the pooled odds ratio using a random-effects model was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.33–0.59; [Formula: see text]). Statistical heterogeneity was moderate, with an I² of 58%. For the subgroup of studies that examined central line-associated BSIs, the odds ratio was 0.40 (95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.59).

Conclusions

Daily bathing with CHG reduced the incidence of BSIs, including central line-associated BSIs, among patients in the medical ICU. Further studies are recommended to determine the optimal frequency, method of application, and concentration of CHG as well as the comparative effectiveness of this strategy relative to other preventive measures available for reducing BSIs. Future studies should also examine the efficacy of daily CHG bathing in non-ICU populations at risk for BSI.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^9c5ef58c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Adjunct dressings and antisepsis considerations — evidence summaries for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention note uncertainty and research needs. A meta-analysis reported an association between CLABSI and transparent dressing use; however, the source studies for the meta-analysis reporting this association were of low quality. Widespread use of chlorhexidine-based products may promote reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility; however, testing for chlorhexidine susceptibility is not standardized, and the clinical impact of reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility is unknown. The impact of sutureless securement devices in reducing CLABSI is unknown. One randomized study suggests that antimicrobial-impregnated umbilical catheters appear to be safe and effective in NICU patients. When antiseptic-containing caps are being used, it is unknown whether their application and removal provides the same benefit as manual disinfection, and future research is needed to determine if such caps will obviate the need for manual disinfection before accessing a catheter.

### Safe administration of vancomycin through a novel midline catheter: a randomized, prospective clinical trial [^3c9a2247]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

METHOD

Patients requiring short-term intravenous vancomycin — more than one dose and less than 6 days of treatment — were referred to the VAT and, after inclusion versus exclusion was decided, randomly assigned (based on odd/even terminal digit of their medical records number) to receive either the midline study device or a PICC (Tele-flex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC). Patients with contraindications to vancomycin or the intended VAD, or whose renal status precluded vascular access in the upper arm, were excluded. If vancomycin therapy was extended beyond 5 days, physicians were advised to administer subsequent doses via a PICC. Understandably, clinical circumstances did not always allow for this change of routes.

Midlines and PICCs were inserted according to manufacturers' directions for use. Preparation included 2% chlorhexidine and maximum sterile barrier protection; lines were dressed with a chlorhexidine impregnated sponge and transparent semipermeable dressing and secured using a mechanical catheter securement device. All VADs were inserted in the basilic, brachial or cephalic vein of the upper arm using ultrasound guidance.

Nurses administering vancomycin were instructed to check for line patency and functionality by aspirating for blood and flushing the line with preservative-free normal saline. If it flushed, but blood return could not be demonstrated, the line was assessed with ultrasound to determine its position. Only if the line flushed easily and intraluminal position could be confirmed was vancomycin administered.

Vancomycin was given by infusion pump over a minimum of 60 minutes, at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, either once or twice daily.

Patients were observed at least once daily. All device-related complications were recorded.

A comparative analysis of operational costs to deliver vancomycin by means of the midline study device versus a PICC was also undertaken.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^4d14e34f]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

When stratified by dwell time, we found that patients with midline catheters in place for 14 or fewer days had significantly lower risk of major complications, particularly CR-VTE, vs PICCs. Further, during this short duration of midline catheter use, the risks of minor complications and device failure were similar to PICCs. For dwell exceeding 14 days, the likelihood of any major complication occurring with midline catheters was similar to those with PICCs. The rates of minor complications and device failure were also comparable in both devices beyond 14 days. Collectively, these findings support current practice that prefer midline catheters over PICCs for peripherally compatible infusates if the intended use is 14 or fewer days. However, these findings also suggest that midline catheters may also be considered for dwell times beyond 14 days. Future studies evaluating factors such as specific infusates, varying care practices, and device placement techniques or properties that support longer midline catheter dwell would be welcomed.,

Minor complications often necessitate device removal or replacement, interrupting OPAT and causing patient discomfort or inconvenience. Consistent with previous reports, we found minor complications to be common with both midline catheters and PICCs. The most common midline catheter complication was catheter dislodgement, which in many cases necessitated device removal. Catheter occlusion was also common with midline catheters and generally led to premature midline catheter removal, as little evidence examining the use of thrombolytics to declot midline catheters is available. In contrast, catheter occlusion of PICCs is often remediable with thrombolytics and may not necessitate device removal. Studies examining the safety and efficacy of the use of these agents in midline catheters appear necessary.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^892bd924]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial/antiseptic agent–impregnated catheters and cuffs — evidence and scope indicate that certain coated or impregnated catheters can decrease the risk for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI); nearly all studies used triple-lumen, uncuffed catheters in adult patients with dwell times less than 30 days; these catheters are approved for patients weighing more than 3 kg and are not currently available for infants weighing less than 3 kg; first-generation chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine catheters reduced CRBSI risk versus standard catheters, with study dwell times ranging from 5.1 to 112 days; second-generation chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine catheters showed a significant reduction in catheter colonization but were underpowered to detect CRBSI differences, and rare anaphylaxis has been observed; minocycline/rifampin-impregnated central venous catheters were associated with lower CRBSI rates than first-generation chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine–impregnated catheters, with beneficial effect beginning after day 6 of catheterization; and silicone minocycline/rifampin–impregnated catheters with an average dwell time of more than 60 days have been shown to be effective in reducing CRBSI.

### Prevention of peripherally inserted central line-associated blood stream infections in very low-birth-weight infants by using a central line bundle guideline with a standard checklist: a case control study [^2da044a5]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Bundle insertion

PICCs were inserted in all the participants by a senior nurse who was qualified to perform catheter insertion. The following conditions were established for the CLB group: 1) creation of a PICC treatment center, which based on a treatment trolley, always with sufficient instrument and drugs in it and be checked regularly, which was placed in the catheter lab, meantime qualified doctors and nurses were also needed. 2) hand hygiene, 3) maximum sterility, 4) skin preparation, and 5) selection of the best puncture site. The PICC supplies (single-lumen 1.9-Fr catheter and No. 26 catheter sheath, BD Inc. Illinois, USA) were kept in a fixed location, and regular inspections were undertaken to ensure the presence of adequate supplies and backups within the study period. The VLBWIs underwent PICC line insertion only in the treatment center. The nurse and assistants were required to wash their hands in strict accordance with the seven-step hand-washing method. For maximum sterility, the nurse and assistants wore sterile surgical gowns, gloves, hats, and masks. Masks required complete and tight wrapping around the nose and mouth. The headcaps completely and tightly covered all the hair. The patients were completely covered with sterile towels from head to toe, with only the puncture site exposed. Skin preparation was performed by washing the prepuncture upper arm (from the fingertips to the fossa cubitalis) with warm soapy water before PICC insertion. A 75% alcohol solution was used to clean and degrease the skin first. The procedure was repeated two or three times according to the patient's skin condition. Thereafter, Anerdian was used to disinfect the armpits, down to the fingertips, and the procedure was repeated three times. Anerdian is a kind of skin disinfectants that used widely in clinics, in which contains iodine (0.2 ± 0.02%), chlorhexidine acetate (0.45 ± 0.045%), ethanol (65 ± 5%). Anerdian could kill intestinal bacteria, pyogenic bacteria, yeast and pathogenic bacteria and many other bacteria that caused hospital infection. Manufacturer was disinfection technologies Ltd. on Haili Kang, ShangHai. The punctured area was dried naturally after disinfectant application. The best puncture site was then selected. The first choice was the basilica vein, followed by the cubital and axillary veins. Puncture of the lower limbs was avoided. In the control group, strict hand hygiene, skin preparation, and aseptic manipulation practices were followed; however, the measures of using the PICC treatment center, ensuring maximum sterility, or selecting the best puncture site were not adopted.

### Effect of a second-generation venous catheter impregnated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine on central catheter-related infections: a randomized, controlled trial [^93428a10]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous catheter-related infections are a significant medical problem. Improved preventive measures are needed.

Objective

To ascertain 1) effectiveness of a second-generation antiseptic-coated catheter in the prevention of microbial colonization and infection; 2) safety and tolerability of this device; 3) microbiology of infected catheters; and 4) propensity for the development of antiseptic resistance.

Design

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.

Setting

9 university-affiliated medical centers.

Patients

780 patients in intensive care units who required central venous catheterization.

Intervention

Patients received either a standard catheter or a catheter coated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine.

Measurements

The authors assessed catheter colonization and catheter-related infection, characterized microbes by molecular typing, and determined their susceptibility to antiseptics. Patient tolerance of the catheter was monitored.

Results

Patients with the 2 types of catheters had similar demographic features, clinical interventions, laboratory values, and risk factors for infection. Antiseptic catheters were less likely to be colonized at the time of removal compared with control catheters (13.3 vs. 24.1 colonized catheters per 1000 catheter-days; P < 0.01). The center-stratified Cox regression hazard ratio for colonization controlling for sampling design and potentially confounding variables was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.78). The rate of definitive catheter-related bloodstream infection was 1.24 per 1000 catheter-days (CI, 0.26 to 3.62 per 1000 catheter-days) for the control group versus 0.42 per 1000 catheter-days (CI, 0.01 to 2.34 per 1000 catheter-days) for the antiseptic catheter group (P = 0.6). Coagulase-negative staphylococci and other gram-positive organisms were the most frequent microbes to colonize catheters. Noninfectious adverse events were similar in both groups. Antiseptic susceptibility was similar for microbes recovered from either group.

Limitations

The antiseptic catheter was not compared with an antibiotic-coated catheter, and no conclusion can be made regarding its effect on bloodstream infection.

Conclusions

The second-generation chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine catheter is well tolerated. Antiseptic coating appears to reduce microbial colonization of the catheter compared with an uncoated catheter.

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^663c171e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters was published by Simon L Thomsen and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Catheter-related bloodstream infection, Sepsis and septic shock, Catheter-related thrombosis, Maintenance fluid therapy and Parenteral nutrition. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the trial question was: what is the role of midline catheters in patients receiving intravenous therapy? In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the population was: 304 patients (130 female, 174 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with an anticipated IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; infection or burns at both upper extremities; existing central venous catheter; informed consent not obtainable. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the interventions were: n = 152 MC (midline catheter for IV fluids or medications for 5–28 days) n = 152 PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter for IV fluids or medications for 5–28 days). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in patients who did not develop catheter-related bloodstream infection (100% vs. 99.3%; ARD 0.7, 95% CI -98.17 to 99.57). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in DVT (0% vs. 1.3%; ARD -1.3, 95% CI -4.99 to 2.39) Significant increase in premature catheter removal (13.2% vs. 6.6%; IRR 2.61, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.64) Significant increase in accidental catheter removal (2.6% vs. 0.7%; AD 1.9%, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.76). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in any complications (13.2% vs. 7.2%), minor complications (13.2% vs. 5.3%). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with an anticipated IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days, MC was not superior to PICC with respect to patients who did not develop catheter-related bloodstream infection.

### Safe use of peripherally inserted central catheters for chemotherapy of solid malignancies in adult patients: a 1-year monocentric, prospectively-assessed, unselected cohort of 482 patients [^d298509e]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aim of this study was to analyze the overall complication and failure rates of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs), in a 1-year consecutive unselected cohort of 482 adult patients, affected by non-hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods

Adult outpatients (aged 18-75years), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2, bearing solid tumors and candidates for intravenous chemotherapy were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria were active infections, coagulopathy (defined as platelet count < 50,000/μL and/or prothrombin time more than 18s), life expectancy < 6months, or inability to give written informed consent. Devices were all implanted in an outpatients' hospital facility, following predefined evidence-based institutional guidelines and protocols by a PICC-dedicated team at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, during the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31, 2019.

Results

Five-hundred PICCs were implanted in a cohort of 482 patients during the time interval of this study. Thirty devices were overall removed (6.2%), 23 as a consequence of a complication occurred, and seven inadvertently. The inserted PICCs accounted for a total of 49,718 catheter days in situ, median duration was 85.5days [interquartile range (IQR): 56–146]. Overall there were 42 (8.7%) complications, corresponding to 0.84 catheter-adverse events (CAE)/1000 PICC-days (95% CI: 0.61–1.14). There were N = 13 (2.7%) thromboses, N = 11 (2.3%) irreversible occlusions, N = 7 (1.5%) accidental removals, N = 5 (1.0%) infections [two Catheter Related Blood Stream Infection (CRBSI) and three exit site/local infection], N = 3 (0.6%) ruptures and N = 3 (0.6%) primary or secondary malpositions.

Conclusion

This large prospective study supports the increasing use of PICCs in adult oncology outpatients treated in specialized centers with chemotherapy for non-hematological malignancies. In this clinical setting, PICC failure occurred in 6% only of the inserted devices.

### A systematic review comparing the relative effectiveness of antimicrobial-coated catheters in intensive care units [^25b7df83]. American Journal of Infection Control (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infection related to a central venous catheter is a substantial clinical and economic problem. To develop policy for managing the risks of these infections, all available evidence for prevention strategies should be synthesized and understood.

Methods

We evaluate evidence (1985–2006) for short-term antimicrobial-coated central venous catheters in lowering rates of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in the adult intensive care unit. Evidence was appraised for inclusion against predefined criteria. Data extraction was by 2 independent reviewers. Thirty-four studies were included in the review. Antiseptic, antibiotic, and heparin-coated catheters were compared with uncoated catheters and one another. Metaanalysis was used to generate summary relative risks for CRBSI and catheter colonization by antimicrobial coating.

Results

Externally impregnated chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine catheters reduce risk of CRBSI relative to uncoated catheters (RR, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47–0.93). Minocycline and rifampicin-coated catheters are significantly more effective relative to CHG/SSD catheters (RR, 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02–0.67). The new generation chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine catheters and silver, platinum, and carbon-coated catheters showed nonsignificant reductions in risk of CRBSI compared with uncoated catheters.

Conclusion

Two decades of evidence describe the effectiveness of antimicrobial catheters in preventing CRBSI and provide useful information about which catheters are most effective. Questions surrounding their routine use will require supplementation of this trial evidence with information from more diverse sources.

### A silver-alginate-coated dressing to reduce peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) infections in NICU patients: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^50558a83]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our aim was to evaluate the safety of a silver-alginate-containing dressing to reduce peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) infections in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients.

Study Design

Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive a patch containing silver, alginate and maltodextrin or standard of care. Patches were placed under the regular transparent retention dressing at the PICC exit site at insertion and were replaced with every dressing change at least every 2 weeks until PICC discontinuation. All study infants were monitored for adverse skin reactions.

Result

A total of 100 infants were followed up for 1922 person-days, including 75 subjects with 89 PICCs who received the patch. The median birth weight (1330 g) and median gestational age (30 weeks) was lower in the patch group when compared with the controls (P = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively). Study patients received the patch with their PICC at a median age of 5 days; the patch stayed in place for a median of 13 days. We noted no adverse skin reactions and found no evidence that the patch alters the microbiology of PICC-associated infections.

Conclusion

This pilot trial suggests that silver-alginate-coated dressings are skin safe and their inclusion in future trials aimed at reduction of PICC-associated bloodstream infections in the NICU should be considered.

### Peripherally inserted central catheters in non-hospitalized cancer patients: 5-year results of a prospective study [^9387b113]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

In our hospital, HPN was not routine practice neither in all cancer patients nor the subset receiving chemotherapy. According to our regional policy, an oncologic patient should receive HPN when meeting all the following criteria: (1) proven failure to meet nutrition requirements by the oral or enteral route, with impending risk of death due to malnutrition; (2) life expectancy > 2 months; (3) Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50; (4) control or absence of pain; (5) absence of severe organ dysfunctions; (6) written informed consent confirming that the patient will accept this modality of nutrition support; (7) approval by the physician responsible for HPN, by the oncologist, and by the general practitioner; (8) presence of environmental conditions compatible with HPN; (9) availability of a dedicated in-home caregiver; (10) and availability of a nursing team dedicated to the patient home care, as provided by the Regional Public Health Service. HPN was defined as patients receiving a PN bag at home on a 10- to 14-h per day basis.

Chemotherapy was defined as patients receiving intravenous or oral anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Chemotherapy regimens were administered by oncologists according to the patients' need (perioperative, adjuvant, or palliative chemotherapy) following the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines. A detailed description of the chemotherapy regimens adopted in the different sites and stages of the tumors is beyond the aims of this paper. In those patients who were receiving HPN and intravenous chemotherapy, the PICC was used for both the therapies but never at the same time.

In all patients, maintenance/care of PICC was carried out by specifically trained nurses through home visits initially every day for 2–3 weeks and at least every 7 days thereafter, according to the recommendations of our regional health service. A strict policy of hand washing and of environmental hygiene was observed by nurses and caregivers at home. Similarly, an appropriate asepsis when managing the PICC; a strict policy for flushing the catheter with normal saline before and after use, with the pulsating "push/pause" plus positive-pressure method; and the use of transparent dressings were adopted. The lines were also used for drawing blood and flushed with 20 mL of normal saline post-blood draw. No heparin lock was used; PICCs were flushed with the pulsating push/pause plus positive-pressure method and were locked with 10–20 mL of normal saline.

Central venous catheter dressings — type and change intervals after insertion are outlined: Use chlorhexidine-containing dressings for CVCs in patients over 2 months of age (Quality of Evidence: HIGH), whereas for children under 2 months of age use of chlorhexidine dressings remains unclear, particularly in very preterm or low birthweight infants; for nontunneled CVCs in adults and children, change transparent dressings and perform site care with a chlorhexidine-based antiseptic at least every 7 days or immediately if the dressing is soiled, loose, or damp, and change gauze dressings every 2 days or earlier if soiled, loose, or damp (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE); less frequent, clinically indicated dressing changes may be used for NICU patients or others at high risk of serious complications from catheter dislodgement, and if there is excessive bleeding or drainage from the catheter exit site, use gauze dressings instead of transparent dressings until drainage resolves.

Vascular access catheters — exit-site cleansing and hub connection antisepsis specify that procedures use aseptic technique, and chlorhexidine 2% with 70% alcohol is the preferred solution with defined alternatives; skin cleansing should include circular application from the exit site, cover an area 10 cm in diameter, repeat this step twice, avoid rinsing/blotting, and allow complete drying before dressing; to cleanse any central venous catheter (CVC) hub and cap use 2 swabs, including cleaning from the connection up the catheter for 10 cm and vigorously cleansing the hub/cap before discarding the swab; cleanse catheter segments adjacent to skin from the exit site outward, and follow manufacturer warnings/directions for disinfectants.

### Patterns, appropriateness and outcomes of peripherally inserted central catheter use in Brazil: a multicentre study of 12 725 catheters [^663b78dd]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large, prospective, multicentre study, we provide important insights into indications of PICC use, patterns of use, insertion techniques, appropriateness and outcomes in hospitalised adults across 16 Brazilian hospitals. Our findings suggest that while PICCs are largely used for appropriate indications and appear to have low rates of complications in Brazil, opportunities for improvement in duration of use and appropriateness remain. Specifically, policies aimed at encouraging more single-lumen device use, avoidance of PICCs with short dwell time and in patients with CKD could help improve patient safety. These findings can help inform local and national quality and policy efforts and serve as a research agenda for vascular access providers in Brazil.

The placement of any central venous catheter carries risk of complications that can increase morbidity, mortality and cost.PICCs play a pivotal role in hospitalised patients because they provide dependable and reliable central venous access for medium-term and long-term intravenous drug therapy. Results of recent studies have emphasised their benefits for patient safety when appropriate indications are respected and proper care is provided. In this first-of-a-kind study from Brazil, PICC insertion was predominantly performed by vascular access nurses, with a success rate close to 90%. The most common indication for PICC use was intravenous antibiotic therapy, and thus many devices were used for extended periods of time. The advent and growth of nurse-led vascular access teams in Brazil has been pivotal to safety of PICC use in the country, as successful placement and event-free device survival has been linked to such teams.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^a6327a2f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Intensive care unit candidemia prevention — prophylaxis thresholds and chlorhexidine bathing: For ICUs that show very high rates of invasive candidiasis, in excess of the expected rates of < 5% of patients, antifungal prophylaxis may be warranted in selected patients who are at high risk. A Cochrane analysis noted that the number needed to treat to prevent one case of invasive candidiasis in the ICU setting varied from 9 in high-risk patients to 188 in low-risk patients. Daily bathing of ICU (intensive care unit) patients with chlorhexidine, which has been shown to decrease the incidence of bloodstream infections including candidemia, could be considered (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Supporting data indicate that several multicenter randomized clinical trials have shown that daily chlorhexidine bathing decreases the incidence of both catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated hospital-acquired bloodstream infections; at least one trial found a significant reduction in catheter-associated bloodstream infections due to Candida species, and among 12 studies performed in an ICU setting only one was a randomized controlled trial, with the conclusion that chlorhexidine bathing reduced the incidence of bloodstream infections.

At insertion

In ICU and non-ICU settings, a facility should have a process in place, such as a checklist, to ensure adherence to infection prevention practices at the time of CVC insertion (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Ensure and document adherence to aseptic technique Checklists have been suggested to ensure optimal insertion practices. If used, the documentation should be done by someone other than the inserter. Observation of CVC insertion should be done by a nurse, physician, or other HCP who has received appropriate education (see above) to ensure that aseptic technique is maintained. HCP should be empowered to stop the procedure if breaches in aseptic technique are observed.
Perform hand hygiene prior to catheter insertion or manipulation (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Use an alcohol-based waterless product or soap and water. Use of gloves does not obviate hand hygiene.
The subclavian site is preferred to reduce infectious complications when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– In the non-ICU setting, the risk of infection between the different sites remains unclear. Importantly, in emergent settings, ensuring life-saving vascular access in the fastest possible way may determine the choice of access site. In children and infants, femoral vein catheterization may be considered if upper body sites are contraindicated. Tunneled femoral vein catheters, with an exit site outside the diaper area in the mid-thigh, may be safer and provide additional risk reduction. Controversy exists regarding infectious and noninfectious complications associated with different short-term CVC access sites. The risk and benefit of different insertion sites must be considered on an individual basis with regard to infectious and noninfectious complications. Among others, this applies to patients currently receiving or likely to require hemodialysis in whom the subclavian site is avoided due to risk of stenosis. Do not use peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. Risk of infection with PICCs in hospitalized patients approaches that of other CVCs. However, the majority of CLABSIs due to PICCs occur in non-ICU settings. Midline catheters are increasingly being used as an alternative to CVCs for short-term vascular access, with some observational studies suggesting lower bloodstream infection risk associated with midline catheters versus PICCsand versus CVCs, respectively. Randomized controlled trials comparing the risk of bloodstream infections and other complications associated with these devices are needed.
Use an all-inclusive catheter cart or kit (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A catheter cart or kit that contains all necessary components for aseptic catheter insertion should be available and easily accessible in all units where CVCs are inserted.
Use ultrasound guidance for catheter insertion (Quality of Evidence: HIGH), Ultrasound-guided internal jugular and femoral vein catheterization reduces the risk of noninfectious complications associated with CVC placementbut the use of ultrasound may lead to a breach in aseptic technique. It is unclear whether ultrasound-guided subclavian vein insertion reduces risk of infectious complications.
Use maximum sterile barrier precautions during CVC insertion (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Use maximum sterile barrier precautions: A mask, cap, sterile gown, and sterile gloves are to be worn by all HCP involved in the catheter insertion procedure. The patient is to be covered with a large ("full-body") sterile drape during catheter insertion. These measures should also be followed when exchanging a catheter over a guidewire. A prospective, randomized study in surgical patients showed no additional benefit for maximum sterile barrier precautions; nevertheless, most available evidence suggests risk reduction with this intervention.
Use an alcoholic chlorhexidine antiseptic for skin preparation (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– Before catheter insertion, apply an alcoholic chlorhexidine solution containing at least 2% chlorhexidine gluconate to the insertion site. The antiseptic solution must be allowed to dry before making the skin puncture. Alcoholic chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis to prevent CLABSI in NICU patients should be used when the benefits are judged to outweigh potential risk.

Before insertion

Provide easy access to an evidence-based list of indications for CVC use to minimize unnecessary CVC placement (Quality of Evidence: LOW)
Require education and competency assessment of healthcare personnel (HCP) involved in insertion, care, and maintenance of CVCs about CLABSI prevention (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Include the indications for catheter use, appropriate insertion and maintenance, the risk of CLABSI, and general infection prevention strategies. Ensure that all HCP involved in catheter insertion and maintenance complete an educational program on essential practices to prevent CLABSI before performing these duties. Periodic retraining with a competency assessment may be of benefit. Periodically assess HCP knowledge of and adherence to preventive measures. Require all HCP who insert a CVC to undergo a credentialing process (as established by the individual healthcare institution) to ensure their competency before independently inserting a CVC and aseptic technique for accessing and maintaining the CVC thereafter. Re-educate when an institution changes components of the infusion system that requires a change in practice (eg, when an institution's change of the needleless connector requires a change in nursing practice). Use simulation training for proper catheter insertion and maintenance if available. –
Bathe ICU patients > 2 months of age with a chlorhexidine preparation on a daily basis (Quality of Evidence: HIGH) – In long-term acute-care hospitals (LTACHs), daily chlorhexidine bathing may also be considered as a preventive measure. The role of chlorhexidine bathing in non-ICU patients remains unclear. One cluster-randomized study found a significant reduction in device-associated bacteremia with CHG bathing in this patient population; however, some of these patients also received methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) decolonization, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding CHG bathing alone. Several studies have suggested benefit among adult hematology-oncology patients; however, a similar reduction was not observed for pediatric patients with similar conditions. Accordingly, potential benefits and risks, such as increases in resistance and cost, need to be carefully considered. The safety and efficacy of routine use of chlorhexidine bathing in infants < 2 months of postnatal age remains unclear. Although life-threatening skin injuries from CHG have been reported in very young or very preterm infants, they typically occur in infants with a birthweight < 1,000 g who are < 7 days postnatal age, and they appear rare in older infants. – Widespread use of chlorhexidine may be associated with decreased chlorhexidine susceptibility, although the clinical relevance of this finding is not well defined.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^53bd146e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI 2019 vascular access — randomized trial evidence on CVC care protocols reports that one cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n = 422 facilities) using exit site disinfection with 2% chlorhexidine and 70% alcohol swab sticks plus 70% alcohol pads for hub care yielded an RR of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.78–0.81) for bloodstream infections versus current practice, with adverse events only in the intervention facilities including chlorhexidine sensitivity and 184 local, non–life-threatening events in 82 participants. A pilot RCT (n = 105) comparing 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol to 0.5% chlorhexidine in alcohol or 0.05% aqueous chlorhexidine for 12 months found fewer infections but not significantly different overall (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.18–1.34), with skin sensitivity reactions in 4 participants (Fisher exact test, P = 0.12).

### Sustained reduction of catheter-associated bloodstream infections with enhancement of catheter bundle by chlorhexidine dressings over 11 years [^5fe94cc9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Intervention

The intervention consisted of four stepwise modifications to an already established catheter bundle with progressive introduction of CHG dressings from 2007 to 2014 (Suppl Table 1).

Comparator (baseline): period A (January 2006–October 2007)

The standard of care as of January 2006 consisted of the following catheter bundle (Supplemental Table 2): (1) general infection control measures (hand hygiene, standard and isolation precautions); (2) guidelines for catheter insertion (checklist for material preparation, standardized hair removal with clippers and CHG-based skin antisepsis, maximal sterile barrier precaution); (3) handling (avoidance of needle and needleless connectors, systematic CHG disinfection of stop-cocks with new caps each time the hub is accessed); (4) maintenance (daily check for catheter necessity, signs of catheter infection, dressing integrity and need for replacement). To guarantee uniform application of the bundle, a designated physician and a designated nurse led the entire bundle and gave periodic feedback based on surveillance data. The designated clinical nurse specialist systematically trained ICU nurses on all elements of the bundle, including daily assessment of the dressings and face-to-face feedback and coaching. The designated physician systematically trained ICU physicians on how to apply the guidelines for insertion. This bundle was applied to all arterial and central venous lines.

Stepwise interventions: periods B through E and post-study period

To guarantee uniform implementation of the stepwise interventions (Supplemental Table 1), the dedicated clinical nurse specialist updated the institutional protocol, highlighted the changes specifically related to the use of the CHG dressings before each period, systematically trained ICU nurses to use these updated practices and completed a daily assessment of the CHG dressings with face-to-face feedback and coaching.

Period B — November 2007–Nov 2009

CHG sponge + transparent dressing on jugular and femoral CVC in all units.

Period C — December 2009–May 2011

CHG sponge + transparent dressing on all CVC and arterial catheters in all units.

Period D — June 2011–May 2013

CHG sponge + transparent dressing in three units (18 beds) and CHG gel all-in-one dressing in two units (14 beds) on all CVC and arterial catheters.

Period E — June 2013–December 2014

CHG gel all-in-one dressing in all units on all CVC and arterial lines.

Post-study period — January 2015–December 2018

CHG gel all-in-one dressing in all units on all CVC and arterial lines.

### Skin antisepsis for reducing central venous catheter-related infections [^70404c81]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The central venous catheter (CVC) is a device used for many functions, including monitoring haemodynamic indicators and administering intravenous medications, fluids, blood products and parenteral nutrition. However, as a foreign object, it is susceptible to colonisation by micro-organisms, which may lead to catheter-related blood stream infection (BSI) and in turn, increased mortality, morbidities and health care costs.

Objectives

To assess the effects of skin antisepsis as part of CVC care for reducing catheter-related BSIs, catheter colonisation, and patient mortality and morbidities.

Search Methods

In May 2016 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Epub Ahead of Print); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trial registries for ongoing and unpublished studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed any type of skin antiseptic agent used either alone or in combination, compared with one or more other skin antiseptic agent(s), placebo or no skin antisepsis in patients with a CVC in place.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the studies for their eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed our results in terms of risk ratio (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number need to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

Thirteen studies were eligible for inclusion, but only 12 studies contributed data, with a total of 3446 CVCs assessed. The total number of participants enrolled was unclear as some studies did not provide such information. The participants were mainly adults admitted to intensive care units, haematology oncology units or general wards. Most studies assessed skin antisepsis prior to insertion and regularly thereafter during the in-dwelling period of the CVC, ranging from every 24 h to every 72 h. The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed due to wide variation in their risk of bias. Most trials did not adequately blind the participants or personnel, and four of the 12 studies had a high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Three studies compared different antisepsis regimens with no antisepsis. There was no clear evidence of a difference in all outcomes examined, including catheter-related BSI, septicaemia, catheter colonisation and number of patients who required systemic antibiotics for any of the three comparisons involving three different antisepsis regimens (aqueous povidone-iodine, aqueous chlorhexidine and alcohol compared with no skin antisepsis). However, there were great uncertainties in all estimates due to underpowered analyses and the overall very low quality of evidence presented. There were multiple head-to-head comparisons between different skin antiseptic agents, with different combinations of active substance and base solutions. The most frequent comparison was chlorhexidine solution versus povidone-iodine solution (any base). There was very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision) that chlorhexidine may reduce catheter-related BSI compared with povidone-iodine (RR of 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.99; ARR 2.30%, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.70%). This evidence came from four studies involving 1436 catheters. None of the individual subgroup comparisons of aqueous chlorhexidine versus aqueous povidone-iodine, alcoholic chlorhexidine versus aqueous povidone-iodine and alcoholic chlorhexidine versus alcoholic povidone-iodine showed clear differences for catheter-related BSI or mortality (and were generally underpowered). Mortality was only reported in a single study. There was very low quality evidence that skin antisepsis with chlorhexidine may also reduce catheter colonisation relative to povidone-iodine (RR of 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.84; ARR 8%, 95% CI 3% to 12%; five studies, 1533 catheters, downgraded for risk of bias, indirectness and inconsistency). Evaluations of other skin antiseptic agents were generally in single, small studies, many of which did not report the primary outcome of catheter-related BSI. Trials also poorly reported other outcomes, such as skin infections and adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not clear whether cleaning the skin around CVC insertion sites with antiseptic reduces catheter related blood stream infection compared with no skin cleansing. Skin cleansing with chlorhexidine solution may reduce rates of CRBSI and catheter colonisation compared with cleaning with povidone iodine. These results are based on very low quality evidence, which means the true effects may be very different. Moreover these results may be influenced by the nature of the antiseptic solution (i.e. aqueous or alcohol-based). Further RCTs are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of different skin antisepsis regimens in CVC care; these should measure and report critical clinical outcomes such as sepsis, catheter-related BSI and mortality.

The incidence of catheter-tip colonization (per 1000 catheter-days) is 3.7, 3.9, and 10.5 events in the 0.5% CHG, 1% CHG and 10% PVI groups, respectively (Table 3 and Fig. 2 (Kaplan–Meier curve) (p = 0.03)). Pairwise comparison of catheter colonization between groups shows that the risk is significantly higher in the 10% PVI group (0.5% CHG vs. 10% PVI: HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12–0.95, p = 0.04; 1.0% CHG vs. 10% PVI: HR0.35, 95% CI 0.13–0.93, p = 0.04). However, there are no differences in colonization risk between the 0.5% and 1.0% CHG groups (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.29–3.13, p = 0.94). Of all analyzed catheters, 134 (16.8%) were further randomized to the three solutions for second or later insertions, although the initially placed catheters were already included in the analysis. A sensitivity analysis for initially inserted catheters, excluding these 134 catheters, showed no differences in patient characteristics between the three groups, and the same conclusion was obtained, showing superiority of 0.5%/1.0% CHG over 10% PVI, as confirmed in the FAS analysis (Additional file 1: Table S4).

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^6c3b7443]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Essential practices — The subclavian vein is considered the preferable site for central venous catheter (CVC) insertion in the intensive care setting to reduce infectious complications, replacing the prior emphasis on avoiding the femoral vein while affirming that guidance remains valid. The recommendation to use ultrasound guidance for catheter insertion is backed by better evidence than was available previously; however, the procedure itself may jeopardize the strict observation of sterile technique. The use of chlorhexidine-containing dressings is now considered an "essential practice"; in the past, it was listed under special approaches that should only be employed if CLABSI rates remain high despite the implementation of basic practices.

After insertion

Ensure appropriate nurse-to-patient ratio and limit use of float nurses in ICUs (Quality of Evidence: HIGH), Observational studies suggest that an adequate nurse-to-patient ratio must be maintained in ICUs where nurses are managing patients with CVCs and that the number of float nurses working in the ICU environment should be minimized.
Use chlorhexidine-containing dressings for CVCs in patients over 2 months of age (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– It is unclear whether there is additional benefit with use of a chlorhexidine-containing dressing if daily chlorhexidine bathing is already established and vice-versa. For long-term catheters (eg, hemodialysis catheters) in well-healed access sites, it is unclear whether use of a chlorhexidine dressing reduces risk of infectious complications. For children under 2 months of age, use of chlorhexidine dressings remains unclear, particularly in very preterm or low birthweight infants.
For nontunneled CVCs in adults and children, change transparent dressings and perform site care with a chlorhexidine-based antiseptic at least every 7 days or immediately if the dressing is soiled, loose, or damp. Change gauze dressings every 2 days or earlier if the dressing is soiled, loose, or damp. (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Less frequent, clinically indicated dressing changes may be used for NICU patients or others at high risk of serious complications from catheter dislodgement. If there is excessive bleeding or drainage from the catheter exit site, use gauze dressings instead of transparent dressings until drainage resolves.
Disinfect catheter hubs, needleless connectors, and injection ports before accessing the catheter (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Before accessing catheter hubs, needleless connectors, or injection ports, vigorously apply mechanical friction with an alcoholic chlorhexidine preparation, or 70% alcohol. Alcoholic chlorhexidine may have additional residual activity compared to alcohol for this purpose and is therefore preferred. Apply mechanical friction for a minimum of 5 seconds to reduce contamination. It is unclear whether this duration of disinfection can be generalized to needleless connectors not tested in these studies. Monitor compliance with hub-connector-port disinfection because approximately half of such catheter components are colonized under conditions of standard practice.
Remove nonessential catheters (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Assess the need for continued intravascular access on a daily basis during multidisciplinary rounds. Remove catheters not required for patient care. Decreasing CVC utilization reduces CRBSI risk. However, reducing CVC utilization may result in increased use of other intravascular catheters with corresponding infection risk. Audits to determine whether CVCs are routinely removed after their intended use may be helpful. Both simple and multifaceted interventions are effective at reducing unnecessary CVC use.
Routine replacement of administration sets not used for blood, blood products, or lipid formulations can be performed at intervals up to 7 days (Quality of Evidence: HIGH) The optimal replacement of intermittently used administration sets is unresolved.
Perform surveillance for CLABSI in ICU and non-ICU settings (Quality of Evidence: HIGH), Measure unit-specific incidence of CLABSI (eg, CLABSI per 1,000 catheter days) and report the data on a regular basis to the units, physician and nursing leadership, and hospital administrators overseeing the units. Compare CLABSI incidence to historical data for individual units and to national rates (ie, NHSN). Audit surveillance as necessary to minimize variation in interobserver reliability.

### Implementation and evaluation of short peripheral intravenous catheter flushing guidelines: a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial [^0a1c805f]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vascular access via peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) in the hand or arm is frequently required during hospital care to administer hydration fluids, medication, and blood transfusions. An estimated 70% of hospitalised patients will require a PIVC, and a large portion of these will be inserted and cared for by nurses. Historically, vascular access device research and practice has focused on reducing bloodstream infection rates, particularly in central venous catheters. However, catheter-related bloodstream infection rates in PIVCs are extremely low, at 0.03–0.1%, or 0.5 per 1000 catheter days, whereas PIVC failure rates due to occlusion, infiltration, dislodgement, phlebitis, or infection are 36%.

A failed PIVC is distressing for patients who have to endure the discomfort of a PIVC complication as well as the pain associated with a PIVC replacement. Complications and failure also hold implications for healthcare budgets with an estimated per-patient cost for PIVC replacement of AUD $70 (~ US $50) in 2012, and additional costs associated with an extended hospital stay due to delayed or interrupted intravenous therapy. With over two billion PIVCs purchased globally every year, and based on current PIVC complication rates, millions of dollars are wasted each year through PIVC failure. A reduction of PIVC failure by just 10% could save significant healthcare dollars and reduce unnecessary discomfort and risks for patients.

Standards of practice for PIVC maintenance globally include statements pertaining to flushing for maintaining patency and function. Flushing the catheter before and after administration of intravenous medication creates opportunity for assessment of insertion site and catheter performance and helps maintain catheter patency through avoiding mixing of incompatible fluids and medications, as well as minimising build-up of fibrin and biofilm that contribute to thrombophlebitis and catheter dysfunction. However, practice surveys and observational studies have revealed significant variation in practice (e.g. use of syringes smaller than 10 mL, use of heparinised saline) and other variations from guideline recommendations. These inconsistencies and failure to implement recommended practices likely contribute to current relatively high PIVC failure rates. Consequently, we developed a multifaceted intervention to raise awareness of the risks associated with PIVC use and adherence to guidelines for PIVC flushing practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multifaceted intervention that 'bundled' reinforcement of PIVC flushing guidelines with manufacturer-prepared pre-filled flush syringes.

### Randomized controlled trial of chlorhexidine dressing and highly adhesive dressing for preventing catheter-related infections in critically ill adults [^e9b128a5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Most vascular catheter-related infections (CRIs) occur extraluminally in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Chlorhexidine-impregnated and strongly adherent dressings may decrease catheter colonization and CRI rates.

Objectives

To determine if chlorhexidine-impregnated and strongly adherent dressings decrease catheter colonization and CRI rates.

Methods

In a 2:1:1 assessor-masked randomized trial in patients with vascular catheters inserted for an expected duration of 48 hours or more in 12 French ICUs, we compared chlorhexidine dressings, highly adhesive dressings, and standard dressings from May 2010 to July 2011. Coprimary endpoints were major CRI with or without catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) with chlorhexidine versus nonchlorhexidine dressings and catheter colonization rate with highly adhesive nonchlorhexidine versus standard nonchlorhexidine dressings. Catheter-colonization, CR-BSIs, and skin reactions were secondary endpoints.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 1,879 patients (4,163 catheters and 34,339 catheter-days) were evaluated. With chlorhexidine dressings, the major-CRI rate was 67% lower (0.7 per 1,000 vs. 2.1 per 1,000 catheter-days; hazard ratio [HR], 0.328; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.174–0.619; P = 0.0006) and the CR-BSI rate 60% lower (0.5 per 1,000 vs. 1.3 per 1,000 catheter-days; HR, 0.402; 95% CI, 0.186–0.868; P = 0.02) than with nonchlorhexidine dressings; decreases were noted in catheter colonization and skin colonization rates at catheter removal. The contact dermatitis rate was 1.1% with and 0.29% without chlorhexidine. Highly adhesive dressings decreased the detachment rate to 64.3% versus 71.9% (P < 0.0001) and the number of dressings per catheter to two (one to four) versus three (one to five) (P < 0.0001) but increased skin colonization (P < 0.0001) and catheter colonization (HR, 1.650; 95% CI, 1.21–2.26; P = 0.0016) without influencing CRI or CR-BSI rates.

Conclusions

A large randomized trial demonstrated that chlorhexidine-gel-impregnated dressings decreased the CRI rate in patients in the ICU with intravascular catheters. Highly adhesive dressings decreased dressing detachment but increased skin and catheter colonization. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01189682).

### Prevention of peripherally inserted central line-associated blood stream infections in very low-birth-weight infants by using a central line bundle guideline with a standard checklist: a case control study [^10f1e609]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The use of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) technology is widespread because of its simple operation, osmotolerance, and long indwelling time. However, catheter-related infections (CRIs) are one of the severe complications of PICC placement, with incidence rates ranging from 16.4 to 28.8%. If treatment is not timely or correct, the incidence of infection and mortality rate can be high. Therefore, knowledge on the manner in which such CRIs can be reduced or eliminated is important. A central line bundle (CLB) guideline was first proposed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and included five key measures — namely, hand hygiene, maximum sterility, chlorhexidine skin disinfection, choosing the best puncture site, and daily assessment of whether to remove the catheter. These measures have been proven to effectively reduce the occurrence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs).

Very low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs) have a low immune response and indistinct symptoms after infection compared with other populations. Some reviews have focused on the effect and safety of a CLB in VLBWIs and its preventive effect on bacterial colonization and infection. In the present study, we combined the CLB guidelines with actual CRBSI conditions to develop a plan for PICC insertion and maintenance and also used a standard checklist to ensure that each measure of the CLB guideline was implemented. The investigation of the effectiveness of the CLB guideline in preventing PICC CRIs in VLBWIs was always common, Pronovost et al has conducted a collaborative cohort study in Michigan, and the results showed a sharply decreased of the catheter-related bloodstream per 1000 catheter-days decreased from 2.7 infections at baseline to 0 at 3 months after implementation of the study, so we would conducted a retrospective study to investigate the guidline use in China, to find the effectiveness and feasibility of central line bundle (CLB) guideline with a standard checklist in the prevention of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related infections (CRIs) in very low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs).

### Comparison of the efficacy of three topical antiseptic solutions for the prevention of catheter colonization: a multicenter randomized controlled study [^f6c8d959]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 1226 catheter placements were reviewed for eligibility, and the remaining 1132 catheters, after obtaining informed consent, were randomized to one of three solutions. Several catheters were excluded because of withdrawal of informed consent, leaving 998 (88%) catheters eligible for analysis. However, substantial numbers of catheters were not cultured for various reasons (Fig. 1). Therefore, the FAS analysis is limited to 796 (70%) catheters.

There are no significant differences in the baseline characteristics among the groups (Table 1). The characteristics of the 202 patients excluded because of the lack of catheter colonization data are similar among the three groups and between the FAS population and patients excluded from the FAS (Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S2 and S3). No significant differences in the insertion sites selected were observed (data not shown). The characteristics of the catheters are similar among the groups (Table 2).

### Patient-reported complications related to peripherally inserted central catheters: a multicentre prospective cohort study [^312ce1e1]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Objective

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are frequently used to deliver medical therapies, but our knowledge regarding PICC-related complications remains incomplete. The objective of this study was to systematically elicit and characterise PICC-related complications as experienced by patients during and after hospitalisation.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Inpatient medical units at four US hospitals in two states.

Participants

Consecutive sample of patients who had a new PICC placed during a hospital stay between August 2015 and May 2017.

Main outcome(s)

Patient-reported signs and symptoms of a possible PICC-related complication or functional issues.

Results

Of the 438 patients in the analytic cohort (91.4% of those consented), two-thirds were male with a mean age of 56 years. The most common reason for PICC placement was long-term antibiotic therapy (43.4%). During the 70-day follow-up period, 61.4% of patients reported signs of at least one complication, including potentially serious complications, such as bloodstream infection (17.6%) and deep vein thrombosis (30.6%). Correspondence of these reported events with medical record documentation of the complication was generally low. More than one-quarter (27.9%) of patients reported minor complications, such as insertion site redness, discomfort or difficult removal. While the PICC was in place, 26.0% reported restrictions in activities of daily living, 14.4% social activity restrictions and 19.2% had difficulty with flushing or operating the PICC.

Conclusion

Over 60% of patients report signs or symptoms of a possible complication or adverse effect after PICC placement. Bothersome complications from the patient perspective are clearly more common than those that typically rise to the level of healthcare provider attention or concern. Understanding the patient experience is critical for providing safe and effective care.

### Practice guidelines for central venous access 2020: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on central venous access [^6d4fc2c9]. Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Central venous access — selection of antiseptic solution is informed by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorhexidine and povidone–iodine formulations: one RCT comparing chlorhexidine (2% aqueous solution without alcohol) with povidone–iodine (10% without alcohol) reports equivocal findings for catheter colonization and catheter-related bacteremia (Category A3-E evidence); another RCT comparing chlorhexidine (2% with 70% isopropyl alcohol) with povidone–iodine (5% with 69% ethanol) finds lower rates of catheter colonization for chlorhexidine (Category A3-B evidence) with equivocal evidence for decreased catheter-related bloodstream infection (Category A3-E evidence); and a third RCT comparing chlorhexidine concentrations (0.5% or 1.0% in 70% ethanol) with povidone–iodine (10% without alcohol) reports equivocal evidence for colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection (Category A3-E evidence). A quasiexperimental study reports a lower rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection with chlorhexidine (2% with 70% alcohol) than povidone–iodine (5% with 69% alcohol) (Category B1-B evidence). The literature is insufficient to evaluate the safety of antiseptic solutions containing chlorhexidine in neonates, infants and children, comparative studies are insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine and alcohol compared with chlorhexidine without alcohol, and an RCT of 5% povidone–iodine with 70% alcohol compared with 10% povidone–iodine alone indicates that catheter tip colonization is reduced with alcohol containing solutions with equivocal findings for catheter-related bloodstream infections and clinical signs of infection. The consultants and ASA members strongly agree with the recommendation to use a chlorhexidine-containing solution for skin preparation in adults, infants, and children; for neonates, the consultants and ASA members agree with the recommendation to determine the use of chlorhexidine-containing solutions based on clinical judgment and institutional protocol; if there is a contraindication to chlorhexidine, the consultants strongly agree and ASA members agree with the recommendation that povidone–iodine or alcohol may be used; and the consultants and ASA members agree with the recommendation to use skin preparation solutions containing alcohol unless contraindicated.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Other central venous access catheters, including nontunneled hemodialysis catheters — routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, with the exception of those placed in immunocompromised patients; catheter care measures include cleansing of catheter port sites with 2% chlorhexidine while in the intensive care unit, which are also recommended.

### Anti-infective external coating of central venous catheters: a randomized, noninferiority trial comparing 5-fluorouracil with chlorhexidine / silver sulfadiazine in preventing catheter colonization [^e7bcad53]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The antimetabolite drug, 5-fluorouracil, inhibits microbial growth. Coating of central venous catheters with 5-fluorouracil may reduce the risk of catheter infection. Our objective was to compare the safety and efficacy of central venous catheters externally coated with 5-fluorouracil with those coated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine.

Design

Prospective, single-blind, randomized, active-controlled, multicentered, noninferiority trial.

Setting

Twenty-five US medical center intensive care units.

Patients

A total of 960 adult patients requiring central venous catheterization for up to 28 days.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive a central venous catheter externally coated with either 5-fluorouracil (n = 480) or chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (n = 480).

Measurements and Main Results

The primary antimicrobial outcome was a dichotomous measure (< 15 colony-forming units or ≥ 15 colony-forming units) for catheter colonization determined by the roll plate method. Secondary antimicrobial outcomes included local site infection and catheter-related bloodstream infection. Central venous catheters coated with 5-fluorouracil were noninferior to chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine coated central venous catheters with respect to the incidence of catheter colonization (2.9% vs. 5.3%, respectively). Local site infection occurred in 1.4% of the 5-fluorouracil group and 0.9% of the chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine group. No episode of catheter-related bloodstream infection occurred in the 5-fluorouracil group, whereas two episodes were noted in the chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine group. Only Gram-positive organisms were cultured from 5-fluorouracil catheters, whereas Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and Candida were cultured from the chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine central venous catheters. Adverse events were comparable between the two central venous catheter coatings.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that central venous catheters externally coated with 5-fluorouracil are a safe and effective alternative to catheters externally coated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine when used in critically ill patients.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^3c8e6824]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central venous catheter maintenance — disinfection, device removal, administration set replacement, and surveillance are described: Disinfect catheter hubs, needleless connectors, and injection ports before accessing the catheter (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) by vigorously applying mechanical friction with an alcoholic chlorhexidine preparation, or 70% alcohol, for a minimum of 5 seconds to reduce contamination, and monitor compliance because approximately half of such catheter components are colonized under conditions of standard practice; remove nonessential catheters, assessing the need for continued intravascular access on a daily basis and removing nonessential catheters; routine replacement of administration sets not used for blood, blood products, or lipid formulations can be performed at intervals up to 7 days (Quality of Evidence: HIGH); and perform surveillance for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in ICU and non-ICU settings (Quality of Evidence: HIGH), measuring unit-specific incidence of CLABSI (eg, CLABSI per 1,000 catheter days), reporting these data regularly, comparing incidence to historical and national rates, and auditing surveillance as necessary to minimize variation in interobserver reliability.

### Association of infectious disease physician approval of peripherally inserted central catheter with appropriateness and complications [^cd4ce1e4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central venous catheters used ubiquitously in medical care. Compared with central venous catheters placed in the neck or chest, PICCs are placed in upper-extremity veins in adults and consequently avoid many of the immediate insertion complications associated with device placement. As PICC use has increased, however, reports of complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), have emerged. One strategy to reduce the risk of PICC-related complications is to consider the appropriateness of PICC use, including aspects such as device characteristics and use of alternatives. For example, use of single-lumen (vs multilumen) devices can reduce the risk of DVT or CLABSI. Similarly, use of PICCs with a smaller cross-sectional diameter (ie, catheter gauge) is known to be associated with fewer thrombotic complications. Furthermore, because safer alternative devices are available, PICC use should be avoided if access is needed for a brief period (ie, ≤ 5 days) or for patients with chronic kidney disease. Collectively, these findings have led to Choosing Wisely recommendationsand appropriateness criteriato inform and benchmark PICC use.

One of the most common indications for PICC insertion is intravenous antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, infectious disease (ID) physicians are often involved in decision-making related to PICC use. If they are consulted early, ID physicians may be able to prevent inappropriate PICC use — for example, for patients who could have their antimicrobials discontinued or switched to oral therapy. Similarly, because ID physicians often treat CLABSIs, they may be more likely to recommend interventions to reduce the risk of CLABSI, such as the use of single-lumen PICCs or antimicrobial catheters in patients who are at high risk of adverse events. Despite this, little is known about the association of ID physician approval with PICC appropriateness and outcomes. Because device complications are common in patients receiving intravenous antimicrobials, there may be an opportunity to improve patient safety by engaging ID physicians prior to PICC insertion.

The Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS) is a statewide quality collaborative aimed at preventing adverse events in hospitalized medical patients. Since 2015, the HMS has collected detailed data on PICCs, allowing for assessment of PICC appropriateness, and patient outcomes. We sought to evaluate whether ID physician approval of PICC use prior to placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with appropriate device use and fewer complications.

### Patterns, appropriateness and outcomes of peripherally inserted central catheter use in Brazil: a multicentre study of 12 725 catheters [^7b1cfc12]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Major complications such as thrombosis occurred at a low rate, especially compared with previous studies of PICC-related thrombosis. A recent study that also used advanced tip location techniques found a similarly low thrombosis rate. During the 30-day follow-up period, of the total 129 cases of PICC-related thrombosis, 76 (58.9%) were observed in the first 10 days. Data and guidelines indicate that short-term PICC use is not recommended because thrombotic complications often occur early in the dwell of a catheter. Better understanding of patient, device and operator factors that may lead to less short-term PICC use and fewer thromboses appears necessary. An alternative strategy to avoid the use of PICC for a short period (≤ 5 days) may be use of midline catheters. Available evidence indicates that midlines can easily be placed at bedside and are reasonable when the expected intravenous duration of therapy is less than 14 days. However, use of midlines may be constrained by infusate pH and osmolarity restrictions which may necessitate use of a central venous catheter such as a PICC.

Reversible catheter occlusion and accidental dislodgement were the most common minor complications, occurring in 2.5% and 1.2% of catheters, respectively. In a study with 13 000 PICCs conducted in North America, occlusion developed in 1716 PICCs (12.0%) in 1684 patients. Catheter occlusion is one of the most common complications of PICC placement, and good catheter maintenance and management practices can contribute to its reduction.

Considering the three MAGIC appropriateness criteria analysed in this study, two (dwell time and creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL) were met by over 80% of catheters. However, when considering indications for multi-lumen PICCs (total parenteral nutrition, administration of incompatible drugs, administration of chemotherapy concomitantly with other drugs), the decision to place this device was rated as inappropriate approximately half of the time. In addition, these devices were more often associated with major complications. These findings are comparable with findings from North America, where the major drivers of inappropriate PICC use are use of multi-lumen devices and short-term device use. This gap presents an opportunity for practice improvement and patient safety. Studies that implemented educational interventions, indications for multi-lumen catheters and modification of electronic medical records to make single-lumen PICCs the default option, have been associated with reductions in multi-lumen catheter use and attendant healthcare costs.

### Sustained reduction of catheter-associated bloodstream infections with enhancement of catheter bundle by chlorhexidine dressings over 11 years [^af08918f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Prospective randomized controlled studies have demonstrated that addition of chlorhexidine (CHG) dressings reduces the rate of catheter (central venous and arterial)-associated bloodstream infections (CABSIs). However, studies confirming their impact in a real-world setting are lacking.

Methods

We conducted a real-world data study evaluating the impact of incrementally introducing chlorhexidine dressings (sponge or gel) in addition to an ongoing catheter bundle on the rates of CABSI, expressed as incidence density rates per 1000 catheter-days measured as part of a surveillance program. Poisson regression models were used to compare infection rates over time. Both dressings were used simultaneously during one of the five study periods.

Results

From 2006 to 2014, 18,286 patients were admitted (91,292 ICU-days and 155,242 catheter-days). We recorded 111 CABSIs. We observed a progressive but significant decrease of CABSI rates from 1.48 (95% CI 1.09–2.01) without CHG dressings to 0.69 (95% CI 0.43–1.09) and 0.23 (95% CI 0.11–0.48) episodes per 1000 catheter-days when CHG sponge and CHG gel dressings were used (p = 0.0007; p < 0.001). A non-significant lower rate of infections occurred with CHG gel compared with CHG sponge dressings. An identical low rate of allergic skin reactions (0.3/1000 device-days) was observed with both types of CHX dressings. Post-study data until 2018 confirmed a sustained decrease of infection rates over 11 years.

Conclusions

The addition of chlorhexidine dressings to all CVC and arterial lines to an ongoing catheter bundle was associated with a sustained 11-year reduction of all catheter-associated bloodstream infections. This large real-world data study further supports the current recommendations for the systematic use of CHG dressings on all catheters of ICU patients.

### Chlorhexidine bathing of the critically ill for the prevention of hospital-acquired infection [^b4459034]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospital-acquired infection is a frequent adverse event in patient care; it can lead to longer stays in the intensive care unit (ICU), additional medical complications, permanent disability or death. Whilst all hospital-based patients are susceptible to infections, prevalence is particularly high in the ICU, where people who are critically ill have suppressed immunity and are subject to increased invasive monitoring. People who are mechanically-ventilated are at infection risk due to tracheostomy and reintubation and use of multiple central venous catheters, where lines and tubes may act as vectors for the transmission of bacteria and may increase bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Chlorhexidine is a low-cost product, widely used as a disinfectant and antiseptic, which may be used to bathe people who are critically ill with the aim of killing bacteria and reducing the spread of hospital-acquired infections.

Objectives

To assess the effects of chlorhexidine bathing on the number of hospital-acquired infections in people who are critically ill.

Search Methods

In December 2018 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trial registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and checked reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared chlorhexidine bathing with soap-and-water bathing of patients in the ICU.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and undertook risk of bias and GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included eight studies in this review. Four RCTs included a total of 1537 individually randomised participants, and four cluster-randomised cross-over studies included 23 randomised ICUs with 22,935 participants. We identified one study awaiting classification, for which we were unable to assess eligibility. The studies compared bathing using 2% chlorhexidine-impregnated washcloths or dilute solutions of 4% chlorhexidine versus soap-and-water bathing or bathing with non-antimicrobial washcloths. Eight studies reported data for participants who had a hospital-acquired infection during the ICU stay. We are uncertain whether using chlorhexidine for bathing of critically ill people reduces the rate of hospital-acquired infection, because the certainty of the evidence is very low (rate difference 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 3.29; 21,924 participants). Six studies reported mortality (in hospital, in the ICU, and at 48 hours). We cannot be sure whether using chlorhexidine for bathing of critically-ill people reduces mortality, because the certainty of the evidence is very low (odds ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99; 15,798 participants). Six studies reported length of stay in the ICU. We noted that individual studies found no evidence of a difference in length of stay; we did not conduct meta-analysis because data were skewed. It is not clear whether using chlorhexidine for bathing of critically ill people reduced length of stay in the ICU, because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Seven studies reported skin reactions as an adverse event, and five of these reported skin reactions which were thought to be attributable to the bathing solution. Data in these studies were reported inconsistently and we were unable to conduct meta-analysis; we cannot tell whether using chlorhexidine for bathing of critically ill people reduced adverse events, because the certainty of the evidence is very low. We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence of each outcome to very low. For all outcomes, we downgraded evidence because of study limitations (most studies had a high risk of performance bias, and we noted high risks of other bias in some studies). We downgraded evidence due to indirectness, because some participants in studies may have had hospital-acquired infections before recruitment. We noted that one small study had a large influence on the effect for hospital-acquired infections, and we assessed decisions made in analysis of some cluster-randomised cross-over studies on the effect for hospital-acquired infections and for mortality; we downgraded the evidence for these outcomes due to inconsistency. We also downgraded the evidence on length of stay in the ICU, because of imprecision. Data for adverse events were limited by few events and so we downgraded for imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the very low-certainty evidence available, it is not clear whether bathing with chlorhexidine reduces hospital-acquired infections, mortality, or length of stay in the ICU, or whether the use of chlorhexidine results in more skin reactions.

### Use of peripherally inserted central catheters in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a prospective cohort study [^78e777e8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines, including Choosing Wisely recommendations, endorse avoiding placement of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objective

To describe the frequency of and characteristics associated with PICC use in hospitalized patients with stage 3b or greater CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

52 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium.

Participants

Hospitalized medical patients who received a PICC between November 2013 and September 2016.

Measurements

Percentage of patients receiving PICCs who had CKD, frequency of PICC-related complications, and variation in the proportion of PICCs placed in patients with CKD.

Results

Of 20 545 patients who had PICCs placed, 4743 (23.1% [95% CI, 20.9% to 25.3%]) had an estimated GFR (eGFR) less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 699 (3.4%) were receiving hemodialysis. In the intensive care unit (ICU), 30.9% (CI, 29.7% to 32.2%) of patients receiving PICCs had an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; the corresponding percentage in wards was 19.3% (CI, 18.8% to 19.9%). Among patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, multilumen PICCs were placed more frequently than single-lumen PICCs. In wards, PICC-related complications occurred in 15.3% of patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and in 15.2% of those with an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or higher. The corresponding percentages in ICU settings were 22.4% and 23.9%. In patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, PICC placement varied widely across hospitals (interquartile range, 23.7% to 37.8% in ICUs and 12.8% to 23.7% in wards).

Limitation

Nephrologist approval for placement could not be determined, and 2.7% of eGFR values were unknown and excluded.

Conclusion

In this sample of hospitalized patients who received PICCs, placement in those with CKD was common and not concordant with clinical guidelines.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^4aad35cc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — essential practices before insertion: Provide easy access to an evidence-based list of indications for central venous catheter (CVC) use to minimize unnecessary CVC placement; require education and competency assessment of healthcare personnel (HCP) involved in insertion, care, and maintenance of CVCs about CLABSI prevention; bathe intensive care unit (ICU) patients aged ≥ 2 months with a chlorhexidine preparation on a daily basis; in ICU and non-ICU settings, a facility should have a process in place, such as a checklist, to ensure adherence to infection prevention practices at the time of CVC insertion; use hand hygiene prior to catheter insertion or manipulation; the subclavian site is preferred to reduce infectious complications when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting; use an all-inclusive catheter cart or kit; use ultrasound guidance for catheter insertion; use maximum sterile barrier precautions during CVC insertion; and use an alcoholic chlorhexidine antiseptic for skin preparation.
