## Question

when should aysmptomatic nsvt be treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) should be treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition of NSVT and how to document it. Then, I should verify the baseline risk stratification by presence or absence of structural heart disease. Next, I will examine scenarios where treatment is not indicated, followed by scenarios where further risk stratification is warranted. After that, I need to check the specific high-risk conditions where treatment or device therapy is indicated. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical decision algorithm with monitoring and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the definition and documentation requirements. NSVT is defined as three or more consecutive ventricular beats at a rate greater than 100 bpm, terminating spontaneously in less than 30 seconds. Obtaining a 12-lead ECG during the arrhythmia whenever possible is recommended to characterize morphology and guide etiology and risk assessment [^116RuoUu].

> Next, I should review baseline risk stratification. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — prognosis and management hinge on whether there is structural heart disease. In patients without apparent heart disease, NSVT is common and often benign, though some observational cohorts associate incidental NSVT with modestly increased long-term cardiovascular risk; nonetheless, suppression is not indicated in the absence of symptoms or cardiomyopathy, so I need to ensure we do not over-treat in this group [^116RuoUu] [^115ob9aw].

> I will now examine scenarios where treatment is not indicated. For asymptomatic NSVT without structural heart disease, observation and reassurance are appropriate; antiarrhythmic drug suppression does not improve outcomes and may cause harm, so I should avoid pharmacologic therapy here. Wait, let me verify the drug safety point — flecainide and other class IC agents are contraindicated after myocardial infarction due to increased mortality, and sotalol carries proarrhythmic risk, reinforcing that asymptomatic NSVT should not be treated with antiarrhythmics in otherwise healthy patients [^116RuoUu] [^116PtshP] [^111ZL46n] [^113aZGb9].

> But wait, what if the patient has structural heart disease — does asymptomatic NSVT change management? Yes, I should confirm that NSVT in structural heart disease warrants further evaluation rather than immediate antiarrhythmic therapy. The weight of evidence shows no survival benefit from suppressing asymptomatic NSVT in heart failure or chronic coronary disease, so the focus must be on treating the underlying disease, optimizing guideline-directed medical therapy, and assessing for primary prevention ICD candidacy when indicated [^116KQ4rD] [^113TAfN5] [^114Uo5FE].

> Now, I need to check high-risk ischemic heart disease contexts. In patients with prior myocardial infarction, reduced ejection fraction, and NSVT, I should consider electrophysiology study for risk stratification; if sustained monomorphic VT is inducible, an ICD is indicated to reduce mortality. Hold on, I should verify timing — early post-MI (within 40 days) is generally too early for ICD implantation, and EPS-guided decisions in that window are uncertain, so deferring ICD until at least 40 days post-MI and after reassessing EF is prudent unless special early-post-MI EPS criteria are met [^112urqr4] [^114Uo5FE] [^114kpYEj].

> Let me consider nonischemic cardiomyopathy next. In NICM with persistent LVEF 35% or less despite GDMT, an ICD is recommended for primary prevention; NSVT alone does not mandate treatment, but it can contribute to risk models and may prompt closer follow-up. I should double-check genotype-specific guidance — LMNA cardiomyopathy with additional risk factors, including NSVT, supports a lower threshold for ICD, which can shift management toward earlier device therapy in select patients [^113dFR5B] [^115MxDum] [^115fAsvu].

> I will now examine hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where NSVT carries prognostic weight. Fast, longer, and repetitive NSVT episodes predict appropriate ICD shocks, and polymorphic morphology or multiple morphologies further heighten risk. Therefore, NSVT in HCM is one of the few settings where the arrhythmia itself meaningfully informs sudden death risk and may influence ICD decisions beyond EF alone [^112WsRzs] [^1131Tv9x].

> For arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, NSVT is an accepted risk marker, particularly when frequent or coupled with other adverse features. While EPS yield is uncertain for primary prevention decisions, ambulatory monitoring to quantify burden and morphology, alongside CMR for fibrofatty replacement, is reasonable to refine risk and timing of ICD implantation in accordance with contemporary risk calculators [^112b1f59] [^113yUKgv] [^11573YkS] [^112EWPWR].

> But wait, what about special populations? In athletes, exercise-suppressed NSVT is generally considered benign, whereas NSVT provoked during exertion or recovery warrants evaluation; I need to ensure we distinguish physiologic from pathologic responses. In children and adolescents with asymptomatic NSVT and normal ventricular function, ablation is not indicated, reinforcing a conservative approach. In the early post–cardiac surgery period, NSVT — especially within 10 days of CABG — portends better outcomes than non-postoperative NSVT, so I should avoid extrapolating standard post-MI risk paradigms to this setting [^111HdHbU] [^114jz7wb] [^111BRoE9].

> Next, I should review diagnostic workup when NSVT is detected. Let me first confirm that a structured evaluation includes history, family history, 12-lead ECG, ambulatory monitoring, echocardiography, and selective stress testing. Second-line testing with CMR, coronary angiography, and EPS is reserved for intermediate or high-risk features such as reduced EF, syncope, or concerning morphology. I need to ensure reversible causes like ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, medication effects, and sleep apnea are addressed before labeling NSVT as idiopathic [^11573YkS] [^116RuoUu].

> I should confirm that pharmacologic suppression is generally avoided for asymptomatic NSVT except when treating the underlying substrate. Beta-blockers are first-line for symptom control in appropriate contexts, but class IC drugs are contraindicated post-MI, and sotalol should be avoided for asymptomatic ectopy due to torsades risk; amiodarone may be considered for symptomatic NSVT when necessary, acknowledging its toxicity profile and lack of mortality benefit in asymptomatic populations [^113TAfN5] [^116PtshP] [^113aZGb9] [^115zzn5V].

> Hold on, I should verify device and ablation indications. ICD therapy is the cornerstone for primary prevention when EF and clinical context meet guideline thresholds, with EP testing guiding decisions in select ischemic patients. Catheter ablation is not indicated for asymptomatic NSVT in the absence of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy or refractory symptoms, and even then, careful selection is essential [^114Uo5FE] [^115zzn5V].

> Finally, I will synthesize the decision pathway. No treatment for asymptomatic NSVT in patients without structural heart disease. Treat the underlying disease and optimize GDMT in those with structural heart disease. Escalate to risk stratification with EP study in post-MI patients with EF 35–40% and NSVT. Proceed to ICD when primary prevention criteria are met, particularly in ischemic cardiomyopathy with inducible VT, NICM with EF 35% or less despite GDMT, HCM with high-risk NSVT features, or ARVC with adverse phenotype. I need to ensure that any deviation from this framework is justified by exceptional risk markers or evolving evidence, and that shared decision-making addresses uncertain benefit in borderline cases [^113TAfN5] [^112urqr4] [^113dFR5B] [^112b1f59].

Asymptomatic NSVT **does not require treatment** in the absence of structural heart disease or symptoms [^113TAfN5]; **manage the underlying condition** and avoid antiarrhythmic drugs. Treat only if **symptomatic, frequent, or associated with structural heart disease** — especially ischemic cardiomyopathy or HCM — using beta-blockers or amiodarone, and consider ICD when EF ≤ 35% or inducible sustained VT is present [^113TAfN5] [^116XHrKn]. In acute MI, NSVT within 48 hours needs no specific therapy [^114czEkZ]; beyond 48 hours, optimize medical therapy and evaluate for ICD if EF remains low [^111gcFzH]. Routine suppression of asymptomatic NSVT is not indicated and may cause harm [^116KQ4rD] [^116PtshP].

---

## General principles of management

- **Evaluate underlying heart disease**: The presence and severity of structural heart disease determine risk and management [^114yuv9t].

- **Asymptomatic NSVT without structural heart disease**: Generally benign; observation and reassurance are appropriate [^114yuv9t].

- **Asymptomatic NSVT with structural heart disease**: Indicates higher risk; further evaluation and risk stratification are warranted [^114yuv9t].

- **Avoid routine antiarrhythmic therapy**: Suppression of asymptomatic NSVT does not improve survival and may cause harm [^113TAfN5] [^116KQ4rD].

## Specific clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|
| Structural heart disease absent | - Observation <br/> - Reassurance <br/> - No antiarrhythmic therapy [^113TAfN5] [^114yuv9t] |
| Structural heart disease present (e.g. ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy) | - Evaluate LVEF <br/> - Optimize medical therapy (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins) [^111gcFzH] <br/> - Consider ICD if EF ≤ 35% or inducible sustained VT on EPS [^113dFR5B] [^114Uo5FE] |
| Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) | - NSVT is a risk marker for SCD [^112WsRzs] <br/> - Consider ICD based on overall risk profile [^notfound] |
| Acute myocardial infarction (within 48 hours) | - NSVT is common and usually benign [^114czEkZ] <br/> - No specific antiarrhythmic therapy required [^114czEkZ] |
| Acute myocardial infarction (beyond 48 hours) | - Optimize medical therapy [^111gcFzH] <br/> - Evaluate for ICD if EF remains low or inducible VT on EPS [^114Uo5FE] |
| Symptomatic NSVT (palpitations, dizziness, syncope) | - Beta-blockers first-line [^113TAfN5] <br/> - Amiodarone if symptoms persist [^115zzn5V] <br/> - Consider catheter ablation in selected cases [^115zzn5V] |

## Role of electrophysiological study (EPS)

EPS is **reasonable for risk stratification** in patients with prior MI, NSVT, and LVEF ≤ 40% [^112urqr4]. Inducible sustained VT identifies high risk and supports consideration of ICD therapy [^117NfkWR] [^112EsyHZ].

---

## Conclusion and practical approach

- **No structural heart disease**: Observe, reassure, no treatment [^114yuv9t].

- **Structural heart disease present**: Evaluate LVEF, optimize medical therapy, consider ICD if EF ≤ 35% or inducible sustained VT on EPS [^113dFR5B] [^114Uo5FE].

- **Symptomatic NSVT**: Beta-blockers first-line; amiodarone if symptoms persist; consider ablation in selected cases [^113TAfN5].

- **Avoid routine suppression**: Antiarrhythmic therapy for asymptomatic NSVT is not indicated and may be harmful [^116KQ4rD] [^116PtshP].

---

Asymptomatic NSVT is common and usually benign; **treat only when symptomatic, frequent, or associated with structural heart disease**, focusing on the underlying condition and reserving antiarrhythmics or ICDs for selected high-risk patients.

### Clinical impact of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia recorded by the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^117Fgauj]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is a risk factor for sudden death (SD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) enable accurate assessment of NSVT burden and characteristics. In a cohort of HCM patients with ICD, we characterized Holter- and ICD-retrieved NSVT and evaluated their relationship with prognosis.

Methods and Results

We studied a cohort of consecutive HCM patients who underwent Holter ECG before receiving a primary prevention ICD. Patients were followed from ICD implantation to the first appropriate ICD therapy. We evaluated the association of NSVT characteristics with ICD interventions. Study cohort included 51 HCM patients (28 males, mean age: 48 ± 15 years). Thirty-four patients (66%) had NSVT at pre-ICD Holter ECG. Out of 17 patients with negative baseline Holter, 7 (41%) showed ICD-NSVT. In patients with both Holter- and ICD-NSVT, these latter were faster (199 ± 27 bpm vs. 146 ± 24 bpm; P < 0.001) and longer (16 ± 8 beats vs. 10 ± 11 beats; P = 0.008) than Holter-NSVT. During follow-up (38 ± 24 months), 11 patients (22%) experienced appropriate ICD therapy. NSVT length in beats (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00–1.10; P = 0.02) but not heart rate (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.98–1.02; P = 0.86) predicted ICD intervention. A simple index of NSVT severity (heart rate × length in beats/100 > 28) predicted ICD intervention (HR: 5.45; 95% CI: 1.10–27.32; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Long-lasting and rapid NSVT recorded during continuous rhythm monitoring predict appropriate ICD intervention in high-risk HCM patients. Further studies should assess whether prolonged rhythm monitoring may assist in evaluating patients at intermediate risk of SD, in which the decision to implant an ICD needs to be individualized.

Table 9 — NSVT in acute and prior myocardial infarction (MI) — states that Acute STEMI < 48 h has "Not increased" risk with prognostic evaluation for "Coronary artery disease" and treatment comprising "Optimal medical therapy including beta-blocker" and "Revascularization". For Acute STEMI > 48 h the risk is "Increased risk" with "Waiting for 6 weeks post-MI" and "Optimal medical therapy (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist)". After previous MI, LVEF 36–40% is "Increased risk" with "EPS" (electrophysiology study) and treatment "ACEI, beta-blocker ± ICD depending on EPS", whereas LVEF ≤ 35% is "Increased risk" with "Careful evaluation of LVEF" and treatment listing "ACE, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ICD".

### Prognostic significance of incidental nonsustained ventricular tachycardia detected on pacemaker interrogation [^115w5DSe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia is a life threatening arrhythmia requiring prompt treatment. However, the risk associated with asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) detected on routine permanent pacemaker (PPM) interrogation in patients with known cardiac conduction disease is unknown. Our aim is to determine if asymptomatic NSVT detected on PPM interrogation is associated with increased mortality. As part of a prospective observational cohort study, 582 patients with long-term pacemakers were recruited at a tertiary cardiac centre, and followed for 4 ± 1.96 years (mean ± standard deviation). At each subsequent pacemaker check, any symptoms and ventricular high-rate episodes were recorded. We excluded 17 patients due to incomplete data. In the remaining 565 patients (57% male, age 74.5 ± 19.2 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 50.0 ± 11.3%), NSVT was found in 125 (22.1%) patients with a higher prevalence in males (65% vs 54%; p = 0.033). Those with NSVT were more likely to have had coronary artery disease (p = 0) or previous myocardial infarction (p = 0.015). After correction for baseline variables, NSVT had no impact on survival (n = 52 [42%] vs n = 162 [37%]; log-rank p = 0.331, hazard ratio: 0.927, 95% confidence interval: 0.678 to 1.268, p = 0.697). In conclusion, asymptomatic NSVT identified on PPM interrogation does not appear to be associated with increased mortality, thus whether treatment to suppress this arrhythmia is of benefit remains unproven.

### Do statins influence the prognostic impact of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia after ST-elevation myocardial infarction? [^114x8CBc]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

The study evaluates the effect of statin therapy on the prognostic impact of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) occurring after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Methods and Results

From the German Acute Coronary Syndrome Registry (ACOS), 3137 patients with STEMI and in-hospital Holter monitoring were analysed. Three hundred and forty-six (11.0%) patients had NSVT. When compared with patients with no documented NSVT, patients with NSVT were older, more often had myocardial infarction in their history, diabetes mellitus, and an ejection fraction < 40%. Regarding frequency of drug application, medication at discharge did not (beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, amiodarone) or only slightly (acetylsalicylic acid, statins, and sotalol) differ between both groups. Multivariable analysis of 1 year mortality, adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, reperfusion therapy, ejection fraction < 40%, and beta-blocker therapy showed the following results: In patients without statin treatment and no NSVT, 1 year mortality after STEMI was 9.2%, but increased to 25.0% [odds ratio (OR) 3.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47–6.20], if NSVT were present. In patients on statin treatment and no NSVT, 1 year mortality was only 3.2%, and in the presence of NSVT 1 year mortality was not significantly increased anymore (5.3%; OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.55–1.92).

Conclusion

After STEMI, only in patients not on statin treatment, the occurrence of NSVT is associated with a significant and marked increase in 1 year mortality.

Electrophysiological testing in coronary heart disease — Class I recommendations are as follows: EP testing is recommended for diagnostic evaluation of patients with remote MI with symptoms suggestive of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including palpitations, presyncope, and syncope (Level of Evidence: B). EP testing is recommended in patients with CHD to guide and assess the efficacy of VT ablation (Level of Evidence: B). EP testing is useful in patients with CHD for the diagnostic evaluation of wide-QRS-complex tachycardias of unclear mechanism (Level of Evidence: C). Class IIa: EP testing is reasonable for risk stratification in patients with remote MI, NSVT, and LVEF equal to or less than 40% (Level of Evidence: B).

Electrophysiological testing outcomes and inducibility — In a MADIT II substudy, inducibility was 36%. In patients with CHD, asymptomatic NSVT, and an EF less than 40%, inducibility of sustained VT ranges between 20% and 40%. Survival was worse for in-hospital compared with out-of-hospital NSVT. Lower heart rate, lower EF, and a longer interval between MI and an EP study correlates with higher inducibility. Inducibility conferred a worse prognosis, and these patients had a high rate of percutaneous revascularization.

Systematic review quality — relevance and bias assessments indicate intermediate-to-high relevance but concerns about representativeness and blinding. All studies showed intermediate-to-high relevance regarding study population, testing, intervention, and outcomes. The enrolled population's representativeness of clinical practice was questionable in 5 studies. The randomized controlled trial had low risk of bias with independent blind assessment of outcomes, whereas all other studies had intermediate overall risk of bias because blind assessment of outcomes was not implemented.

### HRS / ACC / AHA expert consensus statement on the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in patients who are not included or not well represented in clinical trials [^115vFvXF]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Patient Population #17 — patients < 9 months from the initial diagnosis of nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) who present with syncope likely due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia: In patients < 9 months from the initial diagnosis of NICM with syncope that is thought to be due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia (by clinical history or documented NSVT), implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) can be useful. In a single-center study of 491 patients with advanced heart failure due to coronary artery disease (48%) and NICM (51%), 60 patients (12%) had syncope, and during a mean follow-up of 1 year, the incidence of sudden death was higher in the syncope group compared with those without syncope (syncope: 45% vs no syncope: 12%; P < .00001). In another single-center study that compared 108 patients with syncope in the setting of NICM with 71 patients who had NICM and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, no differences in overall survival or risk of ventricular arrhythmias could be identified, and the risk of developing ventricular tachyarrhythmias was 26%–41%; traditional methods for risk stratification are generally less useful in patients with NICM.

In patients with early repolarization pattern on ECG and cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmia, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected. In patients with early repolarization pattern on ECG, genetic testing is not recommended.

### Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: what's new? [^115ktvuH]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias can present as asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptomatic presentation of the former arrhythmias, or sustained VT with minimal symptoms to full hemodynamic collapse. The most important and feared consequence of VT is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Independent of SCD risk, frequent ventricular arrhythmias can cause substantial symptoms. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the foundation of managing patients at high risk for SCD due to their ability to automatically identify and defibrillate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, defibrillation is associated with significant physical and emotional adverse effects. Other treatment options include antiarrhythmic drugs, which have substantial toxicities and limited efficacy, and catheter ablation. The techniques and strategies for VT ablation have advanced considerably in recent years leading to a rapid expansion of indications and use. In this review, we discuss current state of the art therapies for ventricular arrhythmias and highlight some of the most promising areas of ongoing development.

### Treatment of persistent ventricular tachycardia: drugs or ablation? [^111jPUVm]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) reduce the mortality risk associated with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and can frequently terminate VT episodes painlessly, but do not prevent recurrent episodes. For patients with symptomatic recurrences, frequent asymptomatic recurrences, ICD shocks, or VT storm, most clinicians recommend strategies to suppress VT. The proarrhythmic mortality risk of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) may be mitigated by the presence of an ICD, but these medications are limited by high recurrence rates, and unfavorable side effect profiles. Catheter ablation is an alternative or adjunctive option, but is also limited by incomplete efficacy and procedural risk.

### Prognosis after finding incidental ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory electrocardiogram-recording [^115ob9aw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The prognostic significance of incidental non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in subjects without apparent heart disease is unknown. We aimed to evaluate short- and long-term prognosis of NSVT in the Copenhagen Holter Study cohort. From the study, 678 middle-aged and elderly subjects had minimum 48 hours of Holter-recording, laboratory testing and physician-based examination and questionnaire performed. Median follow-up time was 14.7 years. NSVT was defined as runs of minimum three premature ventricular complexes. The primary end-point was a combination of cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or stroke. Secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and components of the primary end-point. We found that 72 (10.6%) had minimum one NSVT event on 48-hour Holter-recording. The primary end-point occurred more frequently in patients with NSVT than those without: 38.3 versus 17.7 events per 1,000 patient-years, hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.20 after adjustment for risk factors. Secondary end-points also occurred more frequently in the NSVT-group. A shorter-term follow-up revealed similar event rates for the primary outcome; 47.5 versus 21.2 events per 1,000 patient-years, hazard ratio 1.9, 95% CI 0.69 to 5.24. Besides stroke other secondary end-points occurred more frequently in the short-term follow-up. The prognosis in subjects with NSVT was not dependent of the length of the VT. In conclusion, incidental asymptomatic NSVT on Holter-recording in subjects without apparent or manifest structural heart disease is associated with increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events, however the increased risk is not imminent but with a slow and steady pace over time.

Electrophysiology testing when ventricular tachycardia is suspected — Syncope with structural heart disease, particularly significant LV dysfunction, is ominous, and NSVT on Holter monitoring, syncope, and structural heart disease are highly sensitive for predicting inducible VT. Syncope with heart disease and reduced EF has high recurrence and death rates even when EP results are negative. EP testing is useful after prior MI with LV dysfunction (EF less than 40%) but is not sensitive in nonischemic cardiomyopathy; induction of polymorphic VT or VF, especially with aggressive stimulation, is not specific. In CHD the diagnostic yield may reach 50%, in HCM EP testing is not diagnostic in most patients, and nonspecific VTs have been induced in 23% of patients with slightly reduced EF.

### What is the diagnostic utility of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in unselected patients with premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia? [^115Q4p1Y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) are common arrhythmias that may signal underlying structural heart disease (SHD). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as a valuable tool for detecting myocardial abnormalities in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of CMR in patients with PVCs/NSVT and identify clinical predictors of pathologic late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent CMR for PVCs or NSVT between 2012 and 2023 at a single health system. The primary outcome was the presence of pathologic LGE. Clinical data were extracted using ICD-10 codes, and cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) was adjudicated by a multidisciplinary team using WASOG criteria.

Results

Among 553 patients (mean age 61.1 ± 14.6 years; 40.7% female), pathologic LGE was identified in 214 (38.6%). Patients with LGE were older and had a greater burden of comorbidities. On multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for LGE included age (aOR 1.04, p = 0.001), male sex (aOR 2.37, p < 0.001), heart failure (aOR 2.53, p < 0.001), and polymorphic PVCs (aOR 1.94, p = 0.015). Among patients with LGE, 12.6% had highly probable CS. Other diagnoses included non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (53.7%), ischemic cardiomyopathy (11.7%), and idiopathic (34.6%).

Conclusion

CMR frequently detects clinically significant myocardial abnormalities in patients with PVCs or NSVT, particularly in those with high-risk features. In this real-world study, nearly 40% of patients had LGE on CMR. An etiology was identified in one-third of these cases. These findings can inform patient selection for CMR in clinical practice to guide diagnosis, risk stratification, and management.

### Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [^111HdHbU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) has been recorded in a wide range of conditions, from apparently healthy individuals to patients with significant heart disease. In the absence of heart disease, the prognostic significance of NSVT is debatable. When detected during exercise, and especially at recovery, NSVT indicates increased cardiovascular mortality within the next decades. In trained athletes, NSVT is considered benign when suppressed by exercise. In patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, NSVT occurring beyond 48 h after admission indicates an increased risk of cardiac and sudden death, especially when associated with myocardial ischemia. In acute myocardial infarction, in-hospital NSVT has an adverse prognostic significance when detected beyond the first 13 to 24 h. In patients with prior myocardial infarction treated with reperfusion and beta-blockers, NSVT is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality when other covariates such as left ventricular ejection fraction are taken into account. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and most probably genetic channelopathies, NSVT carries prognostic significance, whereas its independent prognostic ability in ischemic heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy has not been established. The management of patients with NSVT is aimed at treating the underlying heart disease.

### Ventricular ectopy in patients with left ventricular dysfunction: should it be treated? [^1114hHrp]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) are commonly encountered in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Frequent ventricular ectopy can be associated with deterioration of cardiac function and may lead to VPC-induced cardiomyopathy. VPC-induced inter- and/or intraventricular dyssynchrony has been postulated as the main mechanism underlying VPC-induced left ventricular dysfunction. For risk stratification, VPCs in the setting of CHF can not be regarded to be a benign arrhythmia as in an apparently healthy subject. However, any potential survival benefits to be derived from suppression of VPCs or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in CHF may be offset by the negative inotropic and proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs and may be masked by the risk of death that is already high in this subgroup of patients. β-Blockers are currently considered to be the first-line therapy, with amiodarone as a back-up. Catheter ablation, although invasive and not without procedural risk, avoids the common adverse effects of currently available antiarrhythmic medications. From a standpoint of preventing or reversing left ventricular dysfunction, frequent VPCs should be treated earlier regardless of their site of origin or the presence of associated symptoms, such as palpitations. Catheter ablation may be the preferable approach in selected patients, particularly when β-blocker therapy has been ineffective or not tolerated.

### The impact of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on reverse remodeling, heart failure, and treated ventricular tachyarrhythmias in MADIT-CRT [^114Lr7V1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study determined whether the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) was predictive of clinical events in MADIT-CRT (multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial-cardiac resynchronization therapy) patients treated with CRT-defibrillator.

Methods and Results

We analyzed 24-hour Holters for the presence of NSVT. Patients were then stratified by the etiology (ischemic or nonischemic) of cardiomyopathy. The impact of NSVT on heart failure events (HF), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy for rapid ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF), and reverse remodeling was determined. At least a single episode of NSVT was recorded in 483 (49%) patients. These patients had a higher burden of premature ventricular contractions, lower percentage of biventricular (BiV) pacing, and significantly less reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. The risk of HF was significantly greater in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and NSVT (hazard ratio [HR] 2.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49–5.61; P = 0.002). The risk of rapid VT/VF was significantly greater (in both ischemic and nonischemic patients) when NSVT was observed (HR 2.06; 95% CI: 1.30–3.26; P = 0.002 in ischemic patients; HR 3.09; 95% CI: 1.80–5.28; P < 0.001 in nonischemic patients).

Conclusions

MADIT-CRT patients with NSVT had a high burden of ventricular ectopy, lower percentage of BiV pacing, and less reverse remodeling. These patients had an increase in HF (in nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients) and rapid VT/VF ICD therapies (in ischemic and nonischemic patients). These findings may have implications for the management of nonsustained ventricular ectopy in CRT patients.

Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during acute coronary syndromes — timing and risk are characterized: Life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurring during the first 24 to 48 h of myocardial infarction (MI) do not imply continuing risk over time, although follow-up after in-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) has been reported to carry an adverse prognosis over the ensuing 6 mo and later in-hospital VF has been associated with long-term risk. Patients presenting with non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are at increased long-term risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and the clinician's ability to recognize individuals with reversible or transient causes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias is limited.

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^111ZL46n]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic PVCs and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, flecainide therapy was found to be associated with a 5.1% rate of death and non-fatal cardiac arrest, compared with a 2.3% rate in a matched placebo group. (See WARNINGS .)

Adverse effects reported for flecainide, described in detail in the WARNINGS section, were new or worsened arrhythmias which occurred in 1% of 108 patients with PSVT and in 7% of 117 patients with PAF; and new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias which occurred in 7% of 1330 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained VT, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. 198 patients with sustained VT experienced a 13% incidence of new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In some patients, flecainide treatment has been associated with episodes of unresuscitatable VT or ventricular fibrillation (cardiac arrest). (See WARNINGS .) New or worsened CHF occurred in 6.3% of 1046 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. Of 297 patients with sustained VT, 9.1% experienced new or worsened CHF. New or worsened CHF was reported in 0.4% of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. There have also been instances of second- (0.5%) or third-degree (0.4%) AV block. Patients have developed sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest, about 1.2% altogether (see WARNINGS). The frequency of most of these serious adverse events probably increases with higher trough plasma levels, especially when these trough levels exceed 1 mcg/mL.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 ventricular arrhythmias — management of asymptomatic presentations states that ventricular arrhythmias may be detected incidentally on ECG or exam or during evaluation of prognosis; in general, treatment is indicated to prevent potential morbidity, reduce symptom burden, or reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, and there is no reason to treat asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of such potential benefit; risk of sudden cardiac death relates more to the type and severity of associated cardiac disease than to arrhythmia frequency or classification; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in a patient with previous myocardial infarction and impaired left ventricular function indicates increased risk of sudden cardiac death and the need for further evaluation or treatment; for other cardiac diseases such as dilated cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the contribution of asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias to management is not well established.

### Premature ventricular complexes and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in older women [^116Bsz3m]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While ventricular ectopy is common across broad populations and becomes even more prevalent with age, this topic has been largely understudied, particularly among women. Recent data have revealed that the prevalence of frequent ventricular ectopy among older women is higher than expected. Furthermore, older women are more likely to experience symptomatic arrhythmias and palpitations resulting in cardiac monitoring and the detection of ectopy. Incidental ventricular ectopy, namely premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), is being identified more frequently across both sexes due to recent expansion of cardiac monitoring, often for atrial fibrillation screening. Definitions and clinically relevant thresholds of frequent ventricular ectopy vary widely across clinical studies and society guidelines. As a result, the diagnosis and management of frequent ventricular ectopy is challenging. Given the consequences of frequent PVCs and NSVT, namely incident cardiomyopathy and associated morbidity and mortality, further characterization of these entities and consensus on diagnostics and therapeutics is needed to guide providers in caring for an aging population. This review seeks to synthesize the literature on the prevalence and clinical significance of ventricular ectopy, while also proposing novel, evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithms. A special focus will be placed on postmenopausal women in an effort to tackle existing sex disparities and highlight unique insights relevant to the clinical care of this understudied population.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and non‑sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) — risk thresholds and management are outlined as follows: Patients with extremely frequent VPBs (> 10% of the total beats during 24 h) are more likely to develop left ventricular dysfunction, and a burden of > 24% or > 20 000 VPBs during 24 h shows a strong association with cardiomyopathy, although cardiomyopathy has been reported at 4% and some with > 20% show no impairment. Beta‑blockers and amiodarone are indicated for VPBs when left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present. The same principles apply to NSVT; NSVT may respond to beta‑blockers or calcium antagonists, and if AAD therapy is required the choice is limited to amiodarone and (less preferable) sotalol. Consensus statements add that ablation of very frequent VPBs or NSVT is recommended as first‑line therapy when arrhythmia‑induced cardiomyopathy is present or suspected; beta‑blockers and non‑dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers might be used in symptomatic VPBs; in the absence of structural heart disease, Class IC AAD (propafenone and flecainide) and Class IA agent disopyramide may be used in symptomatic high‑burden VPBs but ablation is the first‑line recommended therapy; and antiarrhythmic drugs should not be used to treat asymptomatic VPBs in the absence of arrhythmia‑induced cardiomyopathy.

### Prognostic implications of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in high-risk patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112WsRzs]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic significance of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is incompletely resolved.

Methods and Results

The study group comprised 160 patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), of whom 94 patients had 24- to 48-hour ambulatory monitoring preimplant. ICDs were interrogated and ambulatory ECGs monitored for NSVT episodes, with associations between NSVT- and ICD-treated ventricular arrhythmias examined. Eighty-six (54%) patients had runs of NSVT, including 17 before implant on ambulatory monitoring, 44 after ICD implantation, and 22 on both. Agreement between preimplant ambulatory monitoring and ICD interrogation for detecting NSVT was poor (κ = 0.18). Eighteen of 86 patients (21%) with NSVT and 6 of 74 patients (8%) without NSVT experienced ICD-treated ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF). NSVT was significantly associated with ICD-treated VT/VF (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–11.29; P = 0.0093). ICD-treated VT/VF was associated with NSVT runs at a rate > 200 beats per minute (adjusted hazard ratio, 15.63; 95% confidence interval, 4.01–60.89; P < 0.0001) and > 7 beats (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.26; 95% confidence interval, 2.02–19.41; P = 0.0015). Repetitive runs of NSVT were also associated with ICD-treated VT/VF (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.22; 95% confidence interval, 2.53–33.60; P = 0.0008). Slower (≤ 200 beats per minute), shorter (≤ 7), or a single run of NSVT were not associated with ICD-treated ventricular arrhythmias.

Conclusions

On extended monitoring, NSVT was independently associated with ICD-treated ventricular arrhythmias, supporting the importance of NSVT in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy risk stratification. Faster rate (> 200 beats per minutes), longer (> 7 beats), and repetitive runs of NSVT were more highly predictive of ICD-treated VT/VF.

Ventricular arrhythmias

Ventricular arrhythmias, especially asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, are commonly detected in ATTR-CA. Sudden cardiac death in ATTR-CA is thought to be uncommon, especially compared with AL-CA, but prospective studies are lacking. Although a number of studies (including both AL- and ATTR-CA) have shown appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use in CA patients, none have shown greater survival compared with CA patients without ICDs. The incidence of appropriate ICD use varied from 6% to 32%, although the duration of follow-up and composition of the cohort in each study was heterogeneous. Overall, the utility of primary-prevention ICDs in ATTR-CA remains controversial. The 2015 European Society of Cardiology guidelines state that there are insufficient data to provide recommendations for the use of ICDs for primary prevention in CA. The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines recommend individualized decision making for both primary and secondary prevention with ICDs in CA. Despite incremental data on ICDs in CA since publication of these guidelines, the benefit of ICDs in ATTR-CA remains unclear.

Post–myocardial infarction (MI) or revascularization — electrophysiology (EP) testing and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) appropriateness are detailed as follows: Early post-MI scenarios within "post-MI (≤ 40 days)" have limited trial data, and MUSTT enrolled patients with "CAD, LVEF ≤ 40%, and asymptomatic, nonsustained VT", with the qualifying arrhythmia occurring "within 6 months before enrollment and ≥ 4 days after the most recent MI or revascularization procedure". EP-guided therapy with ICDs "reduced the risk of sudden death; however, most (> 80%) of randomized patients had their most recent MI > 1 month before enrollment", so "the utility of EP testing in that time period is uncertain". Nonetheless, "ICD implantation is considered Appropriate if in patients early post-MI (≤ 40 days) in the setting of asymptomatic NSVT occurring ≥ 4 days post-MI if sustained VT is inducible by EP study in patients with LVEF ≤ 40%". Regarding revascularization, "the MADIT II trial required a waiting period of ≥ 3 months following coronary revascularization", whereas "patients were eligible for enrollment in the MUSTT trial ≥ 4 days following revascularization, and 56% of patients enrolled in this trial underwent prior CABG at some point in time", and postoperative NSVT "especially within 10 days after CABG, portends a far better outcome than when it occurs in non-postoperative settings".

Randomized controlled trials of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy for primary prevention — In CABG-Patch, 900 patients with an ejection fraction (EF) < 0.36 undergoing bypass surgery were randomized to receive an ICD or not, and after an average follow-up of 32 months the hazard ratio (HR) for death from any cause was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81–1.42, P = 0.64); ICD implantation was associated with postoperative infections (ICD: 12.3% vs control: 5.9%; P < .05) and deep sternal wound infections (ICD: 2% vs 0.4%, P < .05). In MUSTT, patients with coronary artery disease, EF ≤ 0.40, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) ≥ 3 beats with inducible sustained VT were randomized to no antiarrhythmic therapy or electrophysiologic (EP)-guided therapy; after a median follow-up of 39 months, 5-year overall mortality was 42% vs 48% (relative risk: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64–1.01), and within the EP-guided group, 161 ICD recipients had an adjusted relative risk of mortality of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.27–0.59). In MADIT, 196 patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), EF ≤ 0.35, and inducible nonsuppressible ventricular arrhythmias randomized to ICD versus medical therapy had reduced mortality after 27 months (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.26–0.82; p = 0.009).

Valvular heart disease — risk of sudden arrhythmic death: Although the overall risk is small, sudden arrhythmic death appears to be more frequent in aortic stenosis than in other lesions, with approximately 0.4% per year for aortic stenosis and less than 0.2% per year for regurgitation and for mitral valve disease; most patients who die suddenly have been symptomatic from their valvular disease, and recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in severe aortic stenosis may place a patient at risk for syncope, with management guided by severity of the valvular lesion.

Patients with valvular heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias (VA) "are generally evaluated and treated using current recommendations for each disorder", and "The presence of a valve lesion alone does not constitute an indication for valve repair or replacement". For aortic stenosis, SCD risk is described as "a risk of 1% to 1.5% per year", and "Most patients who die suddenly have been symptomatic from their valve disease". Although recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) may increase syncope risk in severe aortic stenosis, "the management of such a patient is guided by the severity of the valvular lesion".

Ischemic heart disease — MUSTT and early post–myocardial infarction risk stratification and ICD effects — reports that patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) at electrophysiological study have a higher overall mortality rate than similar patients without inducible VT, and that patients who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) after failing to have inducible VT suppressed by an antiarrhythmic medication had lower mortality than those who did not receive an ICD; MUSTT required an LVEF of ≤ 40% with an average LVEF of 30%, allowed enrollment ≥ 4 days after an acute MI or revascularization, and in a single-center observational study performed a median of 9 days after acute MI in 115 patients with LVEF < 40%, median follow-up was 12 months, sustained VT was induced in 27% of patients, 22% of those who received ICDs had spontaneous VT terminated by the ICD during follow-up, and none of the patients without inducible VT had VT or sudden cardiac death during follow-up.

Asymptomatic pre-excitation — epidemiology and prior guideline context note that electrocardiographic pre-excitation affects about 0.1% to 0.3% of the general population, and patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death that may approach 4% over a lifetime. The 2003 ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines designated "no treatment" as a Class I recommendation and catheter ablation as a Class IIa recommendation in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation; the guideline writing committee stated that the positive predictive value of the EP study is too low to justify routine use in asymptomatic patients and that potential benefit must be balanced against the approximately 2% risk of a major complication associated with catheter ablation.

Implanted cardiac monitors — In patients with sporadic symptoms (including syncope) suspected to be related to ventricular arrhythmias (VA), implanted cardiac monitors can be useful (Class IIa, B-R). These devices provide continuous rhythm monitoring and stored electrograms based on patient activation or preset parameters, allowing a prolonged monitoring period of a few years, and require a minor invasive procedure with local anesthesia. They are generally reserved when other ambulatory monitoring is nonrevealing, with a 25% added yield in diagnosis after an unrevealing external ambulatory monitor; in a study of patients with syncope, the implantable monitor had a greater diagnostic yield than "conventional" testing. In a prospective study after myocardial infarction with LVEF < 40%, implantable monitoring demonstrated NSVT (> 16 beats long) in 13%, VT (> 30 s) in 3% and VF in 3% of patients. It is important to accurately correlate symptoms with arrhythmias detected by implanted cardiac monitors.

Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) — recommendations and evidence classes are as follows: COR I; LOE A: In patients with NICM, HF with NYHA class II–III symptoms and an LVEF of 35% or less, despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected. COR IIa; LOE B-NR: In patients with NICM due to a Lamin A/C mutation who have 2 or more risk factors (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [NSVT], LVEF < 45%, nonmissense mutation, and male sex), an ICD can be beneficial if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected. COR IIb; LOE B-R: In patients with NICM, HF with NYHA class I symptoms and an LVEF of 35% or less, despite GDMT, an ICD may be considered if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected. COR III: No Benefit; LOE C-EO: In patients with medication-refractory NYHA class IV HF who are not also candidates for cardiac transplantation, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) defibrillator that incorporates both pacing and defibrillation capabilities, an ICD should not be implanted.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy — electrophysiology study (EPS) yield and prognostic value: The value of an electrophysiological study is uncertain in asymptomatic patients with preserved ventricular function for predicting subsequent sudden cardiac death risk. Electrophysiology studies induce sustained VT in approximately 60% of patients, most of whom have prior spontaneous sustained VT. In patients with primary prevention ICDs, inducible sustained VT did not predict subsequent appropriate ICD shocks; in 1 study including symptomatic patients, those without inducible VT were less likely to receive appropriate ICD shocks. In asymptomatic patients without evidence of VA on ambulatory monitoring, a negative electrophysiology study may have limited value in decision-making for an ICD, and existing studies include most symptomatic patients, making recommendations on asymptomatic patients difficult.

Incidence of Ventricular Arrhythmia

A total of 23/106 (21.7%) athletes experienced at least 1 ventricular arrhythmic episode with 3/106 (2.8%) having VT and 20/106 (18.9%) having nonsustained VT (Figure 3). All 3 participants who experienced VT were symptomatic and developed an episode of nonsustained VT before the onset of VT. They all underwent clinical evaluation by their local Consultant Cardiologist. Of those, 1 athlete received an implantable cardiac defibrillator due to presyncope, 1 was scheduled for an electrophysiology study and the third was advised to cease competing due to recurrent VT during exercise but declined further investigation.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias — electrocardiographic classification specifies: Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) is "Three or more beats in duration, terminating spontaneously in less than 30 s", and VT is defined as "a cardiac arrhythmia of three or more consecutive complexes in duration emanating from the ventricles at a rate of greater than 100 bpm (cycle length less than 600 ms)". Nonsustained VT may be monomorphic ("Nonsustained VT with a single QRS morphology") or polymorphic ("Nonsustained VT with a changing QRS morphology at cycle length between 600 and 180 ms"). Sustained VT is "VT greater than 30 s in duration and/or requiring termination due to hemodynamic compromise in less than 30 s", with monomorphic ("Sustained VT with a stable single QRS morphology") and polymorphic ("Sustained VT with a changing or multiform QRS morphology at cycle length between 600 and 180 ms") forms. Additional entities include bundle-branch re-entrant tachycardia ("VT due to re-entry involving the His-Purkinje system, usually with LBBB morphology; this usually occurs in the setting of cardiomyopathy"), bidirectional VT ("VT with a beat-to-beat alternans in the QRS frontal plane axis, often associated with digitalis toxicity"), torsades de pointes (long QT/QTc with twisting QRS; "Typical", initiated following "short-long-short" coupling; short-coupled variant from normal-short coupling), and ventricular flutter described as a regular monomorphic ventricular arrhythmia with no isoelectric interval between successive QRS complexes.

### Differences in inducibility and prognosis of in-hospital versus out-of-hospital identified nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with coronary artery disease: clinical and trial design implications [^111iN4Mv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to describe the influence of the clinical setting (in-hospital vs. out-of-hospital) in which nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is discovered on the rate of inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), arrhythmic events and survival in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.

Background

In-hospital presentation of sustained VT is independently associated with lower long-term overall survival. The impact of the clinical setting in which NSVT is documented is unknown.

Methods

In the Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT), designed to assess the benefit of randomized antiarrhythmic therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing in patients with asymptomatic NSVT, CAD and LV dysfunction, eligible patients were enrolled irrespective of the setting in which the index arrhythmia was discovered. In this retrospective analysis, we compared the rate of VT inducibility and outcome of MUSTT-enrolled patients with in-hospital versus out-of-hospital presentation of NSVT.

Results

Monomorphic sustained VT was induced in 35% and 28% of the patients whose index NSVT occurred in-hospital and out-of-hospital, respectively (adjusted p = 0.006). Cardiac arrest or death due to arrhythmia at two- and five-year follow-ups were 14% and 28% for untreated patients with in-hospital-identified NSVT and 11% and 21% for the out-of-hospital group (adjusted p = 0.10). Overall mortality rates at two- and five-year follow-ups were 24% and 48% for inpatients and 18% and 38% for outpatients (adjusted p = 0.018). In patients randomized to antiarrhythmic therapy, there was no significant interaction between patient status (in-hospital vs. out-of-hospital) and treatment impact on the rates of total mortality (p = 0.98) and arrhythmic events (p = 0.08).

Conclusions

In patients with CAD and impaired LV function, asymptomatic NSVT identified in-hospital, compared with that identified out-of-hospital, is associated with a higher rate of induction of sustained VT and overall mortality. Therefore, in similar patients, the clinical setting in which NSVT is discovered should be taken into account when formulating patient risk, treatment and clinical trial design.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in chronic heart failure — prevalence, prognosis, and management — indicates NSVT can be documented on 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring in 30% to 80% of chronic HF patients with arrhythmic symptoms, the weight of evidence does not show a specific link between NSVT and sudden cardiac death (SCD) although one trial suggested a link, there is no evidence that suppression of NSVT has a favorable effect on prognosis in HF and thus asymptomatic NSVT should not be treated by antiarrhythmic medication; if NSVT causes symptoms that require therapy, amiodarone is probably the safest agent although in NYHA functional class III patients in the SCD-HeFT trial it was associated with possibly increased mortality, polymorphic VT with or without QT prolongation may occur during HF exacerbations and may resolve with treatment of HF, and SCD accounts for approximately 50% of deaths in patients with HF yet there is little evidence that empiric antiarrhythmic therapy can reduce the risk of SCD.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) — prevalence and prognostic significance in structurally normal hearts are described: PVCs on standard electrocardiograms (ECGs) were found in 0.8% of a healthy military population with a range of 0.5% among those under 20 y to 2.2% in those over 50 y; a 6-h monitor study in middle-aged men identified a 62% incidence of asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. In the Tecumseh community study, PVCs carried no adverse prognostic significance under the age of 30 y, but in those older than 30 y, PVCs and short runs of non–sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) began to influence risk. Exercise testing data are mixed: one study reported that PVCs and NSVT induced during exercise correlated with increased total mortality, while another found both exercise- and recovery-phase PVCs correlated with risk, with the greater burden associated with recovery-phase arrhythmias.

### Desmoplakin-specific ARVC risk scores: deep phenotyping to drive precision medicine [^112EWPWR]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ARVC risk calculator utilizes nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (3 or more beats for > 120 beats/min) for prediction of sustained ventricular tachycardia, but treating nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) as a binary variable likely blunts its effectiveness as a risk factor. Prior work in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy indicates that NSVT that are fast (> 200 beats/min), repetitive, and longer than 7 beats are more predictive of future appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock than slow, single, and short events. Deeper phenotyping of duration, rate, and characteristics of NSVT would likely improve risk stratification.

Use of spontaneous sustained VA > 100 beats/min and lasting longer than 30 seconds as an endpoint is not an SCD equivalent, as the authors caution. Indeed, the original report on the first iteration of the ARVC risk score received some scrutiny and criticism for its high estimates of VA risk using this definition of sustained VA. The investigators nimbly repeated their analysis (generating a second generation risk calculator) utilizing a higher-risk, "fast VA" endpoint (SCD, aborted SCD, ventricular fibrillation, or VT > 250 beats/min). It would have been interesting to see how this more rigorous definition of "fast VA" affects risk prediction of DSP patients in the present study. Future models should more deeply phenotype both the NSVT risk factor and the VA endpoint/outcome in developing genotype-specific risk calculators.

Finally, we address the issue of DSP-associated myocardial inflammation. Many ARVC variants, but particularly DSP have been associated with both chronic fluorodeoxyglucose-F18-avidity on positron emission tomographyas well as "hot phase" episodes of myocarditis-like injury heralding disease progression. Early reports of diffuse lymphocyte infiltration into ARVC myocardium in up to two-thirds of patients and the presence of autoantibodies against intercalating disk components and myosin in some patients suggest that inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Other work has identified a lack of correlation between fluorodeoxyglucose-F18-positron emission tomography scan positivity and endomyocardial biopsy results suggesting a component of myocardial metabolic derangement as well. Deep phenotyping to determine inflammatory and metabolic components of DSP cardiomyopathy may improve future risk prediction models and calculators.

After revascularization, MADIT II required a waiting period of ≥ 3 months, whereas MUSTT allowed enrollment ≥ 4 days post‑revascularization; 56% had prior CABG, and postoperative NSVT, especially within 10 days after CABG, portended a far better outcome than nonpostoperative NSVT.

### Prognostic significance of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia identified postoperatively after coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with left ventricular dysfunction [^111BRoE9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) occurs frequently in the postoperative period (≤ 30 days) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, a setting where many factors may play a role in its genesis. The prognosis of NSVT in this setting in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is unknown. This study was designed to assess its significance.

Methods and Results

We compared the outcome of untreated patients enrolled in the Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial with coronary artery disease (CAD), LV dysfunction, and NSVT identified postoperatively after CABG (n = 228; mean age 67 years, 84% males) versus nonpostoperative settings (n = 1,302; mean age 66 years, 85% males). Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced in 27% and 33% (P = 0.046) of patients with postoperative and nonpostoperative NSVT, respectively. The 2- and 5-year rates of arrhythmic events were 6% and 16%, respectively, in postoperative patients versus 15% and 29% in nonpostoperative patients (unadjusted P = 0.0020, adjusted P = 0.0082). The 2- and 5-year overall mortality rates were 15% and 36%, respectively, for postoperative patients versus 24% and 47% for nonpostoperative patients (unadjusted P = 0.0005, adjusted P = 0.027). Patients whose NSVT was identified early (< 10 days) versus late (10–30 days) after CABG had significantly lower 2- (13% vs 23%) and 5-year (30% vs 52%) mortality rates (unadjusted P = 0.024, adjusted P = 0.018).

Conclusion

In this population of patients with CAD and LV dysfunction, the occurrence of postoperative NSVT, especially within 10 days after CABG, portends a far better outcome than when it occurs in nonpostoperative settings. This suggests that in a such setting, NSVT represents a less specific risk factor for future events and should be considered when assigning risk and treatment of similar patients.

### Prognostic implications of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia morphology in high-risk patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1131Tv9x]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prognostic impact of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) morphology has never been explored in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In a single-center cohort of consecutive HCM patients implanted with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), we assessed NSVT morphology patterns and their prognostic implications.

Methods

A cohort of consecutive HCM patients implanted with an ICD was followed from ICD implantation to last follow-up visit. Patients were assessed for NSVT as stored events in ICD memory. Ventricular tachycardias (VTs) were classified as monomorphic (MM) or polymorphic according to intracardiac electrogram morphology.

Results

One hundred nine consecutive HCM patients (68 males; mean age: 45 ± 17years) composed the study population. During follow-up (71 ± 48months), 7 polymorphic NSVT in 4 patients and 370 MM NSVT in 42 patients were retrieved from ICD memory. Among patients with only MM NSVT, 19 (45%) had one morphology, 17 (41%) had two morphologies, 3 (7%) had three morphologies, and 3 (7%) had four morphologies. Patients with polymorphic NSVT had the highest risk of ICD interventions (HR, 5.04; 95% CI, 1.26–20.19; p = 0.02). A stepwise increase of the risk of ICD interventions in patients with two, three, and four NSVT morphologies was observed. Out of 16 patients with both NSVT and ICD-treated VTs, 13 (81%) had at least one ICD-treated VT with the same morphology of a previous long-lasting NSVT.

Conclusions

In high-risk HCM patients, the occurrence of polymorphic NSVT and of NSVT with multiple morphologies carries a high risk for ICD interventions. Sustained VTs tend to recur with the same morphology of previous long-lasting NSVTs.

### Risk stratification for arrhythmic events in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation: a systematic review for the 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^1164ZAV7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic pre-excitation — epidemiology and prior guideline positions note that electrocardiographic pre-excitation affects about 0.1% to 0.3% of the general population, and patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have a risk of sudden cardiac death that may approach 4% over a lifetime; in asymptomatic pre-excitation, the first arrhythmic event may lead to sudden cardiac death. The 2003 ACC/AHA/ESC guideline designated "no treatment" as a Class I recommendation and catheter ablation as a Class IIa recommendation in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation, citing that the positive predictive value of the electrophysiological study is too low to justify routine use in asymptomatic patients and that potential benefit must be balanced against the approximately 2% risk of a major complication associated with catheter ablation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Post–myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction — implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) indications and timing: ICD therapy is indicated to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients whose left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is less than or equal to 40% with spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) inducible by electrophysiology (EP) testing, and in patients whose LVEF is less than 30% after a myocardial infarction (MI) that occurred greater than or equal to 40 d earlier when heart failure (NYHA functional class II or III symptoms) is present. Evaluation of the need for an ICD and implantation should be deferred until at least 3 mo after revascularization procedures, and in general, ICD implantation should be deferred until at least 40 d after AMI because ICD therapy has not been demonstrated to improve survival when implanted within 40 d after MI.

### Detection of concealed structural heart disease by imaging in patients with apparently idiopathic premature ventricular complexes: a review of current literature [^115FvptH]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

When an accurate initial evaluation process detects high‐risk features, thus raising suspicion of concealed SHD, the use of advanced cardiovascular imaging techniques (eg, CMR, MSCT, PET) should be considered. The flow‐chart in Figure 3 offers an easy‐to‐consult graphic model to orientate the decision‐making process throughout a comprehensive diagnostic work‐up and management of patients presenting with frequent PVCs.

Figure 3
Proposed flow‐chart for the diagnostic work‐up and management of patients presenting with apparently idiopathic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). Careful evaluation of personal history, baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and PVC features should be always the first step in the diagnostic work‐up of patients with frequent PVCs (left panel); complementary diagnostics may be needed to rule out suspected causes of PVCs (eg, valvular or ischemic heart disease). When features suggestive of truly idiopathic PVCs are present (central panel, green triangle), no further investigations are mandatory. Conversely, when one or more high‐risk features (central panel, red triangle) are present, further investigations with advanced imaging techniques should be considered in order to detect possible underlying structural abnormalities deserving proper medical attention and specific treatment (right panel) CMP: cardiomyopathy; CT: computed tomography; FDG‐PET: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography; LBBB: left bundle branch block; LV: left ventricle; NSVT: non‐sustained ventricular tachycardia; RBBB: right bundle branch block; SCD: sudden cardiac death; SHD: structural heart disease; TT: transthoracic

### Application of the 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guidelines for risk stratification for sudden death in adult patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation [^112Ydt8v]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of the asymptomatic pre-excited patient largely hinges on risk stratification and individual patient considerations and choice. A high threshold to treat patients may lead to a small overall risk of death while a low threshold clearly leads to increased invasive testing and ablation with associated cost and procedural risk. A firm recommendation to uniformly assess all by electrophysiology study or, alternatively, reassure all is inappropriate and unjustified by data as reflected in the recent guideline recommendations. The use of noninvasive and invasive parameters to identify the potentially at-risk individual with surveillance for symptoms in those comfortable with this approach or ablation for those choosing this alternative for individual reasons remains the cornerstone of best practice.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia — nonsustained VT (NSVT) is defined as three or more consecutive ventricular beats at a rate of greater than 100 b.p.m., with a duration of less than 30 s; the prevalence of asymptomatic NSVT varies from 0.7% (healthy army population) to 10% (in a geriatric population) in patients without known heart disease, and it is common in ischaemic heart disease (30–80% of patients) during long-term ECG monitoring where it is usually asymptomatic. For documentation, a 12-lead ECG during the arrhythmia should be obtained whenever possible. Whereas NSVT may be asymptomatic, sustained VT is much more often symptomatic; slow VT, generally slower than 150 b.p.m., may however be asymptomatic, but when lasting for hours/days individuals with slow VT may, however, become symptomatic because of HF symptoms. Among ventricular arrhythmias, two distinct entities require specific mention: bidirectional VT, which may be asymptomatic particularly in Andersen–Tawil syndrome with classic causes including digitalis toxicity or channelopathies such as CPVT, and torsades de pointes VT, which is seen exclusively in the setting of prolonged QT interval whether acquired or congenital.

### Implantable loop recorders in patients with heart disease: comparison between patients with and without syncope [^1119uqnP]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinically relevant arrhythmic event rate of an ILR in patients with cardiac disease who have a history of syncope versus those with non-syncopal suspected arrhythmia-related symptoms. We found no difference in the yield of an ILR between groups, either defined as the rate of actionable events or the rate of device implantations. It should be mentioned that the majority of patients in our study population (82%) had a background of either a genetic or congenital heart disease. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the yield of an ILR in a large cohort of adults with structural or electrical heart disease.

Role of ILRs in high-risk patients

An ILR can be a useful diagnostic tool in selected symptomatic patients with structural or electrical heart disease who are at increased risk of SCD. Continuous arrhythmia monitoring can provide: (1) symptom-rhythm correlation; (2) detection of asymptomatic clinically relevant arrhythmias (eg, AF, NSVT) and (3) patient reassurance. For example, detection of asymptomatic NSVT can be relevant for risk stratification in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, the detection of subclinical AF may necessitate the use of oral anticoagulation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend an ILR for patients with inherited cardiomyopathies or channelopathies who present with recurrent episodes of unexplained syncope and who are at low risk of SCD (class IIa indication). Furthermore, an ILR is also recommended in patients with infrequent, suspected arrhythmia-related symptoms, if conventional methods fail to provide a symptom-rhythm correlation. However, data supporting these recommendations in the specific population of patients with structural or electrical heart disease are scarce. The current study provides an overview of the yield of an ILR in this specific population.

### Acute treatment of patients with supraventricular… [^111te4zr]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Guideline title: 2015 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society Guideline for the Management of Adult Patients With Supraventricular Tachycardia Developers: American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and Heart Rhythm Society Release dates: September 23, 2015; April 5, 2016. Prior version: October 14, 2003 Funding sources: American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and Heart Rhythm Society Target population: Adults with supraventricular tachycardia Major recommendations: This guideline offers recommendations for the management of SVT. Atrial fibrillation was not covered. This synopsis summarizes recommendations on the acute management of SVT. Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are recommended for the termination of regular SVT of uncertain type, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia.

Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for the termination of any hemodynamically unstable SVT. In the absence of hemodynamic compromise, SVT should be treated with synchronized cardioversion when pharmacologic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol is recommended for control of heat rate in patients with hemodynamically stable atrial flutter and for the treatment of hemodynamically stable focal atrial tachycardia. Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol can be useful in terminating hemodynamically stable regular SVT of uncertain type, multifocal atrial tachycardia., atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia in the absence of pre-excitation on the resting electrocardiogram. Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to mirror recommended anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation. Treatment of pre-excited atrial fibrillation with intravenous digoxin, intravenous amiodarone, intravenous or oral β-blockers, diltiazem, and verapamil is potentially harmful. Instead, intravenous ibutilide or procainamide is recommended for the treatment of hemodynamically stable pre-excited atrial fibrillation.

Supraventricular tachycardia is relatively common in adult Americans, with 89 000 newly diagnosed cases each year and a prevalence of 570 000 persons. 1 Supraventricular tachycardia accounts for approximately 50 000 emergency department visits each year. 1 The manifestations of SVT vary widely, from total lack of symptoms to debilitating symptoms with substantial effects on patient functional status and quality of life. Clinicians should be able to recognize SVT when they detect regular narrow complex tachycardia and should know how to treat patients with SVT. Key steps in the assessment and treatment of patients with SVT are determining whether a patient is hemodynamically stable and deciding whether any symptoms reported by the patient are indeed owing to the SVT. Another important step is to try to establish the mechanism of the tachycardia because this will help inform the best treatment course.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) after revascularization — time-dependent risk and benefit are described across observational and trial substudies: Postoperative nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) patients had higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and lower inducibility and event/mortality rates than nonpostoperative NSVT (LVEF 0.30 vs 0.28, P = 0.002; inducibility 27% vs 33%; arrhythmic events 6% vs 15% at 2 years and 16% vs 29% at 5 years; mortality 15% vs 24% at 2 years and 36% vs 47% at 5 years). Substudies report that an ICD has an increasing survival benefit as time from revascularization increases; in MADIT-II, benefit was seen only when enrollment occurred at least 6 months after revascularization, another MADIT-II substudy found a 6% increase in 8-year mortality and a 5% increase in appropriate ICD therapy for every year from revascularization, and in MADIT-CRT the rate of VT/VF or death was lower early (< 1.5 years) compared with later after revascularization.

Inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes — definitions of special terms used in the document are as follows: In this context, "the occurrence of "syncope" is an important indicator of arrhythmic risk", and within this document syncope "implies the exclusion of events that are likely due to vasovagal events such as those occurring during abrupt postural changes, exposure to heat and dehydration, emotional reactions to events such as blood drawing, etc". "Symptomatic individuals" are those who have experienced "ventricular arrhythmias (usually ventricular tachycardia or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation), or syncopal episodes", and "The presence of symptoms is, in some of the channelopathies, an independent predictor of cardiac arrest at follow-up". "Concealed mutation-positive patients" refers to individuals "without clinical symptoms or phenotype of a channelopathy who carry the genetic defect present in clinically affected members of the family". "Arrhythmic events" refers to "the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic sustained or nonsustained spontaneous ventricular tachycardia, or unexplained syncope/resuscitated cardiac arrest".

MUSTT and MADIT have clearly shown the survival benefit of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in patients with previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 0.40, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and who have had sustained VT induced at electrophysiology study. Progress in primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) depends on a concerted effort by clinicians to identify and appropriately treat MUSTT/MADIT-type patients; further research to more precisely define patient subgroups at risk for SCD and the willingness of industry to develop a lower priced ICD for prophylactic use are needed.

Early repolarization "J-wave" syndrome — management includes observation for asymptomatic electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for events when survival is meaningful, and avoidance of genetic testing. The guideline states, 'In asymptomatic patients with an early repolarization pattern on ECG, observation without treatment is recommended'. It also states, 'In patients with early repolarization pattern on ECG and cardiac arrest or sustained VA, an ICD is recommended if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected'. Additionally, 'In patients with early repolarization pattern on ECG, genetic testing is not recommended'.

Electrophysiological testing in cardiomyopathies and genetic arrhythmia syndromes — In dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), EP testing plays a minor role in the evaluation and management of VT and this is related to low inducibility, reproducibility of EP study, and the predictive value of induced VT. In long QT syndrome (LQTS), EP testing has not proved useful. In Brugada syndrome, the role of EP testing for risk stratification is debated and may remain undefined until prospective data are obtained with uniform protocols in large populations with adequate follow-up. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the value of EP testing has been controversial. In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), arrhythmic manifestations are variable, the prognostic role of EP testing in patients with isolated PVCs or NSVT is not known, the response may be influenced by disease severity, and progression of disease has to be considered. For outflow tract ventricular tachycardia (VT), EP testing is basically similar to other VT entities and is motivated by the need to establish precise diagnosis to guide curative catheter ablation.

Chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) — nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): Most NSVT in chronic CHD is brief and asymptomatic, and there is no evidence that suppression of asymptomatic NSVT prolongs life; thus there is no indication to treat NSVT unless frequent (incessant) or very rapid episodes compromise hemodynamic stability, in which case pharmacological antiarrhythmic therapy, catheter ablation, or surgical resection may be used. For symptomatic NSVT, initial pharmacological therapy should consist of beta adrenergic–blocking agents, and if unresponsive, amiodarone or sotalol would most appropriately be used.

Asymptomatic pre-excitation — key limitations of the systematic review include unavoidable selection bias and lack of quantitative synthesis due to the absence of data from randomized controlled trials or controlled prospective studies; potential publication and reporting biases with inconsistent outcome definitions; exclusion of studies that mixed asymptomatic and symptomatic patients without separate reporting; possible reduced generalizability from allowing studies that included children; and exclusion of a 1968 cohort of 128 healthy US Air Force men followed for 5 to 28 years, which reported 3 deaths with no known cardiac cause.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — arrhythmic risk markers and medical therapy signals: Frequent PVCs > 760 to 1000 per 24 hours during ambulatory rhythm monitoring correlate with arrhythmic risk, and the presence of NSVT or sustained VT is an important predictor of adverse cardiac events. The increased arrhythmia risk conferred by intense exercise is consistent with beta-adrenergic modulation of disease expression. An observational registry reported that treatment with atenolol or amiodarone was associated with less clinically relevant VA, while sotalol was associated with no effect or increased arrhythmia, and ambulatory monitoring to assess VA burden and adequacy of beta-blocker therapy is usually used.

Primary prevention of SCD in NICM: In NICM with heart failure (HF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–III symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less despite guideline‑directed medical therapy (GDMT), an ICD is recommended if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected (I, A). In NICM due to a lamin A/C mutation with 2 or more risk factors (NSVT, LVEF < 45%, nonmissense mutation, and male sex), an ICD can be beneficial if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected (IIa, B‑NR). In NICM with NYHA class I symptoms and an LVEF of 35% or less despite GDMT, an ICD may be considered if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected (IIb, B‑R). In medication‑refractory NYHA class IV HF without candidacy for cardiac transplantation, an LVAD, or a CRT defibrillator that incorporates both pacing and defibrillation capabilities, an ICD should not be implanted (III: No Benefit, C‑EO).

### 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus statement on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring / telemetry [^116uGsqi]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Post–myocardial infarction patients — nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on ambulatory ECG (AECG) is discussed for prognostic assessment and risk stratification. In patients with prior MI treated with reperfusion and beta-blockers, NSVT is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality when other covariates such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are taken into account, yet NSVT was shown to be a significant predictor of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in post‑MI patients with a relatively preserved ejection fraction (LVEF > 35%). Following the Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial, there is a role for AECG for NSVT detection in post‑MI patients with LVEF 35%–40% as electrophysiologically guided implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD) implantation improves survival, and prolonged (> 8 beats) and rapid (> 120 beats per minute) NSVT episodes may justify further exploration of SCD risk. Detection of any NSVT in patients with borderline ejection fraction (e.g., 35%–40%) might prompt further risk stratification and determination of need for ICD using electrophysiology study (EPS), although AECG is currently not commonly used.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) — genetic testing provides diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information, with substantial diagnostic yield and selective use in unexplained QTc prolongation. Genetic testing for disease-causing mutations in long QT syndrome offers important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information in addition to the clinical evaluation, and a positive test can facilitate establishing risk for family members; the yield in phenotype-positive patients is 50% to 86.0%. A negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of long QT syndrome, and in asymptomatic patients with otherwise unexplained prolonged QTc ≥ 480 ms on serial ECGs, genetic testing may help confirm the diagnosis and supplement prognostic information.

### 2019 HRS expert consensus statement on evaluation, risk stratification, and management of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^112iPvMH]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis — arrhythmia management considerations: The most common tachyarrhythmia in this disorder is atrial arrhythmia, and rate control using AV nodal blocking agents can be especially challenging in the face of the relative hypotension and impairment in compensatory vasoreactivity that is commonly seen with widespread systemic and autonomic involvement. AV nodal ablation has been evaluated and appears to be a reasonable consideration in more resistant and symptomatic cases, but extensive substrate abnormalities are common and results from atrial fibrillation ablation are less than ideal. Frequent ectopy with NSVT is the most common ventricular dysrhythmia, yet neither burden of ectopy nor NSVT appears to predict SCD, and whether ICDs improve survival is not clear, with progressive HF and terminal pulseless electrical activity remaining a common theme; this situation may be different for patients with cardiac amyloidosis who have been successfully managed for AL-type disease and for those awaiting cardiac transplantation. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis remain at high risk for developing intracardiac thrombus and thromboembolic stroke; anticoagulation needs to be carefully considered even in the absence of atrial arrhythmias.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy — electrophysiological study (EPS) prognostic value: The value of an electrophysiological study is uncertain in asymptomatic patients with preserved ventricular function for predicting subsequent risk for sudden cardiac death, electrophysiology studies induce sustained VT in approximately 60% of patients of whom half had prior spontaneous sustained VT, inducible sustained VT did not predict subsequent appropriate ICD shocks in primary prevention ICD recipients, and in 1 study symptomatic patients without inducible VT were less likely to receive appropriate ICD shocks; in asymptomatic patients without evidence of VA on ambulatory monitoring, a negative study may have limited value for ICD decision-making.

Focal atrial tachycardias — treatment recommendations include acute conversion with DC cardioversion class I, level of evidence B for haemodynamically unstable cases; for haemodynamically stable conversion, options listed as class IIa, level C are adenosine, beta-blockers, verapamil or diltiazem, procainamide, flecainide or propafenone, and amiodarone or sotalol. Acute rate regulation lists beta-blockers class I, level C, verapamil or diltiazem class I, level C, and digoxin class IIb, level C.

Appropriate ICD therapies in patients with none/minimal LGE burden

The clinical histories of the 10 patients in the none/minimal LGE group who received appropriate ICD therapies were examined (Supplemental Table S3). Two patients were later diagnosed with noncompaction cardiomyopathy and possible lamin A/C cardiomyopathy; both experienced sustained monomorphic VT that required ICD therapy. One patient required an ICD shock for torsade de pointes in the setting of markedly prolonged QTc (626 ms) caused by hydroxychloroquine therapy. One patient had frequent asymptomatic episodes of monomorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) at baseline but eventually received ATP in 1 instance, which resulted in a type-2 break shortly after the completion of a single round of ATP. The remaining 6 patients had no identifiable inherited cardiomyopathic diagnoses or reversible clinical triggers and presumably would have had a sustained arrhythmic event had they not received device therapy. Yet, even this small patient group was enriched for specific, potentially high-risk conditions (2 had severely reduced LVEF of ≤ 15%; 1 had end-stage renal disease treated with dialysis; 1 had pulmonary sarcoidosis, although without proven cardiac involvement; 1 had anthracycline-associated cardiomyopathy; and 1 had suspected alcohol-associated cardiomyopathy).

Conversely, 5 of the 10 treated patients with none or minimal LGE had LVEF of > 35% at the time of ICD therapy (3 of whom were CRT recipients) and would thus not have qualified for de novo primary prevention ICD implantation per clinical guidelines.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) — treatment recommendations specify beta blocker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use. Beta blockers are indicated for patients who are clinically diagnosed with CPVT on the basis of the presence of spontaneous or documented stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias (Level of Evidence: C). Implantation of an ICD with use of beta blockers is indicated for patients with CPVT who are survivors of cardiac arrest and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y (Level of Evidence: C). Beta blockers can be effective in patients without clinical manifestations when the diagnosis of CPVT is established during childhood based on genetic analysis (Level of Evidence: C). Implantation of an ICD with the use of beta blockers can be effective for affected patients with CPVT with syncope and/or documented sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) while receiving beta blockers and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y (Level of Evidence: C). Beta blockers may be considered for patients with CPVT who were genetically diagnosed in adulthood and never manifested clinical symptoms of tachyarrhythmias (Level of Evidence: C).

1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets are an antiarrhythmic indicated for:

the treatment of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias (1.1)

Limitations of Use

Avoid use in patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature contraction (1.1)

1.1 Life-Threatening Ventricular Arrhythmias

Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the treatment of life-threatening, documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).

Limitation of Use:

Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets may not enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias. Because of the proarrhythmic effects of Sotalol Hydrochloride Tablets, including a 1.5 to 2% rate of Torsade de Pointes (TdP) or new ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) in patients with either non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) or supraventricular arrhythmias (SVT), its use in patients with less severe arrhythmias, even if the patients are symptomatic, is generally not recommended.

Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) — implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) recommendations: In patients with NICM, heart failure (HF) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–III symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less, despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), an ICD is recommended if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected. In patients with NICM due to a Lamin A/C mutation who have 2 or more risk factors (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [NSVT], LVEF < 45%, nonmissense mutation, and male sex), an ICD can be beneficial if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected. In patients with NICM, HF with NYHA class I symptoms and an LVEF of 35% or less, despite GDMT, an ICD may be considered if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected. In patients with medication-refractory NYHA class IV HF who are not also candidates for cardiac transplantation, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) defibrillator that incorporates both pacing and defibrillation capabilities, an ICD should not be implanted.

Section 3 Clinical Evaluation

3.1. Clinical Presentation

Recommendation for clinical evaluation of patients with VAs

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

1. History should identify the onset, duration, frequency, and trigger of any symptoms and should include medication use as well as comorbidities and family history. Available cardiac rhythm data include interrogation of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) to assess arrhythmia burden, morphologies, and duration as well as treatment. Electrogram storage may be programmed to include far- and near-field electrograms to allow superior assessment of VA morphologies. The laboratory workup should be individualized to the patient's presentation and may include electrolytes, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, genetic testing, or drug screening as appropriate.

Synopsis

The clinical presentations of patients with VAs encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to VT/VF storm or sudden cardiac death.

Presenting symptoms can be classified into 5 groups: due to the VA itself (eg, PVCs, VT or VF); due to a secondary disease caused by the VAs (eg, PVC-induced cardiomyopathy); due to an underlying pathology associated with the VAs (eg, ischemia); due to ICD therapy; and a combination of these causes.

Idiopathic VA is frequently asymptomatic, especially when presenting as PVCs or nonsustained VT. In those cases, Vas are commonly detected coincidentally during routine exams. If symptomatic, symptoms can often be secondary to post-PVC augmentation of contractility or a post-PVC compensatory pause, and commonly consist of palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, fatigue, or chest discomfort. With increasing duration or VA rate (eg, VT or VF), hemodynamic compromise can result in more severe symptoms, such as pre-syncope, syncope, or even sudden cardiac death.

Special concerns regarding specific arrhythmias — sex differences and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW): WPW syndrome and orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia are more common in men than in women, and in patients with WPW syndrome manifest pathways are more common in men, whereas antidromic AV reciprocating tachycardia is more common in women than in men. Atrial fibrillation (AF) degenerating to ventricular fibrillation (VF) is more common in men than in women. For symptomatic WPW syndrome, the treatment of choice is radiofrequency (RF) ablation and the outcomes are similar in both sexes; during pregnancy, management may require initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs to block the accessory pathway and, in some, long-term monitoring. The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) at any age is greater in men than in women. Classic predictors such as obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) more in men, whereas for women, hyperglycemia, elevated hematocrit, and decreased vital capacity are more important predictors; the impact of diabetes is seen in both sexes but is much more pronounced in women. While nonsustained VT (NSVT) and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) have been associated with increased risk of sudden death in men with or without CHD, no such association has been seen in women; similarly, PVCs post–myocardial infarction (post-MI) in men have been associated with increased mortality, which does not hold true for women.

### Amiodarone versus implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: randomized trial in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia – AMIOVIRT [^115uw6jy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this multicenter randomized trial was to compare total mortality during therapy with amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).

Background

Whether an ICD reduces mortality more than amiodarone in patients with NIDCM and NSVT is unknown.

Methods

One hundred three patients with NIDCM, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 0.35, and asymptomatic NSVT were randomized to receive either amiodarone or an ICD. The primary end point was total mortality. Secondary end points included arrhythmia-free survival, quality of life, and costs.

Results

The study was stopped when the prospective stopping rule for futility was reached. The percent of patients surviving at one year (90% vs. 96%) and three years (88% vs. 87%) in the amiodarone and ICD groups, respectively, were not statistically different (p = 0.8). Quality of life was also similar with each therapy (p = NS). There was a trend with amiodarone, as compared to the ICD, towards improved arrhythmia-free survival (p = 0.1) and lower costs during the first year of therapy ($8,879 US dollars vs. $22,039 US dollars, p = 0.1).

Conclusions

Mortality and quality of life in patients with NIDCM and NSVT treated with amiodarone or an ICD are not statistically different. There is a trend towards a more beneficial cost profile and improved arrhythmia-free survival with amiodarone therapy.

MUSTT — Patients with coronary artery disease, ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 0.40, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) ≥ 3 beats who had inducible sustained VT were randomized to no antiarrhythmic therapy vs electrophysiology (EP)–guided therapy. After a median 39 months, 5‑year overall mortality estimates were 42% vs 48% (relative risk: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64–1.01); within the EP-guided group, 161 who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) had an adjusted relative risk of mortality of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.27–0.59).
