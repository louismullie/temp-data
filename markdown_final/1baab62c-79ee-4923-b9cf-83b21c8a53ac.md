## Question

Myxdema coma diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to diagnose myxedema coma, preserving the thinking process and self-verification steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clinical context and red flags that trigger suspicion. Then, I should verify the key bedside findings and physical examination clues. Next, I will consider precipitating factors and why the diagnosis is often delayed. After that, I need to check which laboratory tests are essential and which are ancillary. Then, I will examine the diagnostic scoring systems and how to apply them pragmatically. Finally, I should review differential diagnoses, common pitfalls, and how to confirm the diagnosis while initiating treatment without delay, anchoring to guideline-based management principles.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context that should raise suspicion for myxedema coma: altered mental status or coma in a patient with features of long-standing hypothyroidism or known hypothyroidism with decompensation, often in the setting of infection, cold exposure, surgery, or sedating drugs, and with bradycardia and hypothermia present. Importantly, clinicians frequently miss this diagnosis initially, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion when mental status and vitals are depressed, especially in older adults or those with edema, cold intolerance, or hoarseness [^116nrVwh] [^114FQTcz] [^111FbEKm].

> Wait, let me verify the key bedside findings before ordering tests: hypothermia with core temperature ≤ 35°C, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoventilation or hypercapnia, and non-pitting edema are classic. Delayed reflex relaxation and coarse, dry skin support the diagnosis, and puffy facies, macroglossia, and pericardial effusion on exam or imaging can be seen. Airway compromise from posterior pharyngeal edema can occur, so I should anticipate a potentially difficult airway if intubation is needed [^117SkLbr] [^112Q7s3b] [^113aTE41] [^1137JYv6].

> I need to check precipitating factors carefully because they both explain decompensation and guide management: infections (especially pneumonia/urosepsis), cold exposure, sedative-hypnotics or anesthesia, surgery or trauma, amiodarone, lithium, and myocardial infarction are well-documented triggers. Amiodarone in particular impairs T4-to-T3 conversion and can precipitate or worsen myxedema coma, so I should review medications and recent procedures early [^116e1FrM] [^113PQ3Xv] [^116HBQYm] [^117Dpi9T].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on nonspecific symptoms alone. I should confirm the laboratory diagnosis while preparing empiric therapy: serum TSH and free T4 are the essential tests, with very high TSH and very low free T4 indicating severe primary hypothyroidism. In central hypothyroidism, TSH may be low or inappropriately normal with low free T4, so I need to interpret patterns accordingly and avoid overreliance on TSH alone in suspected central disease [^111oVG6n] [^113mkwj1] [^117Va2bp] [^114V2Xs5].

> Let me consider ancillary labs that support severity but are not diagnostic by themselves: hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hypercarbia, hypoxemia, and CK elevation reflect multi-organ involvement. Hyponatremia is often multifactorial in severe hypothyroidism and, while mechanistically linked, I should double-check for other causes like SIADH or diuretics, especially outside overt myxedema coma, to avoid anchoring bias [^1145no7G] [^115ucrYh] [^116e1FrM].

> I should review the diagnostic scoring systems, but I need to ensure I do not delay treatment while calculating points: the semiquantitative scale assigns points across thermoregulatory, CNS, cardiovascular, GI, and metabolic domains plus precipitating events, with a score ≥ 60 strongly suggestive of myxedema coma and 45–59 indicating high risk. A separate framework from the Japan Thyroid Association includes hypothyroidism, CNS failure, hypothermia, hypoventilation, cardiovascular failure, and hyponatremia, and has been operationalized in contemporary reports, which can help standardize diagnosis in research and education contexts [^116kneCx] [^112GYdjv] [^1137JYv6].

> But wait, what if the labs are not back yet or the patient is too unstable to wait? I should confirm that diagnosis can be clinical when classic features coexist: severe hypothyroid phenotype with altered sensorium, hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypoventilation, plus a precipitant, can justify empiric treatment while labs are pending. Case-based literature supports early clinical diagnosis in extremis, particularly with characteristic edema, bradycardia, low-voltage ECG, and pericardial effusion on imaging [^112GYdjv] [^112Q7s3b] [^1137JYv6].

> Next, I should review the differential so I do not anchor prematurely: sepsis with shock, encephalopathy, or hypothermia can mimic or coexist. Opioid or sedative overdose may present with bradycardia and CNS depression. Severe adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis) shares hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. And hypothermia-related coagulopathy and infection may cloud the picture. In patients with hyponatremia and coma, I need to distinguish SIADH, adrenal crisis, and hypothyroid encephalopathy, and I should remember that central hypothyroidism can present subtly and requires low TSH/low T4 pattern recognition [^1145no7G] [^1144YkcP] [^114V2Xs5].

> Hold on, I should verify common pitfalls and avoid them: assuming normal TSH excludes hypothyroidism (it does not in central disease), relying on oral hormone in a coma (oral absorption is unreliable), forgetting steroids (risk of precipitating adrenal crisis), missing airway edema and difficult intubation, and failing to treat precipitating illness. Also, meperidine can provoke seizures in hypothyroid patients, so I should avoid it in this setting [^111CcJZx] [^116Guxqx] [^113aTE41] [^113sUT6E].

> Let me synthesize the diagnostic approach: in a patient with altered mental status, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypoventilation, and edema, I should obtain TSH and free T4 urgently, search for and treat precipitating factors, apply a scoring system to quantify severity while recognizing its limitations, and make a clinical diagnosis if the phenotype is classic and the patient is unstable. I should initiate IV levothyroxine and empiric glucocorticoids without waiting for full lab confirmation when suspicion is high, because delays increase mortality [^112GYdjv] [^116Guxqx] [^115H48AC].

Myxedema coma is diagnosed clinically by the **triad of hypothermia, altered mental status, and bradycardia** in a patient with severe hypothyroidism or a precipitating event [^116nrVwh] [^116e1FrM]. Laboratory confirmation requires **markedly elevated TSH and low free T4**; if central hypothyroidism is suspected, TSH may be low or inappropriately normal with low free T4 [^113mkwj1] [^114V2Xs5]. A **diagnostic scoring system** (score ≥ 60) can support diagnosis, but clinical judgment is paramount [^116kneCx]. Because myxedema coma is a medical emergency, **treatment must begin immediately** upon clinical suspicion, without waiting for laboratory results [^116nrVwh] [^112sB9yc].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

Myxedema coma presents with **multisystem involvement**, and diagnosis relies on clinical features supported by laboratory findings:

| **System** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Thermoregulatory | - Hypothermia (core temperature < 35°C) [^116e1FrM] [^116nrVwh] |
| Central nervous system | - Altered mental status (lethargy, confusion, stupor, coma) [^116e1FrM] [^116nrVwh] |
| Cardiovascular | - Bradycardia <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Pericardial effusion [^1137JYv6] |
| Respiratory | - Hypoventilation <br/> - Hypercapnia <br/> - Respiratory acidosis [^116e1FrM] [^117SkLbr] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Ileus <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Abdominal distension [^114SKCrx] |
| Metabolic | - Hyponatremia <br/> - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Hypoventilation [^116e1FrM] [^1145no7G] |

---

The **diagnostic criteria** include:

- **Severe hypothyroidism**: Markedly elevated TSH and low free T4 [^113mkwj1].
- **Altered mental status**: Lethargy, confusion, stupor, or coma [^116nrVwh].
- **Hypothermia**: Core temperature < 35°C [^117SkLbr].
- **Bradycardia**: Sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block [^1137JYv6].
- **Precipitating event**: Infection, surgery, trauma, cold exposure, or medications (sedatives, opioids, amiodarone) [^116e1FrM] [^113PQ3Xv].

---

## Laboratory findings

Laboratory tests are essential to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity:

- **Thyroid function tests**: Markedly elevated TSH and low free T4 indicate primary hypothyroidism; in central hypothyroidism, TSH may be low or inappropriately normal with low free T4 [^113mkwj1].
- **Electrolytes**: Hyponatremia is common due to impaired free water clearance [^116e1FrM] [^112jsLXU].
- **Glucose**: Hypoglycemia may occur due to reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis [^notfound].
- **Arterial blood gases**: Hypoventilation with respiratory acidosis [^116e1FrM].
- **Complete blood count**: Anemia is common [^notfound].
- **Cardiac enzymes**: Elevated creatine kinase and troponin may indicate myocardial involvement [^114npjkt].

---

## Diagnostic scoring system

A **diagnostic scoring system** has been proposed to aid diagnosis, incorporating clinical features, laboratory findings, and precipitating events. A score ≥ 60 is strongly suggestive of myxedema coma [^116kneCx].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Myxedema coma must be differentiated from other causes of altered mental status and hypothermia, including:

- **Sepsis**: Fever is common, whereas hypothermia is rare [^notfound].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Rapid reversal with glucose administration [^notfound].
- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Hyperpigmentation, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities [^notfound].
- **Encephalitis or meningitis**: Neck stiffness, fever, and focal neurological deficits [^notfound].
- **Drug overdose**: History of ingestion and toxicology screen [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given the high mortality, **treatment should begin immediately** upon clinical suspicion, without waiting for laboratory confirmation:

- **Immediate stabilization**: Airway, breathing, circulation, and correction of hypothermia [^116e1FrM].
- **Empiric therapy**: Intravenous levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) with glucocorticoid coverage [^112uZ7hH].
- **Supportive care**: Mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and treatment of precipitating factors [^116e1FrM].

---

Myxedema coma is diagnosed clinically by the **triad of hypothermia, altered mental status, and bradycardia**, supported by laboratory evidence of severe hypothyroidism. Immediate treatment is critical, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with severe hypothyroidism or precipitating events [^116e1FrM].

High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) — key diagnostic features and imaging: The diagnosis of HACE is heralded by signs of encephalopathy including ataxia — often the earliest clinical finding — and altered mentation; other signs include apathy, irritability, lassitude, and inability to provide self-care, and untreated HACE can progress to coma. Heel-toe walking can gauge ataxia, papilledema can confirm cerebral edema, and optic nerve sheath diameter by ultrasound is not reliable for diagnosis of AMS or HACE. With HACE, MRI often shows increased FLAIR and T2 signal in the corpus callosum with microhemorrhages consistent with blood-brain barrier disruption, mainly in the corpus callosum, and microhemorrhages can still be seen on MRI up to 120 mo following an episode of HACE, enabling retrospective evaluation after return to sea level.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings.

Thyroid hormones are given orally. In acute, emergency conditions, injectable levothyroxine sodium (T4) may be given intravenously when oral administration is not feasible or desirable, as in the treatment of myxedema coma, or during total parenteral nutrition. Intramuscular administration is not advisable because of reported poor absorption.

Hypothyroidism

Therapy is usually instituted using low doses, with increments which depend on the cardiovascular status of the patient. The usual starting dose is 30 mg Thyroid Tablets, USP, with increments of 15 mg every 2 to 3 weeks. A lower starting dosage, 15 mg/day, is recommended in patients with long-standing myxedema, particularly if cardiovascular impairment is suspected, in which case extreme caution is recommended. The appearance of angina is an indication for a reduction in dosage. Most patients require 60 to 120 mg/day. Failure to respond to doses of 180 mg suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption. Maintenance dosages 60 to 120 mg/day usually result in normal serum T4 and T3 levels. Adequate therapy usually results in normal TSH and T4 levels after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy.

Readjustment of thyroid hormone dosage should be made within the first four weeks of therapy, after proper clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum levels of T4, bound and free, and TSH. Liothyronine (T3) may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T4) during radio-isotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) is suspected.

### Myxedema coma [^116e1FrM]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Myxedema coma is the term given to the most severe presentation of profound hypothyroidism and is often fatal in spite of therapy. Decompensation of the hypothyroid patient into a coma may be precipitated by a number of drugs, systemic illnesses (eg, pneumonia), and other causes. It typically presents in older women in the winter months and is associated with signs of hypothyroidism, hypothermia, hyponatremia, hypercarbia, and hypoxemia. Treatment must be initiated promptly in an intensive care unit setting. Although thyroid hormone therapy is critical to survival, it remains uncertain whether it should be administered as thyroxine, triiodothyronine, or both. Adjunctive measures, such as ventilation, warming, fluids, antibiotics, pressors, and corticosteroids, may be essential for survival.

Clinical studies

The clinical data regarding the association between thyroid and sodium levels are poor. Clinical studies, excluding case reports, are summarized in Table 1. There have been several studies that have concluded that hyponatremia, especially severe hyponatremia, is uncommon in patients with hypothyroidism. In a large retrospective review of 33,912 patients, sodium levels were similar in euthyroid and hypothyroid patients, suggesting that the association is more coincidence than causal. Studies conducted in the emergency department and the primary care setting have demonstrated that although hyponatremia is more common in patients with elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) values, serum sodium levels do not correlate with TSH levels. This could be because most of the patients had normal sodium levels and therefore, when TSH and sodium was analyzed as a continuous variable, a strong correlation could not be found. A single-center, retrospective analysis found that in 98.88% of patients with hypothyroidism and hyponatremia, there was a potential alternative cause for the patient's hyponatremia, with no cases of clinically relevant hyponatremia (Na < 130 mmol/L) attributable to hypothyroidism alone. The results suggest that hyponatremia is oftentimes multifactorial in hypothyroid patients with moderate to severe hyponatremia. A study of 100 patients with hyponatremia associated with altered mental status found only eight patients with hypothyroidism requiring replacement, indicating that hypothyroidism is not a common cause of severe unexplained hyponatremia. Although there was not a significant association between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia in newly diagnosed hypothyroid patients, every 10 mU/L rise in TSH was associated with a 0.14 mmol/L decrease in sodium, suggesting that only the most severe cases of hypothyroidism result in clinically significant hyponatremia. A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 71,817 patients also concluded that the prevalence of overt hypothyroidism was higher for more severe hyponatremia, even after adjusting for potential confounders. However, patients with severe hypothyroidism will often have other electrolyte derangements and organ impairments that can impact sodium levels. Therefore, it can be challenging to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the effect of the thyroid hormone alone. A study of 10 patients with severe hypothyroidism undergoing a levothyroxine absorption test concluded that despite having a very elevated TSH and decreased GFR, hyponatremia was not observed in these patients. Therefore, even in severe hypothyroidism, in the absence of myxedema coma, hyponatremia may not be seen.

### Predictors of outcome in myxoedema coma [^111u9vuG]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Myxoedema coma is a rare and life-threatening illness the outcome of which has not been robustly studied in large numbers, partly due to its low incidence. Dutta and colleagues have explored outcome predictors in a developing country where access to thyroid function tests is more limited than in the Western world. Cardiovascular instability, reduced consciousness, persistent hypothermia, and sepsis all contributed to a poorer outcome, as has been demonstrated before, but a generic outcome predictor model was shown to be useful in this group of patients. Unfortunately, this observational study was unable to show differences in outcome based on replacement treatment methods and the mortality remains at 40%.

### Levothyroxine and liothyronine (Np thyroid 90) [^117KJi7K]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Myxedema Coma — Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of longstanding by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. T4 and T3 may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given intravenously. Normal T4 levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

Thyroid Cancer — Exogenous thyroid hormone may produce regression of metastases from follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and is used as ancillary therapy of these conditions with radioactive iodine. TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels. Therefore, larger amounts of thyroid hormone than those used for replacement therapy are required. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is usually unresponsive to this therapy.

Thyroid Suppression Therapy — Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50 percent or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy. For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T4 and T3 levels and lack of response to TSH. Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Synthroid) [^114MXL4y]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Risks Related to Overtreatment or Undertreatment with SYNTHROID

SYNTHROID has a narrow therapeutic index. Overtreatment or undertreatment with SYNTHROID may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, gastrointestinal function, and glucose and lipid metabolism in adult or pediatric patients.

In pediatric patients with congenital and acquired hypothyroidism, undertreatment may adversely affect cognitive development and linear growth, and overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis and acceleration of bone age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Titrate the dose of SYNTHROID carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider the potential for food or drug interactions and adjust the administration or dosage of SYNTHROID as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.000000000000000e+00 2 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease

Over-treatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate SYNTHROID therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive SYNTHROID therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant SYNTHROID and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency.

If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the SYNTHROID dose or withhold for one week and restart at a lower dose.

5.000000000000000e+00 3 Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.

### Central hypothyroidism with myxoedema: a less known but clinically challenging presentation [^114V2Xs5]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Myxoedema can have a variety of presentations, from mild cognitive impairment to psychosis, to overt coma. While majority of cases have primary hypothyroidism as the underlying aetiology, very few cases have central hypothyroidism. We report two patients who presented with myxoedema and were diagnosed with central hypothyroidism. A man in his 50s with a history of panhypopituitarism presented with hypotension, slurring of speech and psychosis that worsened to coma. He was initially treated as adrenal crisis, and on failing to improve he was later treated correctly as myxoedema coma. A woman in her 30s presented with bradykinesia and shock and was diagnosed with Sheehan's syndrome based on hormonal and imaging features. Both patients improved with a loading dose of oral thyroxine and intravenous steroids. Central hypothyroidism presenting with myxoedema is often complicated by coexisting pituitary hormone deficiencies. A high index of suspicion is required for better treatment outcomes.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^113PQ3Xv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Thyroid Abnormalities

Amiodarone hydrochloride inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T3levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T3(rT3) in clinically euthyroid patients. Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause either hypothyroidism (reported in up to 10% of patients) or hyperthyroidism (occurring in about 2% of patients). Monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction.

Hyperthyroidism may induce arrhythmia breakthrough. If any new signs of arrhythmia appear, the possibility of hyperthyroidism should be considered. Antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers, temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The action of antithyroid drugs may be delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Pacerone-induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism may be primary or subsequent to resolution of preceding amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, sometimes fatal, have been reported in association with amiodarone therapy. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing Pacerone and thyroid hormone supplementation.

5.7 Bradycardia

Pacerone causes symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest with suppression of escape foci in 2% to 4% of patients. The risk is increased by electrolytic disorders or use of concomitant antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Bradycardia may require a pacemaker for rate control.

Post-marketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, some requiring pacemaker insertion and at least one fatal, have been reported when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir were initiated in patients on amiodarone. Bradycardia generally occurred within hours to days, but in some cases presented up to 2 weeks after initiating antiviral treatment. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of antiviral treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Monitor heart rate in patients taking or recently discontinuing amiodarone when starting antiviral treatment [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Clinical findings

The patient had experienced general weakness and edema in the bilateral lower extremities for a few years, but the patient did not visit any hospital regarding this issue. Recently, the patient experienced poor appetite and ate almost nothing. Several days before the admission, the patient still had a poor appetite and could not carry out daily activities. The patient was unconscious at home and was brought to the hospital by the ambulance crew. Cardiac pulmonary resuscitation was performed by the ambulance crew, and ROSC was achieved. The patient was intubated and transferred to our hospital.

Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 40.0 kg/m². The initial vital signs on arrival at our hospital were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6 (E1VTM4); blood pressure, 86/51 mmHg; heart rate, 55 beats/min; SpO₂, 100%; and respiratory rate, 21 breaths/min. The patient had hypothermia (core body temperature, 32.4 °C). On physical examination, the patient was found to have a puffy face, thin eyebrows, and severe systemic non-pitting edema (Fig. 1). Electrocardiography revealed low-voltage sinus bradycardia with an inverted T-wave in the anterior precordial leads (Fig. 2). Troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide levels were 1159 pg/mL and 138 pg/mL, respectively. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly and bilateral costophrenic angle blunting (Fig. 3). Echocardiography, performed by a cardiologist, revealed hypokinesis of the inferior wall motion and a moderate amount of pericardial effusion (Fig. 4). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but there was a contrast-opaque area on the intimal side of the left ventricular inferior wall (Fig. 5). Based on these findings, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was suspected. The patient's laboratory test findings were as follows: sodium, 125 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; total protein, 6.1 g/dL; and albumin, 3.3 g/dL. Serum muscle enzyme levels were elevated, with a creatine kinase level of 1649 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 483 IU/L. Serum-free triiodothyronine (T3) level was 0.39 pg/mL, free thyroxine (T4) level was 0.04 pg/dL, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 33.5 µIU/mL. The anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) antibody level was 3579 IU/mL, and the anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody level was 26.9 IU/mL. The serum cortisol level was 62.4 µg/dL, and the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level was 237 mg/dL.

### Myxedema coma: diagnosis and treatment [^117RLftA]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Myxedema coma, the extreme manifestation of hypothyroidism, is an uncommon but potentially lethal condition. Patients with hypothyroidism may exhibit a number of physiologic alterations to compensate for the lack of thyroid hormone. If these homeostatic mechanisms are overwhelmed by factors such as infection, the patient may decompensate into myxedema coma. Patients with hypothyroidism typically have a history of fatigue, weight gain, constipation and cold intolerance. Physicians should include hypothyroidism in the differential diagnosis of every patient with hyponatremia. Patients with suspected myxedema coma should be admitted to an intensive care unit for vigorous pulmonary and cardiovascular support. Most authorities recommend treatment with intravenous levothyroxine (T4) as opposed to intravenous liothyronine (T3). Hydrocortisone should be administered until coexisting adrenal insufficiency is ruled out. Family physicians are in an important position to prevent myxedema coma by maintaining a high level of suspicion for hypothyroidism.

### Is there a causal relationship between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia? [^1145no7G]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hyponatremia and hypothyroidism are common diagnoses. Therefore, their simultaneous co-occurrence is not surprising. It is challenging to establish causality given that, in many situations, the etiology of hyponatremia is likely multifactorial. Although there are proposed mechanisms that explain how hypothyroidism leads to hyponatremia, clinical studies have not consistently demonstrated this relationship. Therefore, if hyponatremia occurs in patients with hypothyroidism in the absence of myxedema coma, other etiologies for hyponatremia should be evaluated.

### Thyroid disease in the emergency department: a clinical and laboratory review [^115mWgZE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Emergency physicians regularly treat patients with thyroid disorders. Until the 1950s, clinical evaluation was the only available diagnostic tool. Since then, increasingly sophisticated laboratory assays have been developed to confirm thyroid pathology. Thyroid physiology, fundamental to interpreting thyroid function tests, is based on a classic negative feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Primary hypothyroidism in developed countries is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's disease. Secondary and tertiary etiologies are uncommon and the result of hypothalamic and pituitary pathology. Clinical presentations range from subclinical disease to myxedema coma. Thyrotoxicosis has many etiologies. A hyperadrenergic state precipitates characteristic signs and symptoms. Thyroid storm and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis are emergent complications. Third generation assays have made thyroid function testing practical for emergency physicians. An ultrasensitive thyroid stimulating hormone level is the most useful. A free thyroxine level is the preferred study for confirming a thyroid disorder. Confounding factors may affect thyroid function interpretation.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1179LeJB]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Myxedema coma — therapeutic endpoints and monitoring with LT4: intravenous levothyroxine treatment may lead to improvement in cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, and metabolic parameters within a week, with serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations increasing or normalizing within a similar time frame and more gradual serum TSH improvement; therapeutic endpoints should be improved mental status, improved cardiac function, and improved pulmonary function, and measurement of thyroid hormones every 1–2 days is reasonable to ensure a favorable trajectory; failure of TSH to trend down or of thyroid hormone levels to improve could be considered indications to increase levothyroxine therapy and/or add liothyronine therapy, whereas high serum triiodothyronine should be considered an indication to decrease therapy. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

Myxedema coma — use of liothyronine (LT3) with LT4: given the possibility that thyroxine conversion to triiodothyronine may be decreased, intravenous liothyronine may be given in addition to levothyroxine, but high doses should be avoided given the association of high serum triiodothyronine during treatment with mortality; dosing can include a loading dose of 5–20 μg followed by 2.5–10 μg every 8 hours, with lower doses for smaller or older patients and those with a history of coronary disease or arrhythmia, and therapy can continue until the patient is clearly recovering. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Sudden cardiac arrest associated with myxedema coma due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism: a case report [^112GYdjv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

This case study reveals the severe clinical course of myxedema coma.

Myxedema coma is a life-threatening and emergency presentation of hypothyroidism. However, because of its rarity, only a few cases of cardiac arrest on hospital arrival have been reported. Most previous studies have focused on the general clinical course of myxedema coma. However, in this case study, we report the characteristic physical examination findings for enabling the early diagnosis of myxedema coma caused by hypothyroidism.

A previous analysis was conducted to reveal the epidemiology of myxedema coma in Japan. According to the study, the mean age at onset was 77 years, and two-thirds of the patients were women. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 29.5%. The number of patients was highest in winter. In-hospital mortality was significantly associated with higher age and the use of catecholamines. Cardiovascular diseases were the most frequent comorbidity at admission, which may be caused by hypothyroidism, leading to dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiovascular injury. Several studies have used a scoring system for diagnosing myxedema coma, but there are no global diagnostic criteria for myxedema coma because of its rarity and sudden onset. The Japan Thyroid Association has announced the widely used original diagnostic criteria, which include hypothyroidism, central nervous system failure, hypothermia, hypoventilation, cardiovascular failure, and hyponatremia. Therefore, myxedema coma is often clinically diagnosed based on symptoms and clinical examination without waiting for laboratory test results. In this case, we considered the possibility that the cause of the disturbance of consciousness was hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest. This was one of the reasons why it was difficult to differentiate it from the central nervous system disorder included in the diagnostic criteria for myxedema coma. Therefore, we clinically diagnosed the patient with myxedema coma without waiting for a response to the hormone replacement therapy.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^111oVG6n]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical hypothyroidism affects one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence among female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening (myxedema coma); more common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic, especially early in disease presentation; therefore, a diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial. Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy, started at 1.5 to 1.8 mcg per kg per day. Adding triiodothyronine is not recommended, even in patients with persistent symptoms and normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients older than 60 years or with known or suspected ischemic heart disease should start at a lower dosage of levothyroxine (12.5 to 50 mcg per day). Women with hypothyroidism who become pregnant should increase their weekly dosage by 30% up to nine doses per week (i.e., take one extra dose twice per week), followed by monthly evaluation and management. Patients with persistent symptoms after adequate levothyroxine dosing should be reassessed for other causes or the need for referral. Early recognition of myxedema coma and appropriate treatment is essential. Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do not benefit from treatment unless the thyroid-stimulating hormone level is greater than 10 mIU per L or the thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated.

### Decompensated hypothyroidism: a review for the emergency clinician [^116nrVwh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Decompensated hypothyroidism, formerly known as myxedema coma, is an endocrine emergency that commonly presents with altered mental status, as well as hypothermia and depressed vital signs. The condition is often caused by an inciting event, which may lead to significant delays in the diagnosis and management of this disease. Although the incidence is low, this disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important for emergency clinicians to be aware of this condition.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine diagnosis and management of adult patients with decompensated hypothyroidism.

Discussion

Decompensated hypothyroidism is a severe hypothyroid state associated with multiple organ failure. The diagnosis can be challenging due to similarities with more common diseases and lack of consideration of the diagnosis. Many patients may present with altered sensorium or depressed vital signs. Clinicians should obtain a thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine level when considering the diagnosis. Management involves resuscitation, early steroid supplementation, thyroid hormone replacement, and treatment of the inciting event.

Conclusions

Decompensated hypothyroidism should be considered in the evaluation of patients with altered sensorium and depressed vital signs so as to not miss this critical diagnosis.

### Sudden cardiac arrest associated with myxedema coma due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism: a case report [^111hr69b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism is a condition where serum thyroid hormone levels are lower than the reference range. If hypothyroidism is not identified early, it could lead to the most severe manifestation, known as myxedema coma. Myxedema coma is a rare form of extreme hypothyroidism, and it has been reported to occur at a frequency of 0.22/1,000,000 per year in Spain. It is a life-threatening condition and is associated with high mortality rates. In some cases, this condition could lead to cardiac arrest due to complications. When patients with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) are managed by resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), a differential diagnosis of hypothyroidism, including myxedema coma, should be considered.

Herein, we report a case of undiagnosed and untreated hypothyroidism resulting in myxedema coma and, consequently, cardiac arrest.

### Thyroid (Armour thyroid) [^111cnF5B]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Myxedema Coma — Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. Levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV. Normal T4 levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

Thyroid Cancer — Exogenous thyroid hormone may produce regression of metastases from follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and is used as ancillary therapy of these conditions with radioactive iodine. TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels. Therefore, larger amounts of thyroid hormone than those used for replacement therapy are required. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is usually unresponsive to this therapy.

Thyroid Suppression Therapy — Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50 percent or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.

For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T4 and T3 levels and lack of response to TSH.

Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source.

### Meperidine hydrochloride (meperidine HCl) [^113sUT6E]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

General

Opioid analgesics can have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, particularly when combined with CNS depressant drugs. The use of these products should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension.

Use of meperidine may be associated with increased potential risks and should be used with caution in the following conditions: sickle cell anemia, pheochromocytoma, acute alcoholism; adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g. Addison's disease); CNS depression or coma; delirium tremens; debilitated patients; kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression; myxedema or hypothyroidism; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; and toxic psychosis.

The administration of meperidine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. All opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings.

Interactions with Other CNS Depressants

Meperidine should be used with caution and consideration should be given to starting with a reduced dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Drug-drug interactions may result in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of meperidine.

Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics

Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as meperidine. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of meperidine and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.

Supraventricular Tachycardias

Meperidine should be used with caution in patients with atrial flutter and other supraventricular tachycardias because of a possible vagolytic action which may produce a significant increase in the ventricular response rate.

Convulsions

Meperidine may aggravate preexisting convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders. If dosage is escalated substantially above recommended levels because of tolerance development, convulsions may occur in individuals without a history of convulsive disorders.

Acute Abdominal Conditions

The administration of meperidine or other narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.

### Sheehan syndrome: a current approach to a dormant disease [^1144YkcP]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Menstrual history of the patient, age of menopause are very important in the detection of hypogonadism and must be questioned in every female patient. Obstetrical history (deliveries, abortus, related complications and hemorrhage), menstruation and lactation after delivery can be the clues for detecting SS. Sparse axillary and pubic hair, atrophy of the mammary gland, increased fine wrinkling around the mouth and eyes, hypopigmented and dry skin are typical clinical signs of SS. ACTH and adrenal steroid deficiency, hypogonadism and GH deficiency are the main reasons for these findings.

Constipation, cold intolerance, paleness, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, hypotension and hypoglycemia can be seen. If not diagnosed previously, patients can encounter adrenal crisis, circulatory collapse, myxedema coma and even death with a triggering stress.

### Hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition in which the thyroid gland provides insufficient amounts of thyroid hormone for the needs of peripheral tissues. The most common cause in adults is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), but there are many other causes. Because most of the clinical features of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the best diagnostic test; an elevated TSH level almost always signals primary hypothyroidism. Serum free thyroxine levels may be below the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) or within the reference range (subclinical hypothyroidism). All patients with overt hypothyroidism should be treated, but those with subclinical hypothyroidism do not always benefit from treatment, especially elderly patients and those with baseline TSH levels below 10 mU/L. Oral L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice because of its well-demonstrated efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Therapy goals are symptom relief and maintenance of serum TSH levels within the reference range. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening form of decompensated hypothyroidism that must be treated with aggressive L-thyroxine replacement and other supportive measures in the inpatient setting.

### Predictors of outcome in myxoedema coma: a study from a tertiary care centre [^117SkLbr]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This prospective observational study includes consecutive patients with myxoedema coma who presented to our institute from January 1999 to August 2006. The study was approved by institute's ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from relatives of patients. Diagnosis of myxoedema coma was based on altered sensorium ranging from obtundation and stupor to coma, hypothermia (core body temperature of less than or equal to 35°C), a precipitating illness, and low serum level of total or free thyroxine (T 4) (total T 4 of less than 58 nmol/L and free T 4 of less than 10.3 pmol/L, lower limit of reference range). Sick euthyroid syndrome was excluded by careful clinical examinations and appropriate investigations. In all patients with primary hypothyroidism, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of greater than 20 mU/L was taken along with low total and/or free T 4, and in patients with secondary hypothyroidism, structural abnormalities of hypothalamo-pituitary area along with low total and/or free T 4 were considered diagnostic. Stupor was defined as a lesser degree of unarousability in which the patient can be awakened by external stimuli, accompanied by motor behaviour leading to the avoidance of uncomfortable or aggravating stimuli. Obtundation was defined as easy arousal and the persistence of alertness for brief periods. Both are always accompanied by some degree of confusion. Altered sensorium was graded by GCS. Hypoventilation was defined as PaCO₂ (partial pressure of carbon dioxide, arterial) of greater than or equal to 43 mm Hg. Glucocorticoid sufficiency was defined by random plasma cortisol of greater than or equal to 350 nmol/L.

### Thyroid emergencies: a narrative review [^1127EuXv]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Myxedema coma and thyroid storm are rare thyroid emergencies associated with considerable mortality and morbidity. Myxedema coma is a state of decompensated hypothyroidism with widespread multi-organ dysfunction, most notably impaired consciousness, mixed respiratory failure, and hypothermia. Thyroid storm is the extreme state of thyrotoxicosis occurring when a patient's metabolic, thermoregulatory, and cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms are surpassed. Common clinical features of thyroid storm include hyperthermia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and tachyarrhythmias. Thyroid emergencies usually result from a precipitating event or trigger transforming a previously compensated hypothyroid or thyrotoxic state. The diagnosis of myxedema coma and thyroid storm is established from clinical features in the either already hypothyroid or thyrotoxic patient. In the case of thyroid storm, clinicians may augment their clinical reasoning with the Japanese Thyroid Association Diagnostic Criteria or the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale. Supportive care for the cardiovascular, respiratory, and thermoregulatory manifestations, as well as possible intercurrent illness or adrenal insufficiency, play a lead role in the management. For myxedema coma, treatment typically includes high dose levothyroxine with the addition of liothyronine for critically ill patients. Management of thyroid storm is multi-pronged and stepwise, consisting of first-line thionamide and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist therapy as first-line, inorganic iodine, as well as cholestyramine, plasmapheresis, or emergent thyroidectomy in appropriate severely ill patients.

### Postoperative myxoedema coma [^117KQ8PM]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a commonly diagnosed endocrine disorder in medicine. Hyponatraemia is reported in up to 10% of hypothyroid patients, although it is usually mild and rarely causes symptoms. Myxoedema coma is a rare manifestation of hypothyroidism and it can be lethal if it goes undiagnosed and untreated. Our patient presented with an acute manifestation of probable long-standing, but undiagnosed, hypothyroidism. She was asymptomatic but when subjected to surgery (identifiable stress factor) it precipitated as myxoedema coma. Stressful situations such as surgery or infection are the usual precipitating factors for myxoedema coma. The patient responded well to treatment with levothyroxin, 0.9% saline infusion and other general supportive measures. Judicious use of intravenous saline to correct hyponatraemia is important. Correction with 3% normal saline should be carried out with great caution, as rapid correction with 3% normal saline can lead to central pontine demyelination.

### Myxedema coma and cardiac ischemia in relation to thyroid hormone replacement therapy in a 38-year-old Japanese woman [^116BGasd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although thyroid hormone deficiency, either clinical or subclinical, is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, coronary ischemia in a premenopausal woman in her 30s is relatively rare.

Case Summary

A 38-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with severe breathlessness and depressed consciousness. Physical examination found facial, abdominal, and pretibial edema; coarse hair, hoarse voice, and dry skin; engorged jugular veins; a distant heart sound; and reduced bilateral entry of air into the chest. Laboratory examinations revealed severe hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and elevated serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125). A computed tomography scan showed massive pleural and pericardial effusions. After 3 months of levothyroxine replacement therapy (initial dose: 12.5 microg/d; maintenance dose: 125 microg/d), all abnormal laboratory values associated with hypothyroidism returned to within normal ranges, with the exception of a transient and paradoxical rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. However, 3 weeks after the initiation of therapy, the patient reported intermittent chest pains during the course of therapy, and a coronary artery angiogram revealed diffuse stenosis of all 3 branches. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, with subsequent improvement in coronary perfusion.

Discussion

Careful cardiovascular evaluation is recommended before the start of thyroid hormone replacement therapy. In addition, care should be taken in the interpretation of serum biomarkers of malignancy (eg, CEA, CA125) in patients with myxedema, as values may be elevated in a hypothyroid state.

Conclusions

Long-standing hypothyroidism may be associated with severe coronary atherosclerosis, even in a relatively young, premenopausal woman. The potential adverse cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormone must be considered during replacement therapy, even in relatively young patients.

### Clinical features and outcomes of myxedema coma in patients hospitalized for hypothyroidism: analysis of the United States national inpatient sample [^114FQTcz]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine condition and chronic thyroid hormone deficiency is associated with adverse effects across multiple organ systems. In compensated hypothyroidism, however, patients remain clinically stable due to gradual physiological adaptation. In contrast, the clinical syndrome of decompensated hypothyroidism referred to as myxedema coma (MC) is an endocrine emergency with high risk of mortality. Because of its rarity, there are currently limited data regarding MC. This study analyzes the clinical features and hospital outcomes of MC compared with hypothyroid patients without MC (nonMChypo) in national United States hospital data. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample, a public database of inpatient admissions to nonfederal hospitals in the United States, 2016–2018, including adult patients with primary diagnosis of MC (International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision [ICD-10]: E03.5) or nonMChypo (E03.0-E03.9, E89.0). Patient demographics, relevant clinical features, mortality, length of stay (LOS), and hospital costs were compared. Results: Of 18,635 patients hospitalized for hypothyroidism, 2495 (13.4%) had a diagnosis of MC. Sex distribution and race/ethnicity were similar between patients with MC and nonMChypo, whereas MC was associated with older patient age (p = 0.02), public insurance (p = 0.01), and unhoused status (p = 0.04). More admissions with MC occurred in winter compared with other seasons (p = 0.01). The overall mortality rate for MC was 6.8% versus 0.7% for nonMChypo (p < 0.001), and MC was independently associated with in-hospital mortality after adjusted regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 9.92 [CI 5.69–17.28], p < 0.001). Mean LOS ± standard error was 9.64 ± 0.73 days for MC versus 4.62 ± 0.12 days for nonMChypo (p < 0.001), and total hospital cost for MC was $21,768 ± $1759 versus $8941 ± $276 for nonMChypo (p = 0.07). In linear regression analyses, MC was an independent predictor of both increased LOS and total hospital cost. Conclusions: In summary, MC remains a clinically significant diagnosis in the modern era, independently associated with high mortality and health care costs. This continued burden demonstrates a need for further efforts to prevent, identify, and optimize treatment for patients with MC.

### Morbidity and mortality risks of premature enteral nutrition during the recovery of myxedema coma (A response to the article entitled "Pediatric patient with altered mental status and hypoxemia") [^112kDZ1a]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

To the Editors:

I read with interest the article by Root et alregarding the extreme rarity of myxedema coma in the pediatric population and agree that this ought not be missed as a differential diagnosis. The scenario, however, suggests that the level of experience managing this endocrine crisis among medical teams tends to be suboptimal. As such, the tendency and temptation to initiate enteral nutrition based solely on the typically rapid improvement in conscious level with intravenous levothyroxine therapy present a very real and present danger. Pediatric intensivists may advocate and routinely practice early enteral feeding in the wake of recent perspectives such as Casaer and Van den Berghewho commented that enteral nutrition administered early during critical illness could be safely tolerated irrespective of residual gastric volume. Exceptions to the rule are severe hypothyroid patients and especially those with myxedema whereby gastric emptying and gastrointestinal motility are drastically compromised and often overlooked. Even the adult population in which hypothyroidism is highly prevalent and myxedema coma is precipitated by the stress of sepsis or trauma is arguably "commoner", deaths (mostly unpublished) from aspiration pneumonia after extubation and switching from parenteral to enteral feeding have inadvertently occurred.

When myxedema is correctly diagnosed and treated, the astonishing clinical recovery in mental status analogous to a "resurrection from the dead" belies the lagged recovery of the hypothyroid gut concealed intra-abdominally. The pathogenetic mechanism of this phenomenon lays in the differential rates of response of various hypothyroid tissues of the body to thyroid hormone replacement. This underscores the importance of emphasizing the perils of premature enteral nutrition during the management of myxedema crisis. Although the authors should be applauded for their judicious transitioning of thyroid medications from intravenous to oral formulation after approximately 7 days probably coinciding with the introduction of enteral nutrition which undoubtedly resulted in a positive outcome in this 5-year-old girl, their lack of emphasis about this potential devastating complication and the ways to minimize that risk in their article are rather unsettling.

### Predictors of outcome in myxoedema coma: a study from a tertiary care centre [^1174Wk2v]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The proponents of T 3 therapy argue that the onset of action of T 3 is rapid, that peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 is hampered in the sick hypothyroid state, and that it has an earlier beneficial effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms as it crosses the blood-brain barrier more rapidly than T 4 does. However, due to the non-availability of T 3, we had not used it in our patients.

Patients with long-standing hypothyroidism may have associated glucocorticoid deficiency; therefore, glucocorticoid support is recommended. In our study, all patients received glucocorticoid therapy, but there was no difference in outcome between glucocorticoid-deficient and glucocorticoid-sufficient subjects.

Prediction of outcome is important both in emergency services and intensive care units. Currently available outcome prediction models such as APACHE II score, GCS, SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score), and MPM (Mortality Probability Model) systems calculate a prediction based on values taken in first 24 hours of admission, but not later. They are best suited for a mixed pool of patients suffering from a variety of disease conditions, but their validity on a day-to-day basis or for a homogenous group of patients such as those with myxoedema coma is questionable. Unlike these models, the SOFA score is validated for assessing and monitoring organ dysfunction because organ failure is a continuous process rather than an 'all or none' phenomenon. The initial SOFA score can be used to predict the degree of organ dysfunction or failure present at admission, delta SOFA score during hospital stay, and total maximum SOFA score represents the cumulative organ dysfunction experienced by the patients. In our experience, this was the best module for predicting mortality and morbidity.

### Myxedema coma after esophagectomy [^114275c8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

For most patients with esophageal cancer, esophagectomy is an effective therapy. Perioperative management is critical for clinical outcomes after the operation. Great efforts should be made to avoid postoperative complications. We report myxedema coma, an emergency condition caused by severe hypothyroidism, after a patient underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous levothyroxine. We strongly recommend that physicians test the thyroid hormone levels in patients with risk factors. If myxedema coma occurs, immediate use of intravenous levothyroxine is effective for this lethal complication.

### Levothyroxine [^111CcJZx]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1–0.5 mU/L for nodules and 0.5–1.0 mU/L for multinodular goiter) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Levothyroxine sodium is contraindicated if the serum TSH is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Myxedema Coma - Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, oral thyroid hormone drug products are not recommended to treat this condition. Thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration should be administered.

### Is there a causal relationship between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia? [^112jsLXU]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common lab abnormalities seen in clinical practice. It has become widely accepted that hypothyroidism is a cause of euvolemic hyponatremia. The primary mechanism is thought to be due to impaired free water excretion and changes in sodium handling in the kidney. However, the clinical studies are conflicting and do not definitively confirm the association between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia. Therefore, if severe hyponatremia occurs in a patient without myxedema coma, other potential etiologies should be sought.

Congenital hypothyroidism is rare and is screened for in the United States during the newborn period in order to prevent a treatable cognitive delay. Myxedema coma is a complication due to severe hypothyroidism resulting from failure of homeostatic processes, causing altered mental status, generalized edema, and vital sign abnormalities. Treatment of myxedema coma consists of supportive care and hormone replacement. We describe a case of congenital hypothyroidism presenting as myxedema coma in an immigrant teenager.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition presenting a challenge to emergency physicians in diagnosing the underlying etiology of vague complaints. Making the diagnosis of a critically ill patient in myxedema coma allows early treatment with appropriate thyroid hormone replacement and avoids higher patient mortality. To do this, the emergency physician must maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion for thyroid disease.

### Levothyroxine and liothyronine (renThyroid) [^117JxKoj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Thyroid hormones should be used with great caution in a number of circumstances where the integrity of the cardiovascular system, particularly the coronary arteries, is suspected.

These include patients with angina pectoris or the elderly, in whom there is a greater likelihood of occult cardiac disease. In these patients therapy should be initiated with low doses, i.e., 15–30 mg of RenThyroid (Thyroid Tablets, USP). When, in such patients, a euthyroid state can only be reached at the expense of an aggravation of the cardiovascular disease, thyroid hormone dosage should be reduced.

Thyroid hormone therapy in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus or adrenal cortical insufficiency aggravates the intensity of their symptoms. Appropriate adjustments of the various therapeutic measures directed at these concomitant endocrine diseases are required. The therapy of myxedema coma requires simultaneous administration of glucocorticoids (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Hypothyroidism decreases and hyperthyroidism increases the sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin time should be closely monitored in thyroid-treated patients on oral anticoagulants and dosage of the latter agents adjusted on the basis of frequent prothrombin time determinations. In infants, excessive doses of thyroid hormone preparations may produce craniosynostosis.

Information for the Patient

Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of children on thyroid therapy should be informed that:

Replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life, with the exception of cases of transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and in those patients receiving a therapeutic trial of the drug.
They should immediately report during the course of therapy any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity, e.g., chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event.
In case of concomitant diabetes mellitus, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need readjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward readjustment of the dosage of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. At all times, close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients.
In case of concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time should be measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants is to be readjusted.
Instruct patients to discontinue biotin or any biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before thyroid function testing is conducted.
Partial loss of hair may be experienced by children in the first few months of thyroid therapy, but this is usually a transient phenomenon and later recovery is usually the rule.

Hyperthyroidism — assessment of disease severity and initial management emphasizes that all patients with known or suspected hyperthyroidism should undergo a comprehensive history and physical examination including measurement of pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body weight, and thyroid size, tenderness, symmetry, nodularity, pulmonary, cardiac, and neuromuscular function with the presence or absence of peripheral edema, eye signs, or pretibial myxedema. The need for evaluation should not postpone therapy of the thyrotoxicosis; in addition to the administration of β-blockers, treatment may be needed for concomitant myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, or atrial arrhythmias, and anticoagulation may be necessary in patients in atrial fibrillation.

### Levothyroxine, liothyronine (NP thyroid 30) [^111nhWHi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Readjustment of thyroid hormone dosage should be made within the first four weeks of therapy, after proper clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum levels of T4, bound and free, and TSH.

T3may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T4) during radio-isotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of T4and T3is suspected.

Myxedema Coma - Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. T4and T3may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given intravenously. Normal T4levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

### A diagnostic scoring system for myxedema coma [^116kneCx]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop diagnostic criteria for myxedema coma (MC), a decompensated state of extreme hypothyroidism with a high mortality rate if untreated, in order to facilitate its early recognition and treatment.

Methods

The frequencies of characteristics associated with MC were assessed retrospectively in patients from our institutions in order to derive a semiquantitative diagnostic point scale that was further applied on selected patients whose data were retrieved from the literature. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the predictive power of the score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to test the discriminative power of the score.

Results

Of the 21 patients examined, 7 were reclassified as not having MC (non-MC), and they were used as controls. The scoring system included a composite of alterations of thermoregulatory, central nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and metabolic systems, and presence or absence of a precipitating event. All 14 of our MC patients had a score of ≥ 60, whereas 6 of 7 non-MC patients had scores of 25 to 50. A total of 16 of 22 MC patients whose data were retrieved from the literature had a score ≥ 60, and 6 of 22 of these patients scored between 45 and 55. The odds ratio per each score unit increase as a continuum was 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.16; p = 0.019); a score of 60 identified coma, with an odds ratio of 1.22. The area under the ROC curve was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.00), and the score of 60 had 100% sensitivity and 85.71% specificity.

Conclusion

A score ≥ 60 in the proposed scoring system is potentially diagnostic for MC, whereas scores between 45 and 59 could classify patients at risk for MC.

### Liothyronine sodium [^113HasgW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease

Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose.

5.2	Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.

5.3	Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency

Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4	Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism

Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Hypothyroidism: causes, killers, and life-saving treatments [^111xBDdK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a very common, yet often overlooked disease. It can have a myriad of signs and symptoms, and is often nonspecific. Identification requires analysis of thyroid hormones circulating in the bloodstream, and treatment is simply replacement with exogenous hormone, usually levothyroxine (Synthroid). The deadly manifestation of hypothyroidism is myxedema coma. Similarly nonspecific and underrecognized, treatment with exogenous hormone is necessary to decrease the high mortality rate.

Treatment and outcomes

First, hydrocortisone was administered at a dose of 200 mg/day, considering the risk of adrenal insufficiency. Then, levothyroxine and liothyronine sodium were administered at doses of 200 µg/day and 50 µg/day, respectively. On the 5th day, the patient experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Electrolyte levels were in the normal range, and the cause of VT could not be identified. The patient was clinically diagnosed with myxedema coma, which was possibly caused by NSTEMI. The patient received amiodarone at a dose of 750 mg for 48 h. Further cardiological intervention was not performed because the neurological prognosis was poor. After amiodarone administration, VT was not observed. On the 12th day, laboratory test results showed that the serum TSH level was 15.1 µIU/mL, the free T4 level was 0.21 pg/dL, and the free T3 levels were normal. However, the patient did not recover from the coma, and the dysfunction of the central nervous system remained.

Renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury and antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia were needed during the stay in the ICU. On the 7th day, tracheostomy was performed, and management with mechanical ventilation continued. The patient was discharged to the chronic care hospital on the 25th day.

Results

Twenty-three patients (20 women; 87%) of 59.5 ± 14.8 years of age (range, 30 to 89 years) were included in the present study. The mean lag time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was 10.5 ± 9.7 days (range, 1 to 45 days). Nine (39%) patients were diagnosed with hypothyroidism for the first time (de novo group) and 14 (61%) were previously diagnosed (defaulter group). Nineteen (83%) patients had primary hypothyroidism and 4 (17%) had secondary hypothyroidism. Of them, 3 had Sheehan syndrome and 1 had non-functioning pituitary adenoma. Fifteen patients presented in the winter and cold exposure was considered to be a major precipitating factor. Sedative hypnotics and lithium overdose were considered to be a precipitating factor in 3 patients and 1 patient, respectively. Infection was the major accompanying comorbidity in 17 (74%) patients, including bacterial pneumonia in 13, urosepsis in 2, and 1 each with viral gastroenteritis and hepatitis. Twelve patients had a history of diuretic use for their edematous states without correct diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Eight patients had tense ascites at the time of presentation, and 2 patients had myxoedema ileus as a presenting manifestation. Sixteen (69%) patients were deeply comatose and 7 were obtunded at the time of presentation. Myxoedematous skin was present in all patients but was more marked in patients with primary hypothyroidism, and hypothermia was accompanied in all patients. The presenting manifestations and clinical profile are summarised in Table 1.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related new-onset thyroid dysfunction: a retrospective analysis using the US FDA adverse event reporting system [^112LbzyD]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the past several years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, and cytotoxic T-cell-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, have emerged as a remarkable therapeutic improvement for cancer patients of advanced stage. After the approval of ICIs for the treatment of a broad subtype of malignancies from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of ICIs, including endocrinopathies, were recognized in a proportion of patients receiving ICI therapy. Common types of ICI-related endocrinopathies are thyroid dysfunction, hypophysitis, primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM).

As a leading subtype of endocrine-related irAEs, ICI-related thyroid dysfunction (ICI-TDs) could present as overt or subclinical hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and/or thyroiditis. However, the incidence of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism varied among statistics from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of different ICIs and meta-analyses. Given the increasing application of ICI therapy in clinical practice and possible life-threatening results caused by thyrotoxic crisis and myxedema coma, it is critical to obtain accurate and comprehensive data from a large population of the incidence, clinical manifestations, and prognosis of ICI-related thyroid dysfunction. Therefore, we carried on a retrospective study to investigate the prevalence and demographic characteristics of ICI-related thyroid dysfunction and to explore risk factors of poor clinical outcome using data from the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

### Cardiac tamponade as initial presenting feature of primary hypothyroidism in the ED [^112BSVRa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion is commonly detected in patients with severe hypothyroidism and is typically mild; rarely, it may lead to cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade with myxedema coma as initial presenting feature of previously unrecognized hypothyroidism is rare. This case highlights that previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism can manifest as myxedema coma with shock due to pericardial tamponade particularly in winters because a cold environment can precipitate myxedema. We report an undiagnosed case of primary hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department for the first time with both cardiac tamponade and myxedema coma. This combination of cardiac tamponade and myxedema coma as the presenting features of primary hypothyroidism has rarely been reported in the literature. The patient was effectively managed with echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis, levothyroxine, and external rewarming. Cardiac tamponade and myxedema coma as presenting features of previously unrecognized primary hypothyroidism are extremely rare. Urgent bedside echocardiography with pericardiocentesis along with thyroxine therapy is the treatment of choice. It is important to include hypothyroidism as the differential diagnosis in patients with cardiac tamponade and altered level of consciousness especially in winter months.

### Predictors of outcome in myxoedema coma: a study from a tertiary care centre [^112Wt7e4]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

With the easy availability of thyroid hormone assays, thyroid disorders are now recognised even in a subclinical state. However, patients are still seen with advanced manifestations of the disease, particularly in developing countries. This observational study analysed the predictors of outcome in patients with myxoedema coma and tested the validity of different modules to define morbidity and mortality in these patients.

Methods

Twenty-three consecutive patients with myxoedema coma who presented from January 1999 to August 2006 were studied. The thyroid function test and random serum cortisol were measured in all patients at the time of admission. Patients were given oral or intravenous (IV) thyroxine with intention to treat with the latter according to availability. Various modules that predict outcome, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, were analysed. SOFA score was repeated every 2 days until the time of discharge or demise.

Results

Twenty-three patients (20 women; 87%) of 59.5 ± 14.4 years of age (range, 30 to 89 years) were seen during the study period. Nine (39%) patients were diagnosed with hypothyroidism for the first time at the time of presentation of myxoedema coma, whereas 14 (70%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism previously. However, the treatment defaulters presented early to the hospital and had more severe manifestations than de novo subjects. Nineteen (82%) had thyroprivic (primary) and 4 (17%) had trophoprivic (secondary) hypothyroidism. Fifteen (65%) patients presented in the winter and in 17 (74%) sepsis was the major accompanying comorbidity. Twelve (52%) had a history of diuretic use, thereby delaying the initial diagnosis. Patients who received oral L-thyroxine had no difference in outcome from those receiving IV thyroxine. Twelve (52%) subjects died and sepsis was the predominant cause of death. Various predictors of mortality included hypotension (p = 0.01) and bradycardia (p = 0.03) at presentation, need for mechanical ventilation (p = 0.00), hypothermia unresponsive to treatment (p = 0.01), sepsis (p = 0.01), intake of sedative drugs (p = 0.02), lower GCS (p = 0.03), high APACHE II score (p = 0.04), and high SOFA score (p = 0.00). However, SOFA score was more effective than other predictive models as baseline and day 3 SOFA scores of more than 6 were highly predictive of poor outcome.

Conclusion

L-Thyroxine treatment defaulters had more severe manifestations compared with de novo subjects. Outcome was not influenced by either aetiology or route of administration of L-thyroxine, and SOFA score was the best outcome predictor model.

Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. Levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV. Normal T4 levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

Thyroid Cancer

Exogenous thyroid hormone may produce regression of metastases from follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and is used as ancillary therapy of these conditions with radioactive iodine. TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels. Therefore, larger amounts of thyroid hormone than those used for replacement therapy are required. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is usually unresponsive to this therapy.

Thyroid Suppression Therapy

Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.

For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T4 and T3 levels and lack of response to TSH.

Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source.

### Predictors of outcome in myxoedema coma: a study from a tertiary care centre [^11557bk2]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study showed that patients who were previously diagnosed and non-compliant with the L-T 4 treatment had more severe manifestations at presentation and higher mortality in comparison with those who were diagnosed as having hypothyroidism for the first time. The aetiology of hypothyroidism (primary versus secondary) and route of administration of L-T 4 (oral versus IV) had no influence on outcome. Among various outcome prediction models for critical care illness, the SOFA score was found to correlate best with mortality in these patients.

As hypothyroidism is more common in elderly women, most of our patients were older females (87%). As in previous reports, the majority of our patients presented in the winter and hypothermia was a frequent accompaniment as cold weather lowers the threshold for encephalopathy in patients with hypothyroidism and this is possibly attributed to the failure of thermoregulatory compensatory mechanisms. In agreement with the published literature, chest and genitourinary infections were the most common comorbidities and/or precipitating factors in the present study. Nearly half of our patients were inappropriately treated with diuretics for edematous state by primary care physicians and that masked the myxoedematous manifestations and posed a difficulty in making an early diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

### Predictors of outcome in myxoedema coma: a study from a tertiary care centre [^115fnTQH]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The prognosis of patients with myxoedema coma is difficult to predict due to the rarity of the condition. Before 1964, the mortality rate was as high as 80%. The mortality rate in the present study was 52.2%, which is similar to that reported by Arlot and colleagues. The improvement in outcome is attributed to early diagnosis, better supportive care, and use of IV T 4. In previous studies, poor predictors of outcome included advanced age, bradycardia, persistent hypothermia, level of sensorium, and high APACHE II score at presentation. Our study is in agreement with previous studies in this aspect, except advanced age, which was comparable between survivors and non-survivors. Additionally, low mean blood pressure, requirement for mechanical ventilation, precipitation of myxoedema coma by use of sedatives, accompanying sepsis, and baseline and mean SOFA scores of greater than or equal to 6 were predictive of mortality.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Elderly and those with underlying cardiovascular disease should receive doses at the lower end of the recommended range. (8.5)

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category A – There are no reported cases of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection used to treat myxedema coma in patients who were pregnant or lactating. Studies in pregnant women treated with oral levothyroxine to maintain a euthyroid state have not shown an increased risk of fetal abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant patients who develop myxedema should be treated with Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection as the risk of nontreatment is associated with a high probability of significant morbidity or mortality to the maternal patient and the fetus.

8.2 Labor and Delivery

Patients in labor who develop myxedema have not been reported in the literature. However, patients should be treated with Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection as the risk of nontreatment is associated with a high probability of significant morbidity or mortality to the maternal patient and the fetus.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Adequate replacement doses of thyroid hormones are required to maintain normal lactation. There are no reported cases of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection used to treat myxedema coma in patients who are lactating. However, such patients should be treated with Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection as the risk of nontreatment is associated with a high probability of significant morbidity or mortality to the nursing patient.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Myxedema coma is a disease of the elderly. An approved, oral dosage form of levothyroxine should be used in the pediatric patient population for maintaining a euthyroid state in non-complicated hypothyroidism.

8.5 Geriatric Use and Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease

See Section 2, Dosage and Administration, for full prescribing information in the geriatric patient population. Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the elderly, cautious use of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection in the elderly and in patients with known cardiac risk factors is advised. Atrial fibrillation is a common side effect associated with levothyroxine treatment in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5)].

### Myxoedema coma and myxoedema heart disease [^1137JYv6]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A 56-year-old woman with a 3-year history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis presented with hypothermia (35°C), hypotension (66/49 mmHg), bradycardia (53 b.p.m.), psychomotor dysfunction (Panel A, Supplementary data online, Video S1A), irritability, fatigue, polyneuropathy, diplopia, weight loss (10 kg in 6 weeks), and dizziness with several falls and brief loss of consciousness. She had discontinuedthyroxine substitution a year ago over medication concerns.

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed discrete exophthalmos and ruled out ischaemia and haemorrhage. Free thyroxine (< 1.3 pmol/L) and free triiodothyronine (fT3 < 0.6 pmol/L) were undetectable, while thyroid-stimulating hormone was significantly elevated (84.6 mIU/L), indicating severe primary hypothyroidism. Mild hyponatraemia, mildly elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and NT-proBNP were noted, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed low-voltage signs (Panel B, Supplementary data online, Table S1, Figure S1A and B). Echocardiography and cardiac MRI revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional function (Panel C). Tissue characterization showed elevated myocardial extracellular volume (Panel D), along with anasarca, bilateral pleural effusion, and a small pericardial effusion (Panels C and E).

These findings were consistent with a myxoedema coma due to non-adherence, complicated by myxoedema heart disease. Thyroid hormone replacement (levothyroxine 150 µg/days) was initiated immediately. At follow-up 7 months later, the patient was in a good condition with improved neurological status, normalization of laboratory values, ECG, and left ventricular hypertrophy (see Supplementary data online, Video S1B, Table S1, Figure S1C).

The diagnosis of myxoedema coma is primarily clinical. A proposed scoring system for myxoedema coma with a score of 60 or higher being diagnostic showed our patient scored 105 points (see Supplementary data online, Table S2).

Supplementary data are available at European Heart Journal online.

### Myxedema, shock and coma… [^115oQJkN]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In the last 7 years numerous reports1–15 have appeared in the British Medical literature dealing with myxedema, shock, and coma. A survey of these reports indicates that 19 out of 25 patients died in spite of vigorous treatment with corticosteroids, vasopressors, thyroid compounds, antibiotics, warming, and electrolyte and fluid correction. Frequently, an infectious process was present, and the syndrome of myxedemacoma was characterized in many instances by hypothermia, hypotension, cardiac failure, and low serum and chloride. Death was due to peripheric vascular failure. In the American medical literature, we have 3 reports16–18 of myxedema-coma. One of these patients was also in shock. There were no survivors. The object of this study is to report 6 survival cases of myxedema with coma and shock and one survival case of myxedema in shock. We believe they are the first survival cases to be reported in the United States. This study. CATZ B, RUSSELL S.

### Thyroid [^112TPvdc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. Levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV. Normal T4 levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

Thyroid Cancer

Exogenous thyroid hormone may produce regression of metastases from follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and is used as ancillary therapy of these conditions with radioactive iodine. TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels. Therefore, larger amounts of thyroid hormone than those used for replacement therapy are required. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is usually unresponsive to this therapy.

Thyroid Suppression Therapy

Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.

For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T4 and T3 levels and lack of response to TSH.

Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source.

### Thyroid, porcine [^111W76iu]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings.

Thyroid hormones are given orally. In acute, emergency conditions, injectable levothyroxine sodium (T4) may be given intravenously when oral administration is not feasible or desirable, as in the treatment of myxedema coma, or during total parenteral nutrition. Intramuscular administration is not advisable because of reported poor absorption.

Hypothyroidism — Therapy is usually instituted using low doses, with increments which depend on the cardiovascular status of the patient. The usual starting dose is 30 mg Armour Thyroid, with increments of 15 mg every 2 to 3 weeks. A lower starting dosage, 15 mg/day, is recommended in patients with long-standing myxedema, particularly if cardiovascular impairment is suspected, in which case extreme caution is recommended. The appearance of angina is an indication for a reduction in dosage. Most patients require 60 to 120 mg/day. Failure to respond to doses of 180 mg suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption. Maintenance dosages 60 to 120 mg/day usually result in normal serum T4 and T3 levels. Adequate therapy usually results in normal TSH and T4 levels after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy.

Readjustment of thyroid hormone dosage should be made within the first four weeks of therapy, after proper clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum levels of T4, bound and free, and TSH.

### Severe angioedema in myxedema coma: a difficult airway in a rare endocrine emergency [^113aTE41]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Myxedema coma is the most lethal manifestation of hypothyroidism. It is a true medical emergency and can result in profound hemodynamic instability and airway compromise. Myxedema coma currently remains a diagnostic challenge due to the rarity of cases seen today, and failure to promptly initiate therapy with replacement thyroid hormone can be fatal. As thyroid hormone therapy can take days or weeks to reverse the manifestations of myxedema coma, interim supportive therapy is critical while awaiting clinical improvement. Some patients will require endotracheal intubation in the emergency department (ED), and physicians should be aware that unanticipated posterior pharyngeal edema in myxedema coma could severely complicate airway management. Although mechanical ventilation is a well-described adjunctive therapy for myxedema coma, reports of the potential difficulty in securing a definitive airway in these patients are rare. We describe a case of an unidentified woman who presented to the ED with myxedema coma requiring urgent endotracheal intubation and was found to have extensive posterior pharyngeal angioedema inconsistent with her relatively benign external examination. This case highlights the typical features of myxedema coma and discusses our necessity for a rescue device in definitive endotracheal tube placement. Emergency physicians should anticipate a potentially difficult airway in all myxedema coma patients regardless of the degree of external facial edema present.

### Indications for ordering thyroid-stimulating hormone in noncritically ill adult inpatients – A Delphi consensus recommendation [^113uLBti]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is ordered commonly among inpatients, but the possibility of nonthyroidal illness syndrome challenges interpretation.

Objective

Our objective was to obtain Canadian consensus on appropriate indications for ordering TSH in the first 48h following presentation of a noncritically ill internal medicine patient.

Design, Setting and Participants

Canadian endocrinologists with inpatient expertise were invited via snowball sampling to an online 3-round Delphi study. Main Outcome and Measures using a 6-point Likert scale, they rated 58 indications on appropriateness for measuring TSH in medical inpatients. These indications included clinical presentations, signs, and symptoms. Items that reached consensus and agreement (≥ 80% of participants selecting a rating of 5 or 6 on the Likert scale) were tabulated and dropped after each round. Qualitative analysis of comments identified additional contextual considerations as themes.

Results

There were 45 participants (academic setting: 84%) representing 8 provinces (Ontario: 64%). Rounds 2 and 3 were completed by 42 and 33 participants, respectively. Nine indications reached consensus and agreement: presumed myxedema coma, presumed thyroid storm, atrial fibrillation/flutter, euvolemic hyponatremia, proptosis, adrenal insufficiency, hypothermia, thyroid medication noncompliance, and goiter. There was also agreement that two contextual considerations identified in thematic analysis, including a recent abnormal outpatient TSH, and the presence of other findings of thyroid dysfunction, would significantly change some mid-range responses.

Conclusions

Canadian experts agreed upon nine specific indications for ordering an inpatient TSH, with others requiring consideration of previous TSH measurement and clinical context.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112uZ7hH]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Myxedema coma — initial thyroid hormone therapy and adjunctive measures are specified as follows: Initial T4 replacement for myxedema coma should be LT4 given intravenously, with a loading dose of 200–400 μg of LT4 and a daily replacement dose of 1.6 μg/kg body weight, reduced to 75% as long as it is being intravenously administered. In one report, patients with mean serum TSH approximately 80 mIU/L treated with 100 μg intravenous LT4 daily had normalization of other clinical parameters within a week. Because T4 conversion to T3 may be decreased, intravenous LT3 may be given in addition to LT4; high doses should be avoided, with a loading dose of 5–20 μg followed by a maintenance dose of 2.5–10 μg every 8 hours, and if intravenous therapy with LT3 is initiated, there are no data addressing optimum duration of such therapy. Intravenous LT3 monotherapy administered at doses of either 25 or 50 μg daily in hypothyroid patients with serum TSH values in the range of 68–81 mIU/L led to normalization of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic parameters within a week. Empiric glucocorticoid therapy at stress doses should be initiated at the start of therapy for myxedema coma, serum cortisol should be measured prior to initiation of therapy, and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be initiated until infection is ruled out as an etiology.

### Sudden cardiac arrest associated with myxedema coma due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism: a case report [^117Dpi9T]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Several factors precipitating myxedema coma have been revealed, such as infection, myocardial infarction (MI), cold exposure, surgery, and the administration of sedative drugs. Amiodarone also has a complex effect on the thyroid gland because its structure is similar to that of thyroid hormones. In this case, fT3 levels were slightly lower, and TSH levels were higher after amiodarone administration for VT; consequently, the dose of LT3/LT4 needed to be increased. As a consequence, physicians should be cautious of certain drugs leading to thyroid dysfunction when managing patients with a myxedema coma.

Owing to the rarity of this condition, the recommended strategy of thyroid hormone replacement therapy remains unclear; thus, it has merely been based on expert opinions and case reports. In Japan, patients with myxedema coma are commonly treated with LT4, with or without LT3.

Thyroid hormones have many effects on the heart and the vascular system. The most common signs of hypothyroidism are bradycardia, mild hypertension, narrowed pulse pressure, and attenuated activity on precordial examination. Low cardiac output is caused by bradycardia, decreased ventricular filling, and decreased cardiac contractility. Systemic vascular resistance may increase by 50%, and diastolic relaxation and filling are slowed. However, heart failure is rare because cardiac output is usually sufficient to meet the lower demand for peripheral oxygen delivery. Hypothyroidism may result in accelerated atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, presumably because of the associated hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.

In this case, the patient had prolonged undiagnosed severe hypothyroidism, which favored several risk factors for cardiac events. On the admission day, MI was expected to occur, precipitating myxedema coma in the patient. Consequently, hemodynamics may have deteriorated, leading to an episode of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Fortunately, the patient's general condition, including her hemodynamic status, improved remarkably with thyroid hormone replacement therapy regardless of the use of amiodarone for VT. Unfortunately, the patient's neurological dysfunction did not recover.

In conclusion, this case presents the clinical course of CPA caused by undiagnosed myxedema coma; this condition is characterized by unique findings on physical examination. Our findings are useful for the differential diagnosis of hypothyroidism, especially a diagnosis based on characteristic physical examination findings, in the emergency department.

Clinicians should be aware of the differential diagnosis of myxedema coma based on findings from physical examination and laboratory testing of thyroid function, and the treatment should be started immediately to prevent the occurrence of complications.

### Hyperammonemic coma – barking up the wrong tree [^113diAVY]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy and myxedema coma share clinical features: coma, ascites, anemia, impaired liver functions, and a "metabolic" electroencephalogram (EEG). Hyperammonemia, a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy, has also been described in hypothyroidism. Differentiation between the 2 conditions, recognition of their possible coexistence, and the consequent therapeutic implications are of utmost importance. We describe a case of an 82-year-old woman with a history of mild chronic liver disease who presented with hyperammonemic coma unresponsive to conventional therapy. Further investigation disclosed severe hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone replacement resulted in gain of consciousness and normalization of hyperammonemia. In patients with an elevated ammonia level, altered mental status, and liver disease, who do not have a clear inciting event for liver disease decompensation, overwhelming evidence of hepatic decompensation, or who do not respond to appropriate therapy for hepatic encephalopathy, hypothyroidism should be considered and evaluated.

### Sudden cardiac arrest associated with myxedema coma due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism: a case report [^115d54Gx]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Myxedema coma, which occurs due to hypothyroidism, is a rare and life-threatening condition. Some patients have hemodynamic dysfunction, which consequently leads to cardiac arrest. The rarity of this condition makes it difficult to determine the cause of cardiac arrest. It is important to diagnose myxedema coma based on clinical findings, including physical examination and laboratory parameters. We present a case of undiagnosed and untreated hypothyroidism that initially caused myxedema coma and then led to cardiac arrest.

Case Presentation

A 56-year-old woman who had no medical history was transferred to our hospital for the management of return of spontaneous circulation due to sudden cardiac arrest. Findings of laboratory tests revealed that she had hypothyroidism. On physical examination, she was found to have a puffy face, thin eyebrows, and severe systemic non-pitting edema. Therefore, the patient was clinically diagnosed with myxedema coma, which was the cause of cardiac arrest. She was treated with thyroid hormone and hydrocortisone, resulting in improvement in her general condition, except for the neurological dysfunction.

Conclusions

This case suggests that myxedema coma is caused by undiagnosed and untreated hypothyroidism, leading to sudden cardiac arrest. Our findings are useful in the differential diagnosis of hypothyroidism based on characteristic physical examination findings. Clinicians should be aware of the differential diagnosis of myxedema coma based on findings from physical examination and laboratory testing of thyroid function, and the treatment should be started immediately.

Adult hypothyroidism — scope, screening, and therapy emphasize that the guidelines primarily address ambulatory patients with biochemically confirmed primary hypothyroidism whose thyroid status has been stable for at least several weeks and do not deal with myxedema coma. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations but is not sufficient for assessing hospitalized patients or when central hypothyroidism is either present or suspected, and the standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine which must be tailored to the individual patient.

### Predictors of outcome in myxoedema coma: a study from a tertiary care centre [^112mZXZY]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence of secondary hypothyroidism in myxoedema coma has been reported to be 5% to 25%. In our study, 4 (18%) patients had secondary hypothyroidism and all had hypothyroid encephalopathy as a presenting manifestation of their pituitary disease. Due to the paucity of cases, none of the previous studies except one had compared the clinical parameters in primary and secondary hypothyroid patients with myxoedema coma. As expected, the myxoedematous manifestations were very subtle and these subjects had relatively higher T 4 levels as compared with patients with primary hypothyroidism as TSH-independent production of T 4 continues in patients with secondary hypothyroidism.

An appreciable difference in presenting manifestations, laboratory parameters, and outcome was observed in those who were defaulters as opposed to those who presented de novo as having myxoedema coma. However, this issue has not been examined in earlier studies. The defaulter patients had a lower mean heart rate and relatively lower serum T 4 and the majority of them required mechanical ventilation and had a higher mortality. They also had lower scores on GCS, comparable APACHE II scores, and showed better SOFA scores in comparison with the patients who were diagnosed as hypothyroid at the first presentation of myxoedema coma. This may be attributed to the fact that the non-compliant patients had absolute deficiency of thyroid hormones as compared with those presenting for the first time as having myxoedema coma but who possibly had borderline thyroid hormone reserve.

### Hypothyroidism: a review [^113Titvo]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hypothyroidism is a chronic endocrine disease associated with the deficiency of thyroxine and T3 thyroid hormones.
- **Pathophysiology**: Hypothyroidism is most frequently caused by a failure of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (99%). Other causes include the underproduction of TSH by the pituitary gland and deficiency of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism in the US is estimated at 300 per 100,000 population and 4,300 per 100,000 population, respectively. Hypothyroidism is 2–8 times more prevalent in women than men, and it's prevalence increases with age.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include weight gain, fatigue, proximal weakness, decreased concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, menstrual irregularities, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, and sensory neuropathy. A severe form of hypothyroidism-myxedema coma- presents with altered mental status, hypothermia, hyponatremia and bradycardia. The disease decreases productivity and QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypothyroidism is not associated with an increase in mortality. Treatment is well tolerated and results in improved QoL in most patients. However, untreated hypothyroidism leads to disease progression and ultimately, coma and death.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^116HBQYm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Thyroid Abnormalities

Amiodarone hydrochloride inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T3levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T3(rT3) in clinically euthyroid patients. Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause either hypothyroidism (reported in up to 10% of patients) or hyperthyroidism (occurring in about 2% of patients). Monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction.

Hyperthyroidism may induce arrhythmia breakthrough. If any new signs of arrhythmia appear, the possibility of hyperthyroidism should be considered. Antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers, temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The action of antithyroid drugs may be delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone hydrochloride-induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism may be primary or subsequent to resolution of preceding amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, sometimes fatal, have been reported in association with amiodarone therapy. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing amiodarone hydrochloride and thyroid hormone supplementation.

5.7 Bradycardia

Amiodarone hydrochloride causes symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest with suppression of escape foci in 2 to 4% of patients. The risk is increased by electrolytic disorders or use of concomitant antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Bradycardia may require a pacemaker for rate control.

Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, some requiring pacemaker insertion and at least one fatal, have been reported when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir were initiated in patients on amiodarone. Bradycardia generally occurred within hours to days, but in some cases presented up to 2 weeks after initiating antiviral treatment. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of antiviral treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Monitor heart rate in patients taking or recently discontinuing amiodarone when starting antiviral treatment [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

C. Noncardiovascular history — thyroid disorders: Permissible values include Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism, with on-page definitions. Hyperthyroidism is described as overactivity of the thyroid gland resulting in overproduction of thyroid hormone and increased metabolic rate with causes including diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland (Graves' disease), single nodule in the thyroid gland, and thyroiditis, and symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, heat intolerance, excessive sweating, diarrhea, tachycardia, insomnia, muscle weakness, and tremor. Hypothyroidism is defined as a condition in which the production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland is diminished, with signs and symptoms including low metabolic rate, tendency to weight gain, somnolence, and sometimes myxedema.

### Myxoedema coma in the setting of hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state [^117JzK2L]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Decompensated hypothyroidism is a rare endocrine emergency but a differential that should be considered in patients presenting critically unwell with systemic illness. We report a case of myxoedema coma in a woman presenting with respiratory failure, hypotension, hypothermia and a reduced level of consciousness, all of which are poor prognostic features in decompensated hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted to critical care for mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular support and treated with a combination of insulin, liothyronine and levothyroxine, making a good recovery. We wanted to highlight this case of myxoedema coma occurring in the context of a hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), as the former condition is normally associated with hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia and hypo-osmolality. Decompensated hypothyroidism should be considered in presentations of HHS as well as with other metabolic derangements, as delays in thyroid hormone replacement are associated with poorer outcomes. It has multisystem effects challenging its recognition and we discuss potential complications and their management.

### Chorea – an unusual manifestation in a woman recovering from myxedema coma [^111J4LFD]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of reversible chorea in a woman with myxedema coma.

Methods

We describe the clinical course, imaging findings, and laboratory test results of a patient who initially presented with myxedema coma and then developed reversible chorea upon treatment.

Results

A 33-year-old woman with a known history of primary hypothyroidism presented with a 3-week history of lethargy, progressing to a precipitous decline in consciousness that required intubation. Physical examination revealed concurrent hypothermia and bradycardia. Laboratory investigations demonstrated a thyrotropin concentration greater than 100 mIU/L, a free triiodothyronine concentration of 1.9 pg/mL, and a free thyroxine concentration of 0.24 ng/dL, but no other metabolic abnormalities. She was treated with intravenous levothyroxine therapy on the first 2 days of hospital admission (200 mcg and 250 mcg, respectively). On day 2, she was obeying commands and she was extubated. She began exhibiting choreiform movements. Thyroid function test results revealed a normal free thyroxine concentration (1.10 ng/dL), but an elevated thyrotropin concentration (40.98 mIU/L) and a low free triiodothyronine concentration (1.9 pg/mL). Findings from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of her brain and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Her regimen was transitioned to oral levothyroxine, 88 mcg daily, and by day 4, her choreiform movements ceased.

Conclusions

Neurologic manifestations of hypothyroidism include psychomotor slowing, memory deficits, and dementia, with myxedema coma at the extreme of this spectrum. Although chorea is a rare manifestation of hyperthyroidism, this is the first report of a patient with acquired, reversible choreiform movement disorder while still being severely hypothyroid and treated with levothyroxine.

### Predictors of outcome in myxoedema coma: a study from a tertiary care centre [^111GM93Y]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myxoedema coma is an uncommon and life-threatening form of long-standing, neglected, untreated hypothyroidism with physiological decompensation. This endocrine crisis usually occurs in elderly women and is precipitated by a secondary insult such as cold exposure, infection, drugs such as sedative-hypnotics, lithium overdoses, and associated systemic diseases. Clinically, it is characterised by lethargy, myxoedematous manifestation, and altered sensorium in the form of stupor, delirium, or coma. Due to widespread use of screening tests for thyroid dysfunctions and hence the early diagnosis even at the subclinical state, this entity has become rare in Western countries. In developing countries, recognition of this entity is hampered by its slow onset, lack of knowledge among physicians and patients, and absence of cost-effective guidelines to screen for subclinical thyroid diseases. Therefore, patients presenting with florid manifestations of the disease are not uncommon. The incidence of myxoedema coma in European countries is 0.22 per million per year; however, no such epidemiological data are available from the Indian subcontinent. Review of the literature suggests that most of the cases of myxoedema coma are isolated case reports or a handful of series comprising only a few patients. Myxoedema coma, if not appropriately treated, has been associated with progressive multi-organ dysfunction and mortality. The predictors of mortality modules used are Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. However, GCS and APACHE II score are assessed only at baseline and do not account for subsequent morbidity. On the contrary, SOFA score assesses the cumulative morbidity and mortality during hospital stay. The present study analysed the presentation and factors predicting outcome of the patients with myxoedema coma and tested the validity of various available outcome predictor models to define morbidity and mortality in these patients.

### Diagnosis of unrecognized primary overt hypothyroidism in the ED [^111FbEKm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims of the study were to evaluate the incidence of newly diagnosed primary overt hypothyroidism among adults admitted through the emergency department (ED) and to assess how previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism presents.

Methods

From July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2006, 56 adult patients were enrolled for further analysis.

Results

The incidence of newly diagnosed primary overt hypothyroidism among adults admitted through the ED is 0.1%. The mean age of the patients was 75.8 ± 12.8 years (range, 27–98 years). Most of our patients presented in the winter. Individual symptoms and signs were not sensitive. Drugs (13 patients, 23%), nongoitrogenous autoimmune thyroiditis (12 patients, 21%), and previous surgery or irradiation related (11 patients, 20%) are frequent causes of unrecognized hypothyroidism in this iodine-replete region. Only 21% of patients were admitted with a correct initial impression. Half of myxedema coma patients were missed during the initial ED stay. Thirty-three patients (59%) had cardiomegaly on chest x-ray receiving further echocardiography examination. Pericardial effusion was found in 18 patients. Of these, 7 patients had moderate to large pericardial effusion, but none had cardiac tamponade. Only 6 patients have depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (< 40%).

Conclusions

The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is often missed during the ED evaluation of patients at risk for this uncommon disease. Hypothyroidism should always be considered in patients who present with nonspecific symptoms suggestive of the disease, including weakness, cold intolerance, and alterations in mental status, and receive drugs impairing thyroid function or treatment of advanced head and neck cancer. In addition, patients with stable chronic heart failure or unexplained pericardial effusion warrant serum thyroid testing.

### Myxedema coma in a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism [^116oTVbc]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Myxedema coma is the extreme manifestation of hypothyroidism, typically seen in patients with severe biochemical hypothyroidism. Its occurrence in association with subclinical hypothyroidism is extremely unusual. We describe a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism who developed clinical manifestations of myxedema coma.

Summary

A 47-year-old woman presented to our endocrine clinic with complaints of fatigue and biochemical findings of subclinical hypothyroidism. She was started on treatment with thyroxine (T4) but remained unwell and was later admitted to hospital with hormone profile showing persisting subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated thyrotropin and normal free T4 [FT4] and free triiodothyronine [FT3]): FT4 10.7pmol/L (reference range 10.3–24.5), FT3 2.7pmol/L (reference range 2.67–7.03), and thyrotropin 6.09mU/L (reference range 0.4–4.0). She subsequently developed hypothermia (temperature 33.2°C), circulatory collapse, and coma. Biochemical profile showed hyponatremia, elevated creatinine phosphokinase, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. An echocardiogram revealed a moderate-sized pericardial effusion. We diagnosed myxedema coma and started treatment with intravenous T3. She responded dramatically with improvement in level of consciousness and normalization of metabolic parameters. We found no explanation other than hypothyroidism to account for the presentation. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests excluded adrenal insufficiency, and serum gonadotrophins were within the normal reference range. FT4 estimation by equilibrium dialysis excluded analytical interference, and molecular analysis for the thyroid hormone receptor β gene associated with thyroid hormone resistance was negative.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of myxedema coma in a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism. The reason for normal thyroid hormone levels is unclear but may reflect deviation from a higher pre-morbid set-point. The case highlights the importance of careful clinical evaluation in patients with disparate clinical and laboratory findings.
