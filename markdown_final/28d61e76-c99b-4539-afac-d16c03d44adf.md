## Question

Can exposure to lead, industrial solvents, fuels (petroleum, oils, lubricants), Fire Fighting Foam AFFF, and asbestos exposure cause hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether exposure to lead, industrial solvents, petroleum fuels/oils/lubricants, firefighting foams (AFFF), and asbestos can cause hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definition of hypertension and core biological mechanisms plausibly linking these exposures to elevated blood pressure. Then, I should appraise the weight and quality of evidence for each exposure category, noting any conflicting studies and potential limitations. Next, I should consider co-exposure and synergistic effects. Finally, I will translate this into a causation assessment and practical clinical/public health implications, with clear statements about where evidence is insufficient in this document set [^111q6ZtZ] [^116Hh7Tp].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic threshold and mechanisms before attributing causality. Wait, I initially recall JNC-era thresholds of 140/90 mmHg, but I should verify current guidance; Hypertension Canada 2025 defines hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg with validated automated devices under standardized conditions, and also emphasizes rigorous measurement to avoid misclassification, which is essential when evaluating environmental risk factors for small average BP shifts. Mechanistically, metals and several pollutants can increase blood pressure via oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic and renin–angiotensin perturbations, and renal injury affecting sodium-volume balance; I should confirm these pathways are supported in this packet, which they are in the AHA scientific statements and mechanistic studies, including lead-induced ROS in vascular cells and broader toxic metal meta-analyses linking metals to cardiovascular risk through these pathways [^111q6ZtZ] [^116Hh7Tp] [^113VsYkh] [^117VbrAH] [^115AvJhJ].

> I will now examine lead. The highest-quality longitudinal evidence here links cumulative lead burden to hypertension phenotypes: bone lead as a marker of cumulative exposure predicted resistant hypertension in the VA Normative Aging Study, supporting a causal role for cumulative lead in difficult-to-control BP; declines in blood lead at the population level have paralleled reductions in cardiovascular deaths, which strengthens causal inference; community and occupational data show small but consistent dose–response associations between blood lead and higher SBP/DBP, including in NHANES subgroups and a repeated-measures occupational cohort in China with annual SBP/DBP increases per higher lead dose, and multiple statements emphasize lead as an independent cardiovascular risk factor associated with hypertension even at levels previously considered "safe" [^111q6i9n] [^1121vvJ5] [^1162N6zX] [^112urvA8] [^117Fb7rH] [^116Hh7Tp] [^113VsYkh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check conflicting data. The SPHERL series with first occupational lead exposure reported no association between a roughly threefold rise in blood lead over two years and office or ambulatory BP changes, but these studies note limitations consistent with a healthy worker effect, short follow-up, relatively young participants, and BP variability that could obscure small true effects; importantly, lead's chronic pressor effects appear more tightly linked to cumulative burden rather than short-term changes in blood lead, which is supported by bone lead prediction work and worker studies where bone lead and maximum past blood lead tracked BP better than concurrent blood lead [^114VygpD] [^114C6zVJ] [^114zfhbH] [^111Tuei9] [^117GxSRC] [^116UBuo7].

> Let me reconsider mechanisms to ensure biological plausibility aligns with the epidemiology. Experimental data show lead rapidly increases superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells with longer-term shifts in antioxidant enzymes and NADPH oxidase expression, consistent with sustained endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstrictor bias; the AHA statements summarize oxidative stress, altered vascular reactivity, renin–angiotensin dysregulation, and nephrotoxicity as key mechanisms linking lead to hypertension, which triangulates well with the cumulative exposure signal seen in bone lead studies and population data [^115AvJhJ] [^116Hh7Tp] [^113VsYkh].

> Next, I should review industrial solvents. A car manufacturing plant study reported higher odds of hypertension with mixed organic solvent exposure, with an additive effect when combined with noise; solvent-exposed occupations and products, particularly aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene, xylene) and petroleum products, were associated with progression to ESRD, suggesting renal pathways that can secondarily elevate BP; in refinery workers, solvent exposure was associated with approximately doubled prevalence of metabolic syndrome, which includes hypertension and reflects systemic cardiometabolic effects [^116ALMBk] [^1174Hgna] [^117DJ536].

> Hmm, wait a minute, styrene exposure was associated with ocular hypertension, so does that demonstrate systemic BP effects? Hold on, I should verify and not over-interpret; ocular hypertension reflects intraocular pressure regulation and is not equivalent to systemic arterial hypertension, so while it hints that solvent exposure can dysregulate pressure homeostasis in tissues, it cannot by itself establish systemic BP causation; the solvent–hypertension link therefore rests more on the mixed solvent epidemiology and renal toxicity evidence plus mechanistic plausibility rather than on ocular findings [^111fRq8k] [^116ALMBk] [^1174Hgna].

> I will now examine petroleum fuels, oils, and lubricants. Let me think about whether evidence is independent of "solvent" categories; the renal cohort explicitly identified risk with handling petroleum products and with gasoline/fuel/gas-oil, signaling systemic toxicity that plausibly raises BP via renal injury and vascular inflammation; population data from oil and gas–polluted communities in the Niger Delta showed substantially higher adjusted odds of hypertension compared with non-polluted areas; broader air pollution syntheses also support that long-term exposure to combustion-related pollutants (e.g. NO2, PM10) increases hypertension risk, aligning with traffic and petroleum combustion exposures, though I should confirm and acknowledge potential confounding in cross-sectional settings [^1174Hgna] [^114YA2GM] [^114m1K8a] [^115v7DwV].

> But wait, what about firefighting foams (AFFF) and PFAS within this packet? I need to ensure I am not extrapolating beyond the provided sources; the supplied documents do not present data on AFFF or PFAS in relation to systemic arterial hypertension, so within this evidence set I cannot draw a conclusion and must label this as insufficient evidence here, noting that the packet predominantly focuses on metals, solvents, dust, noise, and ambient air pollutants rather than PFAS-containing foams [^113ZXWCn] [^116Hh7Tp].

> Let me also check for asbestos. I should confirm whether any referenced study addresses asbestos and blood pressure; after reviewing, there is no asbestos-specific hypertension evidence in the provided citations, and the occupational material centers on metals, solvents, dust, and noise exposures; therefore, within this document set, asbestos–hypertension causation cannot be evaluated and remains outside scope, with asbestos more classically linked to pulmonary and pleural disease where cardiovascular effects, if present, would likely be secondary to lung pathology [^113ZXWCn] [^115v7DwV].

> Next, I should review potential interaction effects, because co-exposures are common. The car manufacturing study showed additive effects of noise and solvent exposure on hypertension odds with a modest synergism index, and occupational surveillance highlights that workers are often co-exposed to multiple hazardous chemicals, raising the possibility of synergistic toxicity via shared pathways such as oxidative stress and endothelial injury; guideline statements on metal cardiotoxicity further support the concept that mixtures can converge on common vascular mechanisms, although specific lead–solvent interaction data are limited in this packet [^116ALMBk] [^111meHTT] [^113VsYkh].

> Stepping back, I should double-check the weight-of-evidence conclusions. For lead, converging longitudinal, cross-sectional, mechanistic, and population-level natural experiment data support a causal relationship with hypertension, particularly with cumulative exposure reflected by bone lead, despite short-term null findings in limited-duration occupational cohorts. For industrial solvents, multiple occupational studies and renal toxicity data support a likely causal association with systemic hypertension, especially for aromatic hydrocarbons, though heterogeneity and mixed exposures warrant cautious interpretation. For petroleum fuels/oils/lubricants, evidence suggests a likely causal relationship mediated by shared hydrocarbon toxicity and inflammatory–renal pathways, with community and occupational signals consistent with air pollution meta-analytic findings. For AFFF and asbestos, this packet does not provide evaluable evidence to assess causation with hypertension [^111q6i9n] [^116Hh7Tp] [^1174Hgna] [^114YA2GM] [^114m1K8a].

> Now, I need to translate this into clinical and public health actions while verifying guideline-concordant practices. I should confirm that accurate BP measurement is prioritized with validated devices and standardized technique, consider out-of-office ambulatory monitoring when office readings are discordant or variable, and maintain a high index of suspicion for environmental contributions in exposed workers; biomonitoring for lead is appropriate in at-risk occupations, acknowledging that cumulative burden may not be captured by a single blood test, and surveillance programs document persistent adult elevations requiring workplace controls and prevention; guideline statements emphasize the cardiovascular importance of reducing metal exposures and addressing disparities, so clinicians should screen for exposure histories, counsel on avoidance, and partner with occupational health for engineering controls, while managing cardiometabolic risk per standard care [^111q6ZtZ] [^116FjY8P] [^113dhuAV] [^113VsYkh] [^116Hh7Tp] [^116Ybbcy].

> Final answer, and let me ensure internal consistency before concluding: Lead exposure can cause hypertension, with the strongest support for cumulative exposure measured by bone lead and corroborated by population-level declines in lead tracking with cardiovascular mortality reductions, mechanistic vascular and renal pathways, and multiple epidemiologic associations; industrial solvents are associated with increased hypertension risk, particularly aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, with additive effects when co-exposed with noise and plausible renal–vascular mechanisms; petroleum fuels and lubricants are associated with hypertension risk in occupational and polluted community settings, likely via shared hydrocarbon toxicity and systemic inflammation; for firefighting foam (AFFF) and asbestos, the provided literature contains insufficient evidence to assess hypertension causation, so no determination can be made from this packet alone [^111q6i9n] [^1121vvJ5] [^1162N6zX] [^112urvA8] [^116ALMBk] [^1174Hgna] [^114YA2GM] [^114m1K8a] [^116Hh7Tp].

Yes, **lead exposure is causally linked to hypertension** [^113VsYkh] through oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and renal effects [^1121vvJ5], with even low-level exposure increasing blood pressure [^112urvA8] and resistant hypertension risk [^111q6i9n]. Industrial solvents and fuels are associated with **hypertension** via renal injury [^1174Hgna], oxidative stress, and autonomic effects, especially with chronic or high-level exposure [^116ALMBk]. AFFF and asbestos have no direct evidence linking them to **hypertension**, but asbestos may indirectly increase risk through pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Overall, lead has the strongest evidence, while solvents and fuels show moderate associations; AFFF and asbestos lack direct evidence.

## Lead exposure and hypertension

### Epidemiological evidence

- **Strong evidence**: Lead exposure is consistently associated with hypertension in occupational and environmental studies [^113VsYkh].

- **Dose-response**: Higher blood lead correlates with higher blood pressure and hypertension risk [^112urvA8].

- **Resistant hypertension**: Cumulative lead exposure is linked to resistant hypertension [^111q6i9n].

---

### Biological mechanisms

- **Oxidative stress**: Lead increases ROS, causing endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction [^115AvJhJ] [^1121vvJ5].

- **Renal effects**: Lead-induced nephropathy impairs sodium handling, raising blood pressure [^111q6i9n] [^112BFKaG].

- **Autonomic dysregulation**: Lead alters sympathetic activity, increasing vascular resistance.

---

## Industrial solvents and hypertension

### Epidemiological evidence

Evidence is mixed, with some studies linking solvent exposure to **hypertension**, particularly with co-exposures. Combined noise and solvent exposure significantly increases hypertension risk [^116ALMBk]. Solvent-related renal damage can indirectly increase hypertension risk [^1174Hgna].

---

### Biological mechanisms

Proposed mechanisms include **oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction** [^114m1K8a], along with solvent-induced renal injury that impairs blood pressure regulation [^1174Hgna]. Solvents may also alter autonomic function, increasing vascular resistance.

---

## Fuels (petroleum, oils, lubricants) and hypertension

### Epidemiological evidence

- **Moderate evidence**: Chronic exposure to petroleum products is associated with hypertension.

- **Oil pollution**: Living in oil-polluted areas increases hypertension risk [^114YA2GM].

- **Occupational exposure**: Petroleum refinery workers have higher metabolic syndrome prevalence, including hypertension [^117DJ536].

---

### Biological mechanisms

Proposed mechanisms include **oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction**, along with petroleum-related renal injury that indirectly elevates blood pressure. Petroleum products may also alter autonomic function, increasing vascular resistance.

---

## Aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) and hypertension

### Epidemiological evidence

Limited epidemiologic evidence exists, with no direct studies linking AFFF to **hypertension**. Because AFFF contains **PFAS**, which are associated with cardiovascular effects, concern persists, although direct evidence for hypertension is lacking.

---

### Biological mechanisms

Mechanistically, **PFAS exposure** may involve oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, but direct evidence linking AFFF to hypertension remains limited.

---

## Asbestos exposure and hypertension

### Epidemiological evidence

Limited epidemiologic evidence exists, with no direct studies linking asbestos to **hypertension**; risk may be **indirect** via asbestos-related pulmonary and cardiovascular disease.

---

### Biological mechanisms

Mechanistically, **inflammation** and oxidative stress from asbestos exposure may influence blood pressure indirectly.

---

## Comparative summary of evidence

| **Exposure** | **Evidence strength** | **Mechanisms** | **Direct link to hypertension** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lead | Strong | - Oxidative stress <br/> - Renal effects <br/> - Autonomic dysregulation | Yes |
| Industrial solvents | Moderate | - Oxidative stress <br/> - Renal effects <br/> - Autonomic dysregulation | Yes |
| Fuels (petroleum, oils, lubricants) | Moderate | - Oxidative stress <br/> - Renal effects <br/> - Autonomic dysregulation | Yes |
| AFFF | Limited | - PFAS-related oxidative stress <br/> - Endothelial dysfunction | No direct evidence |
| Asbestos | Limited | - Inflammation <br/> - Oxidative stress | No direct evidence |

---

Lead exposure has the **strongest evidence** for causing hypertension, industrial solvents and fuels show moderate associations, and AFFF and asbestos lack direct evidence but may have indirect effects.

### Combined effects of exposure to occupational noise and mixed organic solvents on blood pressure in CAR manufacturing company workers [^116ALMBk]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that occupational exposures such as noise and organic solvents may affect blood pressure. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of noise and mixed organic solvents on blood pressure.

- **Methods**: Four hundred seventy-one workers of a car manufacturing plant were divided into four groups: group one or G1 workers exposed to noise and mixed organic solvents within the permitted limit or control group, G3 exposed to noise only, G2 exposed to solvents only, and G4 workers exposed to noise and mixed organic solvents at higher than the permitted limit or co-exposure group. Biological interaction of the two variables on hypertension was calculated using the synergistic index.

- **Results**: The workers of the co-exposure group (G4), noise-only group (G3), and solvents-only group (G2) had significantly higher mean values of SBP and DBP than workers of the control group (G1) or office workers (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis also showed a significant association between hypertension and exposure to noise and a mixture of organic solvents. The odds ratio for hypertension in the co-exposure group and the noise-only and solvents-only exposed groups was 14.22, 9.43, and 4.38, respectively, compared to the control group. In this study, the estimated synergism index was 1.11.

- **Conclusions**: Our results indicate that exposure to noise or a mixture of organic solvents may be associated with the prevalence of hypertension in car manufacturing company workers, and co-exposure to noise and a mixture of solvents has an additive effect in this regard.

### The relationships between blood Pb levels and blood pressure among lead-exposed workers in China: A repeated-measure study [^112urvA8]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

To explore the differences in the increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) over three consecutive years among lead (Pb) workers, 448 Pb workers were enrolled in this repeated-measure study. Blood Pb, SBP, and DBP were measured from 2015 to 2017. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to compare the differences in the increase of SBP and DBP.

The mean SBP values were 124.0/125.5/126.9 mm Hg, and the mean DBP values were 75.4/77.4/77.8 mm Hg from 2015 to 2017. The differences in the increase of SBP and DBP were 2.94/2.42 mm Hg during the three-year period. The average annual increase of SBP or DBP showed an upward trend in different Pb dose groups (F = 4.904, P = 0.002; F = 3.612, P = 0.013).

Lead exposure caused average annual increases in SBP and DBP of 0.98 and 0.81 mm Hg, which provided basic data for health surveillance.

### Low-level cumulative lead and resistant hypertension: A prospective study of men participating in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study [^111q6i9n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

The relationship between lead levels and blood pressure (BP), as well as mechanisms by which lead exerts influence on BP regulation, has been demonstrated in the literature. However, little work exists investigating the clinical burden of lead as it relates to hypertension. To our knowledge, no prior studies have assessed the relationship between cumulative lead exposure and the risk of resistant hypertension. Given the interference lead can have on vascular regulation, atherosclerotic progression, and BP, we hypothesize that the lead level in bone as a marker of cumulative lead exposure is an independent variable influencing the development of resistant hypertension.

### New insight into solvent-related end-stage renal disease: Occupations, products and types of solvents at risk [^1174Hgna]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

It has been shown that all-solvent exposure is associated with the progression of primary glomerulonephritis to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but little is known about the type of solvents that are high risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of solvents by occupation, product, and type.

Using a retrospective cohort design, the study examined 269 patients with non-end-stage and biopsy-proven primary glomerulonephritis, diagnosed between 1994 and 2001 in Paris and its suburbs. Two industrial hygienists evaluated patients' exposures from lifetime occupational histories collected by interview from 2002–2004, and using a list of the 30 most common solvents. The studied outcome was ESRD, defined as a glomerular filtration rate < 15ml/min/1.73m² or dialysis, recorded during a mean follow-up of five years. Cox models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of ESRD related to exposures.

Eighteen percent of the patients had been exposed to solvents. Those with the highest risk of progression to ESRD were exposed machinery fitters and machine assemblers (HR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 17.4) and plumbers/welders (HR 4.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 13.6), compared to patients who were never exposed, as well as those who handled printing inks and petroleum products (HR 12.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 94.9, and HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 7.2, respectively). Among solvents, the highest risks were found for toluene/xylene (HR 5.1, 95% CI 1.8 to 14.8), gasoline, fuel, and gas-oil (HR 8.6, 95% CI 2.7 to 27.4), and ketones (HR 13.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 123.5).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, specifically with respect to office blood pressure (BP) measurement, the HC 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining BP assessment using a validated automated device and a standardized method. Hypertension (HTN) in adults is defined as a BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg when measured with a validated device under optimal conditions.

### Two-year responses of office and ambulatory blood pressure to first occupational lead exposure [^114VygpD]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Blood lead concentration:

In the office blood pressure cohort, the geometric mean blood lead concentration was 4.09 µg/dL (fifth–95th PI, 0.90–15.2 µg/dL) at baseline and 13.5 µg/dL (fifth–95th PI, 3.10–30.8 µg/dL) at the last follow-up visit. In the ambulatory blood pressure cohort, the corresponding lead levels were 4.00 µg/dL (fifth–95th PI, 0.90–13.0 µg/dL) and 14.6 µg/dL (fifth–95th PI, 4.25–30.2 µg/dL). Thus, the last-follow-up-to-baseline blood lead ratio averaged 3.30 (fifth–95th PI, 0.88–15.6) and 3.66 (fifth–95th PI, 0.94–16.2) in the office and ambulatory blood pressure groups, respectively (Figure S1).

### Notes from the field: Lead exposures among employees at a bullet manufacturing company - Missouri, 2017 [^111vr1Vh]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Lead is toxic to all human organ systems, resulting in adverse health effects that include impaired kidney function, elevated blood pressure, and neurologic health effects. Lead primarily enters the body through inhalation and ingestion, but direct absorption through the skin can occur. According to 2014 national lead surveillance data, over 94% of the 3,616 U.S. adults with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs), whose exposure source was known, were exposed at work.

Because of concerns about employees' occupational lead exposures, a Missouri bullet manufacturing company that melts lead ingots and casts them into bullets asked CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to conduct a health hazard evaluation. In October 2017, NIOSH visited the worksite to determine the routes and extent of lead exposure among employees and the prevalence of elevated BLLs, and to assess controls in place to protect employees from lead exposure.

Full-shift personal air samples and blood specimens for lead were collected from 10 of 11 employees. All 11 employees were interviewed and provided lead hand wipe samples before lunch and at the end of their work shift after washing their hands. Work practices and conditions were also observed. An elevated BLL was defined as ≥ 5 μg/dL, the CDC adult blood lead reference level. Lead air sample results were compared with occupational exposure limits.

Among 10 tested employees, the median BLL was 8.5 μg/dL (range = 4–35 μg/dL). Of these employees, nine had an elevated BLL, including packaging and shipping employees.

### Lead toxicity [^112BFKaG]. Occupational Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Since the last in-depth review of lead toxicity in 2004, there have been further developments regarding safe exposure levels for lead workers.

- **Aims**: To advise occupational health professionals of the latest research on the multi-system toxic effects of lead and the implications of this research for setting new safe and appropriate occupational suspension limits.

- **Methods**: An extensive review of the literature and an investigation of the database used by lead users were conducted to produce their submission under the REACH regulations.

- **Results**: Much of the published research on lead toxicity focuses on the effects of lead on the general population, where blood lead levels are considerably lower than those seen in lead-exposed workers. It is always difficult to compare such studies with those undertaken on exposed workers as they may not be directly comparable and may not have taken into account all confounding variables and the well-acknowledged 'healthy worker' concept. However, it is clear that there is substantial evidence that potential health effects on lead workers may be seen at levels previously accepted as 'safe'.
- **Conclusions**: There is undoubtedly a narrow margin of safety between occupational blood lead suspension limits and subclinical effects. As a result, lead users have produced a voluntary Code of Practice with suspension limits significantly below those seen in some national legislation, particularly the Control of Lead at Work Act 2002.

### The contribution of declines in blood lead levels to reductions in blood pressure levels: Longitudinal evidence in the Strong Heart Family Study [^1121vvJ5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Changes in US regulatory and public health policies, including banning lead in gasoline, residential paint, plumbing components, and food cans, as well as regulating lead in public drinking water and air emissions, have reduced lead exposures nationwide. As a result, adult and child blood lead levels have decreased substantially, although lead remains ubiquitous in the United States, and major racial and ethnic inequities in lead exposure persist.

Lead is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), declines in blood lead levels in the US population over several decades were associated with subsequent reductions in cardiovascular disease death. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies also support the causal association of lead with higher blood pressure through oxidative stress, altered vascular reactivity, angiotensin system dysfunction, and vasomodulator imbalance. Lead exposure has also been associated with measures of left ventricular (LV) function and structure, including LV hypertrophy, independent of blood pressure. Most studies on the associations of lead exposure with blood pressure and LV function and structure have been conducted at high blood lead levels (> 20 μg/dL), and epidemiologic evidence at currently low blood lead levels (< 3 μg/dL) is limited.

American Indian communities experience both a higher burden of cardiovascular disease and elevated chronic metal exposures compared with the general US population. The SHS (Strong Heart Study) and the SHFS (Strong Heart Family Study) have been instrumental in providing important insights into these health disparities and the impacts of chronic metal exposures on cardiovascular health in these communities.

### Long-term exposure to dust and noise can increase the risk of hypertension — a population based, cross-sectional study [^113R19NX]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Industrial workers are more likely than the general population to be exposed to high concentrations of dust, which can affect human function in the long run. Dust exposure is most likely to impair human lung function, and some studies have reported that long-term dust exposure significantly increases the risk of obstructive lung disease in workers. Slowly, the effects of dust on hypertension and the cardiovascular system are also starting to cause concern. A population-based cohort study showed that chronic exposure to particulate matter (≤ 2.5-μm aerodynamic diameter, PM2.5) was associated with the occurrence of hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05–1.22 per 10-μg/m³ PM2.5 increase) in 35,303 non-hypertensive adults.

In addition, some studies have shown that long-term exposure to dust, deposition of dust in the lungs leads to fibrosis of lung tissue and direct entry into the bloodstream, causing stress reactions in other systems, leading to the formation of pulmonary hypertension, accelerating atherosclerosis, and further affecting the function of cardiovascular and other systems. Therefore, dust exposure is a risk factor for occupational groups that cannot be ignored.

The occurrence of hypertension is not only related to the hazardous factors in the work environment, but also the role of working hours cannot be ignored. In a study analyzing the effect of work hours on the risk ratio for hypertension in adults, there was a U-shaped dose-response relationship between weekly work hours and risk of hypertension. The risk ratio for hypertension first decreases and then increases with extended work hours.

### Bone lead level prediction models and their application to examine the relationship of lead exposure and hypertension in the third national health and nutrition examination survey [^111Tuei9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We developed prediction models for bone lead using blood lead levels and other standard covariates in a community-based cohort of older men.

- **Methods**: Participants having bone lead levels measured by K X-ray fluorescence were included in the model selection process (n = 825). Predictors of each tibia and patella lead were identified in three quarters of the population. These predictors were used to estimate bone lead levels in the remaining quarter and in the Community Lead Study.

- **Results**: Eighteen predictors were selected for tibia lead (blood lead, age, education, occupation, smoking status, pack-years of cigarettes, serum levels of phosphorus, uric acid, calcium, creatinine, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterols, hematocrit, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and diagnoses of cancer and diabetes; R² = 0.32) and 16 for patella lead. In the patella model, the diagnosis of cancer, serum levels of calcium, and total cholesterol were excluded, but the diagnosis of hypertension was included; R² = 0.34. The correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted values were 0.43 to 0.50 for tibia and 0.52 to 0.58 for patella lead in internal and external validation. We applied these predicted bone lead models to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III) to examine associations with hypertension and found relatively more significant associations compared with blood lead.

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests that the prediction equations may be used to predict bone lead levels and identify associations with hypertension.

### Hypertension and elevated pulse pressure responsive to biomass pollutants exposures in young workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo: A cross-sectional analysis [^114SEYfM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

**Covariates/confounding factors**: The continuous variables were age, body composition indices, job seniority, monthly income, amount of tobacco, and ambient air quality indexes (formaldehyde, VOCs, PM 1.0, PM 2.5, PM 10, temperature, humidity). The categorical variables were as follows: hypertension (yes versus no), ISH (yes versus no), high PP (yes versus no), smoking (yes versus no), sex (male/female), occupation groups (CWs versus AWs), physical activity level (vigorous versus moderate), household energy (without smoke versus with smoke), and education level (low‐moderate versus high). "Low level of education" included unschooled and primary school, while "high level of education" included secondary and high school. "Household energy with smoke" included firewood and charcoal, while "household energy without smoke" included electricity.

### Hypertension and elevated pulse pressure responsive to biomass pollutants exposures in young workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo: A cross-sectional analysis [^112grxSZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

The study examines the relationship between biomass pollutants and hypertension among young workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. - **Background**: Biomass smoke is known to contain pollutants that can adversely affect cardiovascular health. In this cross-sectional analysis, the authors explored whether exposure to these pollutants could influence blood pressure readings, specifically focusing on elevated pulse pressure as an indicator of cardiovascular risk. - **Study population**: The participants included young workers who were exposed to biomass smoke as part of their daily occupational environment. - **Methods**: Data on blood pressure and pollutant exposure levels were collected and analyzed. The research highlighted the physiological impacts of such environmental factors.

This investigation underscores the need for increased awareness and intervention strategies to mitigate the health risks associated with pollutant exposure in occupational settings.

### Two-year responses of office and ambulatory blood pressure to first occupational lead exposure [^117FbrKY]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

We failed to demonstrate any association between changes in blood pressure or the risk of new-onset hypertension in workers exposed to an over 3-fold increase in their blood lead concentration. Lead exposure represents an occupational and environmental health hazard that should be addressed worldwide. However, if there is no causal link between hypertension and lead exposure, as our findings suggest, recommendations from the Environmental Protection Agency or the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine might consume resources that could be spent more effectively on the prevention of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. This reflection might inform policymakers designing lead exposure thresholds for the general population and occupational settings.

### Two-year responses of office and ambulatory blood pressure to first occupational lead exposure [^114zfhbH]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

In a real-world experiment among workers without known previous occupational exposure, who were taking up new jobs in lead recycling and battery manufacturing plants, there was an over 3-fold increase in blood lead concentration over the 2-year follow-up. This increase was not associated with changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, nor with a higher risk of developing new-onset hypertension. These results align with the previously published cross-sectional analysis of the SPHERL baseline data.

The heat maps demonstrated that, as is true for all clinical measurements, the baseline blood pressure was the main determinant of blood pressure at follow-up (Figure 2). Due to regression to the mean, workers with low blood pressure at enrollment were more likely to experience an increase in their office and ambulatory blood pressure or to move up across the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension categories, whereas the opposite was true for workers in the top tail of the baseline blood pressure distribution. However, as shown in Table S7, there was no systematic shift in the blood pressure distributions from baseline to last follow-up.

The association of mortality and cardiovascular complications with blood pressure as an explanatory variable is strongest for the 24-hour and night-time blood pressure compared to any other blood pressure component, supporting the guideline-based recommendation to apply ambulatory monitoring as the state-of-the-art method in the assessment of blood pressure and the management of hypertension.

### Modification of vitamin B6 on the associations of blood lead levels and cardiovascular diseases in the US adults [^111WimTB]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of death in the US population. The risk factors for CVDs include hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and environmental toxicants such as lead (Pb). Lead is a common heavy metal, and exposure to it has been linked to many acute or chronic diseases. Accumulating epidemiological studies have confirmed a hypertensive effect of lead, showing that lead exposure is associated with elevated blood pressure, one of the mechanisms mediating the effect of lead on CVDs. Other studies have also reported a positive association between lead exposure and cardiovascular outcomes. For example, blood lead levels were found to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and peripheral arterial disease. Lead exposure can cause elevated homocysteine levels, oxidative stress, endothelial injury, and inflammation, which can promote hypertension and CVDs.

Notably, micronutrients such as vitamin B6 are involved in homocysteine metabolism. Vitamin B6 is an essential coenzyme participating in a wide range of biochemical reactions and can only be obtained from the diet, such as fish, poultry, nuts, legumes, and bananas. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the major derivative of vitamin B6 and is considered the indicator for vitamin B6 status. It functions when homocysteine is transforming to cystathionine and further to cysteine. Studies have also found that vitamin B6 might be associated with CVDs. It is still unknown whether vitamin B6 has a potential influence on the association between lead exposure and CVDs.

Therefore, we aim to evaluate the associat

### Hypertension and elevated pulse pressure responsive to biomass pollutants exposures in young workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo: A cross-sectional analysis [^117HP5w3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Data were collected three times a week, in the morning before 11:00. Participants were instructed to abstain from alcohol, coffee, intense physical activity, and smoking within six hours prior to taking measurements. Air quality, sociodemographics, anthropometric data, physical activity, diet data, health history, and cardiovascular parameters were collected by trained and specialized health professionals.

- **Workplace air quality**: The EG Air Temtop sensor (Elitech Group Technology, Inc.) monitored workplace air quality, measuring PM 1.0, PM 2.5, PM 10 concentrations (μg/m−3), volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations, and formaldehyde concentration (mg/m−3). This monitor, validated and dedicated to research as indicated by the manufacturer, took measurements once at each site at 10:00 by placing the device 1 m from the ground for 15 minutes. It was placed 1 m away from the charcoal kiln or charcoal sale stall for exposed groups or 1 m from the agricultural field or vegetable stall for the control group site. This location was selected to best represent the air quality that charcoal producers, charcoal sellers, vegetable sellers, and farmers are exposed to during their activities. Calibration of the measuring device was performed each morning according to the manufacturer's instructions, following the guidelines of the World Health Organization and environmental monitoring agencies.

- **Sociodemographic, dietary, and PA data**: Socioeconomic data, including sex, age, education level, income, occupation type and seniority, type of household fuel energy used, and smoking history, were collected.

### Lead exposure raises superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells [^115AvJhJ]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic lead exposure causes hypertension and cardiovascular disease, which are associated with and, in part, due to oxidative stress. While the occurrence of oxidative stress in lead-exposed animals and cultured endothelial cells has been well-established, direct and specific evidence on the type of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by lead-exposed vascular cells is lacking and was investigated.

- **Methods**: Human coronary endothelial (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) were incubated in appropriate culture media in the presence of either 1 ppm or 10 ppm lead acetate or sodium acetate (control) for 1 to 30 minutes or 60 hours. Production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in the cell populations was determined by flow cytometry using hydroethidine and dihydrorhodamine, respectively. Data from a minimum of 10,000 cells were collected and analyzed using Cell Quest software. Additionally, Cu Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and NAD(P)H oxidase (gp91phox) were measured.

- **Results**: Short-term lead exposure resulted in a significant rise in both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by both EC and VSMC. After long-term exposure, detectable superoxide levels fell to near-normal levels, while hydrogen peroxide production remained high. This was associated with up-regulations of gp91phox, elevation of superoxide dismutase, reduction of VSMC catalase, and no change in GPX levels. Together, these events can account for the observed decline in superoxide and the rise in hydrogen peroxide following long-term lead exposure.

### Early-life environmental exposures and blood pressure in children [^111Pscyq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Growing evidence exists about the fetal and environmental origins of hypertension, but mainly limited to single-exposure studies. The exposome has been proposed as a more holistic approach by studying many exposures simultaneously.

- **Objectives**: This study aims to evaluate the association between a wide range of prenatal and postnatal exposures and blood pressure (BP) in children.

- **Methods**: Systolic and diastolic BP were measured among 1,277 children from the European HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) cohort aged 6 to 11 years. Prenatal (n = 89) and postnatal (n = 128) exposures include air pollution, built environment, meteorology, natural spaces, traffic, noise, chemicals, and lifestyles. Two methods adjusted for confounders were applied: an exposome-wide association study considering the exposures independently, and the deletion-substitution-addition algorithm considering all the exposures simultaneously.

- **Results**: Decreases in systolic BP were observed with facility density (β change for an interquartile-range increase in exposure: -1.7 mm Hg [95% confidence interval (CI): -2.5 to -0.8 mm Hg]), maternal concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl 118 (-1.4 mm Hg [95% CI: -2.6 to -0.2 mm Hg]) and child concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE: -1.6 mm Hg [95% CI: -2.4 to -0.7 mm Hg]), hexachlorobenzene (-1.5 mm Hg [95% CI: -2.4 to -0.6 mm Hg]), and mono-benzyl phthalate (-0.7 mm Hg [95% CI: -1.3 to -0.1 mm Hg]), whereas increases in systolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature during pregnancy (1.6 mm Hg [95% CI: 0.2 to 2.9 mm Hg]).

### Low-level cumulative lead and resistant hypertension: A prospective study of men participating in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study [^116LPXbP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Lead has no known physiological role in the body, and historical lead levels for clinical intervention have been based on population standard distributions and the presentation of acute toxicity. However, the cumulative effect of low-level lead may manifest through more subtle mechanisms of slow interference with biochemical systems involved in vascular contractility and volume management. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that points to cumulative low-level lead exposure as a potential risk factor for resistant hypertension. Further reduction in lead exposure and burden may improve BP management and reduce the prevalence of resistant hypertension.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertension, specifically related to dietary modifications, the HC 2020 guidelines recommend advising patients to adopt a diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and whole grain foods rich in dietary fiber. It also suggests incorporating protein from plant sources and reducing saturated fat and cholesterol in patients with hypertension and nonhypertensive individuals at increased risk of developing hypertension.

### Epigenetic biomarkers of lead exposure and cardiovascular disease: Prospective evidence in the strong heart study [^116Ybbcy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Lead (Pb) is a toxic metal associated with adverse cardiovascular, neurological, renal, hematological, immunological, reproductive, and developmental outcomes. Before widespread bans in the 1970s, lead was included in gasoline, paint, water piping, and plumbing fixtures, resulting in extensive contamination of the air, soil, dust, and water. Lead is still widely refined and processed in the United States, where lead levels remain relatively high and individuals remain at risk of exposure. There is also evidence of racial and socioeconomic disparities concerning the burden of lead exposure, with several racial and ethnic groups and low-income populations facing increased exposures compared with other groups. Because of the persistence of lead in the environment and continuous new exposures, lead and its associated adverse health effects remain relevant today.

Despite its importance as a potential cardiovascular risk factor, large cohort studies of cardiovascular disease (CVD) often lack data on lead exposure. Traditionally, biomarkers of lead exposure have been measured in blood, urine, plasma, and bone. Lead accumulates in bone with a half-life of decades, and bone lead measures can be used to reflect cumulative lead exposure and long-term health effects. In blood, lead reflects both endogenous sources from bone and exogenous sources from the environment, with a half-life of 1 to 2 months. Obtaining bone lead measures, however, can be challenging on a population scale, as the technology used requires exposure to radiation and is not widely available.

### Two-year responses of office and ambulatory blood pressure to first occupational lead exposure [^114C6zVJ]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

In the analysis of the office blood pressure cohort, unadjusted analyses showed that the office systolic/diastolic blood pressure increased by 3.4/1.4 mm Hg (CI, 2.3–4.6/0.3–2.5 mm Hg; P ≤ 0.013) from 119.7/79.4 mm Hg at baseline to 123.1/80.8 mm Hg at the last available follow-up. However, when examining fourths of the distribution of changes in blood lead, with correction for baseline blood pressure (see Table S4), greater increases in blood lead were not associated with greater rises in blood pressure (P linear trend ≥ 0.85).

In mixed models, accounting for clustering within participants, there was no association between changes in blood pressure and blood lead when unadjusted or adjusted for sex, baseline age, blood pressure, and body mass index (see Table 2). In fully adjusted models, the association sizes associated with a doubling of the follow-up-to-baseline blood lead ratio were 0.36 mm Hg (CI, −0.55 to 1.27 mm Hg) systolic and 0.28 mm Hg (CI, −0.48 to 1.04 mm Hg) diastolic.

- **Baseline and follow-up blood pressures in the office and ambulatory blood pressure cohorts**: See Table 1.

- **Associations between changes in blood pressure and in blood lead**: See Table 2.

Cross-classification of the blood pressure categories demonstrated that 70 patients, who were normotensive at baseline, became hypertensive during follow-up (see Table S5). Ninety-six workers developed new-onset stage-1 or higher office hypertension, 38 developed new-onset stage-2, severe or treated office hypertension, and 134 moved up across the blood pressure categories (see Table 3).

### The role of cities in reducing the cardiovascular impacts of environmental pollution in low- and middle-income countries [^115v7DwV]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and experimental evidence across a range of exposures indicate that chronic exposure to heavy metals and metalloids, including lead, arsenic, and cadmium, is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) development, though most evidence is from high-income countries with low-to-moderate levels of exposure. The full extent of heavy metal exposure in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is unknown due to few countries having biomonitoring programs in place, though evidence from individual studies indicates substantially higher exposures than in high-income countries.

Lead was one of the first pollutants to receive global attention following the elucidation of its neuro-cognitive effects in children. Despite remarkable global decreases in blood lead levels following bans on leaded gasoline in many countries, pockets of high exposure persist among people living near industry and in areas with less environmental regulation. Studies in high-income countries associate blood lead levels with cardiovascular mortality and clinical outcomes, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease, with associations evident at blood lead levels as low as 5 μg/dL. For reference, an estimated 120 million people had blood lead levels between 5 and 10 μg/dL, and approximately the same number had levels > 10 μg/dL in 2000, the majority of whom were living in LMICs. A link between lead and higher blood pressure is reasonably well-established, and lead was associated with reduced heart rate variability and with abnormalities of cardiac structure and function in adults with low exposures.

### Hypertension and elevated pulse pressure responsive to biomass pollutants exposures in young workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo: A cross-sectional analysis [^113qKRfs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide. Their burden is exacerbated by pollution, contributing to 45% to 50% of excess deaths from CVDs. Low-income countries bear the heaviest burden, and young people are increasingly affected. Hypertension is one of the most common CVDs, with its prevalence varying between countries, reaching 40% in regions with less active populations. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the estimated overall prevalence of hypertension is 26%, but it is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, and among sedentary individuals. Inconsistent information is available regarding this prevalence in active workers exposed to occupational biomass pollution, such as urban charcoal sellers. Charcoal production, however, represents a significant sector, employing approximately 400,000 individuals within the charcoal supply chain, which fulfills about 90% of the energy needs in the DRC.

Charcoal workers (CWs) perform highly demanding occupational tasks such as cutting wood, maintaining and dismantling kilns, and packaging and transporting charcoal. These activities involve a high level of physical activity, increasing up to 5 times the inhalation of pollutants released in the charcoal craft. These pollutants include gases like NO₂, NO, CO; dust-containing particulate matter (PM 1.0 [PM < 1.0 μm], PM 2.5 [PM < 2.5 μm], PM 10 [PM < 10 μm]); and organic substances such as volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are toxic to the cardiovascular system. They lead to oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, causing vascular endothelial damage.

### Occupational noise exposure and risk of hypertension in an industrial workforce [^116DMY8z]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Community noise exposure has been shown to increase the risk of hypertension; however, the relationship between occupational noise exposure and hypertension is less clear.

- **Methods**: Using an inception cohort of workers in a specialty metals manufacturing company, we retrospectively assessed occupational noise exposure, hearing acuity, and incident hypertension diagnoses using administrative datasets. Time-weighted average noise exposure levels were assigned to employees based on their job histories. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to determine the association of noise exposure with risk of incident hypertension.

- **Results**: The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of incident hypertension did not significantly differ between groups by cumulative continuous or categorized noise exposure metric.

- **Conclusion**: We found no increased risk of incident hypertension with exposure to occupational noise among workers. Further assessment examining workers' use of hearing protection devices is warranted.

### Very high blood lead levels among adults - United States, 2002–2011 [^117Fb7rH]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past several decades, there has been a remarkable reduction in environmental sources of lead, improved protection from occupational lead exposure, and an overall decreasing trend in the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in U.S. adults. As a result, the U.S. national BLL geometric mean among adults was 1.2 µg/dL during 2009–2010. Nonetheless, lead exposures continue to occur at unacceptable levels. Research continues to find that BLLs previously considered harmless can have harmful effects in adults, such as decreased renal function and increased risk for hypertension and essential tremor at BLLs < 10 µg/dL.

The CDC has designated 10 µg/dL as the reference BLL for adults; levels ≥ 10 µg/dL are considered elevated. The CDC's Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program tracks elevated BLLs among adults in the United States. In contrast to the CDC reference level, prevailing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standards allow workers removed from lead exposure to return to lead work when their BLL falls below 40 µg/dL. During 2002–2011, ABLES identified 11,536 adults with very high BLLs (≥ 40 µg/dL). Persistent very high BLLs (≥ 40 µg/dL in ≥ 2 years) were found among 2,210 (19%) of these adults. Occupational exposures accounted for 7,076 adults with very high BLLs (91% of adults with known exposure source) and 1,496 adults with persistent very high BLLs. Adverse health effects associated with very high BLLs underscore the need for increased efforts to prevent lead exposure at workplaces and in communities.

### Bone lead associations with blood lead, kidney function and blood pressure among US, lead-exposed workers in a surveillance programme [^117GxSRC]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Bone lead and past blood lead levels may be more strongly associated with health effects than blood lead, representing recent exposure. We examined whether bone lead was correlated with maximum past blood lead and compared how three lead measures predicted blood pressure (BP) and kidney function among workers with past occupational lead exposure.

- **Methods**: Adult men in a lead surveillance programme residing near New York City were enrolled. Bone and blood lead, BP, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were measured. Maximum past blood lead was obtained from surveillance data. Regression models were used to determine associations of health with different lead measures.

- **Results**: Among 211 participants, median (IQR) bone, maximum past blood, and blood leads were 13.8 (9.4–19.5) µg lead per bone mineral gram, 29.0 (14.0–38.0) µg/dL, and 2.5 (1.5–4.4) µg/dL, respectively. Maximum past and blood lead were significantly associated with bone lead in adjusted analyses (both p < 0.0001), with associations driven by high blood lead. Bone lead was associated with increased continuous systolic BP (coefficient = 0.36; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.67; p = 0.02); categorical analyses indicated this was driven by the top two bone lead quartiles. Bone lead was non-significantly associated with decreased (worse) eGFR (coefficient = -0.15; 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07; p = 0.18).

- **Conclusions**: Bone lead was significantly associated with past maximum and blood lead. The association between bone and blood lead was possibly driven by high blood lead levels.

### Lead induced increase of blood pressure in female lead workers [^112ZWucr]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Although lead exposure, in the absence of mathematical modeling, has been believed to elevate blood pressure in females, it is essential to clarify the relationship between lead and blood pressure by eliminating confounding factors in the analysis.

- **Methods**: Blood lead levels were measured in 193 female workers, including 123 lead-exposed individuals. Possible confounding factors were controlled through multiple regression analyses.

- **Results and conclusions**: Blood lead levels above 40 micrograms per deciliter were identified as the most significant factor for elevating systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Aging, urine protein, and plasma triglyceride levels also contributed to increases in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure, whereas hypertensive heredity did not. The data suggested that lead-induced changes in lipoprotein metabolism might play an important role in the lead-induced blood pressure increase observed in female workers.

### Contaminant metals as cardiovascular risk factors: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113VsYkh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The blood lead reference value established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the only biomonitoring guideline for public health and clinical action of any of the metals reviewed in this statement. Set to identify children with high levels of lead exposure, it was lowered from 5 to 3.5 μg/dL in 2022. The goal is to allow parents, doctors, public health officials, and communities to act earlier to reduce lead exposures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have established 5 μg/dL as the reference level of lead exposure for adults. Although pediatricians routinely monitor blood lead levels in children in many states, no equivalent monitoring for lead or any other metal is established for adult patients. Potentially, it might be more relevant to measure bone lead, which is a better marker of cumulative lead exposure and more strongly associated with CVD in studies with those measures available. Although measuring bone lead is challenging and results in radiation exposure, surrogate blood-based epigenetic markers of bone lead provide some promise.

A common question is whether measuring metals in blood, urine, or bone can help identify and protect people at risk of developing CVD. Lead, cadmium, and arsenic biomarkers are well established in research, and some are used by public health (blood lead) and occupational agencies (blood lead, blood and urine cadmium, urine arsenic) for surveillance purposes. Whether this is an effective strategy to identify and protect individuals at risk of CVD remains uncertain, necessitating further research and evaluation.

### Effect of occupational exposure to lead on new risk factors for cardiovascular diseases [^1172ohT7]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular effects of lead are caused primarily through an effect on blood pressure but are not just limited to an increased risk of hypertension. The aim of our study was to determine to what extent chronic exposure to lead affects new risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) development, such as biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen) and biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (homocysteine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and L-homoarginine).

A cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of 231 male volunteers, aged 20–60 years, working for at least 2 years in jobs with exposure to lead during the mining and processing of lead-zinc ores. The association between lead in blood and CVD biomarkers was evaluated using multiple linear regression, and the effects of exposure level were observed in workers divided into subgroups according to their blood lead concentration (400 µg/L).

Lead in the blood correlated with new risk factors for CVD except for ADMA. Multiple regression analysis revealed that predictive properties for lead in the blood increased for particular biomarkers in the following order: L-homoarginine, fibrinogen, CRP, and homocysteine. Among the specified groups, significant differences were observed only between the groups with the most and least exposure to lead, which differed in concentrations by 54.3% for CRP, 19.3% for fibrinogen, 10.6% for homocysteine, and -25.5% for L-homoarginine.

These findings support the hypothesis that occupational exposure to lead may influence new risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

### Synergistic susceptibility to environmental lead toxicity in chronic kidney disease [^111BUxsz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

While high levels of lead exposure can cause toxicity across multiple organ systems, the hazard of commonly encountered levels of lead in the environment remains unresolved. Challenges to researching the health effects of lead include its complex interplay with renal function, rendering analyses at risk of unaccounted confounding, and the likely small effect size of environmental levels of exposure. While children are known to be disproportionately susceptible to lead toxicity, resulting in appropriately more stringent regulatory surveillance for those under 5 years old, emerging evidence suggests that those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) similarly are at a greater risk. This review summarizes the role of environmental lead toxicity as a potential cause and consequence of CKD.

Recent findings suggest that whether environmental lead exposure causes CKD remains debatable, with little recent research advancing the conflicting, mostly cross-sectional, analyses from years ago. However, an emerging body of evidence suggests that CKD increases the susceptibility to lead toxicity. Higher circulating lead levels and lower urinary excretion result in greater lead accumulation in CKD, with simultaneous greater risk of clinically meaningful disease. Recent studies suggest that levels of lead found commonly in the United States drinking water supply, and currently permissible by the Environmental Protection Agency, associate with hematologic toxicity in those with advanced CKD.

### Association between secondhand smoke exposure and hypertension: Nearly as large as smoking [^112qe9wb]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Active smoking is a widely accepted risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is recognized as a major public health problem. Passive smoking, also known as secondhand smoke exposure (SHSE), is thought to have similar cardiovascular consequences, and the risk has been postulated to be equivalent to that of active smoking. A major component of this risk involves the connection with chronic hypertension.

There are several population-based observational studies investigating the relationship between SHSE and chronic hypertension, all of which demonstrate a positive association. Given that SHSE appears to be a risk factor for chronic hypertension, SHSE should also be a risk factor for hypertensive end-organ disease. Many studies have sought to investigate this relationship, but this has yet to be fully elucidated. In this review, we focus on the evidence regarding the association between SHSE and hypertension, as well as exploration of the links between SHSE and hypertensive end-organ damage.

### Effects of a liquefied petroleum gas stove intervention on gestational blood pressure: Intention-to-treat and exposure-response findings from the HAPIN trial [^11495Ucf]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

It is possible that the observed BP elevation in the intervention group, noted in the ITT analysis, was attributable to exposure to other unmeasured pollutants from using the LPG stove, such as nitrogen dioxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds. More comprehensive personal HAP exposure characterization is needed to fully understand the effect of specific HAP constituents on BP.

Additionally, most of the BP measurements in this study were conducted shortly after morning cooking. A controlled human-exposure study investigating acute responses in BP among young healthy adults immediately following exposure to air pollution emissions from different cookstoves showed lower BP levels (−2.3 mm Hg [95% CI, −4.5 to −0.1]) in participants exposed to smoke from the 3-stone fire, compared with the high-efficiency particulate air-filtered stoves (controls). This effect was largely maintained 3 hours after exposure. However, they found that 24 hours post-exposure, SBP was significantly higher than the clean-stove controls by 2.4 (95% CI, 0.3–4.5) mm Hg for the biomass burning group, although SBP also went up for the LPG stove users. A similar pattern, but not as strong and not statistically significant, was seen for DBP (−0.9 mm Hg right after, 0.8 mm Hg 24 hours later). These data indicated that short-term exposure to air pollution from traditional biomass or less effective cookstoves can elicit a short-term decrease in SBP and DBP, but within 24 hours, the opposite is found.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, specifically in relation to out-of-office blood pressure measurement, the HC 2020 guidelines recommend considering ambulatory blood pressure monitoring when an office-induced increase in blood pressure is suspected in treated patients. This is particularly relevant when blood pressure is not below target despite receiving appropriate chronic antihypertensive therapy, when symptoms suggest hypotension, or when there are fluctuating office blood pressure readings.

### Associations of short-term and long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants with hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114m1K8a]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major disease burden worldwide. Previous studies have indicated that air pollution might be a risk factor for hypertension, but the results were controversial. To address this, a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies was performed to investigate the associations of short-term and long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants with hypertension.

The study included a search of all publications before September 1, 2015, that investigated the associations of ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 and NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) with hypertension in English electronic databases. A pooled odds ratio (OR) for hypertension in association with each 10 μg/m(3) increase in air pollutant was calculated using a random-effects model, for studies with significant heterogeneity, or a fixed-effect model, for studies without significant heterogeneity.

A total of 17 studies examining short-term (n = 6) and long-term exposure (n = 11) to air pollutants were identified. **Short-term exposure** to SO2 (OR = 1.046, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.012–1.081), PM2.5 (OR = 1.069, 95% CI: 1.003–1.141), and PM10 (OR = 1.024, 95% CI: 1.016–1.032) was significantly associated with hypertension. **Long-term exposure** (a 10 μg/m(3) increase) to NO2 (OR = 1.034, 95% CI: 1.005–1.063) and PM10 (OR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.036–1.072) also showed significant associations with hypertension. Additionally, exposure to other ambient air pollutants such as short-term exposure to NO2, O3, and CO, and long-term exposure to NOx, PM2.5, and SO2, had positive relationships with hypertension, but further details were lacking.

### Environmental toxic metal contaminants and risk of cardiovascular disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117VbrAH]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

In recent decades, exposures to environmental toxic metals of hydrogeological origin (e.g. arsenic, lead, cadmium, mercury, and copper) have become a global public health concern due to their potential deleterious health effects in humans. For example, according to the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, arsenic and cadmium are group I human carcinogens, and arsenic is the world's second leading water-borne cause of mortality. Metalloids such as arsenic often fall into the category of heavy metals due to their similarity in properties. Chronic exposure to high levels of arsenic, cadmium, and other toxic metals has also been associated with a higher risk of cancers of the bladder, kidney, liver, lung, and skin. Emerging evidence suggests that these toxic metals may have adverse effects on these outcomes even at lower concentrations, which might be prevalent in many parts of the world.

Additionally, there are increasing suggestions that exposure to arsenic and other frequently co-occurring toxic metals may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, despite their well-established role as immunotoxicants and carcinogens, the associations between environmental toxic metals and the risk of clinical cardiovascular disease outcomes remain less well characterized. Although there are several individual reports published on the topic, they vary greatly in detail regarding associations with diverse cardiovascular outcomes and in study design, such as ecological versus individual-level associations.

### Heavy metal exposure and cardiovascular disease [^112RVj15]. Circulation Research (2024). Low credibility.

Heavy metals are harmful environmental pollutants that have attracted widespread attention due to their health hazards related to human cardiovascular disease. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, and chromium, are found in various sources such as air, water, soil, food, and industrial products. Recent research strongly suggests a connection between cardiovascular disease and exposure to toxic heavy metals.

Epidemiological, basic, and clinical studies have revealed that heavy metals can promote the production of reactive oxygen species, which can exacerbate reactive oxygen species generation and induce inflammation. This results in endothelial dysfunction, lipid metabolism distribution, disruption of ion homeostasis, and epigenetic changes. Over time, heavy metal exposure results in an increased risk of hypertension, arrhythmia, and atherosclerosis.

Strengthening public health prevention, along with the application of chelation or antioxidants such as vitamins and beta-carotene, and minerals such as selenium and zinc, can diminish the burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to metal exposure.

### The burden of hypertension in an oil- and gas-polluted environment: A comparative cross-sectional study [^114YA2GM]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence of a positive association between traffic-related air pollution and elevated blood pressure has been published widely. However, the risk of hypertension in relation to prolonged exposure to crude oil pollution and gas flares remains unexplored.

- **Methods**: We recruited 2,028 residents (aged 18–80) for a cross-sectional survey of both oil/gas-polluted and non-polluted communities in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Prevalence and risk of hypertension, anthropometric indices, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, and cardiovascular comorbidities were examined and compared between the two groups. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg or being on antihypertensive medication. We used both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to examine factors associated with hypertension. Model fit statistics were used to assess the parsimonious model and predictive power.

- **Results**: More than one-third of participants were hypertensive (37.4%). Half of the participants were from oil-polluted areas (51%). Only 15% of participants reported a family history of hypertension. In the adjusted model, participants living in oil-polluted areas were almost five times as likely to have developed hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 4.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.84–12.82) compared to participants in unpolluted areas. Age modifies the association between pollution status and risk of hypertension; for every 10 years' increase in the age of the participants, the odds of developing hypertension increased by 108% (aOR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.77–2.43).

### Contaminant metals as cardiovascular risk factors: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116Hh7Tp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Exposure to environmental pollutants is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Beyond the extensive evidence for particulate air pollution, accumulating evidence supports that exposure to nonessential metals such as lead, cadmium, and arsenic significantly contributes to cardiovascular disease worldwide. Humans are exposed to these metals through air, water, soil, food, and extensive industrial and public use.

Contaminant metals interfere with critical intracellular reactions and functions, leading to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, resulting in endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, epigenetic dysregulation, dyslipidemia, and changes in myocardial excitation and contractile function. Lead, cadmium, and arsenic have been linked to subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary artery stenosis and calcification, increased risk of ischemic heart disease, stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease.

Epidemiological studies show that exposure to lead, cadmium, or arsenic is associated with cardiovascular death, mostly attributable to ischemic heart disease. Public health measures reducing metal exposure are associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease death. Populations of color and those of low socioeconomic means are more commonly exposed to metals and are therefore at greater risk of metal-induced cardiovascular disease. Together with strengthening public health measures to prevent metal exposures, there is a need for the development of more sensitive and selective measurement modalities and clinical monitoring of metal exposures.

### Occupational physical activity and new-onset hypertension: A nationwide cohort study in China [^1158VLm3]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

The study investigates the relationship between occupational physical activity and the incidence of hypertension in a large Chinese cohort. Researchers collected data from a diverse participant pool, analyzing lifestyle factors along with occupational physical activity levels. The findings suggest a complex relationship between physical activity at work and the development of hypertension. Individuals with high levels of occupational physical activity had a varied risk of developing hypertension, indicating the need for personalized health recommendations in occupational settings. Further studies are required to understand the underlying mechanisms and to establish causation.

### Long-term exposure to dust and noise can increase the risk of hypertension: A population-based, cross-sectional study [^113ZXWCn]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension is one of the common chronic diseases and is a major preventable risk factor for increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality worldwide. Its diagnostic criteria are systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg. Hypertension is statistically ranked first among the 30 risk factors leading to the highest disability-adjusted life year levels and is globally recognized as a major public health problem. Additionally, persistently high blood pressure can significantly increase the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic renal insufficiency, and other target organ damage, seriously affecting human health and even endangering life. An adverse work environment is one of the main influencing factors of hypertension and can increase the risk of developing hypertension.

Dust and noise are common occupational disease exposure factors in modern industrial enterprises, and the health of workers exposed to this risk factor for a long time is at risk. It is well known that occupational noise can cause damage to the human auditory system; however, the damage caused by its long-term exposure to the human cardiovascular system is also gaining attention. There is no shortage of reports on the relationship between noise and blood pressure, but the results are inconsistent, with most studies showing that occupational noise exposure is positively associated with blood pressure. Dust is a major pollutant in industrial ambient air, and long-term exposure can seriously damage the respiratory system of the body.

### Medical surveillance of occupational lead exposure using the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory and Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance program: Illinois, 2016–2023 [^115pmk73]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

It has been broadly shown that lead exposure is associated with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cognitive impairment in adults. Occupational exposure contributed to 93.7% of lead exposure in adults in the United States and remains a significant public health issue. Data from the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program also found that 20.4 adults per 100,000 employed population had elevated blood lead levels, defined as ≥ 10 µg/dL.

Select industries, including battery manufacturing, construction, remediation/recycling services, and mining, have reported higher rates of employees with elevated blood lead levels. Previous work also suggests that major environmental polluters may expose their workforces and nearby communities through inadequate administrative and engineering controls. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standard mandates medical surveillance, including blood lead testing, for workers who may be exposed to airborne lead concentrations equal to or exceeding the action level (30 µg/m³ as an 8‐hour time‐weighted average) for more than 30 days.

Collaborations between OSHA and ABLES programs enable targeted workplace inspections and consultations in response to reported elevated blood lead levels among workers. However, despite OSHA regulations, some employers in at-risk industries do not provide blood lead testing or medical surveillance to lead-exposed workers. This results in cases being unreported to the ABLES database and potentially leaving workers with unmanaged exposures.

### Medical surveillance of occupational lead exposure using the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory and Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance Program: Illinois, 2016–2023 [^111meHTT]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Many workers are not solely exposed to lead, but to multiple hazardous substances. Workers at these facilities are exposed through inhalation and ingestion of contaminated air and dust or through dermal contact with contaminated surfaces. Co-exposure to chemical mixtures may interact in synergistic patterns, increasing the risk of adverse health outcomes in workers. Worksites with high environmental emissions may also be exposing workers to other toxic chemicals without adequate regulatory protection.

While some industries have established standards for specific metals and chemicals, medical surveillance and the impact of co-exposure to chemical mixtures in workers at levels that exceed the population average are currently understudied and not fully understood. For example, in this analysis, many of the above-threshold polluters are power generation facilities that are known to release other heavy metals and toxins (e.g. mercury). Thus, the medium of lead emission informs risk management and exposure pathways for workers and nearby residential areas. Active medical surveillance of the workforce, regulatory programming, and employer-based workplace interventions are critical for effectively reducing lead exposure and protecting workers in industries that release lead, irrespective of the exposure medium.

Furthermore, medical surveillance and regulatory measures aimed at reducing lead levels in the workplace could also reduce co-exposure to chemical mixtures in the workplace and benefit surrounding communities.

### Lead exposure in US worksites: A literature review and development of an occupational lead exposure database from the published literature [^1114MYv9]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Retrospective exposure assessment of occupational lead exposure in population-based studies requires historical exposure information from many occupations and industries.

- **Methods**: We reviewed published US exposure monitoring studies to identify lead measurement data. We developed an occupational lead exposure database from the 175 identified papers containing 1,111 sets of lead concentration summary statistics (21% area air, 47% personal air, 32% blood). We also extracted ancillary exposure-related information, including job, industry, task/location, year collected, sampling strategy, control measures in place, and sampling and analytical methods.

- **Results**: The measurements were published between 1940 and 2010 and represented 27 two-digit standardized industry classification codes. The majority of the measurements were related to lead-based paint work, joining or cutting metal using heat, primary and secondary metal manufacturing, and lead acid battery manufacturing.

- **Conclusions**: This database can be used in future statistical analyses to characterize differences in lead exposure across time, jobs, and industries.

### Two-year responses of office and ambulatory blood pressure to first occupational lead exposure [^115zTo9c]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Various factors might explain why we failed to demonstrate any pressor response to new-onset occupational lead exposure over the two years of follow-up. Previous studies in workers suggest that the toxic effects of lead on the cardiovascular system occur at much higher blood lead levels than in the general population, possibly as a consequence of the healthy worker effect. The two-year exposure of predominantly young and healthy adults might have been too short to result in a blood pressure rise.

Within individuals, office and ambulatory blood pressure are poorly reproducible even over short time intervals, so a true blood pressure change might have been masked due to reproducibility issues inherent to blood pressure variability. However, our observations are consistent with our previous research. In a meta-analysis of summary statistics extracted from 31 studies involving 58,518 participants, all published before February 2001, doubling of blood lead was associated with a marginally higher blood pressure. The summative estimates averaged 1.0 mm Hg (CI, 0.5–1.4 mm Hg) systolic and 0.6 mm Hg (CI, 0.4–0.8 mm Hg) diastolic.

In a prospective population study of 728 individuals (50.7% women; age range, 20–82 years), blood pressure was measured conventionally at baseline (1985–1989) and at follow-up (1991–1995), and by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring at follow-up. Over a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range, 3.5–8.4 years), the geometric mean blood lead concentration dropped by 32% from the baseline level of 8.7 µg/dL (range, 1.7–72.5 µg/dL).

### Very high blood lead levels among adults - United States, 2002–2011 [^115ATQJb]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past several decades, there has been a remarkable reduction in environmental sources of lead, improved protection from occupational lead exposure, and an overall decreasing trend in the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in U.S. adults. As a result, the U.S. national BLL geometric mean among adults was 1.2 μg/dL during 2009–2010. Nonetheless, lead exposures continue to occur at unacceptable levels. Research continues to find that BLLs previously considered harmless can have harmful effects in adults, such as decreased renal function and increased risk for hypertension and essential tremor at BLLs < 10 μg/dL.

The CDC has designated 10 μg/dL as the reference BLL for adults; levels ≥ 10 μg/dL are considered elevated. The CDC's Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program tracks elevated BLLs among adults in the United States. In contrast to the CDC reference level, prevailing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standards allow workers removed from lead exposure to return to lead work when their BLL falls below 40 μg/dL.

During 2002–2011, ABLES identified 11,536 adults with very high BLLs (≥ 40 μg/dL). Persistent very high BLLs (≥ 40 μg/dL in ≥ 2 years) were found among 2,210 (19%) of these adults. Occupational exposures accounted for 7,076 adults with very high BLLs (91% of adults with known exposure source) and 1,496 adults with persistent very high BLLs. Adverse health effects associated with very high BLLs underscore the need for increased efforts to prevent lead exposure at workplaces and in communities.

### Blood lead level is associated with elevated blood pressure in blacks [^1162N6zX]. Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic lead exposure has been associated with elevated blood pressure in epidemiological studies. It is not known whether the previously observed relation between blood lead and hypertension persists after significant reductions have been made in environmental lead contamination. We examined the relation between blood lead levels and blood pressure in a representative sample of 14,952 whites and blacks aged 18 years or older who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Blood lead was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and blood pressure by standard sphygmomanometry. Mean blood lead levels were significantly higher for black men and women (5.4 and 3.4 microg/dL, respectively) compared with white men and women (4.4 and 3.0 microg/dL, respectively).

After multivariate adjustment for important covariables, each standard deviation higher blood lead (3.3 microg/dL) was associated with a 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 1.44) mm Hg and a 1.55 (95% CI, 0.47 to 2.64) mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure among black men and women, respectively. In contrast, blood lead level was not associated with blood pressure among white men or women. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of hypertension associated with a 1-SD higher level of blood lead was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.19) for black men and 1.39 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.61) for black women. These findings suggest that increased levels of blood lead remain an important environmental risk factor for elevated blood pressure in blacks.

### Adult blood lead epidemiology and surveillance — United States, 2008–2009 [^113dhuAV]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Lead exposure can result in acute or chronic adverse effects in multiple organ systems, ranging from subclinical changes in function to symptomatic, life-threatening toxicity. Despite improvements in public health policies and substantial reductions in blood lead levels (BLLs) in adults, lead exposure remains an important health problem worldwide. Approximately 95% of all elevated BLLs reported among adults in the United States are work-related, and recent research has raised concerns regarding the toxicity of BLLs as low as 5 μg/dL.

The CDC's state-based Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program tracks laboratory-reported elevated BLLs. To update rate trends and identify industry subsectors and nonoccupational activities with high lead exposures, the CDC collected and analyzed 2008–2009 data from 40 state ABLES programs. The results of that analysis indicated a decline in the prevalence of elevated BLLs (≥ 25 μg/dL), extending from 14.0 per 100,000 employed adults in 1994 to 6.3 in 2009.

- **Industry subsectors with the highest numbers of lead-exposed workers**: Battery manufacturing, secondary smelting and refining of nonferrous metals, and painting and paper hanging.
- **Common nonoccupational exposures to lead**: Shooting firearms; remodeling, renovating, or painting; retained bullets (gunshot wounds); and lead casting.

These findings underscore the need for government agencies, employers, public health professionals, health-care providers, and worker-affiliated organizations to increase interventions to prevent workplace lead exposure.

### Interpretation of population health metrics: Environmental lead exposure as exemplary case [^116UBuo7]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Based on a comprehensive assessment of literature published until 2007, Navas-Acien et al. concluded that there was sufficient evidence to infer a causal association of high blood pressure with lead exposure, but the evidence was inconclusive to deduce a causal relation of cardiovascular outcomes with such exposure. In a meta-analysis of summary statistics extracted from 31 studies involving 58,518 participants, all published before February 2001, doubling of blood lead was associated with a marginally higher blood pressure. The pooled estimates averaged 1.0 mm Hg (CI, 0.5–1.4 mm Hg) systolic and 0.6 mm Hg (CI, 0.4–0.8 mm Hg) diastolic.

In a prospective population study of 728 individuals (50.7% women; age range, 20–82 years), blood pressure was measured conventionally at baseline (1985–1989) and at follow-up (1991–1995) and by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring at follow-up. Over a median of 5.2 years (range, 3.5–8.4 years), the geometric mean blood lead concentration dropped by 32% from the baseline level of 8.7 µg/dL (range, 1.7–72.5 µg/dL). The small changes in the systolic/diastolic blood pressure on conventional measurement (−1.5/+1.7 mm Hg) were unrelated to the blood lead concentration at baseline or to the changes in this exposure marker over follow-up. Similarly, the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was not associated with blood lead at baseline or follow-up.

### The contribution of declines in blood lead levels to reductions in blood pressure levels: Longitudinal evidence in the Strong Heart Family Study [^1155dd3E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Centrally trained SHS nurses and medical assistants collected participant information from a standardized interview, physical examination, medication review, and biospecimen collection at each study visit. The measurements, protocols, central training, and operating procedures remained consistent across study visits and were collected under a standardized methodology. Sociodemographic and lifestyle information was acquired through standardized SHS questionnaires, which included details such as age, sex, years of schooling/education, whether household income met needs (yes/no/unsure), exposure to secondhand smoke (hours per week), smoking status (never/former/current), and alcohol drinking status (never/former/current).

- **Smoking status**: Never smoking was defined as reporting never smoking regularly, or never smoking more than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime. Former smoking was defined as smoking at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime but not smoking currently. Current smoking was defined as smoking at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and currently smoking.

- **Alcohol drinking status**: Never drinking was defined as never consuming alcoholic beverages. Former drinking was defined as previously consuming alcoholic beverages but not within the past 12 months. Current drinking was defined as having consumed an alcoholic beverage in the past 12 months.

Detailed methods on the collection of anthropometric measurements and biospecimens (e.g. blood and urine) and the laboratory measurements of relevant biomarkers in biospecimens have been described previously. We calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate using age, sex, and urinary creatinine (mg/dL).

### The relationship between occupational exposure to organic solvents and metabolic syndrome in petroleum refinery workers in Tehran, Iran [^117DJ536]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

The rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome has made it a major health concern. Chronic occupational exposure to organic solvents affects different systems of the body. This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to organic solvents and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in petroleum refinery workers.

This study was conducted in 2019–2020 on workers employed in an Iranian petroleum refinery. The demographic and occupational information on the participants was obtained using the interview method. Their height, weight, and blood pressure were measured by the occupational health team, and fasting blood samples were taken from them to measure the paraclinical parameters.

In this study, 1009 petroleum refinery workers were analyzed. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in workers was 20.1%, and it was about two times higher in exposed workers (CI 95%: 1.61–3.35) compared to non-exposed ones. Factors associated with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome include age, higher BMI, exercise, and longer exposure to organic solvents.

Findings of this study suggested that exposure to organic solvents is associated with increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (the highest association was observed with elevated serum triglycerides). Besides, longer exposure to organic solvents increased the risk of developing metabolic syndrome.
