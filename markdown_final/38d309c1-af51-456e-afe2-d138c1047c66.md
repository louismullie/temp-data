## Question

what is the difference between a steriod injection for cubital tunnel syndrome and medial epicondyle injection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between a steroid injection for cubital tunnel syndrome and a medial epicondyle injection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotypes to avoid conflating nerve compression with tendon disease. Then, I should differentiate the injection targets and anatomical landmarks. Next, I'll review technique and guidance, with an emphasis on safety and avoidance of intraneural or intratendinous placement. After that, I will examine the quality and direction of the efficacy evidence for each condition. Finally, I'll synthesize practical recommendations and counseling points based on risks, benefits, and evidence strength, ensuring I cite appropriately as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic context so I don't anchor incorrectly. Cubital tunnel syndrome is ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow with paresthesias in the ring and small fingers, possible elbow-to-hand pain radiation, and in more advanced cases intrinsic weakness and clawing, which clearly signals a neuropathy rather than a tendon disorder. By contrast, medial epicondylitis is a tendinopathy of the common flexor origin at the medial epicondyle, typically an overuse condition with focal medial elbow pain, distinct from nerve compression. I need to ensure I keep "nerve" and "tendon" pathways separate because that dictates both target and technique.

> Now, I will delineate the injection targets and precise locations because accuracy here mitigates complications. For cubital tunnel syndrome, the target is the perineural space adjacent to the ulnar nerve — classically halfway between the olecranon and medial epicondyle — with the goal of bathing the nerve, not penetrating it; ultrasound studies show reliable perineural spread from this approach, which reassures me about anatomic reach while still demanding caution against intraneural injection. For medial epicondylitis, the target is peritendinous: infiltrate the tendon sheath and the area of maximal tenderness at the medial epicondyle while explicitly avoiding injection into the tendon substance itself to reduce rupture risk, which is reinforced by labeling guidance and procedural reviews. Wait, let me verify the phrasing — yes, tendon sheath rather than tendon substance is the critical warning I must keep prominent [^111CfTCy] [^111omiVS] [^112RqGQX].

> Next, I should review guidance modalities and safety. For cubital tunnel injections, I need to emphasize ultrasound guidance to visualize the ulnar nerve and avoid intraneural placement because even small errors can cause nerve injury; cadaveric data support the feasibility of a standardized ultrasound-guided perineural approach. For medial epicondylitis, landmark-guided infiltration is commonly described and acceptable in experienced hands, but I should still counsel on risks such as skin atrophy, depigmentation, or rare tendon rupture; reports of skin atrophy after corticosteroid injection in elbow tendinopathy underscore this, though those data are more robust in lateral than medial disease, which I should explicitly acknowledge to avoid overgeneralization [^111CfTCy] [^116hLBqd] [^1113SJqd].

> I will now examine efficacy for cubital tunnel steroid injection to avoid overstating benefit. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed no clinically significant advantage of ultrasound-guided methylprednisolone over placebo at 3 months, although there was a small reduction in ulnar nerve cross-sectional area — so an anatomical change without symptom benefit. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; a structural change might still matter in some contexts, but here symptom and functional outcomes did not improve, and the authors correctly suggest natural history and education may explain favorable outcomes. Bottom line: the clinical effect appears limited, and the evidence quality is modest, so I should be cautious in presenting this as a reliable therapy [^111bFp9H].

> For medial epicondylitis, I need to check the strength and direction of evidence and be transparent about extrapolation from lateral epicondylitis. The family medicine review synthesizes that corticosteroid injections for medial and lateral epicondylitis provide only short-term symptom relief with high recurrence, which aligns with trials in lateral epicondylitis showing early benefit but poorer medium- to long-term outcomes versus physiotherapy or even wait-and-see approaches. Wait, I should clarify that the strongest randomized data are for lateral epicondylitis; however, given shared tendinopathic biology at the epicondyles, the short-term gain/long-term regression pattern is plausibly similar in medial disease, and that's how guidelines often frame it. PRP tends to outperform corticosteroid by 3–6 months in lateral epicondylitis meta-analyses, further emphasizing the transient nature of steroid benefit, but again that's lateral data and I should label it as such to avoid overreach [^112Rxe87] [^112GJHjk] [^1162Vjah].

> Let me consider technique and dosing nuances I should explicitly counsel on for tendon-side injections, because this is a frequent source of harm if imprecise. I need to ensure the tendon is placed on stretch to facilitate sheath infiltration, infiltrate the area of maximal tenderness, and avoid intratendinous injection per methylprednisolone labeling. I should also review with the patient that even when pain relief is achieved, recurrence is common and a staged plan emphasizing eccentric loading and activity modification is prudent, reserving reinjection for select cases after discussing diminishing returns and complication risks. Hmm, wait a minute — did I already note skin changes and rare rupture? Yes, but it bears repeating given risk salience in shared decision-making [^111omiVS] [^112RqGQX] [^116hLBqd].

> Bringing this together into clear clinical distinctions, I should emphasize that these are fundamentally different procedures: perineural ultrasound-guided injection intended to modulate ulnar nerve inflammation and edema in cubital tunnel syndrome versus peritendinous landmark-guided infiltration to modulate nociceptive tendinopathy in medial epicondylitis. The former has limited evidence for symptom benefit over placebo, so it should be considered cautiously, often as an adjunct to activity modification, splinting, or surgical discussion when deficits progress. The latter can provide short-term pain relief but is associated with high recurrence and inferior long-term outcomes compared with rehabilitation-centric strategies, so it is best framed as a temporizing measure within a broader tendon-loading program rather than a definitive fix [^111bFp9H] [^112Rxe87] [^112GJHjk].

Key difference: cubital tunnel injections target the **ulnar nerve** [^111CfTCy] to reduce nerve inflammation and compression, whereas medial epicondyle injections target the **flexor-pronator tendon origin** [^112RqGQX] to reduce tendon inflammation and pain. Cubital tunnel injections are typically **ultrasound-guided** perineural injections between the olecranon and medial epicondyle [^111CfTCy], whereas medial epicondyle injections are **landmark-guided** at the point of maximal tenderness over the medial epicondyle [^111omiVS]. Cubital tunnel injections show limited benefit and are generally not first-line [^111bFp9H], whereas medial epicondyle injections provide short-term relief but have high recurrence and are not recommended for long-term management [^112GJHjk] [^112Rxe87].

## Anatomical targets and clinical indications

| **Injection type** | **Anatomical target** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Cubital tunnel injection | Ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel (between olecranon and medial epicondyle) [^115Vwa9H] | Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome) |
| Medial epicondyle injection | Flexor-pronator tendon origin at the medial epicondyle [^112RqGQX] | Medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow) |

---

Cubital tunnel injections target the **ulnar nerve** [^115Vwa9H] within the cubital tunnel to reduce nerve inflammation and compression, whereas Medial epicondyle injections target the **flexor-pronator tendon origin** [^112RqGQX] to reduce tendon inflammation and pain.

---

## Injection techniques and guidance

| **Injection type** | **Technique** | **Guidance method** |
|-|-|-|
| Cubital tunnel injection | Perineural injection around the ulnar nerve | Ultrasound-guided [^111CfTCy] |
| Medial epicondyle injection | Injection into the area of maximal tenderness at the medial epicondyle | Landmark-guided (palpation-based) [^112RqGQX] |

---

Cubital tunnel injections are typically performed under **ultrasound guidance** to accurately target the ulnar nerve and avoid nerve injury [^111CfTCy], whereas Medial epicondyle injections are usually performed using **anatomical landmarks and palpation** to identify the point of maximal tenderness [^111omiVS].

---

## Medications used

Both injection types commonly use **corticosteroids** (e.g. methylprednisolone acetate or triamcinolone acetonide) combined with a local anesthetic (e.g. lidocaine) to provide immediate pain relief and reduce inflammation [^111omiVS] [^116hLBqd].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

| **Injection type** | **Clinical outcomes** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Cubital tunnel injection | - Limited evidence of benefit <br/> - No significant improvement in symptoms or electrodiagnostic parameters compared to placebo [^111bFp9H] | Limited effectiveness |
| Medial epicondyle injection | - Short-term pain relief <br/> - High recurrence rates <br/> - No long-term benefit [^112Rxe87] | Short-term effectiveness only |

---

Cubital tunnel injections show **limited benefit**, with studies demonstrating no significant improvement compared with placebo [^111bFp9H], whereas Medial epicondyle injections provide **short-term pain relief** [^112GJHjk] but have **high recurrence rates** and **no long-term benefit** [^112Rxe87].

---

## Potential risks and complications

| **Injection type** | **Potential risks and complications** |
|-|-|
| Cubital tunnel injection | - Nerve injury <br/> - Infection <br/> - Bleeding <br/> - Temporary worsening of symptoms [^111bFp9H] [^116hLBqd] [^114G2S62] |
| Medial epicondyle injection | - Tendon rupture <br/> - Skin atrophy <br/> - Depigmentation <br/> - Infection <br/> - Bleeding [^111omiVS] [^114G2S62] |

---

Cubital tunnel injections carry risks such as **nerve injury**, **infection**, **bleeding**, and **temporary worsening of symptoms** [^111bFp9H], whereas Medial epicondyle injections carry risks such as **tendon rupture**, **skin atrophy**, **depigmentation**, **infection**, and **bleeding** [^111omiVS] [^114G2S62].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Cubital tunnel injections are **not recommended as first-line treatment** due to limited evidence of effectiveness, and initial management should be conservative (e.g. splinting, activity modification) [^111bFp9H]. Medial epicondyle injections may be used for **short-term symptom relief** but are **not recommended for long-term management** due to high recurrence rates; conservative treatments (e.g. physical therapy, bracing) are preferred for long-term management [^112GJHjk] [^112Rxe87].

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **Cubital tunnel injection** | **Medial epicondyle injection** |
|-|-|-|
| Anatomical target | Ulnar nerve | Flexor-pronator tendon origin |
| Clinical indication | Cubital tunnel syndrome | Medial epicondylitis |
| Technique | Perineural injection | Tendon injection |
| Guidance method | Ultrasound-guided | Landmark-guided |
| Effectiveness | Limited evidence | Short-term only |
| Risks | - Nerve injury <br/> - Infection <br/> - Bleeding | - Tendon rupture <br/> - Skin atrophy <br/> - Infection |
| Clinical recommendation | Not first-line | Short-term relief only |

---

Primary differences involve anatomical targets, clinical indications, injection techniques, and clinical outcomes. Cubital tunnel injections target the **ulnar nerve** [^115Vwa9H] and are typically ultrasound-guided [^111CfTCy], whereas medial epicondyle injections target the **flexor-pronator tendon origin** [^112RqGQX] and are typically landmark-guided [^111omiVS]. Cubital tunnel injections have limited evidence of effectiveness [^111bFp9H], while medial epicondyle injections provide only short-term relief with high recurrence rates.

### Corticosteroid injections for common musculoskeletal conditions [^112Rxe87]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Family physicians considering corticosteroid injections as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for musculoskeletal diagnoses will find few high-quality studies to assist with evidence-based decision-making. Most studies of corticosteroid injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, bursitis, or neuropathy include only small numbers of patients and have inconsistent long-term follow-up. Corticosteroid injections for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis result in short-term improvements in pain and range of motion; for subacromial impingement syndrome, these injections provide short-term pain relief and improvement in function. In medial and lateral epicondylitis, corticosteroid injections offer only short-term improvement of symptoms and have a high rate of symptom recurrence. Corticosteroid injections for carpal tunnel syndrome may help patients avoid or delay surgery. Trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis may be treated effectively with corticosteroid injections, while patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis may experience short-term symptom relief with such injections.

### A reliable technique for ultrasound-guided perineural injection in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [^111CfTCy]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is a common peripheral compression neuropathy and, in most cases, occurs at two sites: the retroepicondylar groove or the cubital tunnel. Regarding a potential therapeutic approach with perineural corticosteroid injection, the aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of injection fluid applied at a standard site.

- **Methods**: We performed ultrasound-guided (US-guided) perineural injections to the ulnar nerve halfway between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle in 21 upper limbs from 11 non-embalmed cadavers. In anatomic dissection, we investigated the spread of injected ink.

- **Results**: Ink was successfully injected into the perineural sheath of the ulnar nerve in all 21 cases (cubital tunnel: 21 of 21; retroepicondylar groove: 19 of 21).

- **Conclusion**: US-guided injection between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle is a feasible and safe method to reach the most common sites of ulnar nerve entrapment.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the elbow region [^112RqGQX]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the elbow is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedures for the elbow joint, medial and lateral epicondylitis, and olecranon bursitis are reviewed. Persistent pain related to inflammatory conditions responds well to injection in the region. Indications for elbow joint injection include osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Corticosteroid injection is an accepted treatment option for medial and lateral epicondylitis. Olecranon bursa aspiration and injection are useful when that bursa is inflamed. The proper techniques, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up essential for effective outcomes are discussed.

### Corticosteroid injection in patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111bFp9H]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection in patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE).

- **Methods**: Fifty-five patients were randomized between an ultrasound-guided injection of 1 mL containing 40 mg methylprednisolone acetate and 10 mg lidocaine hydrochloride or a placebo injection. The primary outcome was the subjective change of symptoms after 3 months. The secondary outcomes were change in electrodiagnostic studies and ultrasonography findings.

- **Results**: A success rate of 30% was found in the corticosteroid injection group versus 28% in the placebo injection group. Only the nerve cross-sectional area changed significantly in the intervention group, from a mean of 11.9 mm² to 10.9 mm².

- **Conclusions**: We could not demonstrate a positive effect of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection in UNE compared with placebo. Favorable outcomes may be attributed to the natural course of UNE or the effect of patient education.

### The clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome (INSTINCTS trial): an open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^113wcv8i]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

To our knowledge, the comparative effectiveness of commonly used conservative treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome has not been evaluated previously in primary care. We aimed to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of night splints with a corticosteroid injection regarding reducing symptoms and improving hand function in patients with mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.

We conducted this randomised, open-label, pragmatic trial in adults (≥ 18 years) with mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome recruited from 25 primary and community musculoskeletal clinics and services. Patients with a new episode of idiopathic mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome of at least 6 weeks' duration were eligible. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients (permutated blocks of two and four by site) with an online web or third-party telephone service to receive either a single injection of 20 mg methylprednisolone acetate (from 40 mg/mL) or a night-resting splint to be worn for 6 weeks. Patients and clinicians could not be masked to the intervention. The primary outcome was the overall score of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) at 6 weeks. We used intention-to-treat analysis, with multiple imputation for missing data, which was concealed to treatment group allocation. The trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2013–001435–48.

Between April 17, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, 234 participants were randomly assigned (118 to the night splint group and 116 to the corticosteroid injection group).

### Comparison between steroid and 2 different sites of botulinum toxin injection in the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia: A randomized, double-blind, active drug-controlled pilot study [^1122zKAo]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

To compare the effects of two different injection sites of low doses of botulinum toxin type A with a steroid in treating lateral epicondylalgia, a double-blind, randomized, active drug-controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary medical center. Patients with lateral epicondylalgia for more than six months were recruited from a hospital-based outpatient population, amounting to a total of 26 participants. Initially, 66 patients were approached, but 40 were excluded. No participant withdrew due to adverse effects.

Patients were randomly assigned into three groups:

- **Botulinum toxin epic group**: Received 20U of botulinum toxin injection into the lateral epicondyle (n = 8).
- **Botulinum toxin tend group**: Received 20U of botulinum toxin injected into tender points of muscles (n = 7).
- **Steroid group**: Received 40mg of triamcinolone acetonide injected into the lateral epicondyle (n = 11).

The main outcome measures included a visual analog scale, a dynamometer, and the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation, utilized to evaluate pain perception, maximal grip strength, and functional status, respectively. Outcome measures were assessed before intervention and at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after treatment, with the primary outcome measure being the visual analog scale.

At 4 weeks post-injection, the steroid group showed superiority over the botulinum toxin tend group in improvement on the visual analog scale (P = 0.006), grip strength (P = 0.03), and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (P = 0.02). However, these differences dissipated at the 8-, 12-, and 16-week follow-up assessments.

### Ongoing positive effect of platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroid injection in lateral epicondylitis: A double-blind randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up [^113dmj82]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been shown to generally stimulate repair, and 1-year results demonstrated promising success percentages.

- **Purpose**: This trial was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of PRP compared with corticosteroid injections in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis, with a 2-year follow-up.

- **Study design**: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

- **Methods**: The trial was conducted in two Dutch teaching hospitals. One hundred patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis were randomly assigned to a leukocyte-enriched PRP group (n = 51) or the corticosteroid group (n = 49). Randomization and allocation to the trial group were carried out by a central computer system. Patients received either a corticosteroid injection or an autologous platelet concentrate injection through a peppering needling technique. The primary analysis included visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) outcome scores.

- **Results**: The PRP group was more often successfully treated than the corticosteroid group (P < .0001). Success was defined as a reduction of 25% on VAS or DASH scores without a reintervention after 2 years. When baseline VAS and DASH scores were compared with the scores at the 2-year follow-up, both groups significantly improved over time (intention-to-treat principle). However, the DASH scores of the corticosteroid group returned to baseline levels, while those of the PRP group significantly improved (as-treated principle). There were no complications related to the use of PRP.

- **Conclusion**: The study demonstrates a significant and ongoing positive effect of PRP compared to corticosteroid injections in treating chronic lateral epicondylitis with long-term benefits.

**Rheumatology key messages**: Corticosteroid injection and night splinting are safe and effective treatment options for mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Clinical effectiveness did not differ over 24 months, but night splinting may be more cost-effective. Patient choice between a corticosteroid injection or night splinting can be encouraged in initial management decisions.

### Musculoskeletal injections: a review of the evidence [^116hLBqd]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Injections are valuable procedures for managing musculoskeletal conditions commonly encountered by family physicians. Corticosteroid injections into articular, periarticular, or soft tissue structures relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and improve mobility. Injections can provide diagnostic information and are commonly used for postoperative pain control. Local anesthetics may be injected with corticosteroids to provide additional, rapid pain relief. Steroid injection is the preferred and definitive treatment for de Quervain tenosynovitis and trochanteric bursitis. Steroid injections can also be helpful in controlling pain during physical rehabilitation from rotator cuff syndrome and lateral epicondylitis. Intra-articular steroid injection provides pain relief in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

There is little systematic evidence to guide medication selection for therapeutic injections. The medication used and the frequency of injection should be guided by the goal of the injection (i.e. diagnostic or therapeutic), the underlying musculoskeletal diagnosis, and clinical experience. Complications from steroid injections are rare, but physicians should understand the potential risks and counsel patients appropriately. Patients with diabetes who receive periarticular or soft tissue steroid injections should closely monitor their blood glucose for two weeks following injection.

### Editorial commentary: The needle or the knife? Platelet-rich plasma versus surgery for lateral epicondylitis [^113oQ8Rd]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The most efficacious treatment for patients with lateral epicondylitis who have not adequately improved despite being treated for extended periods with commonly used nonoperative measures remains controversial. Are locally applied platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections more effective than a surgical procedure, such as arthroscopic lateral epicondylitis debridement, in reducing symptoms for such patients?

Level II evidence shows that long-term clinical benefits are much less likely to occur in patients receiving PRP injections. Moreover, in patients treated with PRP injections, progressively worsening pain is more likely to develop during activity at 1 and 2 years of follow-up, in contradistinction to arthroscopically managed patients.

### Local corticosteroid injection versus placebo for carpal tunnel syndrome [^116JUMUK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a very common clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The direct and indirect costs of CTS are substantial, with estimated costs of two billion US dollars for CTS surgery in the United States in 1995 alone. Local corticosteroid injection has been used as a non-surgical treatment for CTS for many years, but its effectiveness is still debated.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of corticosteroids injected in or around the carpal tunnel for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome compared to no treatment or a placebo injection.

- **Search methods**: We employed standard, extensive Cochrane search methods, with searches performed on 7 June 2020 and 26 May 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomized trials of adults with CTS that involved at least one comparison group receiving a local injection of corticosteroid (LCI) into the wrist and one group receiving a placebo or no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Standard Cochrane methods were used. Our primary outcome was improvement in symptoms at up to three months of follow-up. Our secondary outcomes included functional improvement, improvement in symptoms at greater than three months of follow-up, improvement in neurophysiological parameters, improvement in imaging parameters, requirement for carpal tunnel surgery, and improvement in quality of life.

- **Adverse events**: GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

- **Main results**: We included 1

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroid injections in the management of elbow epicondylitis and plantar fasciitis: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112uVjsu]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is increasingly used as a promising alternative to traditional corticosteroid (CS) treatment for elbow epicondylitis (EE) and plantar fasciitis (PF). At the time of writing, the synthesis of information on the clinical efficacy of PRP versus CS remains limited and conclusions vary.

- **Purpose**: To compare the clinical efficacy of PRP and CS injections in reducing pain and improving function in EE and PF.

- **Study design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: Online databases were searched from inception to October 2018 for prospective studies evaluating PRP versus CS injections for EE or PF. Independent reviewers conducted searches, screenings, and risk-of-bias appraisals. The primary outcomes of interest were pain and function in both the short term (1–3 months) and the long term (≥ 6 months).

- **Results**: Twenty trials with 1,268 participants were included. For EE, PRP provides a statistically and clinically meaningful long-term improvement in pain, with a very large effect size of -1.3 (95% CI, -1.9 to -0.7) compared to CS. However, the evidence level was low. There was moderate evidence that CS provides a statistically meaningful improvement in pain in the short term for EE, with a medium effect size of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.08–1.03) compared to PRP; this improvement might not be clinically significant. For PF, low evidence suggests that PRP provides a statistically and clinically meaningful long-term improvement in function (American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society score), with a very large effect size of 1.94 (95% CI, 0.6…).

### Methylprednisolone acetate [^111omiVS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Miscellaneous: Ganglion, tendinitis, epicondylitis**: In the treatment of conditions such as tendinitis or tenosynovitis, care should be taken following application of a suitable antiseptic to the overlying skin to inject the suspension into the tendon sheath rather than into the substance of the tendon. The tendon may be readily palpated when placed on a stretch. When treating conditions such as epicondylitis, the area of greatest tenderness should be outlined carefully, and the suspension infiltrated into the area. For ganglia of the tendon sheaths, the suspension is injected directly into the cyst. In many cases, a single injection causes a marked decrease in the size of the cystic tumor and may effect disappearance. The usual sterile precautions should be observed with each injection.

- **Injections for local effect in dermatologic conditions**: Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic, such as 70% alcohol, 20 mg to 60 mg is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 mg to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. Care should be taken to avoid injection of sufficient material to cause blanching since this may be followed by a small slough. One to four injections are usually employed, with intervals between injections varying with the type of lesion.

### The clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome (INSTINCTS trial): An open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^114MwHFK]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

The comparative clinical effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and nocturnal wrist splints has only been investigated in two small trials, neither of which were done in a primary care setting. In patients with carpal tunnel syndrome recruited from hospital clinics and confirmed by nerve conduction studies, within-group improvements in symptoms and electrophysiological findings were seen after 11 months of adherent use of nocturnal wrist splints (n = 28) but not following a single corticosteroid injection (n = 57). So and colleagues investigated between-group comparisons 4 weeks after treatment and found that a local corticosteroid injection and nocturnal wrist splints (n = 25 participants per group) were equally effective for improving symptom severity, although finger dexterity was improved with local corticosteroid injection.

In the INSTINCTS trial (INjection versus SplinTing in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome), we aimed to investigate the comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and night splints in primary care.

The patient was followed up in the outpatient clinic 4 weeks post-injection and was symptom-free. She expressed interest in undergoing the same procedure again if she were to become symptomatic. At a 3-month follow-up post-injection, she remained symptom-free. She is aware that definitive treatment is surgical release but wishes to delay or avoid this due to her risk of bleeding. She has been counseled that surgical release may be required if symptoms reoccur after two steroid injections.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^1118HZ6Q]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

- **Steroid injections**: In the majority of the reported studies, facet joint (FJ) injection includes long-acting corticosteroids, which provide anti-inflammatory and antiedematous effects, as well as immunosuppressive action and inhibition of neural transmission within the C fibres. FJ can be infiltrated with intra-articular, periarticular, and medial branch injections. Due to the presence of inflammatory mediators in and around degenerative FJ, short- to intermediate-term pain relief should occur after steroid injections. However, discrepancies persist in the literature about the efficacy of steroids for FJ pain. Although intra-articular injections (with or without steroids) have traditionally been used in the diagnosis of FJ pain, a controlled trial by Lilius et al. reported no outcome differences between intra- and periarticular injections. Notably, European guidelines do not recommend the use of intra-articular steroids in the management of chronic low back pain (LBP).

- **Neurolysis**: The ideal candidate for FJ denervation is a patient who underwent medial branch infiltration with significant pain relief after the failure of conservative management. Because of the dual nerve supply of a given FJ, electrodes or cryoprobes should be placed at two subsequent levels. Nerve fibres can either be destroyed by physical means, such as heat (radiofrequency) or cold (cryoneurolysis), or by chemical means (alcohol/phenol). Lumbar medial branch neurolysis achieves relief of pain, improvement in disability, and reduction in the need for analgesics.

### Predictors and variation in steroid injection use for carpal tunnel syndrome from a multicenter quality collaborative [^113WhaP9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Steroid injections are commonly used as a first-line treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS); however, research has shown that their benefit is generally short-term. Many patients eventually undergo carpal tunnel release (CTR). This study aimed to determine the variation in steroid injection use by hand surgeons.

- **Methods**: The authors analyzed data from a nine-center hand surgery quality collaborative. Data from 1586 patients (2381 hands) were included if they underwent elective CTR at one of the sites. Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to examine the association of receipt of steroid injection and the association of receipt of more than one steroid injection among patient-level covariates.

- **Results**: Steroid injection use significantly varied by practice, ranging from 12% to 53% of patients. The odds of receiving a steroid injection were 1.4 times higher for women (P < 0.01) and 1.6 times higher for patients with chronic pain syndrome (P < 0.01). Conversely, the odds were 0.5 times lower for patients with moderate electromyography (EMG) classification and 0.4 times lower for patients with severe EMG classification (both P < 0.01). Patients with high scores on the Six-Item CTS Scale (P = 0.02) and patients with moderate (P = 0.04) or severe EMG (P = 0.05) classification had lower odds of receiving multiple steroid injections. Complete symptomatic improvement after steroid injection was significantly reported by patients with a high Six-Item CTS Scale score (P = 0.03) and patients with severe EMG classification (P = 0.02).

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fqrXr]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). High credibility.

Previous systematic reviews yielded contradictory results regarding the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided (USG) versus anatomic landmark-guided (ALG) corticosteroid injections for the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). This meta-analysis included the largest sample size of participants at the time of writing and compared the most comprehensive set of outcome measures stratified by age, follow-up duration, and type of corticosteroid. We found that the USG injection offers significantly better clinical improvement than ALG corticosteroid injection for the treatment of SIS, with acceptable safety.

### Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome [^114Rf2yq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical syndrome manifested by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome has been studied, but remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome versus placebo injection or other non-surgical interventions.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials register (searched May 2006), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to May 2006), and CINAHL (searched January 1982 to May 2006).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized studies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently selected the trials and rated their overall quality. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial; in addition, summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated.

- **Main results**: We included 12 studies with a total of 671 participants. Two high-quality randomized controlled trials involving 141 participants demonstrated clinical improvement of carpal tunnel syndrome at one month or less following local corticosteroid injection compared to placebo injection (relative risk 2.58 [95% confidence intervals 1.72 to 3.87]). One trial compared local corticosteroid injection to oral corticosteroid and found significantly more improvement in the injection group at 12 weeks after treatment (mean difference -7.10 [95% confidence intervals -11.68 to -2.52]).

### Novel steroid infiltration technique of the carpal tunnel [^1114gToy]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome are well established and defined. They include splinting, steroid injection, and surgery (both open and endoscopic). Splinting is considered a temporary option before more definitive measures are taken. It is particularly useful for reversible causes of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as pregnancy.

The effectiveness of each treatment option is variable, but all modalities have proven efficacy in various published meta-analyses. The definitive treatment is surgical release of the carpal tunnel. However, atraumatic infiltration techniques are not frequently taught or described. Treatments should be approached cautiously and without trauma where possible, especially in cases with a high INR, as is the case for this patient.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carpal tunnel syndrome, specifically in relation to local corticosteroid injections, technical considerations are important. The AAPM/ASIPP/ASRA/IPSIS/NASS 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of ultrasound guidance for carpal tunnel injections.

### Predicting the outcome of carpal tunnel release [^114vpstu]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that the result of steroid injection in the carpal tunnel provides a better predictor of the outcome of later surgery, we explored other possible factors that might predict the outcome directly or interact with the results of the steroid injection to better predict the outcome.

- **Method**: We performed a historical cohort study on 57 patients who had carpal tunnel release, taking care to avoid problems of statistical non-independence caused by both hands being studied and confounding from previous surgeries.

- **Results**: We found a large and significant difference in the success rate of surgery for patients who had obtained some relief from injection (87%) versus those who had not (54%). No other significant predictor was found. We discovered factors that may interact with the results of injection in predicting the outcome of surgery, such as the Katz and Stirrat hand diagram assessment of the probability of carpal tunnel syndrome, although these were not significant in our study.

- **Conclusions**: Some relief from steroid injection is the best predictor for success of surgery. Further study is warranted to identify factors that interact with this predictor.

### Hydrodissection with or without corticosteroid versus corticosteroid-only injection for carpal tunnel syndrome: Double-blind randomized controlled trial [^114wFv2F]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Hydrodissection is an emerging technique in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of hydrodissection with or without corticosteroid versus intra-carpal corticosteroid injection for treating carpal tunnel syndrome.

In total, 66 wrists with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome were allocated to three study arms. Under ultrasound guidance, patients received a single injection consisting of 1mL (40mg) triamcinolone acetonide, 1mL lidocaine, and 3mL of saline, or 1mL lidocaine and 4mL saline. Another group received 1mL intra-carpal triamcinolone acetonide (40mg) without ultrasound guidance. All participants were followed for 3 months post-injection. The primary outcome was the median nerve cross-sectional area. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity, functional status, electrodiagnostic test results, hand grip, and pain.

Analyses showed a significant reduction in symptom severity, improvement in function, decrease in median cross-sectional area, and improvement in electrodiagnostic evaluations for all the interventions 3 months after the injections (all p < 0.05). However, there was no significant improvement in muscle strength with any of the interventions. Sensory distal latency decreased (p ≤ 0.004), and sensory nerve conduction velocity increased in all groups (p ≤ 0.001). For motor nerve evaluations, distal latency decreased significantly with the three interventions (p ≤ 0.003), while nerve conduction velocity in the forearm segment increased in the steroid-only group (p < 0.011).

### Is ultrasound-guided steroid injection less effective in carpal tunnel syndrome patients with bifid median nerve: A focus on short-term efficacy [^114LGFgk]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate the impact of bifid median nerve (BMN) on treatment response to ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), this observational study included 50 patients with mild to moderate CTS undergoing ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection. During the procedure, 25 patients with a BMN and 25 with a normal median nerve (NMN) were consecutively selected. Twenty-one from each group completed the 4-week follow-up. Symptom severity, functional status, and disability were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (Quick-DASH). Treatment response was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in VAS at 4 weeks post-injection.

Pre-treatment VAS, BCTQ-SSS, BCTQ-FSS, and Quick-DASH scores did not differ between groups (p > 0.05). At 4 weeks, 76.19% of NMN patients achieved a ≥ 50% VAS reduction versus 33.33% in the BMN group (p = 0.005). While both groups improved post-injection (p < 0.05), the BMN group showed significantly lower improvement in VAS (p = 0.004), BCTQ-SSS (p = 0.015), BCTQ-FSS (p = 0.008), and Quick-DASH (p = 0.013).

Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection was effective in both groups, but response was significantly lower in BMN patients. BMN may be a risk factor for treatment failure, highlighting the need for alternative injection strategies or combination therapies to optimize outcomes.

### Comparison between botulinum toxin and corticosteroid injection in the treatment of acute and subacute tennis elbow: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, active drug-controlled pilot study [^112dSJth]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A injection with corticosteroid injection in treating tennis elbow. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, drug-controlled trial, 19 affected elbows from 16 patients were randomly assigned to either the botulinum toxin type A group (Botox group) or the triamcinolone acetonide group (steroid group).

The researchers used the Visual Analog Scale, pain-free grip strength, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Questionnaire to assess pain perception, grip strength, and quality of life, respectively. Assessments were conducted before treatment and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-treatment.

Four weeks post-treatment, results indicated that the Botox group experienced a smaller decrease in pain (P = 0.02) but a greater decrease in grip strength (P = 0.01). The significant difference in grip strength persisted at 8 weeks (P = 0.03). Throughout the study period, no significant differences in quality of life were observed.

The study concluded that corticosteroid injection is superior to botulinum toxin type A in alleviating pain from tennis elbow 4 weeks after injection. The study suggests that since botulinum toxin injection did not significantly relieve pain and caused muscle weakness, the weakness might not be the only mechanism of pain relief observed in earlier studies.

### The clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome (INSTINCTS trial): an open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^1172c2Ph]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Research in context

- **Evidence before this study**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science for articles published from Jan 1, 1980, to Aug 2, 2011, with updates on Nov 6, 2012, for literature from 2008 to 2012. Before this study, evidence of the comparative clinical or cost-effectiveness of night splints and corticosteroid injections in the medium term or primary care population was not robust. At the design phase of the INSTINCTS trial (2009–12), systematic reviews identified only one small trial conducted in a secondary care setting that directly compared the two main interventions (corticosteroid injections and night-resting splints) used in primary care for carpal tunnel syndrome. A lack of robust evidence of clinical effectiveness beyond the short term for both interventions in any setting was identified. Most trials were performed in secondary care, where patients often have carpal tunnel syndrome of longer duration and are less responsive to conservative management. No trials had assessed the cost-effectiveness of either intervention.

- **Added value of this study**: To our knowledge, our study at the time was the largest to examine corticosteroid injection compared with night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome. We have demonstrated clinically significant short-term and sustained improvements with corticosteroid injections compared to night splints, with no safety issues observed. This is the first study to conduct a full economic assessment, showing that both interventions are relatively inexpensive.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: An analysis of 80,169 patients [^114MXznt]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

First, although the aforementioned study noted a relative increase in corticosteroid (CS) utilization compared with other treatment modalities, it did not address the overall utilization among all patients with lateral epicondylitis (LE), including those receiving no treatment. Our study demonstrated an overall decrease in CS usage, along with no notable changes in the utilization of other treatment modalities such as physical therapy (PT), bracing treatment, and surgery. Therefore, these findings suggest a growing number of LE cases that are treated with a wait-and-see approach, which has been reported to be equally as effective in the long-term treatment of tennis elbow as CS injections and physiotherapy.

Second, our study highlights a population of providers who may be reluctant to change their practice in the face of growing evidence against the use of CS for tennis elbow. This is apparent in the aforementioned increase in usage of CS injections relative to other treatments and our own finding of an increasing number of injections received per patient, among patients receiving injections. Numerous examples of the slow adoption of new evidence litter the medical landscape, with many changes sometimes taking years; for example, the reported decrease in rates of knee arthroscopy for patients with osteoarthritis after an impactful publication. Further promulgation and acceptance of decreasing CS usage among providers can benefit from evidence-based guidelines published by professional organizations, as such guidelines have been shown to result in notable changes in practice.

### Deep friction massage versus steroid injection in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis [^111kSXPD]. Hand (2018). High credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of deep friction massage in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis by comparing outcomes with a control group treated with splinting and therapy and with an experimental group receiving a local steroid injection.

- **Methods**: A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare outcomes after recruitment of consecutive patients presenting with lateral epicondylitis. Patients were randomized to receive one of three treatments: group 1 received splinting and stretching, group 2 received a cortisone injection, and group 3 received a lidocaine injection with deep friction massage. Pretreatment and posttreatment parameters of visual analog scale (VAS) pain ratings, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores, and grip strength were measured.

- **Results**: Outcomes were measured at early follow-up (6–12 weeks) and at 6-month follow-up. There was a significant improvement in VAS pain score in all treatment groups at early follow-up. DASH score and grip strength improved in the cortisone injection group and the deep friction massage group at early follow-up; these parameters did not improve in the splinting and stretching group. At 6-month follow-up, only patients in the deep friction massage group demonstrated a significant improvement in all outcome measures, including VAS pain score, DASH score, and grip strength.

- **Conclusions**: Deep friction massage is an effective treatment for lateral epicondylitis and can be used in patients who have failed other nonoperative treatments, including cortisone injection.

### N of 1, two contemporary arm, randomised controlled clinical trial for bilateral epicondylitis: a new study design [^112NkhqX]. BMJ (2011).

At the end of the trial, both arms were almost pain-free, but the drop in pain in the treated arm was greater than in the control arm. This allows several different conclusions to be drawn regarding the efficacy of platelet lysate in chronic refractory epicondylitis:

- **It is effective**: The drop in pain was steeper in the treated arm.
- **It is not effective**: Improvement may have been due to the natural course of lateral epicondylitis.
- **It is effective with indirect benefits**: The parallel improvement in the untreated arm could have been mediated by the improvement in the treated arm by allowing a more equal distribution of workload.
- **General benefits from trial participation**: Both arms benefited simply from participation in a clinical trial.
- **Further research required**: More studies are needed to solidify these conclusions.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: An analysis of 80,169 patients [^11687281]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the growing contemporary evidence against the use of corticosteroid (CS) injections for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis (LE), beginning with an impactful meta-analysis in 2010, recommendations for CS injections still suggest their use for short-term relief. Amidst these guidelines and the increasing body of literature against the use of CS, it remains unknown if physician behavior has changed in treating LE. In this study, we examined the annual usage of CS injections for the treatment of LE from 2010 through 2017. The primary goal was to determine if the utilization of this treatment modality changed throughout the eight-year period. As a secondary goal, we provide an overview of trends in diagnosis and treatment during this period by examining the annual utilization of other treatment modalities, including bracing, physical therapy, and surgery.

### Comparison between corticosteroid and lidocaine injection in the treatment of tennis elbow: A randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial [^111rNZM5]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to compare the effects of corticosteroid injection with lidocaine injection in treating tennis elbow. It is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients with tennis elbow for more than one month were recruited from a hospital-based rehabilitation outpatient clinic. A total of 70 patients were recruited, and 61 patients completed the study. Patients received an injection of either 10 mg (1 ml) of triamcinolone (corticosteroid group, n = 30) or 1 mL of 1% lidocaine (lidocaine group, n = 31). All of the outcome measures were evaluated before the intervention and at 2 weeks and 2 months after treatment.

No significant group differences were observed between the corticosteroid and lidocaine groups regarding Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, visual analog scale for pain, and grip strength at baseline and at 2 weeks and 2 months after treatment (P > 0.05). However, within-group comparison showed significant improvement after injection with regard to Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, visual analog scale for pain, and grip strength in both groups (P > 0.05).

No differences in the short-term outcomes were found between lidocaine and corticosteroid injection in a small sample of people with tennis elbow with mean duration of 3.8 months.

### Prospective comparison of the six-item carpal tunnel symptoms scale and portable nerve conduction testing in measuring the outcomes of treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome with steroid injection [^1156EnrT]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

We prospectively studied patients clinically diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and treated with the injection of corticosteroid into their carpal tunnel to compare changes in the six-item CTS symptoms scale and portable nerve conduction study (NCS) parameters as outcome tools. Our pilot study was the first to assess the utility of the six-item CTS symptom scale (CTS-6) with steroid injections as a patient-directed outcome measure for the treatment of CTS.

- **Methods**: We enrolled patients who presented to our county hospital orthopedic surgery clinic from August 2012 through August 2013. The patients were clinically diagnosed with CTS. After completing the six-item CTS symptoms scale questionnaire, portable NCS was obtained. Each patient then received an injection of 1 mL of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg/ml mixed with 1 mL of 1% lidocaine into the carpal tunnel. Six weeks post-injection, each patient repeated a CTS-6 questionnaire and underwent a repeat portable NCS. The CTS-6 and NCS results were analyzed using the paired samples t-test. A Pearson correlation was used to assess the correlation between the changes in the CTS-6 and the NCS measurements. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

- **Results**: Thirty-two wrists in 20 patients were evaluated. There was a statistically significant difference between the CTS-6 scores before and after injection. There were also statistically significant changes in five of the NCS parameters. None of the correlations between the CTS-6 and the NCS parameters were statistically significant.

### Cubital tunnel perfusion in different postures-an anatomical investigation [^114dc3YE]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Low credibility.

A 9-MHz linear ultrasound probe (9L-D; General Electric, Boston, Massachusetts) was positioned in a transverse plane, perpendicular to the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel. It was held between the tip of the medial epicondyle and the posterior tip of the olecranon. All scans were performed using a standard ultrasound system (Logiq e9; General Electric). Ultrasound still images were stored at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 seconds.

The contrast agent within the arm was then destroyed and thus rendered invisible to ultrasound. This was achieved by bursting its microbubbles with ultrasound of a high mechanical index, which refers to the mechanical and thermic forces of ultrasound waves to which an investigated tissue is exposed. The upper extremity posture was changed to posture 2, and the full procedure with contrast agent injection and destruction was repeated until data from all postures were collected.

Postures were designed as described in previous studies. The focus was on adding joint positions that cause elongation of the ulnar nerve and create tension, while less emphasis was placed on creating postures of everyday usage.

After examination in all five postures, the cubital tunnel was dissected and inspected by a neuropathologist and a neurosurgeon to rule out any pathologies or scar tissue affecting the results.

In each ultrasound still image, a region of interest containing the cubital tunnel was defined. The outline was placed at the surface of the medial epicondyle, the olecranon, and the Osborne ligament.

### Corticosteroid injections for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis are superior to platelet-rich plasma at 1 month but platelet-rich plasma is more effective at 6 months: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of level 1 and 2 studies [^1162Vjah]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing local injections of either platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or corticosteroid for the treatment of lateral elbow epicondylitis.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar was performed, and all level 1 and 2 randomized studies from 2000 to 2022 were included. Clinical symptoms, patient perceived outcomes, and pain were assessed by the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) and pain by the visual analog scale (VAS). Publication bias and risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tools. The modified Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) and the GRADE system were used to assess the quality of the body of evidence. Heterogeneity was assessed using χ² and I² statistics.

- **Results**: Thirteen studies were included in the analysis. Five studies had a high risk of bias, and the risk of bias across studies was assessed as unclear. There was no publication bias identified. Two of the four GRADE domains (inconsistency of results, imprecision of results) were downgraded to low quality, and the final GRADE assessment was downgraded to a low quality of evidence. The mean CMS score was 62.8, indicating fair quality. The pooled estimate for VAS at 1 month favored corticosteroids (P = 0.75) but favored PRP at three (P = 0.003) and six months (P = 0.0001). The pooled estimate for the DASH score favored corticosteroids at 1 month (P = 0.028) but favored PRP at three (P = 0.01) and six months (P = 0.107). The results indicate…

### Injection with methylprednisolone in patients with the carpal tunnel syndrome: a randomised double blind trial testing three different doses [^112ixm1v]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy of 20, 40, and 60 mg methylprednisolone injections in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Methods**: Included were patients with signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome of more than 3 months' duration, confirmed by electrophysiological tests. Patients participated in a double-blind trial and were randomized to receive injections of 20, 40, or 60 mg methylprednisolone proximate to the carpal tunnel. The primary outcome was the improvement of symptoms requiring no further treatment. These patients were followed for one year.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences in treatment response between the three randomized groups at the one-year follow-up (log rank analysis 1.51, 2 df, 0.4711). In the 20, 40, and 60 mg treatment groups, 56%, 53%, and 73% of the patients, respectively, were free of important symptoms at six months' follow-up. Of the patients treated with one or two injections, 22% were eventually referred to surgery within one year of the first treatment. No side effects were recorded.

- **Conclusion**: A single local injection of 20, 40, or 60 mg methylprednisolone results in long-lasting improvement in approximately half of the patients. There is a trend in favor of the highest dose. A second injection may further reduce the number of patients requiring surgery.

### Comparison of proximal and distal corticosteroid injections for carpal tunnel syndrome [^115Jen8v]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). High credibility.

Evidence for the efficacy of distal corticosteroid injection compared with proximal injection in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is inadequate.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind noninferiority trial of 131 wrists with CTS. Forty milligrams of methylprednisolone was injected medial to the palmaris longus tendon 2 cm proximal to the wrist crease, or at the volar aspect, 2 to 3 cm distal to the wrist crease. Proximal and distal groups received a placebo. The primary outcome was the difference in the CTS Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) score at 1 month. Secondary outcome measures included the difference in SSS score at 3 months, Functional Status Scale (FSS) score at 1 and 3 months, and pain of injections.

- **Results**: No significant differences were noted between groups in scores on the SSS and FSS. Pain was lower in the proximal group compared with the distal group.

- **Discussion**: Corticosteroid injections for CTS distal to the wrist are not inferior to proximal injections, yet they are more painful.

### Associations between work-related factors and specific disorders at the elbow: A systematic literature review [^1141TfuD]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

The study aimed to assess the exposure-response relationships between work-related physical and psychosocial factors and specific elbow disorders, including lateral and medial epicondylitis, cubital tunnel syndrome, and radial tunnel syndrome in occupational populations.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to explore how type of work, physical load, and psychosocial aspects at work are associated with these elbow disorders. Associations between work factors and these disorders were expressed using quantitative measures such as odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR).

- **Lateral epicondylitis**: Handling tools weighing more than 1 kg (ORs of 2.1–3.0), handling loads over 20 kg at least 10 times per day (OR 2.6), and repetitive movements for more than 2 hours a day (ORs of 2.8–4.7) were linked to lateral epicondylitis. Psychosocial factors such as low job control (OR 2.2) and low social support (OR 1.8) were also significantly associated.

- **Medial epicondylitis**: Handling loads over 5 kg (2 times per minute for a minimum of 2 hours a day), handling loads over 20 kg at least 10 times per day, high hand grip forces for more than 1 hour a day, repetitive movements for over 2 hours a day (ORs of 2.2–3.6), and working with vibrating tools for more than 2 hours a day (OR 2.2) were associated with this condition.

- **Cubital tunnel syndrome**: The occurrence was significantly associated with the factor "holding a tool in position" (OR 3.53).

- **Radial tunnel syndrome**: Handling loads over 1 kg (OR 9.0; 95% CI 1.4, 56.9), static work of the hand during the majority of cycle time (OR 5.9), and full extension (0–45 degrees) of the elbow (OR 4.9) were identified as associated factors.

In conclusion, the study found that various physical and psychosocial factors at work may contribute to the development of specific elbow disorders.

### Outcomes following modified oblique medial epicondylectomy for treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome [^111gRqsK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

To quantify and define objective and patient-rated outcomes after our modification of medial epicondylectomy for the treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome. Although medial epicondylectomy has been previously studied, data are lacking regarding elbow-specific outcomes after our technique that aims to minimize complications historically associated with medical epicondylectomy.

- **Methods**: A total of 27 subjects with clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of cubital tunnel syndrome underwent a modified oblique medial epicondylectomy that was designed to minimize bony resection and preserve the origin of the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow. The average age was 57 years, the mean duration of symptoms was 24 months, and the mean postoperative follow-up was 29 months. Eight patients had McGowan stage I disease, 14 had stage II, and 5 had stage III. Preoperatively, we measured intrinsic hand strength, 2-point discrimination, and residual medial elbow pain, and assessed for continuing signs and symptoms of nerve compression. Postoperatively, we added to the clinical examination elbow stability testing, elbow range of motion, and assessment of medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve injury. We collected patient-reported outcomes, including Quick Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm, and Hand; Levine-Katz Severity Score; and Patient-Rated Elbow Evaluation.

- **Results**: We noted improvement of at least 1 McGowan grade in 20 of 27 patients (74%). Three of the 7 patients who had no change in McGowan grade still reported excellent patient-rated outcomes. Good to excellent results were achieved in

### Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome [^114eCNns]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical syndrome manifested by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the level of the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The effectiveness and duration of benefit of local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome remain unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of local steroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome versus placebo injection or other non-surgical interventions in improving clinical outcomes and to determine the length of symptom relief.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group register (searched June 2002), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to May 2002), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to May 2002), and CINAHL (searched January 1982 to May 2002).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized or quasi-randomized studies of participants with carpal tunnel syndrome treated with local corticosteroid injection. The primary outcome measure was clinical improvement.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently selected the trials to be included and rated them for their overall quality. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial, and summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated.

- **Main results**: We identified nine randomized controlled trials. Four were excluded. One trial demonstrated clinical improvement of carpal tunnel syndrome at one month following local corticosteroid compared to placebo injection (Relative risk 3.83, 95% confidence interval…).

### Imaging of elbow entrapment neuropathies [^115Vwa9H]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremity after carpal tunnel syndrome. It results from pathologic compression or a lesion of the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel. Ulnar neuropathy at the cubital tunnel can occur due to dynamic compression during elbow flexion movements or from external compression or impingement. When the elbow is flexed, the space between the humerus's medial epicondyle and the olecranon widens, putting strain on the cubital tunnel retinaculum and, thereby, decreasing the ulnar canal's diameter. Individuals at high risk of developing ulnar neuropathy include baseball pitchers, truck drivers, and office workers whose jobs involve repetitive or prolonged elbow flexion. Extrinsic causes of compression can be:

- **Masses**: Such as schwannomas or ganglia.
- **Accessory muscles**: For example, the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle.
- **Elbow arthritis and bone abnormalities**: Due to previous fractures or surgery, as well as osteophytes.

Common symptoms of ulnar nerve compression are paresthesia and dysesthesia of the last two fingers, especially at night and during elbow flexion and repeated flexion–extension movements. The patient may also feel elbow pain that radiates towards the hand. In more advanced cases, the Wartenberg sign (the abduction stance of the small finger) can be observed, and there may be a claw deformity of the hand with extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints, secondary to paralysis of lumbrical and interosseous muscles.

### The effect of impactful articles on clinical practice in the United States: Corticosteroid injection for patients with lateral epicondylitis [^113siYpr]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Following the publication of high-level evidence demonstrating that corticosteroid injection is not an effective treatment for lateral epicondylitis, a reduction in the injection rate would be expected. The authors aimed to clarify the clinical practice pattern for lateral epicondylitis and identify factors that influence the introduction of evidence into clinical practice.

- **Methods**: In this administrative claims analysis, the authors used 2009 to 2015 Truven MarketScan data to extract claims for corticosteroid injection, physical therapy, platelet-rich plasma injection, and surgery for lateral epicondylitis. They performed a multivariable analysis using a generalized estimating equation model to identify the variables that potentially affect the odds of receiving a given treatment.

- **Results**: Among 711,726 claims, the authors found that the odds of receiving a corticosteroid injection increased slightly after the publication of contradictory evidence (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.11 in 2015). Being male (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.23), older (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.19), and having managed care insurance (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.18) significantly contributed to increased odds of receiving corticosteroid injections. Patients seen at facilities in the South (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.36 compared with the Northeast) and by plastic/orthopedic surgeons (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 2.43 to 2.52) also had increased odds of receiving the injection.

- **Conclusions**: Corticosteroid injection use did not decrease after publication of the evidence.

### Mobilisation with movement and exercise, corticosteroid injection, or wait and see for tennis elbow: Randomised trial [^112GJHjk]. BMJ (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of physiotherapy compared with a wait and see approach or corticosteroid injections over 52 weeks in patients with tennis elbow.

- **Design**: Single blind randomised controlled trial conducted in a community setting in Brisbane, Australia.

- **Participants**: The study involved 198 participants aged 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow of a minimum six weeks' duration, who had not received any other active treatment by a health practitioner in the previous six months.

- **Interventions**: Three groups were compared: eight sessions of physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, and a wait and see approach.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes assessed were global improvement, grip force, and the assessor's rating of severity measured at baseline, six weeks, and 52 weeks.

- **Results**: Corticosteroid injection showed significantly better effects at six weeks but had high recurrence rates thereafter (47 out of 65 successes subsequently regressed) and significantly poorer long-term outcomes compared with physiotherapy. Physiotherapy was found to be superior to wait and see in the short term. However, no difference was observed at 52 weeks, when most participants in both groups reported a successful outcome. Participants who underwent physiotherapy sought less additional treatment, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, than those in the wait and see or injection groups.

- **Conclusion**: Physiotherapy combining elbow manipulation and exercise provides superior benefits compared to the wait and see approach in the first six weeks, and to corticosteroid injections after six weeks, offering a reasonable alternative to injections in the mid to long term.

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DfcVi]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis in this study provides moderate to very low evidence that ultrasound-guided (USG) corticosteroid injection for the management of subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) results in significant pain relief and improvement in physical function of the shoulder compared to anatomic landmark-guided (ALG) injection. Short-term retention between 6 and 8 weeks after injection and the type of corticosteroid used potentially affect the treatment efficacy of USG as reported in this study. Adverse events were relatively low in both groups, which justifies the safety and efficacy of USG injection in treating SIS. Future research should optimize the study design, taking factors not limited to a clear definition of SIS into account, perform a cost-effective analysis, include longer follow-up periods and larger sample sizes, and conduct an intention-to-treat analysis to generate high-certainty evidence.

### Novel steroid infiltration technique of the carpal tunnel [^115QuZPE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition with an annual incidence of 99 per 100,000 and a slight female predilection. Recent reports recommend first-line management options such as a trial of splinting or steroid injection directly into the carpal tunnel. Variable techniques, such as distal and proximal carpal tunnel infiltration, have been considered. A number of anatomical cadaveric studies have attempted to locate the median nerve within the wrist to minimize direct trauma to the nerve and adjacent structures. Most practitioners will report occasional difficulty when injecting the wrist with steroid, and many will confess to having caused sudden pain by injecting directly into the median nerve.

Ultrasonic localization of the nerve prior to infiltration has also been used to identify anatomical variations and swelling within the nerve in the proximal carpal tunnel. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Royal College of Surgeons guidelines recommend splinting at night and a single corticosteroid injection for initial management in the primary care setting. Further management with corticosteroids is not recommended as it may delay surgical decompression. Corticosteroid infiltration is an appropriate treatment modality for high-risk patients (as in our case) and for patients who wish to avoid surgical intervention. Any functional impairment as a result of carpal tunnel syndrome should be managed by a specialist.

We describe a novel technique that allows localization of the median nerve and infiltration using a blunt cannula to minimize direct trauma.

### The clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome (INSTINCTS trial): an open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^116FfD2L]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this trial is the largest randomized comparison of the short-term and medium-term effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splint for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome, and it is the first to be done in a primary care setting where most patients presenting with mild or moderate symptoms are managed. The results show that at 6 weeks, across all primary and secondary outcome measures analyzed, a single injection of 20 mg methylprednisolone acetate led to significantly greater improvements in pain and function than night splints, and these improvements were largely sustained over 6 months (with no difference between groups), which is beyond the active life of methylprednisolone acetate. As a result of further improvements in the night splint group, differences at 6 months were small.

The more rapid improvement associated with corticosteroid injection also leads to this treatment being more cost-effective from both an NHS and societal perspective. These 6-month results add to the inconsistent evidence of only short-term comparative effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints. Furthermore, we reported only known and expected adverse reactions. Methylprednisolone acetate has been widely used for many years in standard practice in both primary and secondary care and has a very well-established safety profile.

A minimally important clinical difference has not been published for the overall BCTQ for a comparison between these two interventions in primary care. We proposed a minimally important clinical difference.

### Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Controversies in the diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^113EkxN3]. Hand (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder responsible for considerable patient suffering and cost to health services. Despite extensive research, controversies still exist with regard to best practice in diagnosis, treatment, and service provision. Best practice supports the use of history, examination, and electro-diagnostic studies. The role of ultrasound scanning in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is yet to be proven. It appears magnetic resonance imaging has a role where a rare cause for carpal tunnel syndrome may be suspected and also in the detailed reconstruction of the anatomy to aid endoscopic procedures.

Treatment options can be surgical or non-surgical, and patient choice will dictate the decision. For non-surgical interventions, many options have been trialed, but until now, only steroid use, acupuncture, and splinting have shown discernible benefits. Open surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel appears to be more simple and cost-effective than minimally invasive interventions. For those patients who reject surgery, splinting, acupuncture, and steroid injection can play a role.

Recent work looking at different service delivery options has shown some positive results in terms of decreasing patient waiting time for definitive treatment. However, no formal cost-effectiveness analysis has been published and concerns exist about the impact of a streamlined service on surgical training. In this review, we look at the different diagnostic and treatment options for managing carpal tunnel syndrome. We then consider the different service delivery options.

### Helpful tips for performing musculoskeletal injections [^114G2S62]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Injections are valuable procedures for managing musculoskeletal conditions commonly encountered by family physicians. Corticosteroid injections into articular, periarticular, or soft tissue structures relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and improve mobility. Injections can provide diagnostic information and are commonly used for postoperative pain control. Local anesthetics may be injected with corticosteroids to provide additional, rapid pain relief.

Steroid injection is the preferred and definitive treatment for de Quervain tenosynovitis and trochanteric bursitis. Steroid injections can also be helpful in controlling pain during physical rehabilitation from rotator cuff syndrome and lateral epicondylitis. Intra-articular steroid injection provides pain relief in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

There is little systematic evidence to guide medication selection for therapeutic injections. The medication used and the frequency of injection should be guided by the goal of the injection (i.e. diagnostic or therapeutic), the underlying musculoskeletal diagnosis, and clinical experience.

Complications from steroid injections are rare, but physicians should understand the potential risks and counsel patients appropriately. Patients with diabetes who receive periarticular or soft tissue steroid injections should closely monitor their blood glucose for two weeks following injection.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: An analysis of 80,169 patients [^115MDZzZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Within the subgroup of patients with lateral epicondylitis receiving corticosteroid injections, we calculated the number of injections received per patient per year. We stratified patients by their date of the most recent injection, quantifying the number of patients who received their most recent injection each year from 2010 to 2017. Next, we calculated the total number of injections given to this subgroup each year. For each year, we divided the total number of injections by the number of patients receiving their most recent injection, providing the number of corticosteroid injections per patient per year from 2010 to 2017.

Trends over time were analyzed using logistic regression. Significance was set at a P value of less than 0.05.

### The use of dry needling vs. corticosteroid injection to treat lateral epicondylitis: a prospective, randomized, controlled study [^1113SJqd]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is a common condition, particularly in middle age. Various treatments have been employed to address LE, including corticosteroid (CS) injections and dry needling (DN). However, the literature has not fully explored which treatment is superior. We hypothesized that DN would be at least as effective as CS injections for treating LE. This study compared pain relief and improvements in functional disability after DN and CS injection.

Methods: A total of 108 LE patients, whose pain was not relieved by 3 weeks of first-line treatment, were randomized using an online application into DN or CS groups (54 patients each). The minimum follow-up duration was 6 months. "Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation" (PRTEE) scores were recorded before treatment and at 3 weeks and 6 months post-treatment.

Results: Seven patients were excluded for various reasons; thus, 101 patients were finally evaluated. Before treatment, the groups were similar in age, symptom duration, and PRTEE scores. However, DN-treated patients showed greater improvement in PRTEE scores than CS-treated patients (P < .01) after treatment. Both treatments were effective (both P < .01), and PRTEE scores decreased over time from assessments at 3 weeks and 6 months post-treatment. Four CS-treated patients (7.6%) developed skin atrophy and whitening. One DN-treated patient (2.04%) could not tolerate the pain of the intervention and withdrew from treatment.

Conclusion: Dry needling and corticosteroid injection afforded significant improvement in PRTEE scores, with DN showing superior outcomes.

### Comparison between effectiveness of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection above versus below the median nerve in mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome: A randomized controlled trial [^117YA45m]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). High credibility.

In this study, the clinical effectiveness of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection "above" versus "below" the median nerve for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome was compared.

- **Design**: This prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial included 44 patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups to receive an ultrasound-guided injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone either "above" or "below" the involved median nerve. Outcome measures were the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, visual analog scale, electrophysiological tests, and ultrasonographic measurement of the median nerve cross-sectional area at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks after the injection.

- **Results**: All outcome measures improved significantly in both groups at 6 weeks after intervention, and these improvements were preserved up to 12 weeks of follow-up (all P values < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in measured outcomes between the two groups. No adverse effects were observed.

- **Conclusions**: Both above and under median nerve ultrasound-guided steroid injection techniques were effective in reducing the symptoms, improving the function, and enhancing electrodiagnostic and sonographic findings of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, the amount of improvement in the outcomes did not differ between groups, implying that neither technique has superiority over the other.

### Non-surgical treatment (other than steroid injection) for carpal tunnel syndrome [^1176Gg4e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is frequently offered to those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, the effectiveness and duration of benefit from these treatments remain unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of non-surgical treatment (other than steroid injection) for carpal tunnel syndrome versus a placebo or other non-surgical control interventions in improving clinical outcomes.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (searched March 2002), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to February 7, 2001), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to March 2002), CINAHL (searched January 1983 to December 2001), AMED (searched 1984 to January 2002), Contents (January 1993 to March 2002), PEDro, and reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized studies in any language of participants with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome who had not previously undergone surgical release were included. All non-surgical treatments apart from local steroid injection were considered. The primary outcome measure was improvement in clinical symptoms following at least three months after the end of treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently selected the trials for inclusion. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Studies were rated for overall quality. Relative risks and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes in each trial.
