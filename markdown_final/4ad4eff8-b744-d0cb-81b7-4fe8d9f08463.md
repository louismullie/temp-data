## Question

How do you treat STI related prostatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat STI-related prostatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the prostatitis syndrome and identifying likely STI pathogens. Then, I should verify diagnostic priorities, including when to test for STIs and how to confirm bacterial involvement. Next, I will consider empiric therapy for acute disease versus targeted therapy for chronic disease, including durations and alternatives. After that, I need to ensure partner management and follow-up testing are addressed. Finally, I will review special scenarios like abscess, HIV, and treatment failure, and close with a concise, practical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework. Prostatitis is typically classified into acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis; STI-related disease most often maps to acute bacterial prostatitis in younger men or chronic bacterial prostatitis when symptoms persist beyond 3 months, so I need to keep both in mind and tailor therapy accordingly [^d5a937a1] [^61c1eab4].

> Wait, let me verify the likely pathogens in STI-related prostatitis. In men under about 35 years, sexually transmitted organisms predominate, especially Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Mycoplasma genitalium, whereas older men more often have enteric gram-negatives; Trichomonas vaginalis can also involve the prostate and should be considered when risk factors or microscopy suggest it [^127e8e8b] [^9b44fa09] [^220d5dcb].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach next. For acute bacterial prostatitis, diagnosis is clinical with fever, chills, dysuria, frequency, and perineal pain, and urinalysis with culture is essential; in chronic presentations, I should confirm bacterial involvement with pre- and post-massage cultures or a modified 2-glass test, and I should actively test for STIs with NAATs for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and M. genitalium when urethritis or prostatitis is suspected, because these are often asymptomatic and drive persistent infection [^d5a937a1] [^46bd9f78] [^f0dc9be6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empiric therapy in acute disease. I initially thought to default to a fluoroquinolone for everyone, but wait, I should verify resistance and local epidemiology; in many regions, fluoroquinolone resistance in uropathogens is high, so empiric therapy should be guided by severity and local patterns, with IV options like a third-generation cephalosporin or piperacillin-tazobactam for severe disease, and oral options like ciprofloxacin only if local resistance is low and there are no recent fluoroquinolone exposures; I should also remember that ciprofloxacin is not recommended as empiric therapy in urology settings or after recent fluoroquinolone use, so I need to adjust accordingly [^a4f83f4e] [^838660fd] [^61c1eab4].

> Let me consider duration carefully. For acute bacterial prostatitis, a 2-week course is generally recommended, though some guidance allows 2–4 weeks depending on severity and response; I should confirm clinical improvement before stepping down and extend if complications are present or response is slow, balancing stewardship with the risk of undertreatment in this complicated UTI phenotype [^0f4d1504] [^e6156924] [^e8b20eae].

> Next, I should review chronic bacterial prostatitis management. Fluoroquinolones remain first-line for 4–6 weeks due to prostatic penetration and spectrum, with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin typical choices; if fluoroquinolones are contraindicated or resistance is present, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 8–12 weeks is reasonable, and for intracellular pathogens like C. trachomatis or M. genitalium, doxycycline or a macrolide such as azithromycin should be selected based on culture or NAAT results and susceptibility; I should double-check that macrolides outperform fluoroquinolones for chlamydial prostatitis, which is supported by comparative data [^62bce8df] [^104fcdae] [^0a9d6fc1] [^97b587d8] [^c95ae38a].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist after appropriate therapy. I need to ensure I have not misclassified CP/CPPS as chronic bacterial prostatitis; if bacterial infection is excluded and symptoms persist beyond 3 months, I should pivot to multimodal, phenotypically directed therapy for CP/CPPS, including alpha-blockers for urinary symptoms, pelvic floor physical therapy, analgesics, and psychological support, and I should avoid repeated antibiotic courses in the absence of documented infection [^61c1eab4] [^4b3bab0c] [^11276478].

> I should confirm partner management and public health steps. For gonorrhea and chlamydia, all partners within 60 days should be notified, tested, and presumptively treated, and patients should abstain from sex until 7 days after treatment and until partners complete therapy; for persistent or recurrent urethritis or prostatitis, I should retest for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis and manage partners accordingly, and I should arrange retesting at 3 months due to high reinfection rates [^dcbafd0a] [^5da54300] [^e52bda95].

> Let me think about special scenarios. If there is poor response to appropriate therapy, I should evaluate for a prostatic abscess with imaging, especially in severe acute disease or immunocompromised hosts, and consider drainage if present; in men with HIV or other immunosuppression, I should broaden my differential to include atypical organisms and ensure close follow-up; if enteric organisms are suspected, I should tailor therapy to local resistance patterns and consider agents like fosfomycin in multidrug-resistant contexts [^2776ed6d] [^46bd9f78].

> I should double-check that my algorithm is coherent. In younger men with acute febrile LUT symptoms, I will treat empirically for STI-related pathogens while cultures are pending, using ceftriaxone plus doxycycline to cover gonorrhea and chlamydia, and add coverage for M. genitalium if risk is high or testing is positive; in older men or those with recent urinary instrumentation, I will favor coverage for enteric gram-negatives with a fluoroquinolone if local resistance permits, otherwise a third-generation cephalosporin, and adjust to culture results; for chronic symptoms, I will confirm bacterial involvement and treat for 4–6 weeks with a fluoroquinolone or pathogen-directed alternative, reserving multimodal CP/CPPS care if infection is excluded [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety netting. I will reassess clinically at 48–72 hours in acute disease, obtain a test-of-cure only in select scenarios such as persistent symptoms or suspected resistance, and schedule retesting at 3 months for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis; I will also counsel on safer sex, condom use, and symptom triggers, and document clear return precautions for worsening pain, fever, or urinary retention [^57b31dd3] [^5da54300].

STI-related prostatitis is best managed with **pathogen-directed antibiotics** [^57c59f04] and **partner treatment** to prevent reinfection [^dcbafd0a]. For acute bacterial prostatitis, use a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) for 2–4 weeks [^0f4d1504]; for severe or septic cases, start IV ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam, then step down to oral therapy [^a4f83f4e] [^61c1eab4]. For chronic bacterial prostatitis, treat for 4–6 weeks with a fluoroquinolone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole if susceptible [^104fcdae] [^62bce8df]; for chlamydia or mycoplasma, use doxycycline or azithromycin [^97b587d8] [^c95ae38a]. Ensure all sexual partners are treated [^dcbafd0a] and abstain from sex until therapy is complete and symptoms resolve [^2f23baec]. Retest at 3 months due to high reinfection rates [^5da54300] [^57b31dd3].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and identification of the causative organism are essential for effective treatment. The following diagnostic steps are recommended:

- **Clinical assessment**: History and physical examination to assess symptoms, risk factors, and potential complications [^d5a937a1].

- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis, urine culture, and blood cultures (if systemic symptoms are present) [^d5a937a1].

- **STI screening**: NAATs for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Trichomonas vaginalis [^f0dc9be6] [^9b44fa09].

- **Prostatic secretion analysis**: Meares-Stamey 4-glass test or modified 2-glass test to confirm bacterial involvement and guide antibiotic selection [^46bd9f78].

---

## Antibiotic treatment

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for STI-related prostatitis. The choice of antibiotic depends on the identified pathogen, antibiotic susceptibility, and patient-specific factors [^57c59f04].

---

### Acute bacterial prostatitis

For acute bacterial prostatitis, **empiric therapy** should start with a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily or levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily) for 2–4 weeks [^0f4d1504] [^e6156924]. For severe or septic cases, initiate IV ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam, then transition to oral fluoroquinolones after clinical improvement [^a4f83f4e] [^61c1eab4].

---

### Chronic bacterial prostatitis

For chronic bacterial prostatitis, **first-line therapy** is a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) for 4–6 weeks [^104fcdae] [^62bce8df]. If fluoroquinolones are contraindicated or resistance is present, use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 4–6 weeks [^notfound]. For chlamydia or mycoplasma, use doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily or azithromycin 1 g orally once weekly for 3 weeks [^notfound].

---

## Partner management and prevention of reinfection

Partner management is critical to prevent reinfection and transmission. Sexual partners should be **notified, tested, and treated** for the identified STI [^dcbafd0a]. Patients and partners should abstain from sexual activity until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve [^2f23baec]. Retesting at 3 months is recommended due to high reinfection rates [^5da54300] [^57b31dd3].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies may help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life:

- **Alpha-blockers**: Tamsulosin or alfuzosin for urinary symptoms and pain relief [^61c1eab4].

- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen or naproxen for pain and inflammation [^61c1eab4].

- **Pelvic floor physical therapy**: For chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^16190e59].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to ensure treatment success and prevent complications. Clinical assessment should monitor symptom resolution and detect complications, and **repeat STI testing** should be performed at 3 months to detect reinfection or persistent infection [^5da54300] [^57b31dd3].

---

## Potential complications of untreated STI-related prostatitis

Untreated STI-related prostatitis can lead to significant complications, including:

- **Chronic pelvic pain syndrome**: Persistent pain and urinary symptoms [^notfound].

- **Infertility**: Due to impaired sperm function and obstruction [^notfound].

- **Increased risk of HIV transmission**: STIs facilitate HIV acquisition [^595c244c].

- **Prostatic abscess**: Requires surgical intervention [^405c41e8].

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute bacterial prostatitis | Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin | 2–4 weeks |
| Severe/septic cases | IV ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam | Until clinical improvement, then oral therapy |
| Chronic bacterial prostatitis | Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin | 4–6 weeks |
| Fluoroquinolone resistance | Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 4–6 weeks |
| Chlamydia or mycoplasma | Doxycycline or azithromycin | 3 weeks |
| Partner management | Notify, test, and treat partners | Concurrently |
| Follow-up | Retesting | 3 months |

---

STI-related prostatitis requires **pathogen-directed antibiotics**, partner treatment, and structured follow-up to prevent reinfection and complications. Fluoroquinolones are first-line for most bacterial cases, with alternatives for resistance or contraindications, and adjunctive therapies can improve symptoms.

Introduction

There is a need for state-of-the-art information in the area of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in relation to sexual function. There are an estimated 60 million people living with and 340 million with treatable STIs. Surveys show sexual problems to be as high as 35% for men and 55% for women; however, there is little research directly assessing relationships between infection and sexual function.

Aim

To show that STIs are associated with (and may cause) sexual dysfunction. Conversely, sexual dysfunction can increase patients' risk of STI acquisition. In men, erectile dysfunction (ED) associated with condom use may lead to unsafe sexual practices and, hence, STI acquisition. The role of various therapies including phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment of ED in positive men taking social drugs will be explored.

Methods

To provide state-of-the-art knowledge concerning sexual function and STIs, representing the opinions of five experts from four countries developed in a consensus process and encompassing a detailed literature review over a 2-year period.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate.

Results

This article highlights major factors causing the spread of STIs and suggests management interventions to prevent further spread of HIV/STIs, focusing on the juxtaposition between STIs and sexual functioning. Women's unique vulnerabilities to HIV/STIs (biological and physiological issues, gender-based violence, gender inequity) and their impact on women's sexual function are reviewed. Similarly, men's unique vulnerabilities to HIV/STIs including condom use, disclosure, voluntary counseling and testing, multiple concurrent sexual partners, and recreational drug use--particularly in homosexual men--are explored, as is the association of prostatitis and sexual function. Lastly, the article reviews the relationship between circumcision and sexual dysfunction.

Conclusions

A multidimensional approach to achieve optimal treatment outcomes should be embraced.

Management of sex partners—evaluation, treatment, and timing: Partners who have had sexual contact with persons treated for gonorrhea or chlamydia <60 days before the onset of the persons symptoms should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for the respective infection. Partners of persons with proctitis should be evaluated for any diseases diagnosed in the index partner, sex partners should abstain from sexual contact until they and their partners are treated, and no specific recommendations are available for screening or treating sex partners of persons with diagnosed sexually transmitted enteric pathogens; however, partners should seek care if symptomatic.

### Antibiotics for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non-pregnant women [^e5377587]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. The infection is mainly asymptomatic in women, thus it can produce infertility and chronic pelvic pain. In men infection is mainly symptomatic, but can evolve to prostatitis. Clinical practice guidelines for CT urogenital infections do not give any specific recommendation about which antibiotic use as first option OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for CT genital infection in men and non-pregnant women.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections' (STI) Information Specialist developed the electronic searches in electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS), and trials registers. We searched studies published from inception to June 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of men, and sexually-active, non-pregnant women with CT infection (urethritis or uterine cervicitis or asymptomatic), diagnosed by cell culture for CT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) or antigen-based detection methods, who had been treated with any of the antibiotic regimens recommended by any of the updated to 2013 CT Guidelines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors screened evidence according to selection criteria and independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Two authors developed the 'Summary of findings' tables. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis model for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect. We estimated the pooled risk ratio in order to establish the effects of the comparisons. Our primary outcomes were microbiological failure and adverse events, and our secondary outcomes were clinical failure, antimicrobial resistance and reinfection.

Main Results

We selected 14 studies ( 2715 participants: 2147 (79.08%) men and 568 (20.92%) women). The studies were conducted mainly at STD clinics. Sample sizes ranged from 71 to 606 participants; follow-up was 29.7 days on average.For the comparison: azithromycin single dose versus doxycycline once or twice daily for 7 days, in men treated for CT, the risk of microbiological failure was higher in the azithromycin group (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.41; participants = 821; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence), but regarding clinical failure, the results showed that the effect is uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.43 to 2,05; I² = 55%; participants = 525; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). Regarding adverse events (AE) in men there could be little or no difference between the antibiotics (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; participants = 1424; studies = 6; low-quality evidence). About women treated for CT, the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 6.16; participants = 338; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence). There were no studies assessing clinical failure or adverse events in women, however, we found that azithromycin probably has fewer adverse events in both genders (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98; I² = 0%; participants = 2261; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence).For the second comparison: doxycycline compared to ofloxacin, for men treated for CT the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR 8.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 167.38, I² not applicable; participants = 80; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence), as also it was on clinical failure (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.62; participants = 36; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). The effect of in women on clinical failure was uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.25; I² = 39%; participants = 127; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence).Regarding adverse events, the effect in both men and women was uncertain (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; participants = 339 studies = 3; very low-quality evidence). The effect on microbiological failure in women and in men and women together, the effect on microbiological failure was not estimable. The most frequently AE reported were not serious and of gastrointestinal origin.No studies assessed antimicrobial resistance or reinfection in either comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

In men, regimens with azithromycin are probably less effective than doxycycline for microbiological failure, however, there might be little or no difference for clinical failure. For women, we are uncertain whether azithromycin compared to doxycycline increases the risk of microbiological failure. Azithromycin probably slightly reduces adverse events compared to doxycycline in men and women together but may have little difference in men alone. We are uncertain whether doxycycline compared to ofloxacin reduces microbiological failure in men or women alone, or men and women together, nor if it reduces clinical failure or adverse events in men or women.Based on the fact that women suffer mainly asymptomatic infections, and in order to test the effectiveness and safety of the current recommendations (azithromycin, doxycycline and ofloxacin), for CT infection, especially in low and middle income countries, future RCTs should be designed and conducted to include a large enough sample size of women, and with low risk of bias. It is also important that future RCTs include adherence, CT resistance to antibiotic regimens, and risk of reinfection as outcomes to be measured. In addition, it is important to conduct a network meta-analysis in order to evaluate all those studies that included in one arm only the current antibiotic treatments for CT infection that are recommended by the updated clinical practice guidelines.

### Prostatitis [^e9b2d46c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is a common condition that accounts for a significant number of visits to both the emergency department and the urologist.  The precise pathogenic mechanism of prostatitis is not known.  The most prevalent theory is that reflux of urine from the urethra into the  intraprostatic ducts promotes ascending infection and leads to chemical or bacterial prostatitis.  Treatment is challenging because many antimicrobial agents do not effectively diffuse into prostatic tissue and many cases of prostatitis are not found to have an infectious etiology.  Prostatitis can be divided into different classifications which range from acute severe infections, to chronic indolent infections, to chronic pain syndromes. The differentiation and management of these entities can be difficult.  This article seeks to clarify the different infections, and provide a rational approach to treatment and disposition of these patients.

### Acute and chronic prostatitis [^d5a937a1]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostatitis is a common clinical syndrome classified into four categories: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic. Bacterial prostatitis (acute and chronic) is primarily diagnosed with history and microbiologic studies, although physical examination can be helpful to localize infection within the genitourinary system. Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics; the span of treatment is guided by the duration of symptoms and presence of complications. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is the most common form of prostatitis and is a diagnosis of exclusion with no standardized treatments. Asymptomatic prostatitis does not require treatment and is usually diagnosed incidentally during the workup for other urologic presentations.

### Treatment of bacterial prostatitis [^4454800a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is characterized by voiding symptoms and genitourinary pain and is sometimes associated with sexual dysfunction. Up to 25% of men receive a diagnosis of prostatitis in their lifetime, but <10% have a proven bacterial infection. The causes and treatment of nonbacterial prostatitis are largely unknown, but bacterial prostatitis is caused by infection with uropathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli, although infection is sometimes due to gram-positive and atypical microorganisms. Acute bacterial prostatitis is easily diagnosed (by abrupt urogential and often systemic symptoms, along with bacteriuria) and treated (by systemic antibiotic therapy). Chronic bacterial prostatitis is characterized by prolonged or recurrent symptoms and relapsing bacteriuria; diagnosis traditionally requires comparing urinary specimens obtained before with specimens obtained after prostatic massage. Treating chronic bacterial prostatitis requires prolonged therapy with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostate (ie, one with high lipid solubility, a low degree of ionization, high dissociation constant, low protein binding, and small molecular size). We review recent pharmacological and clinical data on treating bacterial prostatitis.

Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfections, men treated for NGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved or for 7 days after single-dose therapy). Men with NGU should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

Follow-Up

Men should be provided their testing results obtained as part of the NGU evaluation. Those with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Trichomoniasis).

If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis. Symptoms alone, without documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of urethral inflammation, are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to the possible diagnosis of chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men experiencing persistent perineal, penile, or pelvic pain or discomfort; voiding symptoms; pain during or after ejaculation; or new-onset premature ejaculation lasting for >3 months. Men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

Management of Sex Partners

All sex partners of men with NGU within the preceding 60 days should be referred for evaluation and testing and presumptive treatment with a drug regimen effective against chlamydia. All partners should be evaluated and treated according to the management section for their respective pathogen; EPT could be an alternate approach if a partner is unable to access timely care. To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.

### Bacterial prostatitis [^521f7dea]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is perhaps the most common urologic complaint in men younger than 50 years of age and affects 11% to 16% of American men over the course of their lifetimes. Prostatitis syndromes have a significant psychologic impact upon patients who suffer from them and place an enormous financial strain upon the health care system. Despite many advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of prostatitis, current management strategies are unable to provide a significant portion of relief from symptoms. In this article, we focus on bacterial prostatitis (types I and II), with an emphasis on new understandings of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for these often challenging patients.

### Prostatitis: diagnosis and treatment [^fd6c75ef]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis ranges from a straightforward clinical entity in its acute form to a complex, debilitating condition when chronic. It is often a source of frustration for the treating physician and patient. There are four classifications of prostatitis: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic. Diagnosis of acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis is primarily based on history, physical examination, urine culture, and urine specimen testing pre- and post-prostatic massage. The differential diagnosis of prostatitis includes acute cystitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract stones, bladder cancer, prostatic abscess, enterovesical fistula, and foreign body within the urinary tract. The mainstay of therapy is an antimicrobial regimen. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a more challenging entity, in part because its pathology is poorly understood. Diagnosis is often based on exclusion of other urologic conditions (e.g., voiding dysfunction, bladder cancer) in association with its presentation. Commonly used medications include antimicrobials, alpha blockers, and anti-inflammatory agents, but the effectiveness of these agents has not been supported in clinical trials. Small studies provide limited support for the use of nonpharmacologic modalities. Asymptomatic prostatitis is an incidental finding in a patient being evaluated for other urologic problems.

Methods

This systematic review of the evidence was guided by 2 types of key questions (Table): informational questions outlining data published since the 2015 update to the CDC treatment guidelines and discussion questions outlining how the evidence should inform guidelines. We identified articles published in English since the 2015 treatment guidelines (January 1, 2015–November 30, 2021) by using the search terms mycoplasma AND genitalium OR M. genitalium to search PubMed. One investigator (L.E.M.) reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for inclusion. All authors verified included papers. In this article, we focus on new evidence on disease syndromes and antibiotic therapy and the implications for testing and treatment strategies.

### Antimicrobial therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis [^c95ae38a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) is frequently diagnosed in men of fertile age, and is characterized by a disabling array of symptoms, including pain in the pelvic area (for example, perineum, testicles), voiding symptoms (increased frequency and urgency, also at night; pain or discomfort at micturition), and sexual dysfunction. Cure of CBP can be attempted by long-term therapy with antibacterial agents, but relapses are frequent. Few antibacterial agents are able to distribute to the prostatic tissue and achieve sufficient concentrations at the site of infection. These agents include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim. After the introduction of fluoroquinolones into clinical practice, a number of studies have been performed to optimize the antimicrobial treatment of CBP, and to improve eradication rates and symptom relief.

Objectives

To assess and compare the efficacy and harm of antimicrobial treatments for chronic bacterial prostatitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, other national or international databases and abstracts from conference proceedings on 8 August 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled comparisons of one antimicrobial agent versus placebo or one or more comparator antimicrobial agents, combined or not with non-antimicrobial drugs. We also included trials comparing different doses, treatment durations, dosing frequencies, or routes of administration of antimicrobial agents. We excluded studies in which patients were not diagnosed according to internationally recommended criteria, or were not subjected to lower urinary tract segmented tests.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study data were extracted independently by two review authors. Study outcomes were microbiological efficacy (pathogen eradication), clinical efficacy (symptom cure or improvement, or symptom scores) at test-of-cure visits or at follow-up, or both, and adverse effects of therapy. Secondary outcomes included microbiological recurrence rates.Statistical analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model for microbiological outcomes and a random-effects model for clinical outcomes and adverse effects. The results were expressed as risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes (with 95% confidence intervals) or as standardized mean differences for continuous or non-dichotomous variables.

Main Results

We identified 18 studies, enrolling a total of 2196 randomized patients. The oral fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin and prulifloxacin were compared. There were no significant differences in clinical or microbiological efficacy or in the rate of adverse effects between these fluoroquinolones. In chlamydial prostatitis, (i) azithromycin showed improved eradication rates and clinical cure rates compared to ciprofloxacin, with no significant differences regarding adverse effects; (ii) azithromycin was equivalent to clarithromycin, both microbiologically and clinically; (iii) prulifloxacin appeared to improve clinical symptoms, but not eradication rates, compared to doxycycline. In ureaplasmal prostatitis, the comparisons ofloxacin versus minocycline and azithromycin versus doxycycline showed similar microbiological, clinical and toxicity profiles.

Authors' Conclusions

The microbiological and clinical efficacy, as well as the adverse effect profile, of different oral fluoroquinolones are comparable. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the optimal treatment duration of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens.Alternative antimicrobial agents tested for the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens are co-trimoxazole, beta-lactams and tetracyclines, but no conclusive evidence can be drawn regarding the role of non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens.In patients with CBP caused by obligate intracellular pathogens, macrolides showed higher microbiological and clinical cure rates compared to fluoroquinolones.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services for persons with HIV—assessment, condom counseling and provision, presumptive treatment, and scope—are detailed as follows: Assessment of behavioral and biologic risk factors is recommended at initial and subsequent visits in clinical settings providing continuing care, and in clinical or nonclinical settings that provide one-time or episodic STD services, assessment is recommended at initial encounter and when clients seek follow-up services; recalling clients specifically for risk assessment may not be feasible. In this section, the term “assess” means eliciting information about behavioral and biologic risk factors for HIV transmission, including history of STD and STD symptoms, and the term “screen” means testing for STD pathogens in persons without symptoms. This section does not address screening persons with HIV for other conditions that have not been shown to facilitate HIV transmission to others, such as viral hepatitis and human papillomavirus infection. All source guidance advises providing information or counseling about condom use; guidance from the Health Resources and Services Administration advises providing condoms to patients in publicly funded clinics. According to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines, immediate presumptive treatment (or immediate linkage to such treatment) is recommended for persons who report sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis or have STD syndromes in order to reduce the risk of onward STD transmission; STD syndromes are conditions that can be caused by sexually transmitted pathogens and cause symptoms or abnormal findings (signs) on physical examination, such as genital ulcer disease, urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and proctitis. The cited source guidance describes the rationale for retesting for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection; the Evidence topic describes the rationale for retesting for trichomoniasis.

The fluoroquinolone antibiotics given for 2 to 4 weeks will cure about 70% of chronic bacterial infections of the prostate. If this treatment fails, the symptomatic manifestations of the infections can almost always be eliminated with suppressive antimicrobial therapy using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, or nitrofurantoin.

Other management considerations—abstinence, testing, and prevention: To minimize transmission and reinfection, patients treated for acute proctitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e., until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved). All persons with acute proctitis and concern for sexually transmitted proctocolitis or enteritis should be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (at other exposed sites). PEP should be considered for exposures that present a risk for HIV acquisition, and for ongoing risk for HIV acquisition, PrEP should be considered. Evidence-based interventions for preventing acquisition of sexually transmitted enteric pathogens are not available; however, recommendations include avoiding contact with feces during sex, using barriers, and washing hands after handling materials that have been in contact with the anal area (i.e., barriers and sex toys) and after touching the anus or rectal area.

### How I manage bacterial prostatitis [^46bd9f78]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial prostatitis is a highly prevalent infection responsible for significant morbidity among men. The diagnosis and treatment for bacterial prostatitis remains complicated. The difficulty in diagnosis is in part owing to the paucity of high-quality evidence that guides a clinician's interpretation of patients' history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Treatment is challenging because of the few antimicrobials capable of prostate penetration, growing antimicrobial resistance limiting effective treatment options, and the high risk of recurrence.

Objectives

We aimed to provide a useful resource for clinicians in effectively diagnosing and managing acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) and chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP).

Sources

A PubMed literature search on prostatitis was performed with no restrictions on publication date.

Content

The epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment for ABP and CBP are explored using a clinical vignette as relevant context.

Implications

Bacterial prostatitis can be diagnosed through a focused history and microbiological investigations. The Meares-Stamey 4-glass test or modified 2-glass test can help confirm the diagnosis if uncertainty exists. Typical uropathogens are common contributors to bacterial prostatitis but there is growing interest in exploring the role atypical and traditional non-pathogenic organisms may have. Fluoroquinolones remain first-line therapy, followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or doxycycline if the pathogen is susceptible. Fosfomycin has emerged as a repurposed and useful agent because of the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens can be challenging and is dependent on the host, chronicity of symptoms, uropathogens' susceptibilities, antimicrobials' side effect profile, and the presence of prostatic abscesses or calcifications. ABP can typically be treated similar to other complicated urinary tract infections. However, CBP requires prolonged therapy, with a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks of therapy.

Diseases Characterized by Urethritis and Cervicitis

Urethritis

Urethritis, as characterized by urethral inflammation, can result from either infectious or noninfectious conditions. Symptoms, if present, include dysuria, urethral pruritis, and mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge. Signs of urethral discharge on examination can also be present among persons without symptoms. Although N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are well established as clinically important infectious causes of urethritis, M. genitalium has been strongly associated with urethritis and, less commonly, prostatitis (–). If POC diagnostic tools (e.g. Gram, methylene blue [MB], or gentian violet [GV] stain microscopy) are unavailable, drug regimens effective against both gonorrhea and chlamydia should be administered. Further testing to determine the specific etiology is recommended for preventing complications, reinfection, and transmission because a specific diagnosis might improve treatment compliance, delivery of risk-reduction interventions, and partner services. Both chlamydia and gonorrhea are reportable to health departments. NAATs are preferred for detecting C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, and urine is the preferred specimen for males. NAAT-based tests for diagnosing T. vaginalis among men with urethritis have not been cleared by FDA; however, laboratories have performed the CLIA-compliant validation studies needed to provide such testing.

Etiology

Multiple organisms can cause infectious urethritis. The presence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) or purple intracellular diplococci (MB or GV) on urethral smear is indicative of presumed gonococcal infection, which is frequently accompanied by chlamydial infection. Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), which is diagnosed when microscopy of urethral secretions indicate inflammation without GNID or MB or GV purple intracellular diplococci, is caused by C. trachomatis in 15%–40% of cases; however, prevalence varies by age group, with a lower proportion of disease occurring among older men. Documentation of chlamydial infection as NGU etiology is essential because of the need for partner referral for evaluation and treatment to prevent complications of chlamydia, especially for female partners. Complications of C. trachomatis –associated NGU among males include epididymitis, prostatitis, and reactive arthritis.

### Prostatitis: a review [^61c1eab4]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prostatitis is defined as infection, inflammation, or pain of the prostate gland and affects approximately 9.3% of men in their lifetime.

Observations

Acute bacterial prostatitis consists of a urinary tract infection (UTI) that includes infection of the prostate, typically associated with fever or chills and caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas, in 80% to 97% of cases. First-line therapy for acute prostatitis is broad-spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics, such as intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or oral ciprofloxacin, which has a 92% to 97% success rate when prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks for people with febrile UTI and acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain. Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) measures symptom severity (scale of 0-43), with a 6-point change considered clinically meaningful. First-line oral therapy for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms is α-blockers (eg, tamsulosin, alfuzosin; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference vs placebo=-10.8 to -4.8). Other oral therapies are associated with modest changes in NIH-CPSI score compared with placebo, including anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference=-2.5 to -1.7), pregabalin (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference=-2.4), and pollen extract (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference=-2.49).

Conclusions and Relevance

Prostatitis includes acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and CP/CPPS, each of which is diagnosed and treated differently. First-line treatments are broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute bacterial prostatitis (such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin), at least 4 weeks of fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis, and α-blockers for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms.

HIV Risk Among Men Who Have Sex with Men

MSM are disproportionately at risk for HIV infection. In the United States, the estimated lifetime risk for HIV infection among MSM is one in six, compared with heterosexual men at one in 524 and heterosexual women at one in 253. These disparities are further exacerbated by race and ethnicity, with African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM having a one in two and a one in four lifetime risk for HIV infection, respectively. For HIV, transmission occurs much more readily through receptive anal sex, compared with penile-vaginal sex. Similar to other STIs, multiple partners, anonymous partners, condomless sex, and substance use are all associated with HIV infection (–). Importantly, other STIs also might significantly increase the risk for HIV infection (–). An estimated 10% of new HIV infections were attributable to chlamydial or gonococcal infection. A substantial number of MSM remain unaware of their HIV diagnosis. Clinical care involving MSM, including those who have HIV infection, should involve asking about STI-related risk factors and routine STI testing. Clinicians should routinely ask MSM about their sexual behaviors and symptoms consistent with common STIs, including urethral discharge, dysuria, ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, and anorectal symptoms that might be consistent with proctitis (e.g. discharge, rectal bleeding, pain on defecation, or pain during anal sex). However, certain STIs are asymptomatic, especially at rectal and pharyngeal sites, and routine testing is recommended. In addition, clinicians should provide education and counseling regarding evidence-based safer-sex approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing STI incidence (see HIV Infection, Detection, Counseling, and Referral).

Trichomonas vaginalis infections in men are traditionally considered to be benign and consequently have been overlooked. However, men with this common sexually transmitted infection can experience urethritis, prostatitis, reduced fertility, and amplified human immunodeficiency virus risk. In addition, men are often asymptomatic and can unknowingly spread the infection to their female sexual partners. With advances in T. vaginalis diagnostics, more men are being diagnosed, yet the optimal method of treatment in men remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to discuss the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of T. vaginalis among men.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^76affe0d]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Issue with conventional designs

Historically, RCTs have an experimental and comparator arm, or two contrasting experimental arms. An issue with conventional two-arm trials is that they are unlikely to identify optimal treatment durations, potentially leading to suboptimal clinical practice. An approach that is more likely to identify optimal treatment durations is the modelling of duration–response curves.

In the specific example of prostatitis, we could design a conventional RCT comparing, for example, treatment durations of 14 versus 28 days. Depending on whether the trial is designed to show superiority or non-inferiority, the trial answers the question ‘is 14 days of antibiotic treatment for prostatitis as good as/worse/better than 28 days of treatment?’ (Fig. 1). However, this does not answer the more important question of ‘what is the optimal antibiotic treatment duration for prostatitis?’ The dot-dashed line in the top panel could occur if there is some non-compliance with the shorter duration as randomised, because patients are not cured (e.g. may still have persisting minor symptoms, which might then relapse without further antibiotic treatment) at the end of their assigned duration (and hence more patients end up receiving the standard duration (28 days) despite being randomised to a shorter duration). In practice, not all patients will require the same duration and, at the population level, the proportion of patients that are not cured will likely decrease with increasing assigned duration, as will the proportion with non-compliance, creating the dot-dashed line in the top panel.

Duration–response curves corresponding to an intention-to-treat analysis. Diamonds show hypothesised event rates for the two randomised groups as designed. The solid and dot-dashed lines show different hypothesised duration–response curves that are compatible with those hypothesised event rates. This figure illustrates that conventional randomised controlled trials that compare two different durations do not provide information about other durations, especially if one duration is clearly superior to the other

### Common questions about chronic prostatitis [^16190e59]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic prostatitis is relatively common, with a lifetime prevalence of 1.8% to 8.2%. Risk factors include conditions that facilitate introduction of bacteria into the urethra and prostate (which also predispose the patient to urinary tract infections) and conditions that can lead to chronic neuropathic pain. Chronic prostatitis must be differentiated from other causes of chronic pelvic pain, such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and pelvic floor dysfunction; prostate and bladder cancers; benign prostatic hyperplasia; urolithiasis; and other causes of dysuria, urinary frequency, and nocturia. The National Institutes of Health divides prostatitis into four syndromes: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP), chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (CNP)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. CBP and CNP/CPPS both lead to pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. CBP presents as recurrent urinary tract infections with the same organism identified on repeated cultures; it responds to a prolonged course of an antibiotic that adequately penetrates the prostate, if the urine culture suggests sensitivity. If four to six weeks of antibiotic therapy is effective but symptoms recur, another course may be prescribed, perhaps in combination with alpha blockers or nonopioid analgesics. CNP/CPPS, accounting for more than 90% of chronic prostatitis cases, presents as prostatic pain lasting at least three months without consistent culture results. Weak evidence supports the use of alpha blockers, pain medications, and a four- to six-week course of antibiotics for the treatment of CNP/CPPS. Patients may also be referred to a psychologist experienced in managing chronic pain. Experts on this condition recommend a combination of treatments tailored to the patient's phenotypic presentation. Urology referral should be considered when appropriate treatment is ineffective. Additional treatments include pelvic floor physical therapy, phytotherapy, and pain management techniques. The UPOINT (urinary, psychosocial, organ-specific, infection, neurologic/systemic, tenderness) approach summarizes the various factors that may contribute to presentation and can guide treatment.

### The etiology and management of acute prostatitis [^2776ed6d]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial prostatitis is a common and clinically important genitourinary disorder. Patient populations who are at especially high risk of acute prostatitis include those with diabetes, cirrhosis, and suppressed immune systems. The cause is usually an ascending infection, but bacteria can also be introduced during transrectal prostate biopsy. Clinical presentation ranges from mild lower urinary tract symptoms to full sepsis. The causative organisms are usually similar to those that cause other common genitourinary infections, and include Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. Oral or intravenous antibiotics are usually effective for curing the infection and progression to chronic bacterial prostatitis is, therefore, uncommon. Immunosuppressed patients require special consideration, as bacterial prostatitis in these patients can be caused by atypical infecting organisms and might, therefore, require additional therapies. A lack of response to standard therapy can lead to complications such as a prostatic abscess or fistula.

### Bacterial prostatitis [^405c41e8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review provides the infectious disease community with a urologic perspective on bacterial prostatitis. Specifically, the article briefly reviews the categorization of prostatitis by type and provides a distillation of new findings published on bacterial prostatitis over the past year. It also highlights key points from the established literature.

Recent Findings

Cross-sectional prostate imaging is becoming more common and may lead to more incidental diagnoses of acute bacterial prostatitis. As drug resistance remains problematic in this condition, the reemergence of older antibiotics such as fosfomycin, has proven beneficial. With regard to chronic bacterial prostatitis, no clear clinical risk factors emerged in a large epidemiological study. However, bacterial biofilm formation has been associated with more severe cases. Surgery has a limited role in bacterial prostatitis and should be reserved for draining of a prostatic abscess or the removal of infected prostatic stones.

Summary

Prostatitis remains a common and bothersome clinical condition. Antibiotic therapy remains the basis of treatment for both acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Further research into improving prostatitis treatment is indicated.

### Epidemiologic association between prostatitis and prostate cancer [^399badb8]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To quantify the relationship between prostatitis and prostate cancer by pooling previous epidemiologic studies of this association.

Methods

A comprehensive search for articles published through 2000 was performed, blinded reviews of each study were conducted, data were abstracted, and all such studies were pooled.

Results

In this meta-analysis, an increased risk was seen among men with a history of prostatitis (odds ratio = 1.6), particularly with population-based case-control studies (odds ratio = 1.8). Increased relative risk estimates were also seen among men with a history of syphilis and a history of gonorrhea.

Conclusions

These associations with prostate cancer suggest that infections may represent one mechanism through which prostate cancer develops. However, causality is unclear, because recall bias and detection bias cannot be ruled out. Future cohort studies of prostate cancer should examine sexually transmitted infections, as well as other infections, as potential risk factors.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^220d5dcb]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

For each indication we calculated the proportion of prescriptions longer than the recommended duration separately for children (<16 years) and for people aged 16 years or older, and by antibiotic where guidelines recommended different durations for particular drugs. Because guidelines recommend longer antibiotic courses to treat acute cystitis in males than females,we performed separate analyses for males and females for this condition. The cause of acute prostatitis in young men is often differentfrom that in older men (sexually transmitted organisms versus mostly Enterobacteriaceae, respectively), and prescribers might fear chronic prostatitis more in older men. Therefore we evaluated three age groups for acute prostatitis: <35, 35-65, and >65 years old. In addition, for all conditions we performed a secondary analysis restricting to healthy patients, defined as those with no chronic kidney disease, COPD, asthma, coronary heart disease, immunosuppressive disease, or use of immunosuppressive drugs, systemic corticosteroids, or inhaled corticosteroids.

We used multiple imputations through chained equations using sequential regression trees to impute duration data that were missing in 10-20% of the consultations (see supplementary file 2 for more details).Confidence intervals were calculated using multiple imputation Wilson intervals, which have better properties than the usual multiple imputation confidence intervals, in particular always being bounded by zero and one.In sensitivity analysis, we restricted the analysis to data with no missing values.

In addition, we calculated the total number of excess antibiotic days, defined as the total number of days beyond the recommended duration in the guidelines.

All analyses were performed using R version 3.4.3 (packages: “dplyr,” “ggplot2,” “mice,” “nlme”).

Patient and public involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Results will be disseminated to relevant patient communities through news media.

Introduction

The term “sexually transmitted infection” (STI) refers to a pathogen that causes infection through sexual contact, whereas the term “sexually transmitted disease” (STD) refers to a recognizable disease state that has developed from an infection. Physicians and other health care providers have a crucial role in preventing and treating STIs. These guidelines are intended to assist with that effort. Although the guidelines emphasize treatment, prevention strategies and diagnostic recommendations also are discussed.

This report updates Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2015 and should be regarded as a source of clinical guidance rather than prescriptive standards. Health care providers should always consider the clinical circumstances of each person in the context of local disease prevalence. These guidelines are applicable to any patient care setting that serves persons at risk for STIs, including family planning clinics, HIV care clinics, correctional health care settings, private physicians’ offices, Federally Qualified Health Centers, clinics for adolescent care, and other primary care facilities. These guidelines are focused on treatment and counseling and do not address other community services and interventions that are essential to STI and HIV prevention efforts.

These STI treatment guidelines complement Recommendations for Providing Quality Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinical Services, 2020 regarding quality clinical services for STIs in primary care and STD specialty care settings. This guidance specifies operational determinants of quality services in various clinical settings, describes on-site treatment and partner services, and indicates when STI-related conditions should be managed through consultation with or referral to a specialist.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^d78124c7]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacteria are increasingly able to resist antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased morbidity, deaths and costs worldwide. Antibiotic use is an important driver of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Selective pressure can be reduced by minimising antibiotic prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics are often unnecessary. Moreover, the duration of antibiotic courses can often be reduced without significantly compromising cure rates. Shortening antibiotic duration can have a large impact on reducing exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, including bacteria carried asymptomatically. Antibiotics are by far the most prescribed drugs for children, with more than 60 million systemic antibiotics dispensed annually in the US outpatient setting alone, and are amongst the most frequently prescribed drugs for adults.

An important challenge is that, for many infectious conditions, the optimal antibiotic course length remains unclear. Courses should be long enough to treat infections effectively, yet short enough to reduce the incidence of side effects and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. The continued need for antibiotics can be assessed with daily reviews for inpatients ; however, in practice, such reviews are not always performed or acted upon and antibiotics are often continued in order to complete currently recommended course durations. Further, in the outpatient or primary care setting, continued assessment of patients initiated on antibiotics is not feasible. Therefore, it is especially important to have strong evidence about optimal treatment durations in these settings.

Because observational studies comparing different antibiotic durations are potentially confounded by unmeasured patient factors influencing the need for prolonged treatment, evidence about the optimal treatment duration should, where possible, come from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, antibiotic durations for several infections managed in primary care, such as prostatitis, are not guided by RCT evidence on optimal treatment duration. Where treatment durations have been compared in RCTs, in most cases, two treatment durations were selected for comparison, both of which lacked a clear scientific rationale. Whilst RCTs designed in this way can be useful, there are disadvantages to this approach.

Herein, we discuss the main issue with conventional two-arm trial designs, how to assess the ‘optimal’ antibiotic treatment duration, four alternative trial designs that can estimate much needed duration–response relationships (subsequently denoted duration–response curves), and which of these designs has the most desirable properties.

### Prostatitis revisited: new definitions, new approaches [^17146ea6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Prostatitis syndromes represent an important health care problem resulting in considerable morbidity and expenditure of health care resources. Comparison of the traditional and consensus classification schemes demonstrates no changes in the traditional categories of acute bacterial prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Examining only the EPS, however, results in diagnosis of half of the patients with inflammatory CP/CPPS. An optimal diagnostic strategy required evaluation of the VB3 and SFA in addition to the traditional EPS examination. Such precision is necessary for research studies, but whether such precision is important clinically remains unproved. The new interest in optimal evaluation and characterization of patients with chronic prostatitis and related conditions has resulted in important research initiatives examining the etiology and optimal treatment for this large group of patients.

HIV Infection

Detection, Counseling, and Referral

Infection with HIV causes an acute but brief and nonspecific influenza-like retroviral syndrome that can include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, arthritis, or skin rash. Most persons experience at least one symptom; however, some might be asymptomatic or have no recognition of illness (–). Acute infection transitions to a multiyear, chronic illness that progressively depletes CD4 + T lymphocytes crucial for maintenance of effective immune function. Ultimately, persons with untreated HIV infection experience symptomatic, life-threatening immunodeficiency (i.e. AIDS).

Effective ART that suppresses HIV replication to undetectable levels reduces morbidity, provides a near-normal lifespan, and prevents sexual transmission of HIV to others (–,–). Early diagnosis of HIV and rapid linkage to care are essential for achieving these goals. Guidelines from both the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the International AIDS Society–USA Panel recommend that all persons with HIV infection be offered effective ART as soon as possible, both to reduce morbidity and mortality and to prevent HIV transmission.

STD specialty or sexual health clinics are a vital partner in reducing HIV infections in the United States. These clinics provide safety net services to vulnerable populations in need of HIV prevention services who are not served by the health care system and HIV partner service organizations. Diagnosis of an STI is a biomarker for HIV acquisition, especially among persons with primary or secondary syphilis or, among MSM, rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia. STD clinics perform only approximately 20% of all federally funded HIV tests nationally but identify approximately 30% of all new infections. Among testing venues, STD clinics are high performing in terms of linkage to HIV care within 90 days of diagnosis; during 2013–2017, the percentage of persons with a new diagnosis in an STD clinic and linked to care within 90 days increased from 55% to >90%.

### Inflammatory disorders of the prostate and the distal genital tract [^c1608316]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Inflammatory disease of the prostate and distal genital tract is emerging as a major health problem because it is estimated that up to 15% of adult men may be affected at some point in their lives. Clinically, the diagnosis of "prostatitis" refers to multiple disorders that cause pelvic pain and discomfort, ranging from acute bacterial infection to complex conditions that may not necessarily be caused by prostatic inflammation. Because the traditional etiology-based classification system did not always correlate with symptoms and therapeutic efficacy, a new classification of prostatitis has been suggested by the National Institutes of Health. New imaging techniques such as high-resolution transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and MR imaging provide exquisite anatomic detail and often play a crucial role in the evaluation of these patients.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^127e8e8b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU)—etiology and epidemiology in men are summarized: The presence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) or purple intracellular diplococci (MB or GV) on urethral smear is indicative of presumed gonococcal infection, whereas NGU is diagnosed when microscopy indicates inflammation without GNID or MB or GV purple intracellular diplococci, and C. trachomatis causes 15%–40% of cases with a lower proportion among older men. Documentation of chlamydial infection as NGU etiology is essential because of the need for partner referral for evaluation and treatment to prevent complications, and complications among males include epididymitis, prostatitis, and reactive arthritis. M. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and urethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU cases in the United States, with detection among symptomatic men reported as 11% in Australia, 12%–15% in the United Kingdom, 15% in South Africa, 19% in China, 21% in Korea, 22% in Japan, and 28.7% in the United States (range: 20.4%–38.8%). Data are inconsistent regarding other Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species as etiologic agents of urethritis, and the majority of men with Ureaplasma infections do not have overt disease unless a high organism load is present.

### Treatment of prostatitis | AAFP (...) [^bf643a8e]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

13 In a limited survey 7 of primary practitioners and urologists, it was found that most of them use TMP-SMX as the first-line agent in treating prostatitis. About 40 percent of urologists and 65 percent of primary care physicians treated patients for only two weeks. Extremely ill patients, such as those with sepsis, should be hospitalized to receive parenteral antibiotics, usually a broad-spectrum cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside. Supportive measures, such as antipyretics, analgesics, hydration and stool softeners, may also be needed. 14, 15 It is thought that the treatment failures are caused by poor antibiotic penetration of the prostate rather than by resistant organisms. In one case series, 16 400 mg of norfloxacin taken twice a day for 28 days achieved a cure rate in 64 percent of patients who had failed treatment with TMP-SMX, carbenicillin, or both.

Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis have been identified as potential pathogens, treatment should cover these organisms. Options for treatment are 100 mg of doxycycline or minocycline twice daily for 14 days, or erythromycin at 500 mg four times daily for 14 days. Hot sitz baths and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may provide some symptom relief. Some men may notice aggravation of symptoms with intake of alcohol or spicy foods and, if so, should avoid them. In men with irritative voiding symptoms, anticholinergic agents or alpha-blocking agents may be beneficial. Common choices include TMP-SMX, doxycycline or one of the fluoroquinolones. Treatment is often recommended for four weeks, although some clinicians use shorter courses.

Physicians should encourage hydration, treat pain appropriately and consider the use of NSAIDs, an alpha-blocking agent, or both. If symptoms persist, a more thorough evaluation for CNP/CPPS should be pursued. Some patients may need several trials of different therapies to find one that alleviates their symptoms.

Other Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfection, patients treated for acute proctitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved). Studies have reported that behaviors that facilitate enteric pathogen transmission might be associated with acquisition of other STIs, including HIV infection. All persons with acute proctitis and concern for sexually transmitted proctocolitis or enteritis should be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (at other exposed sites). PEP should be considered for exposures that present a risk for HIV acquisition. For ongoing risk for HIV acquisition, PrEP should be considered.

Evidence-based interventions for preventing acquisition of sexually transmitted enteric pathogens are not available. However, extrapolating from general infection control practices for communicable diseases and established STI prevention practices, recommendations include avoiding contact with feces during sex, using barriers, and washing hands after handing materials that have been in contact with the anal area (i.e. barriers and sex toys) and after touching the anus or rectal area.

Follow-Up

Follow-up should be based on specific etiology and severity of clinical symptoms. For proctitis associated with gonorrhea or chlamydia, retesting for the respective pathogen should be performed 3 months after treatment.

Management of Sex Partners

Partners who have had sexual contact with persons treated for gonorrhea or chlamydia <60 days before the onset of the persons symptoms should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for the respective infection. Partners of persons with proctitis should be evaluated for any diseases diagnosed in the index partner. Sex partners should abstain from sexual contact until they and their partners are treated. No specific recommendations are available for screening or treating sex partners of persons with diagnosed sexually transmitted enteric pathogens; however, partners should seek care if symptomatic.

Special Considerations

Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

Allergic reactions with third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone) are uncommon among persons with a history of penicillin allergy.

HIV Infection

Persons with HIV infection and acute proctitis might present with bloody discharge, painful perianal ulcers, or mucosal ulcers and LGV and herpes proctitis are more prevalent among this population. Presumptive treatment in such cases should include a regimen for genital herpes and LGV.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^57b31dd3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Other Management Considerations

To maximize adherence with recommended therapies and reduce complications and transmission, medication for gonococcal infection should be provided on-site and directly observed. If medications are unavailable when treatment is indicated, linkage to an STI treatment facility should be provided for same-day treatment. To minimize disease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea should be instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all sex partners are treated (7 days after receiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present). All persons who receive a diagnosis of gonorrhea should be tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.

Follow-Up

A test of cure (i.e. repeat testing after completion of therapy) is unnecessary for persons who receive a diagnosis of uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens. Any person with pharyngeal gonorrhea should return 7–14 days after initial treatment for a test of cure by using either culture or NAAT; however, testing at 7 days might result in an increased likelihood of false-positive tests. If the NAAT is positive, effort should be made to perform a confirmatory culture before retreatment, especially if a culture was not already collected. All positive cultures for test of cure should undergo antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Symptoms that persist after treatment should be evaluated by culture for N. gonorrhoeae (with or without simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility. Persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused by other organisms (see Urethritis; Cervicitis; Proctitis).

A high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae infection has been observed among men and women previously treated for gonorrhea. The majority of these infections result from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved patient education and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care <12 months after initial treatment.

Acute epididymitis—recommended antimicrobial regimens: For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea, the recommended regimen is Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM in a single dose plus Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days, with the footnote that for persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered. For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, or enteric organisms (men who practice insertive anal sex), the regimen is Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM in a single dose plus Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days. For acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms only, the regimen is Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days, and levofloxacin monotherapy should be considered if the infection is most likely caused by enteric organisms only, and gonorrhea has been ruled out by Gram, MB, or GV stain; this includes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary tract instrumentation procedures.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^ed6b41b6]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

For two of the antibiotic indications we studied, treatment was frequently prescribed for shorter durations than recommended—both urinary tract infections in men: acute cystitis and acute prostatitis. This could arise because prescribers appreciate that recommendations for these conditions are based on expert opinion and historical precedent rather than evidence, and that treatment durations for urinary tract infections in women have declined considerably in recent years. It needs to be established whether shorter treatment durations are effective for men with urinary tract infections, as this is a small but important patient population with a risk of harm from under-treatment. Notably, the conditions for which course durations tended to be less than recommended in the guidelines were those for which evidence supporting duration of treatment is weak (supplementary figs S5-S7).

In general, the preference seemed to be for antibiotic prescriptions with durations of five or seven days or multiples thereof, without a clear evidence base for this preference. The preference for such durations has been observed previously in other settings and depended more on local practice and subspecialty than on clinical features such as fever, comorbidities, and severity.In addition, for conditions where guidelines recommend longer durations, the percentage of prescriptions beyond the recommendation is substantially lower than for conditions where guidelines recommend a relatively short duration.

### Advances in diagnostics of sexually transmitted infections [^9bee42fb]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by various pathogens, many of which have common symptoms. Diagnostic tests are critical to supporting clinical evaluations in making patient management decisions. Molecular diagnostics are the preferred test type when available, especially in asymptomatic patients for many STIs. However, for some infections, serology offers the best insight into infectious status. Clinicians should be aware of the performance characteristics of the available STI diagnostic tests and understand how to use them. Point-of-care tests are helpful to implement rapid and accurate treatment responses, which are particularly helpful in certain at-risk populations.

### U.S. centers for disease control and prevention guidelines for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases: an opportunity to unify clinical and public health practice [^5e96721d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) constitute an epidemic of tremendous magnitude, with an estimated 15 million persons in the United States acquiring a new STD each year. Effective clinical management of STDs is a strategic common element in efforts to prevent HIV infection and to improve reproductive and sexual health. Sexually transmitted diseases may result in severe, long-term, costly complications, including facilitation of HIV infection, tubal infertility, adverse outcomes of pregnancy, and cervical and other types of anogenital cancer. The publication of national guidelines for the management of STDs, by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has been a key component of federal initiatives to improve the health of the U.S. population by preventing and controlling STDs and their sequelae. This paper presents new recommendations from the 2002 CDC Guidelines for the Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases in the context of current disease trends and public health.

Further considerations when managing proctitis caused by a sexually transmitted pathogen

Patients diagnosed in the gastroenterology clinic with an STI should be seen by an expert in sexual heath and associated infections, when clear information regarding their diagnosis should be provided to patients and their sexual contacts. Partner notification and screening should be undertaken (partners in preceding 3 months for primary syphilis, chlamydia, LGV, or rectal gonorrhoea, and 2 years for secondary or latent syphilis), and this may help to identify sexual networks with a high risk of future transmission. Empirical treatment for partners may be recommended until negative results of investigations are available. With respect to HSV, patients should be given advice on transmission risks and sharing information with partners. Co-infection with other sexually transmitted pathogens is common and so full sexual health screening including HIV, hepatitis B and C is advisable.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e8b20eae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management—men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10-14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^5a267aef]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Throughout this report, the evidence used as the basis for specific recommendations is discussed briefly. Publication of comprehensive, annotated discussions of such evidence is planned in a supplemental issue of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases after publication of the treatment guidelines. When more than one therapeutic regimen is recommended and the listed regimens have similar efficacy and similar rates of intolerance or toxicity, the recommendations are listed alphabetically. If differences are specified, regimens are prioritized on the basis of these differences. Recommended regimens should be used primarily; alternative regimens can be considered in instances of notable drug allergy or other medical contraindications to the recommended regimens. Alternative regimens are considered inferior to recommended regimens on the basis of available evidence regarding the principal outcomes and disadvantages of the regimens.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis and chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome: a consensus guideline [^323d4f6c]. BJU International (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for chronic bacterial prostatitis, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, PERG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider using the NIH-CPSI, IPSS, and UPOINT scales to assess initial symptom severity, evaluate phenotypic differences, and monitor response to therapeutic intervention.
