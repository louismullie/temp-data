## Question

treat hypovolemic hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating hypovolemic hyponatremia, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the hyponatremia. Then, I should assess symptom severity and hemodynamic stability to decide on hypertonic versus isotonic therapy. Next, I will outline treatment for severe symptoms, followed by treatment for stable hypovolemic cases. After that, I need to set correction limits and monitoring cadence, consider special populations, and finally address overcorrection and cause-specific management, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classification, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with hypotonic, hypovolemic hyponatremia before committing to saline therapy. Hypotonicity is supported by low measured serum osmolality, and hypovolemia is suggested by low urine sodium, typically less than 30 mmol/L, alongside clinical signs such as orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucosa, and decreased skin turgor, although I should double-check that clinical assessment alone is imperfect and that urine sodium can be misleading in certain contexts, so I must integrate history and exam with labs rather than rely on a single sign or test [^115evmgn] [^114txMQH] [^114NwZaW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify symptom severity and hemodynamic stability next because that dictates urgency and the choice of fluids. Severe symptoms include seizures, coma, respiratory distress, or signs of cerebral edema, whereas moderate symptoms include confusion, nausea, vomiting, headache, and gait instability; mild symptoms are subtle neurocognitive changes and weakness, and I need to remember that even mild chronic hyponatremia correlates with falls and fractures, so I should not dismiss it as benign [^114hmeK4] [^111WyraN].

> For patients with severe symptoms or hemodynamic instability, I will now examine the need for hypertonic saline, but wait, let me verify the dosing and targets. The recommended approach is 3% hypertonic saline given as 100–150 mL boluses, repeated up to three times at 10-minute intervals, aiming for a 4–6 mmol/L early rise to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy, with a hard limit of no more than 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk; I should check sodium 20 minutes after each bolus and stop once symptoms improve or the total rise approaches 10 mmol/L or sodium reaches 130 mmol/L, whichever comes first [^116Rry73] [^115WbE1C] [^1132UNHS] [^114C7k4P] [^114hmeK4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to apply the same hypertonic strategy to all hypovolemic patients, but I should correct that; in hypovolemic hyponatremia without severe neurologic symptoms, isotonic 0.9% saline is the therapy of choice because it restores effective arterial blood volume, suppresses non-osmotic vasopressin, and promotes free water excretion, thereby raising serum sodium more safely than hypertonic saline in this phenotype; typical infusion rates are 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h, titrated to clinical response, with balanced crystalloids acceptable alternatives in some protocols [^1144sLbT] [^111WyraN] [^114NwZaW] [^112xVMrb].

> I need to ensure correction limits are explicit and monitored, so let me verify the targets. For chronic hyponatremia, the safe total rise is generally limited to 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours, with stricter limits of 6–8 mmol/L in the first 24 hours for high-risk patients such as those with alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, liver disease, or very low starting sodium; I should double-check sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours once stable, and if overcorrection is detected, I should consider desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to relower sodium to stay within the safe window [^114C7k4P] [^11621z9d] [^1117skm3].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population where standard rules might not fully apply; I should review those. In exercise-associated hyponatremia, early fluid restriction and hypertonic saline boluses are prioritized, and isotonic saline should be avoided early unless true hypovolemia is proven, so I must not reflexively give normal saline in that setting; in liver disease with hypovolemia, normal saline is still appropriate for volume repletion; in pediatrics, isotonic maintenance fluids help prevent iatrogenic hyponatremia; and in neurocritical care after subarachnoid hemorrhage, fluid restriction is discouraged and hypertonic saline may be used cautiously while monitoring for cerebral salt wasting and natriuresis [^111Qzmkn] [^113cFjnz] [^115Kfw91] [^112xVMrb] [^114xCBiV].

> I should confirm how to handle overcorrection because that is where harm occurs. If sodium rises too quickly, I need to stop hypertonic or isotonic saline, give desmopressin 1–4 micrograms every 6–8 hours to halt aquaresis, and administer electrolyte-free water such as D5W at about 10 mL/kg over an hour, with careful monitoring of urine output and fluid balance; I need to check sodium every 2–4 hours during active correction and again after any corrective maneuver to ensure we return to the planned trajectory [^113PyTGH] [^1117skm3] [^114jzD4z].

> Next, I should review cause-specific management because treating the driver prevents recurrence. Gastrointestinal or renal losses should be corrected and ongoing losses accounted for in the fluid plan; thiazide diuretics should be stopped; adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism should be treated with hormone replacement; and once euvolemia is restored, if SIADH is unmasked, I should pivot to fluid restriction and consider solute therapy with urea or a loop diuretic plus salt tablet strategy rather than continuing saline, which can worsen SIADH-related hyponatremia [^112n6Umk] [^112MGZPb] [^114NwZaW].

> Let me reconsider the key principles to ensure internal consistency. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is a salt and water deficit state in which restoring effective circulating volume with isotonic saline is foundational; hypertonic saline is reserved for severe neurologic symptoms or imminent herniation risk, not for routine hypovolemic correction; and regardless of the fluid chosen, frequent sodium monitoring and adherence to correction limits are non-negotiable to avoid osmotic demyelination while reversing encephalopathy when present [^1144sLbT] [^114hmeK4] [^111WyraN].

---

Treat hypovolemic hyponatremia by restoring effective circulating volume with **isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)** [^1144sLbT] at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h [^1144sLbT], titrated to clinical response and urine output. This suppresses ADH, promotes free water excretion, and corrects sodium safely [^114NwZaW]. Use **hypertonic saline (3%)** only for severe neurologic symptoms (seizures, coma) [^114hmeK4] with 100 mL boluses repeated up to three times [^111Qzmkn], aiming for a 4–6 mmol/L early rise and stopping once symptoms improve or sodium reaches 130 mmol/L [^114hmeK4] [^1132UNHS]. Monitor sodium every 2–4 hours initially [^notfound]; limit total correction to ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination [^114C7k4P] [^11621z9d]. Address the underlying cause and avoid hypotonic fluids [^114hmeK4] [^1117skm3].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical features

Hypovolemic hyponatremia reflects **sodium and water loss** with relatively greater water retention due to ADH, producing low serum sodium with low plasma osmolality and concentrated urine [^114NwZaW]. Clinical features include orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucosa, decreased skin turgor, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and — when severe — seizures or coma [^114NwZaW].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Confirm hypotonic hyponatremia with **serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg** and assess volume status clinically and with urine sodium/osmolality [^115evmgn]. Typical findings include low urine sodium (< 30 mmol/L) and high urine osmolality (> 100 mOsm/kg) [^114txMQH]. Identify causes such as gastrointestinal losses, diuretics, adrenal insufficiency, or renal salt wasting [^112xVMrb].

---

## General principles of treatment

- **Restore effective circulating volume**: Use isotonic saline to suppress ADH and promote free water excretion [^1144sLbT] [^114NwZaW].
- **Correct sodium gradually**: Avoid rapid correction to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^114C7k4P] [^11621z9d].
- **Treat underlying cause**: Address the precipitating cause to prevent recurrence [^112n6Umk].

---

## Specific treatment strategies

### Mild to moderate hypovolemic hyponatremia

Use **isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)** infused at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h [^1144sLbT], titrated to blood pressure, urine output, and clinical response [^111bC6Vc]. Monitor serum sodium every 4–6 hours initially, then every 6–12 hours once stable. Limit total correction to ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid ODS [^114C7k4P] [^11621z9d].

---

### Severe symptomatic hypovolemic hyponatremia

- **Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl)**: Use for severe neurologic symptoms (seizures, coma) [^114hmeK4].
- **Bolus dosing**: 100 mL over 10 minutes; repeat up to three times if needed [^notfound].
- **Target rise**: 4–6 mmol/L early to reverse encephalopathy; stop when symptoms improve or sodium reaches 130 mmol/L [^1132UNHS].
- **Monitoring**: Check sodium every 2–4 hours during correction [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and prevention of complications

- **Frequent sodium monitoring**: Every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours as stable [^notfound].
- **Limit correction rate**: ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours; ≤ 18 mmol/L in 48 hours [^114C7k4P] [^11621z9d].
- **Manage overcorrection**: If sodium rises too fast, give desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to relower sodium safely [^113PyTGH] [^1117skm3].

---

## Special considerations

Avoid **vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans)** in hypovolemic hyponatremia because they can worsen volume depletion and cause hypotension [^114ThkwS]. In adrenal insufficiency, administer hormone replacement (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids) as indicated [^112n6Umk]. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is often hypervolemic; restrict fluids and use hypertonic saline for severe cases [^111Qzmkn].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm hypotonic hyponatremia and hypovolemia [^115evmgn] |
| 2 | Assess symptom severity and hemodynamic stability [^114hmeK4] |
| 3 | Mild/moderate: isotonic saline 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h [^1144sLbT] |
| 4 | Severe: hypertonic saline 100 mL boluses (max 3) [^notfound] |
| 5 | Monitor sodium frequently; limit correction rate [^114jzD4z] [^114C7k4P] |
| 6 | Treat underlying cause [^112n6Umk] |

---

Hypovolemic hyponatremia is best managed with **isotonic saline to restore volume** [^1144sLbT], reserving hypertonic saline for severe neurologic symptoms [^114hmeK4]. Close monitoring and adherence to correction limits are essential to prevent complications [^114C7k4P].

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia [^11534PiV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic (present > 48 hours) non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia occurs frequently, can be caused by various conditions, and is associated with shorter survival and longer hospital stays. Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect. Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent. Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^111Qzmkn]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations for approaches to treatments for hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117M8SDu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^116DDwPZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia is frequently observed in cancer patients and can be explained by malignant disease itself, concomitant comorbidities, physical stress (e.g. pain), or medication. In hospitalized cancer patients, hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality and length of hospital stay, and higher costs. It is widely accepted that the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) due to ectopic release of vasopressin accounts for the majority of cases. However, drugs including chemotherapies as well as targeted therapies, hypo- or hypervolemia, as well as other less frequent disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, myxedema, etc. must be ruled out as possible alternative causes. Diagnostic work-up is often viewed as complex, and treatment is considered cumbersome and potentially dangerous. However, despite the urgent need for better education on how to approach the hyponatremic patient, no evidence-based guideline for hyponatremia management specific to cancer patients is available. Current management strategies are not well characterized.

The multinational Hyponatremia Registry (NCT01240668) assessed the current state of treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in real-world hospital settings. This report focuses on the subgroup of patients with cancer and SIADH with the aim to determine which diagnostic and treatment modalities are employed, how effective they are, and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum [Na +].

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

Management Protocol

Table 5 summarizes the management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. Closed system formulas (formulas 2 to 7) provide estimates of the required saline volume and allow comparison between desired and observed changes in [Na] and, therefore, provide the frame for identifying the source of their deviations and the guide for appropriate treatment changes. The first aim of treatment is to avoid undercorrection of hyponatremia. Prescription of the volume of saline infused by formula 4 or 6 is suitable for this purpose. Monitoring is critical when saline is infused, particularly in hypovolemic hyponatremia in which water diuresis, overestimation of initial body water, and initial focusing on volume rather than tonicity issues complicate the treatment. Monitoring, with reduced frequency of [Na] measurement (usually once daily), is essential during treatment of hyponatremia without saline infusion.

Table 5.
Steps of the Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Many tests, especially urine chemistries and osmolality, cannot be obtained rapidly from all hospital laboratories. For this and other reasons, administration, along with saline, of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) to make urine free water excretion more predictable may be helpful in managing hypovolemic hyponatremia. Although furosemide will initially increase urinary sodium and potassium excretion, it is reasonable to assume that the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentration is equal to ≈75 mEq/L when a furosemide effect is present, at least until direct laboratory measurements are available. Because patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia have reduced total body sodium and probably water, care must be taken to replace more than the predicted urinary electrolyte and water losses with infused saline.

Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists may ultimately be extremely useful for treating complicated chronic hyponatremias. However, it is unclear how to best use these new agents at present. It is fair to say that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists appear to be very effective in the settings of heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and safe when administered as monotherapy. – Unfortunately, these agents are currently extremely expensive. Moreover, we would stress that these agents should be avoided during saline infusion to prevent the hazards of excessive water diuresis.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^112nQieF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The Hyponatremia Registry is the largest observational hyponatremia study to date. The current analysis focuses on the subgroup of cancer-related SIADH, which accounts for approximately one third of all cases of SIADH. With 358 patients, this analysis represents the largest group of cancer patients with SIADH ever studied.

Of note, 39% of all cancer patients initially enrolled as euvolemic hyponatremia had to be excluded, mostly because of clear signs of hypo- or hypervolemia. Thorough assessment of volume status, however, is key for determining the cause of hyponatremia. Although SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion, clinicians apparently readily interpret hyponatremia in cancer patients as SIADH without excluding alternative causes. In addition, a minimal set of lab results is mandatory for a diagnosis of SIADH, but was performed in only 46% and a hyponatremia expert was consulted in only 43% of patients. In line with these findings, sub-optimal management of hyponatremia in general is widespread, as has been reported repeatedly. However, in contrast to what we have previously demonstrated in the overall SIADH population, proper work-up of hyponatremia was not associated with superior treatment effectiveness in the cancer-related SIADH subgroup.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^1116ARCm]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The HN Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Patients with hypovolemic HN were excluded, as were those with hypervolemic HN in the EU cohort. A large number of patients were excluded at the time of adjudication. Sensitivity analysis showed no difference in the major outcomes when patients with suspected hypovolemia were restored to the analysis. We believe that the exclusion of these patients represents a conservative approach. Ascertainment varied from center to center; enrollment of consecutive cases was not required. Consequently, the study provides no information about relative prevalence of different etiologies of HN. Accurate determination of clinical volume status is difficult under the best of circumstances. The selection of diagnostic studies and treatments was left up to the clinicians responsible for patients, and the study relied on treating clinicians to make a diagnosis. Neither a fluid challenge nor a urine sodium determination was required as an entry criterion for putatively euvolemic patients. This limited our ability to exclude hypovolemia and independently confirm the presence of SIADH with precision. Because the study's intent was to capture 'real-world' practice, this limitation did not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH is treated. Indeed, a principal conclusion is that diagnostic rigor in the case of SIADH is severely lacking, even in a study situation where some treating physicians were aware that their diagnostic choices were being observed. Some therapies were used too infrequently to assess. For example, urea, a treatment shown to be effective in SIADH, and recommended in recent EU guidelines, was used in only 10 patients. Because of the large number of combinations used at low frequency, analysis focused on monotherapy and initial therapy episodes. The study did not specify, much less randomize, treatment choices. We were unable to determine the rationale for choosing a particular treatment. In particular, we could not determine how often NS was used initially in a diagnostic trial to exclude volume depletion in patients suspected of SIADH, a reasonable strategy for its use. Choice of treatments was likely confounded by indication, and the study cannot accurately assess whether any particular treatment shortened hospital stay. We were not able to fully assess how maneuvers such as discontinuation of a HN-inducing medication or treatment of CHF affected [Na +] changes or the decision to add another treatment maneuver. As a result, even the limited comparisons showing superiority or inferiority of particular treatments that were feasible must be interpreted with much circumspection.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^112xVMrb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The approach for the management of hyponatremia depends on the patient's volume status. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is typically attributed to an excess of total body water due to conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or heart, liver, and kidney failure. Euvolemic hyponatremia is caused by various conditions including Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), polydipsia, or hypothyroidism as there is a stable total body sodium level alongside an increase in total body water. Various risk factors for SIADH include central nervous system disturbances, lower respiratory tract infections, drugs, and certain malignancies. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is due to a depletion of total body sodium, often caused by gastrointestinal losses, the use of diuretics, and mineralocorticoid insufficiencies. Patients experiencing hypovolemic hyponatremia with shock require fluid resuscitation using 0.9% saline, Ringers, Plasmalyte, or other isotonic solutions to restore hemodynamic stability. Treatment for hypervolemic hyponatremia varies depending on the etiology. For example, heart failure may be treated with diuretics whereas dialysis can be used to treat patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Patients presenting with euvolemic hyponatremia, such as in the instance of SIADH or psychogenic polydipsia must undergo fluid restriction. However, in cases of hypothyroidism, the underlying condition should be addressed for treatment. Iatrogenic hyponatremia is another concern in pediatric patients undergoing treatment with intravenous fluids. The 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend using isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline or Ringer's lactate, to maintain proper sodium levels and prevent the development of iatrogenic hyponatremia.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117RCyx2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia represents a serious health hazard. Hospitalized patients, nursing home residents, women, – and childrenexhibit high frequency and/or severity of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia developing during the course of other morbid conditions increases their severity. – Estimates of direct costs for treating hyponatremia in the United States ranged between $1.61 and $3.6 billion.

Clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are universal – and range from subtle (disturbances of balance, problems in cognition detected only during specific testing) to life‐threatening manifestations of increased intracranial pressure with life‐threatening hypoxia – and noncardiac pulmonary edema. Although the treating physicians must make an accurate diagnosis based on well‐established and described clinical criteria, treatment is also guided by the severity of these manifestations. The magnitude and rate of increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na]) during treatment are critical. Overcorrection of chronic hyponatremia may lead to osmotic myelinolysis, – whereas undercorrection may fail to prevent life‐threatening manifestations.

The mainstays of treatment are restricted free water intake and saline infusion, with or without furosemide. There are 2 indications for saline infusion in hyponatremia. Overt manifestations of hyponatremia are treated with hypertonic saline, whereas symptomatic hypovolemia associated with hyponatremia without overt symptoms is usually treated with isotonic saline. – In both situations, the infusion of saline results in rising [Na]. This rise can be slower or faster than desired, with potentially dire clinical consequences.

To achieve the desired rise in [Na], several formulas, most often the Adrogue–Madias formula, are used to calculate volume, rate, and strength of saline infusion. The predictive accuracy of the Adrogue–Madias formula is, in general, good. However, the rise in [Na] exceeds the value predicted by this formula in some instances, particularly in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia. –

This report presents the principles of management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. We analyzed factors that cause deviations in the change of [Na] from the predicted values. We present a clinical protocol for managing hyponatremia with saline infusion based on this analysis.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^1175CAmS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

Volume status and urine sodium concentration

Assessment of volume status (to approximate ECF volume) is a frequently used method of classifying hyponatremia, though the accuracy of clinical examination has been shown to be poor. Although features indicative of hypovolemia such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, prolonged capillary refill, hypotension, and postural tachycardia are frequently mentioned in diagnostic algorithms, a systematic review found that few clinical signs of hypovolemia have proven utility, with widely ranging sensitivities between 29% and 85%, specificity 58% to 95%, and variable interobserver agreement. The most difficult distinction, which is critical in guiding initial management (ie, FR vs volume administration), is between apparent euvolemia in SIAD and mild hypovolemia. In one study, clinical assessment correctly identified only 47% of hypovolemic patients compared to the gold-standard method of diagnosing hypovolemic hyponatremia: serum sodium improvement with IV isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl). In hypovolemia, volume replacement with IV 0.9% saline treatment reduces the hypovolemic stimulus to AVP secretion, leading to improvement in serum sodium, in part by urinary dilution leading to excretion of excess free water. However, in SIAD, where AVP does not respond to the volume stimulus, the urine remains concentrated despite the IV fluid. Hence, IV 0.9% saline is not an effective treatment in SIAD as it may lead to a further reduction in serum sodium, as the water component is retained, coupled with ongoing renal sodium loss. In this scenario, 0.9% NaCl (osmolality 308 mOsmol/L) may be hypotonic relative to the concentrated urine (commonly > 500 mOsmol/L in SIAD) leading to net free water retention, worsening the hyponatremia. Consequently, this treatment should be reserved for patients with either clinical or biochemical indicators of ECF volume depletion — low urine sodium (UNa) concentration — despite the limitations of these assessments.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prehospital assessment — point-of-care testing and clinical evaluation: Devices and cartridges require a narrow ambient temperature range of 16 to 30°C (61 to 86°F) to ensure functionality. When testing is unavailable, correct field diagnosis is mostly predicated on obtaining an accurate history of total fluid intake, and supportive features include the absence of major signs and symptoms common to symptomatic hypovolemia, weight gain, and that urine output may be an unreliable differentiator. The guideline states, "When available, point-of-care testing should be done on at-risk, symptomatic patients. If unavailable, integrate all available clinical and historical information into an assessment of the patient's hydration status (history of fluid intake, food intake, preexisting signs and symptoms, body weight if available, and urine output). Recommendation grade: 1C".

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study plan

The study design has been described previously in detail. Briefly, patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic HN were enrolled from 146 US sites and patients with euvolemic HN were enrolled from 79 EU sites. We excluded patients with hypovolemic HN because this disorder should respond readily and completely to treatment of volume deficits, and it therefore poses no therapeutic dilemma. We excluded patient with hypervolemic HN from the EU study centers because tolvaptan is only approved in the EU for euvolemic patients. Inclusion of hypervolemic patients treated with tolvaptan would have created a regulatory burden for the sponsor. At each site, approval was sought from the appropriate research ethics review boards as required. After informed consent, absent a waiver, investigators prospectively recorded patient data. To ascertain patients, some centers systematically reviewed hospital laboratory-generated lists of patients with HN. Others enrolled only patients referred to or managed by the investigator personally. The study was exclusively observational; no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols were imposed. Investigators simply recorded the choices made by the physicians responsible for the patient's hospital care.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To assure that HN was clinically significant, the study required an entry [Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/l. Patients were excluded if < 18 years old, hypovolemic, hypervolemic (EU only), using an investigational agent or device, or if hyperglycemic enough to interfere with assessment of [Na +] or receiving renal replacement therapy while hyponatremic. As indicated in Supplementary Table S3 online, euvolemia was defined as the absence of clinical and historical evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion or sequestration, and the absence of edema and ascites, or on the basis of the treating physician's diagnosis of SIADH. Hypervolemia was defined as excess extracellular fluid volume manifesting as dependent edema or ascites. Although not a specified exclusion criterion originally, we subsequently decided to exclude any patient who was receiving a thiazide at the time the treating physician made a diagnosis of SIADH. It would be difficult to assure that such patients were not in fact hypovolemic, and diuretic use is generally considered to be an exclusion to the proper diagnosis of SIADH. This decision was made prior to data analysis. A complete listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as published previously, is provided as Supplementary Table S3 online.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

Hyponatremia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) — fluid and endocrine measures are directed as follows: Fluid restriction should not be used to treat hyponatremia (weak quality evidence; strong recommendation). Early treatment with hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone may be used to limit natriuresis and hyponatremia (moderate quality evidence; weak recommendation). Mild hypertonic saline solutions can be used to correct hyponatremia (very low quality evidence; strong recommendation). Extreme caution to avoid hypovolemia is needed if vasopressin-receptor antagonists are used for treatment of hyponatremia (weak quality evidence; strong recommendation). Free water intake via intravenous and enteral routes should be limited (very low quality evidence; strong recommendation).

Sodium Concentration and Volume of Infused Saline

Table 1 shows the symbols for volumes and concentrations used in this report. Sodium concentration in commercial saline solutions represents 2 hypertonic (0.855 and 0.513 mol/L), 1 "isotonic" (0.154 mol/L), and 3 "hypotonic" (0.130, 0.077, and 0.034 mol/L) values. Sodium concentration in the infusate is usually 0.513 mol/L for hyponatremia with pronounced symptomsand 0.154 mol/L for volume replacement in patients with symptomatic hypovolemia.

Table 1.
Symbols and Interpretations

The sodium concentration in the infusate should not be limited by the strength of the commercial saline solutions. Mixing of saline and dextrose in water can produce any desired sodium concentration by the use of formula 1 (Table 2), which can be of help in hypovolemic hyponatremia with minimal hyponatremic symptomatology, when a large volume of infusate must be reconciled with the need to produce only a modest rise in [Na]. A suitable sodium concentration of the infusate in this instance could be the target [Na] at 24 hours. For example, the target [Na] at 24 hours would be 117 mEq/L in a patient with hypovolemic hyponatremia and initial [Na] of 111 mEq/L. By formula 1, the addition of 0.316 L of dextrose in water to 1 L of 0.154 mol/L saline produces a sodium concentration of 117 mEq/L in the infusate.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^117RWnJQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113ho7wX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

### Vasopressin receptor antagonists for the treatment of hyponatremia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112L24Fh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, the effect of vasopressin antagonists is yet undefined.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Setting & Population

In- and outpatients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Selection Criteria For Studies

We included all RCTs regardless of publication status or language.

Intervention

Vasopressin antagonists with or without fluid restriction versus placebo or no treatment with or without fluid restriction.

Outcomes

Response rate defined as normalization of serum sodium level or significant increase in serum sodium level at 3–7 days (primary) and later, change from baseline serum sodium level at 3–7 days and later, adverse events, rate of rapid sodium level correction, and rate of hypernatremia.

Results

15 RCTs were identified. Vasopressin antagonist treatment significantly increased response rate both early (RR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.27–4.37; 11 trials) and late (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.79–2.89; 4 trials). Response rates were high in trials assessing mostly euvolemic patients and those assessing mostly hypervolemic patients, with greater effect estimate in the former. Change from baseline serum sodium level was significantly increased both early (weighted mean difference, 5.27 mEq/L; 95% CI, 4.27–6.26, 13 trials) and late (weighted mean difference, 3.49 mEq/L; 95% CI, 2.56–4.41, 8 trials). Although there was an increased rate of rapid sodium correction (RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.26–5.08, 8 trials) with vasopressin antagonists, hypernatremia rates were not significantly higher (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.61–7.96; 5 trials), adverse events were not increased, and there were no reports of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Limitations

Significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome.

Conclusions

Vasopressin antagonists are effective for the treatment of hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

### Vaptans for the treatment of hyponatremia [^114ThkwS]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The vaptans constitute a new class of pharmaceuticals developed for the treatment of the hypervolemic and euvolemic forms of hyponatremia. These agents are nonpeptide vasopressin antagonists that interfere with the antidiuretic effect of the hormone by competitively binding to V(2) receptors in the kidney. This blockade results in water diuresis (aquaresis) that, if not offset by increased fluid intake, reduces body water content and raises plasma sodium levels. Probably as a result of this rise in plasma sodium, thirst and plasma vasopressin concentration increase, potentionally limiting the effects of the vasopressin antagonists. Nonetheless, vaptans are particularly useful to treat hypervolemic hyponatremia associated with severe congestive heart failure or chronic liver failure, as the only other treatments currently available, such as fluid restriction and diuretics, are slow-acting and minimally effective. Vaptans are also useful for treating euvolemic hyponatremia associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), at least when it is chronic and/or minimally symptomatic. However, because their effects vary unpredictably from patient to patient, vaptans are less useful than hypertonic saline infusion in cases of acute, severe and symptomatic hyponatremia. Vaptan therapy is absolutely contraindicated in hypovolemic hyponatremia (in which total body water is reduced) and is ineffective in the vasopressin-independent form of inappropriate antidiuresis caused by constitutive activating mutations of V(2) receptors.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

In conclusion, data reported here from the HN Registry suggest that fluid restriction, the therapy administered most frequently for HN in patients with HF, is relatively ineffective, often results in undercorrection of [Na +], and is similar to no specific therapy for HN. Furthermore, most patients with HN remain hyponatremic at hospital discharge. It remains unknown whether more‐effective correction of [Na +] results in better outcomes for patients with HN hospitalized with acute HF. Given the high prevalence and poorer outcomes of patients with acute HF and HN, however, further research is needed regarding decision making and optimal approaches to effectively correct [Na +] in the inpatient setting.

### Recognition and treatment of hyponatremia in acutely ill hospitalized patients [^116nDHcR]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this paper was to discuss the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of hyponatremia among critically ill, hospitalized patients (eg, after surgery or in the intensive care unit).

Methods

English-language literature published between 1967 and 2006 was searched using several key words (AVP receptor antagonists, hyponatremia, SIADH, conivaptan, tolvaptan, and lixivaptan) and by accessing MEDLINE and ScienceDirect. Meeting abstracts from scientific sessions (American Society of Nephrology Renal Week 2004 and the Endocrine Society's 87th Annual Meeting [2005]) were reviewed. The package insert for conivaptan hydrochloride injection was referenced from. Clinical trials included in this review were randomized and placebo controlled.

Results

Based on the literature we researched, hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in critical care and is associated with a variety of conditions, including congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Because hyponatremia can arise in hypervolemic, euvolemic, and hypovolemic states, clinicians may not recognize its presence and cause. Incorrect management can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians need to recognize risk factors and symptoms and use appropriate treatment guidelines for hyponatremia. Traditionally, therapy for hyponatremia has been limited by efficacy and safety concerns. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonists, therapeutic agents that promote aquaresis in patients with hyponatremia by targeting V(1a) receptors in the vascular smooth muscle, V(2) receptors in the kidney, or both, are under development. A dual-receptor antagonist targeting both V(1a) and V(2) receptors is now approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients.

Conclusions

Hyponatremia, an electrolyte abnormality found in critically ill patients, can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. AVP receptor antagonists show promise as effective and tolerable treatments for patients with hyponatremia.

### Lixivaptan safely and effectively corrects serum sodium concentrations in hospitalized patients with euvolemic hyponatremia [^112LSSjd]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly. Lixivaptan, a new selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, safely corrected serum sodium concentrations in phase II studies of patients with euvolemic hyponatremia. Here our multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study assessed the effect of lixivaptan on serum sodium concentrations in 106 initially hospitalized patients with euvolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mmol/l). Of them, 52 were randomized to receive placebo and 54 received 50 mg lixivaptan once daily and were then titrated to receive 25–100 mg once daily depending on serum sodium concentration. Fluid restriction was at the investigator's discretion. Initial titration occurred in a monitored inpatient setting; patients were then treated as outpatients for a total of 30 days. The primary end point was the change in serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 7. Lixivaptan significantly increased the serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 7 (the primary end point) by 6.7 mmol/l compared with placebo (4.5 mmol/l; P = 0.034). Importantly, the serum sodium concentration was normalized safely and more rapidly in patients receiving lixivaptan than placebo (P = 0.004) and was well tolerated. After drug discontinuation, serum sodium concentrations decreased to near-baseline levels within 7 days. Thus, lixivaptan safely and effectively corrects serum sodium concentrations in patients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

FIGURE 2
Hyponatremia treatment.

A patient with hypovolemic hyponatremia needs isotonic saline to replace any sodium and water deficit; this restores intravascular volume and interrupts the non-osmotic release of ADH.

A patient with hypervolemic hyponatremia presents an excess of both water and sodium. Therefore, the therapy is based on water and sodium restriction and on treatment or stabilization of the underlying diseases (eg, heart failure, chronic liver disease, or renal failure).

In patients presenting euvolemic hypovolemia, the underlying cause should be addressed (see Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 2). Chronic hyponatremia due to poor solute intake should be corrected with appropriate feeding formula and restricting water intake. A patient presenting hypothyroidism or cortisol deficiency should receive appropriate hormone therapy.SIADH treatment relies on treatment of the etiology and progressive correction of the serum sodium level through fluid restriction.

Acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be promptly treated with the administration of hypertonic 3% saline solution (Fig. 3). The rate at which hyponatremia should be corrected depends on its duration (acute or chronic) and should be adapted to avoid disastrous neurological consequences.

FIGURE 3
Treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia.

Acute symptomatic hyponatremia (< 48 h) can be corrected as fast as 2 mmol/l per hour until symptoms resolve. Usually, symptoms improve after the administration of 4–6 mmol/kg of NaCl 3%, reversing hyponatremic encephalopathy. For a more aggressive therapy, boluses of NaCl 3% can be administered at a rate of 2 ml/kg to a maximum of 100 ml. One bolus results in a maximum of 2 mmol/l acute increase in natremia, which quickly reduces brain oedema. This approach has the advantage of an immediate and controlled increase in sodium levels, with little to no risk of overcorrection.

Chronic hyponatremia (> 48h or duration unknown) should be corrected with caution to avoid central pontine myelinolysis. After 48 hours, brain cells lose osmolytes to maintain their volume, and therefore a rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause hypertonic stress, triggering apoptosis and eventually demyelination. Up to 7 days after overcorrection, patients may present confusion, quadriplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, or even death.

To prevent overcorrection, the maximal recommended rate should be 1 mmol/l/h and an overall correction of 6–8 mmol/l in 24 hours.

Table 2.
Formulas

Volume, strength, and rate of saline infused are determined by the symptoms of hyponatremia or hypovolemia and the presenting [Na]. In the past, the required amount and volume of hypertonic saline were calculated by formulas 2 and 3 (Table 2), which do not take into account the effect of infused water on the change in [Na]. The Adrogue–Madias formula(formula 4 in Table 2), which calculates the predicted change in [Na] after infusion of 1 L of saline, accounts for the major factors that determine the changes in [Na] after the addition of saline to a closed system (initial [Na] and body water plus sodium concentration and volume of the infused saline). Not accounting for the water infused has caused errors in calculations of the changes in [Na] resulting from hypertonic infusions in experimental settings. – The magnitude of the error increased as the infused volume increased.

Although formula 4 represents a conceptual improvement in the prediction of changes in [Na] after saline infusion, it cannot compute directly the amount of saline required for a desired rise in [Na] or the predicted rise in [Na] after infusion of a volume of saline that is not a multiple of 1 L. To address these issues, we developed formulas 5 to 7 (Table 2) accounting for the same factors as the Adrogue–Madias formula.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114EsrDx]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

Pathogenesis of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — The primary mechanism leading to the majority of EAH cases is overconsumption of hypotonic fluids, likely in combination with nonosmotic stimulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP), and a hypovolemic form, although far less common than the symptomatic hypervolemic form, may be more prevalent in certain circumstances. AVP secretion may play a role in the majority of individuals with EAH, and release of AVP leads to water retention in the distal tubule of the kidney with a net result of lowering serum sodium; potential stimuli include nonspecific stresses, nausea/vomiting, hypoglycemia, exposure to heat, and possibly medication use such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1117skm3]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

For hypervolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, seven guidance documents recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment (Table 3). Three guidance documents advocated concomitant salt restriction, without clear dose recommendations, and one to avoid hypotonic infusion solution. Three additionally proposed loop diuretics and three others generally stated to treat the underlying disease, whereas one advised to consider stopping diuretics. One guideline additionally proposed demeclocycline and two proposed vasopressin receptor antagonists as a second-line treatment for refractory hyponatremia, whereas one guideline specifically recommended against both demeclocycline and vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Targets and limits of speed of correction

Table 4 shows the key recommendations. The key areas include targets and limits for increase in serum sodium concentration.

Seven guidance documents provided targets or aims for the increase in serum sodium concentration in case of symptomatic and/or acute hyponatremia. Seven guidance documents provided limits for the increase in serum sodium concentration that should not be surpassed. Five did so independent of symptoms. Limits usually varied between 8 to 12 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L during the first 48 hours, irrespective of whether hyponatremia was acute or chronic. Three guidance documents set a stricter limit of < 8 mmol/L during the first 24 hours in cases where the patient was believed to be high risk for developing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Four discussed what to do in case of overcorrection, i.e. to stop current treatment and to consider re-lowering serum sodium concentration by starting hypotonic infusion and administering 1 to 4 μg desmopressin every 6 to 8 hours.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

Treatment protocol for Hyponatremia

All patients were treated using our standardized therapeutic protocol for hyponatremia (Fig. 1). This therapeutic protocol fundamentally complied with the international treatment recommendations on chronic profound hyponatremia, although it did involve an exceptionally aggressive strategy to avoid under-treatment. The steps in this protocol are carried out in sequence, rather than simultaneously. First, all the patients were evaluated to identify the causes of hyponatremia. This evaluation involved (1) an interview about the history of the present illness, (2) vital signs, (3) physical examination, (4) laboratory data, and (5) echocardiography, if appropriate. Urine osmolality ≦100 mOsm/kg suggested that the hyponatremia was caused by primary polydipsia or poor sodium intake. Patientsand received cause-specific treatments, such as water restriction for primary polydipsia, discontinuation of a drug that caused hyponatremia, and amelioration of physiological stimulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In addition, if patients had severe symptoms, such as seizures, coma, or cardiorespiratory distress, an intravenous (i.v.) bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline of weight-based (2 mL/kg) amount was initiated until the symptoms improved. When the patients were relieved from these severe symptoms, they were assessed to determine the extracellular water (ECW) status. Patients were considered to have hypovolemic hyponatremia if the following findings were present, along with the discretion of the attending physician: history of gastrointestinal loss, reduced oral intake, thiazide usage, reduced turgor, or prolonged capillary refill time on physical examination, urine Na ≦ 30 mEq/L, and collapsed IVC on echography. Hydration with 0.9% saline at 1 mL/kg/h i.v. was initiated for patients who were diagnosed with reduced ECW. The administration speed of 0.9% saline was increased to 2 mL/kg/h when the patient could not take food orally.

Chronic asymptomatic hyponatraemia

Apart from hypovolemic hyponatraemia, which can be treated with isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solution, the treatment of chronic hyponatraemia relies on reducing free water intake and increasing renal free water excretion (Figure 2). Fluid restriction (< 1 l/d) remains the cornerstone therapy for chronic hyponatraemia. The urine to serum electrolyte ratio [(UNa + + UK +) / serum Na +] indicates if the patient is in an antidiuretic or aquaretic phase and can also help estimate the degree of fluid restriction required to increase serum Na + concentration. In case of a ratio > 1, a stricter fluid restriction is recommended (< 500 ml/d), which is difficult to adhere to, and pharmacologic therapy is often required to increase renal free water excretion. Current guidelines unanimously recommend increasing solute intake with 0.25–0.50 g/kg per day of urea or a combination of low-dose loop diuretics and oral sodium chloride in moderate or profound chronic hyponatraemia owing to SIADH (Figure 2). Although there is controversial evidence regarding the efficacy in improving clinical outcomes and safety of vaptans, lithium and demeclocycline, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been recently proposed as a potential treatment option for hospitalized patients with SIADH-induced hyponatraemia.

Vaptans are competitive antagonists of vasopressin receptors without detectable agonist activity. Until now, two of them (intravenous conivaptan and oral tolvaptan) have been approved for the treatment of clinically significant euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that they have been related to overcorrection of hyponatraemia, and they are contra-indicated in severe symptomatic hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 120 mmol/l), in hypovolemic hyponatraemia or in patients with impaired thirst mechanisms, which is common in patients with stroke. Moreover, considering the fact that statin therapy is commonly used in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, physicians should keep in mind that vaptans inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and such a co-administration is contra-indicated.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Current prescriptions for the correction of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia: are they too simple? [^115n9Lnh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Hypo- and hypernatraemic (dysnatraemic) disorders are among the most common electrolyte disorders encountered by primary care providers and nephrologists. They represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and inappropriate management can result in serious sequelae. Several formulas addressing the fluid prescription for dysnatraemic patients have been introduced. Many authors stress the importance of considering output as well as input in formulating a treatment plan for the dysnatraemic patient. However, currently available formulas fail to account for ongoing renal and extrarenal fluid and electrolyte losses. We propose a novel, versatile formula based on established principles governing the distribution of Na(+) in body fluids. The formula can be used in a simplified form for a quick but accurate estimate of the change in serum [Na(+)] for any infused fluid, while simultaneously accounting for renal losses. The formula can also be expanded to include more complex losses if desired. Importantly, it forces the caregiver to consider both output and input when formulating a prescription for the dysnatraemic patient.

Adrogué HJ, Tucker BM, Madias NE. Diagnosis and Management of Hyponatremia: A Review. JAMA. 2022; 328: 280–291. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2022. 11176 Importance. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects. Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency.

US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Conivaptan (vaprisol) for the treatment of hyponatremia… [^114Grui1]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Conivaptan is an antagonist of arginine vasopressin receptors V1A and V2 that produces a water diuresis, with electrolyte-sparing effects on the kidney. 1 It is labeled for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. 1, 2 Treatment may be required for rapid correction of sodium levels in symptomatic patients presenting with serum sodium levels less than 120 mEq per L.
3. 1 Additionally, transient minor hypotension is common with conivaptan infusion. This adverse reaction is tolerable and is likely the result of water loss. 4 No other significant hemodynamic effects have been reported. Some patients will develop overly rapid correction of serum sodium levels. 1 There are no reported cases of neurologic sequelae.
1.

EFFECTIVENESS Low serum sodium levels may occur in conjunction with a reduction in total body water and a greater loss of total body sodium; increased total body water relative to an increase in total body sodium; and normal total body sodium, but increased total body water. Conivaptan has been compared with placebo in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. SIMPLICITY The initial dose of conivaptan is 20 mg given over 30 minutes, followed by up to 20 mg administered over the next 24 hours. The dose can be increased to 40 mg per day. Administration of conivaptan can be continued for one to three days after the initial day of treatment for a maximum of four days total. Serum sodium levels, blood pressure, and volume status should be closely monitored throughout the infusion. Bottom Line In most cases, patients with hyponatremia can be adequately managed with fluid restriction alone.

However, acutely symptomatic patients may require treatment, such as hypertonic saline. In these situations, conivaptan is an expensive alternative. The safety and effectiveness of conivaptan has not been compared directly with hypertonic saline. It would be ideal to have comparative data before conivaptan is considered a standard treatment for hyponatremia.
