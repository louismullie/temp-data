## Question

Will someone with a thyroidectomy on replacement always have an elevated tsh

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether someone who has undergone a thyroidectomy and is on thyroid hormone replacement will always have an elevated TSH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of total thyroidectomy and the requirement for lifelong levothyroxine. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about TSH targets in athyreotic patients. Next, I will examine real-world data on TSH distributions in treated hypothyroidism, including athyreotic cohorts. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like TSH suppression in thyroid cancer and central hypothyroidism where TSH is unreliable. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and outline practical monitoring and dose-adjustment principles to keep TSH at goal over time [^39bee5aa] [^32fb5434].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Total thyroidectomy removes essentially all thyroid tissue, so endogenous thyroid hormone production ceases and patients require lifelong levothyroxine replacement; without it, TSH would be markedly elevated due to lack of feedback inhibition, but the question is specifically about patients who are on replacement therapy, so I should focus on whether TSH remains high despite treatment [^39bee5aa] [^a03cf760].

> Next, I should review guideline targets. The American Thyroid Association recommends that in primary hypothyroidism, including athyreotic patients, the therapeutic target is a TSH within the reference range, typically 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, with many clinicians aiming for 0.5–2.5 mIU/L in the absence of contraindications; this directly contradicts the idea that TSH must be elevated on replacement [^32fb5434] [^07a7b05d]. Hold on, I should verify cancer-specific exceptions: in differentiated thyroid cancer, TSH suppression below normal is used for higher-risk disease, but for low-risk, disease-free patients, TSH should be kept in the normal range, again arguing against a universal elevation on replacement [^98d6d7be] [^4b5003c6].

> I will now examine real-world data. Large observational datasets show that among patients on levothyroxine, median TSH is often around 2.3 mIU/L, which is within the reference interval, although a substantial minority fall outside the normal range due to under- or over-replacement; importantly, this includes both elevated and suppressed TSH values, not a uniform elevation, and the proportion outside normal can be as high as 20–40% in some cohorts, underscoring the need for careful titration rather than implying inevitability of high TSH [^94c90208] [^53ade335]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: yes, treated patients' median TSH is about 30% higher than untreated euthyroid individuals, but it still sits within the lab reference range in many cases, and the distribution spans both high and low values, not a fixed elevation [^94c90208].

> But wait, what if the patient is on TSH-suppressive therapy after thyroid cancer surgery? In that scenario, clinicians intentionally target a low or undetectable TSH for risk-adapted suppression, so TSH is not elevated; rather, it is suppressed, which is the opposite of the premise, and this is a deliberate, guideline-supported strategy in appropriate risk contexts [^98d6d7be] [^4b5003c6]. I should double-check that this applies to total thyroidectomy: yes, post-thyroidectomy cancer patients commonly receive suppressive dosing when indicated, again showing TSH is not inherently elevated on replacement [^98d6d7be].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about TSH being a perfect mirror of tissue status. I need to consider discordance phenomena. Even when TSH is "normal", some levothyroxine-treated patients, including athyreotic individuals, may have relatively lower T3 or tissue-specific under-replacement, which can contribute to persistent symptoms; this is a recognized limitation of TSH-centric monitoring and explains why a minority remain symptomatic despite a normal TSH, but it does not mean TSH is universally elevated on replacement [^b8cfe5d7] [^99f896d2]. Let me reconsider: this supports individualized assessment and occasional use of combination therapy in selected cases, but still does not imply that TSH must be high on LT4 monotherapy [^68508bc1].

> Next, I should review practical dose titration and monitoring to ensure TSH stays at goal. Standard practice is to start levothyroxine around 1.6 mcg/kg/day in athyreotic adults, adjust in 12.5–25 mcg increments, and recheck TSH in 4–6 weeks until stable, then monitor every 6–12 months; factors like weight changes, aging, medications, and product switching can alter absorption and require re-titration, which explains why some patients transiently drift out of range, but with appropriate follow-up, TSH can reliably be maintained within the reference interval [^07a7b05d] [^4881bc8a] [^639f6a74]. I should confirm that this applies post-thyroidectomy: yes, endocrine surgical guidelines align with this monitoring cadence and TSH target approach after total thyroidectomy [^39bee5aa].

> I should also consider special populations. In older adults, a more relaxed TSH target may be reasonable due to age-related shifts in the reference interval and comorbidity risks, but even then, the aim is not to accept a chronically elevated TSH; rather, it is to individualize within a slightly wider reference band, still avoiding overtreatment and undertreatment extremes [^ff11340f] [^6bd74f0d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that "relaxed" means accepting high TSH; that would be misleading — individualized, age-appropriate targets still strive for biochemical euthyroidism rather than persistent elevation [^ff11340f].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. No, someone with a total thyroidectomy who is on appropriate levothyroxine replacement does not always have an elevated TSH; with proper dosing and monitoring, TSH is typically normalized within the reference range, and in many patients it sits near the low-normal or mid-normal range, while in thyroid cancer care it may be intentionally suppressed below normal depending on risk, which is the opposite of elevated [^32fb5434] [^98d6d7be]. Persistent TSH elevation on replacement signals under-replacement, adherence issues, absorption problems, drug interactions, or the need for dose adjustment, not an inevitable feature of post-thyroidectomy care [^80fb55bf] [^07a7b05d].

Patients with a thyroidectomy on replacement therapy **do not always have an elevated TSH** [^32fb5434]. With appropriate levothyroxine dosing and adherence, TSH is typically normalized within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) [^32fb5434]. Persistent TSH elevation usually reflects **under-replacement**, **nonadherence**, **malabsorption**, or **drug interactions** [^80fb55bf] [^ed1b4d82]. In thyroid cancer, TSH may be intentionally suppressed to below-normal levels, so an elevated TSH is not expected with adequate therapy [^98d6d7be] [^4b5003c6]. Regular TSH monitoring and dose adjustments are essential to maintain euthyroidism [^07a7b05d] [^39bee5aa].

## Normalization of TSH with replacement therapy

- **Goal of therapy**: The primary objective of levothyroxine replacement after thyroidectomy is to normalize TSH, thereby maintaining euthyroidism [^32fb5434] [^4e552c61].

- **Typical TSH targets**: For most patients, the therapeutic target TSH is within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) [^32fb5434] [^04a4a7e0].

- **Achieving normalization**: With appropriate dosing and adherence, TSH normalization is achievable in the majority of patients [^32fb5434] [^d1b328bd].

## Factors influencing TSH levels in thyroidectomy patients

Several factors can cause **persistent TSH elevation** despite replacement therapy:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Inadequate dosing | Under-replacement is the most common cause of elevated TSH [^notfound]. |
| Nonadherence | Irregular or missed doses can lead to fluctuating TSH levels [^80fb55bf]. |
| Malabsorption | Gastrointestinal disorders, celiac disease, or bariatric surgery can impair levothyroxine absorption [^notfound]. |
| Drug interactions | Calcium, iron, proton pump inhibitors, and some antidepressants can interfere with levothyroxine absorption [^notfound]. |
| Timing of administration | Taking levothyroxine with food or other medications can reduce absorption [^notfound]. |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Monitoring**: Regular TSH monitoring is recommended every 6–8 weeks after initiation or dose changes until stable, then annually or as clinically indicated [^07a7b05d] [^39bee5aa].

- **Dose adjustments**: Dose adjustments should be based on TSH levels, clinical symptoms, and patient-specific factors [^07a7b05d] [^4881bc8a].

- **Individualized care**: Therapy should be tailored to patient age, weight, cardiovascular status, and comorbidities [^a03cf760] [^07a7b05d].

## Special considerations: thyroid cancer patients

In differentiated thyroid cancer, **TSH suppression** is often used to reduce recurrence risk [^98d6d7be] [^4b5003c6]. Targets vary by risk: high-risk patients may have TSH suppressed to < 0.1 mIU/L, whereas low-risk patients may aim for 0.5–2 mIU/L [^98d6d7be] [^4b5003c6]. Thus, an elevated TSH in this context indicates under-replacement or nonadherence, not the intended therapy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Patients with a thyroidectomy on replacement therapy **do not always have an elevated TSH** [^32fb5434]. With appropriate dosing, adherence, and monitoring, TSH can be normalized within the reference range [^07a7b05d]. Persistent TSH elevation usually reflects under-replacement, nonadherence, malabsorption, or drug interactions, and should prompt evaluation and adjustment of therapy [^80fb55bf].

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^80fb55bf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1b65e3ea]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Although age specific TSH targets may be considered, especially in the context of high cardiovascular risk, this strategy is based on the findings of studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid people. However, patients with hypothyroidism need a higher concentration of serum free thyroxine to achieve a normal TSH concentration compared with euthyroid controls. Consequently, a hypothyroid patient receiving thyroid replacement therapy and a euthyroid patient with comparable TSH concentrations are not expected to have comparable circulating free thyroxine concentrations. The same is true of free triiodothyronine concentrations in patients who have had total thyroidectomy. Therefore, any extrapolations on the association between optimal TSH concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy based on studies in euthyroid patients should be treated with caution, as serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations (relevant to cardiovascular physiology) may differ significantly between the two groups.

Moreover, in primary studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid patients, and in the related meta-analyses and reviews, thyroid function testing was done only at baseline. The potential therefore exists for misclassification bias in all estimates to date as a result of established and anticipated changes in thyroid hormone production over the life course of a patient, as well as instances of transient thyroid dysfunction (such as non-thyroidal illness or following the hyperthyroid phase of a painless thyroiditis). A person classified as euthyroid at baseline might go on to develop hypothyroidism, overt or subclinical, whereas those classified as subclinically hypothyroid might be found to be euthyroid on follow-up thyroid function testing.

Similar limitations affect studies assessing the association between thyroid dysfunction and risk of fracture, and whether variation in TSH concentration within normal limits may significantly affect the skeleton or whether any effect is insignificant in clinical terms (fracture risk remains unaffected) remains unclear. This is further challenged by evidence suggesting that free thyroxine concentrations are the main driver of the above clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to explore whether TSH concentration is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, mortality, and fractures in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. We treated TSH as a time varying covariate to account for variation in TSH concentration over time within individuals.

4 Discussion

We have described here results from a large data set suggesting that current treatment regimens of either low or high dose levothyroxine are not delivering the expected laboratory TFT profiles, with significant numbers of treated patients being well outside the expected values — both TSH and FT4 being significantly higher. This effect seems to be more prevalent in women than men, which is more concerning given the higher number of women requiring treatment. There was a steady increase in TSH by age in the untreated population which was not seen in LT4 treated individuals. Conversely FT4 remained relatively stable with age in untreated individuals but increased with age in LT4 treated individuals.

A better understanding of the relation between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, FT3, and FT4 in patients could allow more tailored and effective therapy for patients with hypothyroidism. We can only speculate as to the reasons for these findings. It may be the case that in some individuals the conversion of thyroxine to triodothyronine at the hypothalamic level is less efficient due to lower deiodinase enzyme activity, hence for a given level of circulating FT4 the TSH is higher. Another factor is that it is possible that some patients miss doses and then double or triple the dose prior having their TFTs checked thus resulting in a higher FT4 on the day while TSH remains slightly high in relation to the lag in TSH response to circulating thyroid hormone levels.

We believe that these data could help inform decisions about whether LT3 and LT4 combination therapy or NDT could be used more widely to reduce the number of patients with persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism while on treatment.

Gullo et al. described a similar phenomenon regarding higher FT4 in treated versus nontreated individuals. However, for that group, the selection was restricted to those with TSH 0.4–4.0 mu/L and to people who had undergone a total thyroidectomy (athyreotic).

It should be pointed out that the age related increase in TSH has previously been described in the NHANES study in a key paper published in 2002. In the same paper the authors pointed out that a large proportion of the US population at that time unknowingly have laboratory evidence of thyroid disease.

### Do patients gain weight after thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer? [^0b118ce4]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who undergo thyroidectomy often complain of weight gain, which they frequently attribute to inadequate thyroid hormone replacement. To assess the weight changes associated with thyroid hormone replacement or suppressive therapy after thyroidectomy, we measured the weights of patients before and after thyroidectomy and compared them to the weights of euthyroid patients with thyroid nodules who were being followed for many years.

Methods

The weights and heights of 67 women and 35 men who underwent total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer were recorded before and for a mean of 8.3 years after thyroidectomy. All patients received either suppressive or replacement doses of levothyroxine. As a comparison group, 70 women and 22 men with goiter or thyroid nodules and were euthyroid had serial measurements of height and weight. They were followed for a mean of 7.6 years. The body mass index (BMI) and age-adjusted BMI percentiles were calculated. The weight, BMI, and BMI percentile changes were compared both unadjusted and adjusted for age, gender, thyrotropin (TSH) level, and duration between measurements.

Results

At baseline, patients with thyroid nodules were older (mean 50.4 years) than those with thyroid cancer (mean 45.8 years). There were no significant differences in baseline weight, BMI, or BMI percentile. The baseline TSH levels were lower for patients with thyroid cancer (mean 0.8 mIU/L) than for those with nodules (mean 1.8 mIU/L) (p = 0.002). There were no significant differences between the changes in weight, BMI, or BMI percentile from the start to the completion of the study whether unadjusted or after adjustment for age, gender, TSH, and duration of follow-up.

Conclusions

Despite the perception of many patients that their thyroidectomy and thyroid hormone replacement or suppressive therapy is responsible for their subsequent weight gain, there were no significant differences in weight gain over time in comparison to a control group of euthyroid patients with thyroid nodules or goiter.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

Postoperative thyroid function monitoring — testing schedule and coordination: After total thyroidectomy, testing of thyroid function should be coordinated with the patient's endocrinologist and/or primary care physician, and TSH level should be checked at 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and T4 dose adjusted accordingly. The appropriate TSH level depends on multiple factors, including whether the patient has a diagnosis of TC of follicular cell origin and has ongoing features of hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^9aa483ba]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease postoperative thyroid hormone replacement (Recommendation 31) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.6 μg/kg), with elderly patients needing somewhat less, and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively; this is a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks add that if TSH was suppressed preoperatively, free T4 and TSH should be measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively, and once stable and normal, TSH should be measured annually or more frequently; dosing will vary with patient body mass index and the percentage of levothyroxine absorbed from the gut.

American Thyroid Association guideline — starting dose strategies indicate that several approaches to initiating LT4 therapy are acceptable, including basing the starting dose on the serum thyrotropin (TSH) level, with full replacement doses roughly 0.73 µg/lb or 1.6 µg/kg body weight when the serum TSH is markedly elevated, and lower doses such as 25–50 µg for milder degrees of hypothyroidism.

How long should TSH suppression to below the reference range be maintained — Recommendation 46 states that long-term thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression is not suggested for patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease who have no evidence of biochemical or structural recurrence (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). It further states that risks versus benefits of TSH suppression and TSH goals should be re-evaluated over time (Good Practice Statement).

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^a03cf760]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong replacement therapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Achieving optimal thyroid hormones replacement promptly after surgery is important but somehow challenging. Indeed, previous studies addressing this topic clearly indicate that a significant proportion of patients who are started on LT4 therapy for postthyroidectomy hypothyroidism require multiple dose adjustments over time. The clinical scenario is thus how we should choose the starting LT4 dose in patients just after total thyroidectomy to warrant the highest rate of euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation. While initial investigations used fixed LT4 doses, revised and eventually adjusted at early follow-up, more recent studies propose potential tailored approaches to more precisely estimate the optimal LT4 dose. Current clinical guidelines on the treatment of primary hypothyroidism recommend that when choosing a starting dose of LT4, several factors including patient's weight, lean body mass, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and comorbidities (ie, particularly cardiac diseases) should all be taken into account. Most papers suggest that in athyreotic patients, a starting LT4 dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg of body weight would be adequate, even though other authors have advocated for a higher starting dose of 2.0 to 2.1 mcg/kg, at least in selected settings.

There is general agreement that the etiology sustaining hypothyroidism impacts on the optimal LT4 dose, making athyreotic patients, owing to the lack of residual functional thyroid tissue, more likely to require a higher LT4 dose as compared to patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, the therapeutic target of TSH may vary in relation to the underlying condition, such as in patients with thyroid cancer who may require higher LT4 doses (ie, TSH-suppressive therapy). In addition, from the patient's standpoint, promptly achieving euthyroidism can provide clinical benefits in terms of both well-being and reduction of further clinical consultations. Although the number of studies in this field is significant, no clear and solid information is available about the optimal LT4 starting dose to be used in athyreotic subjects with no (or at least minor) need for further adjustment over time.

Hospitalized but not critically ill hypothyroid patients with elevated thyrotropin — re-evaluation of therapy: In hospitalized patients with a pre-established diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are found to have an elevated thyrotropin measurement, consideration should be given to institution or adjustment of levothyroxine replacement, with relevant considerations including the degree of clinical and biochemical hypothyroidism, active comorbidities, and details of levothyroxine administration. Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Revised American Thyroid Association guidelines for the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma [^d282ab39]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Hormone replacement following thyroidectomy (Recommendation 31) notes there is no reason to suppress thyrotropin (TSH); replacement L‑thyroxine is needed to maintain serum TSH levels in the euthyroid range, and serum TSH should be measured within 4–6 weeks postoperatively, with replacement therapy with levothyroxine administered with the goal of maintaining serum TSH levels in the euthyroid range (Grade B Recommendation).

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de885b19]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^318324c9]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^6e82e5e4]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

American Thyroid Association guideline — initiating and adjusting therapy states that thyroid hormone therapy should be initiated as an initial full replacement or as partial replacement with gradual increments in the dose titrated upward using serum thyrotropin as the goal, with dose adjustments where there are large changes in body weight, with aging, and with pregnancy, and thyrotropin assessment 4–6 weeks after any dosage change. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^7aacc405]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association 2016 — post-lobectomy follow-up for TA: Following lobectomy for TA, TSH and estimated free T4 levels should be obtained 4–6 weeks after surgery, and thyroid hormone supplementation started if there is a persistent rise in TSH above the reference range (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). After lobectomy for TA, serum calcium levels do not need to be obtained and calcium and calcitriol supplements do not need to be administered. Thyroid hormone replacement is required in about 15%–20% of patients following thyroid lobectomy. TSH levels may remain in the high normal range for 3–6 months; therefore, continued monitoring for 4–6 months postoperatively is reasonable.

Perioperative medication management and thyroid hormone replacement after thyroidectomy for Graves' disease — "Antithyroid drugs should be stopped at the time of thyroidectomy for GD, and beta-adrenergic blockers should be weaned following surgery". After surgery, "L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.7 μg/kg), and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively", and "Once stable and normal, TSH should be measured annually or more frequently if clinically indicated".

ATA differentiated thyroid cancer — postoperative thyroglobulin measurement and early assessment: Measuring a postoperative serum Tg level 6–12 weeks after total thyroidectomy while on thyroid hormone therapy or after TSH stimulation is recommended, and such measurements may guide additional decision-making regarding clinical management (Strong recommendation, Low certainty evidence). The authors propose that the first assessment following initial therapy should occur within 3 months after resection, with an example that a patient at high risk of recurrence may be treated with a lower dose if the serum Tg is not detectable on a highly sensitive assay (e.g., lower limit of detection 0.1 ng/mL), in the absence of TgAb during levothyroxine (LT4) administration, and if neck ultrasonography does not reveal residual disease after operation; conversely, an elevated Tg level might prompt chest imaging to identify metastases.

Hormone replacement following thyroidectomy — TSH and calcium management indicates there is no reason to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) because MTC is not a follicular cell–derived neoplasm; replacement L-thyroxine is needed to maintain serum TSH in the euthyroid range, patients need monitoring for hypocalcemia, treatment with oral calcium and calcitriol is indicated if symptomatic or if hypocalcemia is persistently prolonged, and withdrawal of replacement therapy is guided by serial serum calcium measurements.

### Levothyroxine dosage after thyroidectomy for metastatic papillary cancer… [^f2216602]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Dr Frame recommended a reduction of thyroid hormone to the equivalent of 0. 2 mg/day of levothyroxine sodium in a patient with papillary thyroid cancer. This recommendation was based on studies indicating that thyroid-stimulating hormone is suppressed to normal levels in a majority of patients with primary hypothyroidism treated with this dosage1; however, the radioimmunoassay is not sensitive enough to separate normal from low levels of TSH. 2 Because it. is desirable to suppress TSH to less than normal levels in patients with TSH-dependent thyroid neoplasms, and because many patients tolerate 0. 3 mg/day of levothyroxine sodium without clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism, it seems prudent to treat patients with thyroid cancer with higher replacement doses of thyroid hormone than is necessary for the treatment of hypothyroidism. 3 Perhaps the response of TSH to thyrotropin-releasing hormone may provide a more sensitive index of the.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^6bd74f0d]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^99f896d2]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

### How does thyroid hormone profile differ on and off replacement treatment? [^d1b328bd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe, and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, with this medication being converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3) are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognised. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalise TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms of hypothyroidism, even with normalised TSH levels. This may be due to LT4 monotherapy not restoring T3 levels to the normal range in a subset of patients, perhaps due to polymorphisms within the genes which encode peripheral deiodinase enzymes.

Additionally, multiple studies suggest that as many as 40% of patients taking LT4 have TSH levels outside of the normal range, indicating under‐ or over‐replacement of thyroid hormones. Certain patient factors, such as sex, age, and duration of treatment, may influence this under‐ or over‐treatment. Significantly, both under‐ and over‐treatment of hypothyroidism are associated with increased all‐cause mortality.

This study aims to investigate further the differences in thyroid hormone levels and health outcomes in people on thyroid hormone replacement therapy compared with people being screened for thyroid disorder and not taking levothyroxine. Better understanding of the relation between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, Free T3 (FT3), and FT4 in patients could allow more tailored and effective therapy for people with hypothyroidism.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^6cc6de10]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Both the non-specific nature of complaints and inherent deficiencies in the diagnostic process raise an unsettling dilemma for patients and thyroid specialists alike. The issues are exemplified and particularly pertinent to an etiological disease entity whose consequences are paralleled in similar outcomes: primary hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Treatment requirements and dosing of the drug LT4 changed when guidelines relaxed the need for TSH-suppressive treatment targets for these patients. The reason for this shift was not primarily motivated by any improvement in the replacement strategy but by a revision of the long-held tenet that TSH may act as a thyroid growth stimulating hormone. Even when only present at a low level in the circulation it was believed that it could potentially stimulate the growth of remaining tumour cells and thereby promote the relapse of the thyroid cancer in the long-term. This view has recently been revised, and TSH suppression is now deemed unnecessary for many thyroid cancer patients. However, this remarkable strategy change has presented a unique opportunity to study the implications for patient complaints of such a far-reaching decision to abandon TSH-suppressive LT4 treatment in low-risk thyroid cancer. Although this could not be done in a prospective study, careful retrospective analysis revealed some interesting trends. Over the years when replacement therapy aimed at complete TSH suppression a relatively low rate of persistent hypothyroid complaints was reported by patients followed at a single institution, much lower than in the subsequent years when the relaxed TSH policy came into effect (Fig. 1). The reverse was true for hyperthyroid complaints reported by patients, which were relatively higher in the first and much lower in the second time period (Fig. 1). The symptom reporting by these patients indicates a historical shift in the trend from a lack of hypothyroid symptoms on LT4 towards an increased awareness of the persisting symptomatology. While the nature, reliability and accuracy of freely communicated symptoms may be questionable it appears that the opposing trends in these rates in the same patients are well documented in this cohort, and they occurred in association with an important change in the treatment policy during follow-up. We are not aware of any prospective studies that followed this historic shift in the pattern of patient complaints during the last decade. The changing pattern in patient complaints observed in this cohort and associated with the low-dose policy promoted by recent guidelines is mirrored in a recent prospective study and by a dramatic increase in patients worldwide expressing their concerns and dissatisfaction with the standard treatment in various ways including over the internet and through patient advocacies. This sentiment was confirmed by a large online survey of 12,146 hypothyroid patients conducted by the American Thyroid Association.

For the treated hypothyroid individuals, timing of LT4 dose may also be a factor as described by Jansen et al. in 2023. The authors concluded that the observed FT4 concentrations above the upper limit of the laboratory reference range together with not (completely) suppressed TSH were mainly related to a combination of timing of blood withdrawal and the timing of LT4 intake.

We accept that there are significant limitations to the laboratory data set as we do not have information about actual thyroid condition diagnosis, nor do have information as to the type, dose or duration of thyroid hormone replacement. Ethnicity was not available to us. Nevertheless, we have been able to analyse a larger number of laboratory results, and we are confident that we have adequately differentiated screening of untreated individuals from monitoring of patients treated with thyroid hormone replacement.

In conclusion, a better understanding of the relationship between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, FT3, and FT4 in patients vs the physiological equipoise, could allow more tailored and effective therapy for patients with hypothyroidism.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression after lobectomy — risks and evidence: Adverse effects of TSH suppression include consequences of subclinical thyrotoxicosis, so optimal TSH targets must balance potential benefit with harm, and there is little evidence to guide TSH targets or thyroid hormone use after lobectomy. In a retrospective analysis of low-risk patients who had undergone lobectomy without thyroid hormone therapy, after a mean follow-up of 8.3 years only 13% of 674 patients became overtly hypothyroid.

Medical treatment for benign thyroid nodules — Levothyroxine (LT) suppressive therapy is not recommended. In geographic areas with mild iodine deficiency, iodine supplementation and/or TSH nonsuppressive LT4 treatment may be considered for young patients with a small nodular goiter and high-normal TSH levels. LT4 replacement is recommended for young patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and due to autoimmune thyroiditis. LT4 therapy is not recommended for preventing recurrence after lobectomy when serum TSH stays in the normal range.

### Thyroid hormone suppression therapy [^ed139a29]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression therapy is designed to lower serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels using doses of thyroid hormone in excess of what would normally be required to maintain a euthyroid state. The basis of this therapy is the knowledge that TSH is a growth factor for thyroid cancer, so that lower serum TSH levels might be associated with decreased disease activity. However, clinical studies have not documented improved outcomes with TSH suppression, except in patients with the most advanced disease. Furthermore, there are a number of negative outcomes related to aggressive thyroid hormone therapy, including osteoporosis, fracture, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a graded approach to TSH suppression is recommended by the American Thyroid Association, based on initial risk and ongoing risk assessment.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — postoperative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) monitoring after lobectomy or without radioactive iodine (RAI) notes that serum Tg has not been shown to predict recurrence in patients with DTC after thyroid lobectomy. A systematic review reported that a total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria; serum Tg measurement following partial thyroidectomy was not accurate for diagnosing DTC recurrence or metastasis, and after total/near-total thyroidectomy without RAI, Tg levels were usually stable and low. For patients who have undergone total or near-total thyroidectomy without RAI, serum Tg levels up to 1–2.5 ng/mL while on LT4 therapy generally identify patients at low risk for persistent or metastatic disease. Because a firm cut-point for Tg monitoring after lobectomy is not supported, the task force unanimously felt that measuring a single Tg value ~ 12 weeks after surgery with a normal TSH would be prudent to ensure it is not unexpectedly markedly elevated, whereupon further imaging would be appropriate.

### Postintervention serum TSH levels may be useful to differentiate patients who should undergo levothyroxine suppressive therapy after thyroid surgery for multinodular goiter in a region with moderate iodine deficiency [^9d9a9ad4]. Thyroid (2000). Low credibility.

Recent studies have raised doubts about the efficacy of the postoperative use of levothyroxine (LT4) suppressive doses in patients who underwent thyroid surgery for multinodular goiter. The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the efficacy of different doses of LT4 in preventing postsurgical recurrences of simple multinodular goiter and to identify a marker that could be useful in discriminating patients with a higher risk of developing recurrence. Two hundred thirty-two patients (57 male, 175 female) operated for nontoxic multinodular goiter were divided into two groups: (I) patients with normal postsurgery thyrotropin (TSH) levels (0.25 to 4.5 mU/L) and (II) patients with elevated postsurgery TSH levels (> 4.5 mU/L). All patients were subjected to replacement (1.3 microg LT4/kg/day) or suppressive (1.7 microg LT4/kg/day) doses of LT4, and they were followed for a median period of 6 years (range 2 to 12). No statistical difference was found for sex, age, and postsurgery serum TSH between patients submitted to suppressive and replacement therapy. The ultrasound (US) detection of new postsurgery nodules of at least 0.5 cm maximum diameter was considered a recurrence of disease and was found in 10% of the cases studied. Patients with normal postsurgery serum TSH showed a high recurrence rate (30.4%) when submitted to lower daily doses of LT4. In patients with elevated postsurgery serum TSH, the rate of nodular goiter recurrence did not vary with different types of LT4 therapy. In conclusion, our results suggest that the postsurgical serum TSH is useful for prediction of nodular goiter recurrence, as it reflects the amount of residual functioning thyroid tissue in the cervical area. It may also be indicative of patients who might benefit from LT4 suppressive therapy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^4b5003c6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma — Principles of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression state that the use of levothyroxine to maintain low TSH levels is considered optimal for papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, although data are lacking to permit precise specification of serum TSH levels. In general, patients with known structural residual carcinoma or at high risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained below 0.1 mU/L. Patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained at the normal range, and for patients at low risk for recurrence with biochemical evidence but no structural evidence of disease (eg, Tg positive, but imaging negative), maintain TSH levels at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Patients who remain disease free for several years should have their TSH levels maintained within the reference range. Given the potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine — including cardiac tachyarrhythmias (especially in the elderly) and bone demineralization (particularly in post-menopausal women) as well as frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis — the risks and benefits of TSH-suppressive therapy must be balanced for each individual patient. Patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed should be counseled to ensure adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Symptoms and TSH in levothyroxine-treated patients — In levothyroxine (LT4) users, a cross-sectional analysis of 697 patients taking LT4 showed a correlation between higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and more hypothyroid symptoms, even within the subset of 43 patients who were overtly euthyroid; however, another cross-sectional study did not find a relationship between well-being and TSH categories of less than and greater than 2 mIU/L, and a randomized, controlled cross-over trial of three LT4 dose targets reported no differences in the major outcomes of patient preference. A nonrandomized open-label study noted symptomatic improvement on an LT4 dose 50 μg higher than the optimal dose with low TSH, yet the summary states that patients treated with LT4 to euthyroid TSH goals may experience more symptoms than people without treated hypothyroidism, and increasing LT4 dose does not affect these symptoms. Psychological distress among those referred for thyroid testing was approximately twice as high as in the general population under physician care, with 54% versus 19% having GHQ scores > 3.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Surgical treatment of hyperthyroidism can Be performed safely before a euthyroid state is achieved [^bd1f0218]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: The 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend that hyperthyroid patients should be euthyroid before thyroidectomy. This recommendation is based on low-quality evidence. In this retrospective cohort study, we compare peri- and post-operative outcomes of patients with hyperthyroidism who were controlled versus uncontrolled at the time of thyroidectomy. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed on 275 hyperthyroidism patients at a single institution from December 2015 to November 2022. Patients were defined as hyperthyroid if they had a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism with at least one suppressed thyrotropin (TSH). Patients were considered uncontrolled if triiodothyronine or thyroxine (T4) was elevated immediately before surgery. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes were compared with Chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, as appropriate. Results: Of the 275 patients, 84.3% were women and 51.3% were uncontrolled at time of surgery. Controlled patients had higher median [interquartile range] TSH (0.4 [0.0, 2.4] mIU/L vs. 0.0 [0.0, 0.0] mIU/L, p < 0.001) and lower free T4 (fT4) (0.9 [0.7, 1.1] ng/dL vs. 3.1 [1.9, 4.4] ng/dL, p < 0.001), respectively. Uncontrolled patients were more likely to be diagnosed with Grave's disease (85.1% vs. 67.9%, p < 0.001) and to undergo surgery due to medication intolerance (12.1% vs. 6%) or history of thyroid storm (6.4% vs. 1.5%) (p = 0.008). Uncontrolled patients were also more likely to take a larger number of preoperative medications (2.3 vs. 1.4, p < 0.001). No patient in either group experienced thyroid storm precipitated by surgery. Controlled patients had shorter operative times (7.3% vs. 19.8% < 1 hour, p < 0.014) and decreased median estimated blood loss (15.0 [5.0, 30.0] mL vs. 20.0 [10.0, 50.0] mL, p = 0.002). Both groups experienced similar, low rates of postoperative complications, apart from an increase in temporary hypocalcemia in the uncontrolled group (13.4% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.013). Conclusion: Our study is the largest to date examining the postoperative outcomes of patients with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism who undergo thyroidectomy. Our results affirm that thyroidectomy in actively thyrotoxic patients is safe and will not precipitate thyroid storm.

Postoperative thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement — Good Practice Statement and kinetics: "Measurement of serum Tg on one occasion 6–12 weeks after lobectomy while on a normal TSH may be helpful to ensure that it is not unexpectedly elevated; however, a specific cut off value is uncertain". Tg is described as "a fundamental tool for evaluating thyroid cancer tumor burden, assessing response to treatment, and monitoring for cancer recurrence", and "A serum Tg level is recommended in the postoperative period to inform treatment decisions". Initial testing timing was informed by data "at multiple time points up to 1 year after surgery", with the "median time to reach the nadir serum Tg… was 12 weeks". Tg can be assessed as basal or TSH-stimulated, the latter achieved by withdrawal or rhTSH "allowing the endogenous TSH to increase (usually > 30 mIU/mL) or administering exogenous recombinant human TSH (rhTSH)", and "a benefit of stimulated over basal Tg has not been consistently shown".

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — postoperative levothyroxine is considered optimal to decrease TSH in patients with higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, but the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring the degree of TSH suppression to individual risk because optimal serum levels have not been defined. For patients with known residual carcinoma or those at high risk for recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mU/L; for patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence, TSH levels should be maintained at the normal range; and for patients at low risk with imaging negative but Tg levels concerning for disease, TSH levels should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, so an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended for patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed; reports do not suggest that bone mineral density is altered in patients receiving levothyroxine.

Adverse outcomes increase when "serum TSH < 0.1 mIU/L", including atrial fibrillation: "patients older than age 65 years with serum TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L… had a threefold increase in the risk of atrial fibrillation over a 10-year observation period". Skeletal risks are higher in postmenopausal women, "especially if the serum TSH levels are undetectable", and cardiovascular, dysrhythmia, and fracture admissions and deaths "were higher for those with suppressed TSH values".

### How should we manage patients with mildly increased serum thyrotrophin concentrations? [^61739e45]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

A mildly increased serum thyrotrophin (TSH) is usually because of mild thyroid failure, and the most common aetiology in iodine-replete communities is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. It is more common in women, and the prevalence increases with age in both men and women and is associated with the presence of antithyroid antibodies. The majority will have serum TSH levels between 5–10 mIU/l, normal free thyroxine (T4) levels and relatively few symptoms. In 2004, US evidence-based consensus guidelines concluded that there were no adverse outcomes of a mildly increased serum TSH other than a risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and few data to justify levothyroxine therapy. There is still debate as to what constitutes an increased serum TSH, particularly in older subjects. Although some subjects will progress to overt hypothyroidism, recent data suggest a significant proportion revert to a serum TSH within the reference range without treatment. Two recent meta-analyses have suggested that the possible cardiovascular risks may be more significant in younger adults. Other data suggest that mild thyroid failure may be the only reversible cause of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. No appropriately powered prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded interventional trial of levothyroxine therapy for a mildly increased serum TSH exists. However, treatment in subjects who are symptomatic, pregnant or preconception, aged less than 65 years and older subjects with evidence of heart failure appear justified.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^2482b1d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Shared decisionmaking in the treatment of hypothyroidism [^8b7e4507]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, affects millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and metabolic slowdowns. It is most prevalent in women and older adults, with causes including autoimmune thyroiditis, surgical thyroidectomy, and certain medications.

Standard Of Care and Limitations

The standard treatment involves synthetic levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, which alleviates symptoms by converting to the active hormone, T3. However, some patients continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and poor quality of life despite normalized TSH levels. This persistence of symptoms may stem from misdiagnosis, inadequate dosing, or incomplete normalization of thyroid hormone signaling.

New Findings

Research suggests that LT4 monotherapy may not fully restore T3 levels, leading to suboptimal symptom control. Consequently, combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3) has been proposed as an alternative, aiming to balance T4 and T3 levels more effectively. Although randomized controlled trials have not identified significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between LT4 monotherapy and combination therapy, they indicate that patients may prefer the latter.

Conclusion

Guidelines from leading endocrinology organizations now recommend considering combination therapy for patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate LT4 dosing. A patient-centered approach, emphasizing shared decision-making and individualized treatment plans, is essential for optimizing outcomes in hypothyroidism management. Further research is needed to refine dosing strategies and identify the patients who would benefit most from combination therapy.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

Thyroid hormone analogs and resistance to thyroid hormone — treatment goals and role of analogs are stated as follows: "The therapeutic goals of the treatment of patients with genetic syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone are to improve the symptoms caused by excessive TRα signaling, while minimizing the symptoms caused by deficient TRβ signaling". Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. "Although preliminary data from small case series suggest that the use of TRIAC in patients with genetic syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone may be promising, more clinical research is needed before the use of thyroid hormone analogs can be recommended for this indication". Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. Mechanistic background notes that resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare genetic disease with increased serum TSH and inappropriately normal or increased FT4; patients with RTHα have normal TSH with low FT4 and high T3, whereas patients with RTHβ have normal or elevated TSH with elevated FT4 and FT3; most forms are autosomal dominant TRβ mutations, and approximately 1000 patients in 350 families with TRβ mutations have been described.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — Postoperative levothyroxine to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is considered optimal for higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, and the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring suppression to individual risk. For known residual carcinoma or high risk of recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mIU/L; for disease-free, low-risk patients, TSH should be maintained at the normal range; and for low-risk patients with imaging negative but concerning Tg, TSH should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mIU/L. Potential toxicities include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis; therefore, an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended when TSH is chronically suppressed, and reports do not suggest altered bone mineral density in patients receiving levothyroxine.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Follow-up Evaluation

Levothyroxine therapy was routinely prescribed according to TT and LT regardless of post-surgical thyroid function as indicated for moderate iodine-deficient countries. The levothyroxine dose was titrated to maintain thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels according to the indications given in different years by authoritative international guidelines, and after the publication of the 2015 ATA Guidelines, according to the ATA risk class and the DRS.

The patients were followed up 1 month after surgery, every 6 months during the first year, and then every 6 to 18 months by a full evaluation including physical examination, measurement of Tg and anti-thyroglobulin autoantibody (TgAb) levels, and neck ultrasound, always performed by the same operator. In particular, recombinant human TSH (rhTSH)-stimulated Tg (exclusively for patients treated with TT) was evaluated from 1997 up to the first months of 2016, when we started to assess patients only by basal ultrasensitive Tg (Elecys Tg II-Roche Diagnostics, Basilea-Switzerland), with an analytical sensitivity of 0.04 μg/L.

Definitions and Clinical End Points

Because reliable demonstration of remission for patients treated with LT can be difficult due to the lower predictivity of Tg levels, we compared our patients by considering the event-free survival rate, defined as the interval between initial surgery and detection of persistent/recurrent disease.

To identify persistent/recurrent disease, ATA guidelines and Italian consensus recommendations were followed. In particular, for the patients treated with TT, the indication was a biochemically incomplete response (negative imaging and detectable basal or stimulated Tg or rising anti-Tg antibody levels) or a structurally incomplete response (evidence of disease at structural or functional imaging at any Tg level, with or without anti-Tg antibodies). For the patients treated with LT, the indication was a biochemically incomplete response (elevated non-stimulated Tg levels not consistent with the presence of a normal thyroid lobe or serum Tg levels, increasing over time in the presence of similar TSH levels, and a negative ultrasonogram [US]) or a structurally incomplete response (structural evidence of disease regardless of serum Tg).

Distant metastases were assessed, by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) as appropriate and according to the availability of a given imaging technique at the time of diagnosis, whereas local recurrences were studied by US, cytology, and/or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) Tg measurement.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^cc6ebde5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^04a4a7e0]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimise these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Current guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalisation" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement, after emphasising the scarcity of relevant evidence. TSH concentrations in this wide target range may be achieved by different doses of levothyroxine. However, from a physiological standpoint, a continuum of effects may plausibly occur across the spectrum of normal TSH concentrations; the same human heart might behave differently at a pace dictated by a TSH concentration of 0.4 mIU/L compared with one of 4 mIU/L, both of which are considered normal. Evidence indicates that TSH and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations are quite tightly regulated on an individual basis, but determining an individual's set point is not part of routine clinical practice, and replacement treatment is generally targeted in a wide reference range.

Median TSH (Figure 2b) was much higher in the treated population and was relatively unchanged by age, while in the untreated population was lower and increased with age. The difference in TSH between treated and untreated was larger at younger ages and declined with age, to be less at older age,
Median FT4 (Figure 2c) increased noticeably with age in the treated population, while in the untreated it remained relatively constant. Thus the difference was smaller at younger ages but grew larger with age.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — interventions and treatment thresholds: The principal treatment for hypothyroidism is oral monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium). Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (such as methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (for example, radioactive iodine or surgery). Although definitive data are lacking, treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or less than 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease, whereas treatment is typically not recommended for patients with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or when thyroiditis is the cause.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

There continues to be much discussion around optimisation of thyroid hormone status in hypothyroid individuals. We here looked the way that free T4(FT4) and thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) related to each other in a large laboratory sample of people who underwent a thyroid function test (TFT), split between those on levothyroxine replacement (monitoring test) and those who underwent a test to check for thyroid hormone imbalance (diagnostic test; not on levothyroxine).

Methods

TFT test (FT4/TSH) results were extracted from the Salford Royal Hospital Laboratory Information Management System during 2009–2012. This was a single site study. Requests includes a tick box for 'on levothyroxine' (yes or no). To minimise comorbidity effects, only samples taken in General Practices were used. For untreated patients only those who had single tests results were used; for treated patients, the median value across all their results was used. Cluster analysis considered an ellipse with centre on median values for log (TSH) and FT4 and the vertex based on 5% and 95% percentile values of both. The percentage of patients falling outside the ellipse boundary was considered for both treated and untreated populations.

Results

The total data set included 290,000 tests on 130,000 individuals. After filtering, FT4/TSH results were used from 12,006 (F 9231/M 2775; age < 60 5850/age ≥ 60 6567) treated patients with 43,846 test results. These were compared to the single results for 43,394 untreated patients (F 24,386/M19,008; age < 60 32,537/age ≥ 60 10,857). Cluster analysis showed for untreated patients, median values for TSH and FT4 were 1.8 mU/L and 15.5 pmol/L, respectively, with 24% of patient results falling outside the untreated 5%/95% percentiles. For treated patients, the median TSH was 2.3 mU/L (+30% vs. untreated) and FT4 was 18.9 pmol/L (+22% vs. untreated), with 22% of treated patients falling outside the treated 5%/95% percentiles. When considered against the untreated limits, 68% of treated results fell outside (split male 63%, female 70% and age < 60 67%, Age ≥ 60 64%).

Conclusion

The current treatment regimens of either low or high dose levothyroxine are not delivering the expected laboratory TFT profiles, with significant numbers of treated patients being well outside the expected values: both TSH and FT4 being significantly higher. This effect appears to be more prevalent in women than men.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) — thyroid hormone replacement monitoring and dosing: We recommend against using serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with CH. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕) Many patients with CH have undetectable TSH levels on presentation, and almost all CH patients adequately treated with L-T4 to maintain serum fT4 levels in the mid to high-normal range will have undetectable TSH levels; therefore, clinicians should not interpret undetectable TSH levels as a sign of overtreatment in CH, even in patients with initial measurable TSH levels. A randomized controlled study of CH measured fT4 levels 2 hours after dose ingestion and reported slightly elevated mean fT4 levels with adequate doses; therefore, we recommend checking fT4 before the L-T4 dose. Alternate preparations of thyroid hormones or nutraceuticals are not recommended for treating CH.

This paper marshals arguments in support of a narrower, optimal or true normal range for thyrotropin (TSH) of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L, based on clinical results and recent information on the relatively stable and narrow range of values in patients without thyroid disease. The terminology used for TSH results is clarified in an attempt to help physicians interpret, explain, and respond to TSH test results for their patients.

TSH reference variability and pregnancy — Median TSH values tend to be higher in iodine-deficient populations than those found in iodine sufficient groups, so population iodine intake should be considered when interpreting TSH values. During pregnancy, the reference interval for TSH varies by trimester, fetal number, geography, and assay; TSH is lowest in the first trimester, lower in women with twins than in women with singleton pregnancies, is ∼0.4 mIU/L lower in African and Asian women, and is higher in women with insufficient iodine intake. Target TSH values for patients taking T4 are dependent on the clinical indication for hormone replacement; for instance, TSH suppression is often recommended for thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy.

Thyroid hormone status discordance between pituitary and peripheral tissues — There are specific instances in which there appears to be discordance between the thyroid status of the pituitary gland, as reflected by serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the status of other tissues indicated by biomarkers, and the clinical significance is not known. Mechanistic data indicate tissues can have variable tissue-specific thyroid status and that normalization of TSH does not ensure uniform triiodothyronine (T3) levels across tissues; animal and in vitro/rodent studies show primary changes in type 2 or type 3 deiodinase (D2 or D3) within a tissue can alter thyroid status without affecting circulating T3, thyroxine (T4), or TSH, with reports of relatively T3-deficient tissues despite the same plasma T3 and T4 and sometimes normal serum TSH; human studies have not been reported.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced thyroid dysfunction — screening and follow-up emphasize that "the majority of patients in whom thyroid dysfunction develops after ICI therapy are asymptomatic", and "all patients should be tested (TSH and free T4) at the baseline prior to therapy". Ongoing surveillance is advised with "frequent monitoring with each cycle or every 4 to 6 weeks from the start of ICI therapy or as needed… should allow for the detection of evolving thyroid disease". Baseline antibodies are not definitive because "Evidence for the measurement of the levels of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies at the baseline to predict future thyroid dysfunction is still emerging", though "additional laboratory investigations for TSH receptor antibodies… and thyroglobulin may help to distinguish the diagnoses", and "Additional imaging… may have a role in select cases". Management notes that "ICI therapy need not be interrupted or discontinued in cases of thyroid-related side effects", while "Patients with overt hypothyroidism (a low level of free T4 and persistently elevated level of TSH of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range) will require thyroid hormone replacement".

Thyroid carcinoma — thyroid hormone suppressive therapy outcomes and TSH targets: Decreased recurrence and cancer-specific mortality rates have been reported with thyroid hormone suppressive therapy, but the optimal TSH target is uncertain; superior outcomes were associated with aggressive suppression in high-risk patients but with modest suppression in stage II disease, and excessive TSH suppression (into the undetectable, thyrotoxic range) is not required to prevent disease progression in all treated patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Adjuvant therapy is RAI administration to destroy suspected (but not identified) remaining thyroid cancer following total or near-total thyroidectomy. Therapeutic treatment is RAI administration to treat known residual or recurrent thyroid cancer, either initially or with subsequent re-presentation after total or near-total thyroidectomy. Thyrotropin suppression therapy uses thyroid hormone to suppress serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations below the normal range based on the risk of recurrence and/or response to therapy.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^d4cafc0d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^bf5485fb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

Introduction

There continues to be much discussion around optimisation of thyroid hormone status in hypothyroid individuals. We here looked the way that free T4(FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) related to each other in a large laboratory sample of people who underwent a thyroid function test (TFT), split between those on levothyroxine replacement (monitoring test) and those who underwent a test to check for thyroid hormone imbalance (diagnostic test; not on levothyroxine).

Methods

TFT test (FT4/TSH) results were extracted from the Salford Royal Hospital Laboratory Information Management System during 2009–2012. This was a single site study. Requests includes a tick box for 'on levothyroxine' (yes or no). To minimise comorbidity effects, only samples taken in General Practices were used. For untreated patients only those who had single tests results were used; for treated patients, the median value across all their results was used. Cluster analysis considered an ellipse with centre on median values for log (TSH) and FT4 and the vertex based on 5% and 95% percentile values of both. The percentage of patients falling outside the ellipse boundary was considered for both treated and untreated populations.

Results

The total data set included 290,000 tests on 130,000 individuals. After filtering, FT4/TSH results were used from 12,006 (F 9231/M 2775; age < 60 5850/age ≥ 60 6567) treated patients with 43,846 test results. These were compared to the single results for 43,394 untreated patients (F 24,386/M19,008; age < 60 32,537/age ≥ 60 10,857). Cluster analysis showed for untreated patients, median values for TSH and FT4 were 1.8mU/L and 15.5pmol/L, respectively, with 24% of patient results falling outside the untreated 5%/95% percentiles. For treated patients, the median TSH was 2.3mU/L (+30% vs. untreated) and FT4 was 18.9pmol/L (+22% vs. untreated), with 22% of treated patients falling outside the treated 5%/95% percentiles. When considered against the untreated limits, 68% of treated results fell outside (split male 63%, female 70% and age < 60 67%, Age ≥ 60 64%).

Conclusion

The current treatment regimens of either low or high dose levothyroxine are not delivering the expected laboratory TFT profiles, with significant numbers of treated patients being well outside the expected values: both TSH and FT4 being significantly higher. This effect appears to be more prevalent in women than men.

### Does postoperative thyrotropin suppression therapy truly decrease recurrence in papillary thyroid carcinoma? A randomized controlled trial [^218c3a29]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

TSH suppression therapy has been used to decrease thyroid cancer recurrence. However, validation of effects through studies providing a high level of evidence has been lacking.

Objective

This single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial tested the hypothesis that disease-free survival (DFS) for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in patients without TSH suppression is not inferior to that in patients with TSH suppression.

Design

Participants were randomly assigned to receive postoperative TSH suppression therapy (group A) or not (group B). Before assignment, patients were stratified into groups with low- and high-risk PTC according to the AMES (age, metastasis, extension, size) risk-group classification.

Interventions and Outcome Measures

For patients assigned to group A, L-T(4) was administered to keep serum TSH levels below 0.01 μU/ml. TSH levels were adjusted to within normal ranges for patients assigned to group B. Recurrence was evaluated by neck ultrasonography and chest computed tomography.

Results

Eligible participants were recruited from 1996–2005, with 218 patients assigned to group A and 215 patients to group B. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. DFS did not differ significantly between groups. The 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio for recurrence was 0.85–1.27 according to Cox proportional hazard modeling, within the margin of 2.12 required to declare 10% noninferiority.

Conclusions

DFS for patients without TSH suppression was not inferior by more than 10% to DFS for patients with TSH suppression. Thyroid-conserving surgery without TSH suppression should be considered for patients with low-risk PTC to avoid potential adverse effects of TSH suppression.

Combination LT4, LT3 treatment in primary hypothyroidism — randomized evidence and outcomes are summarized as follows: In adults with primary hypothyroidism, 13 original RCTs were reviewed, with treatment durations ranging from 5 weeks to 1 year and the majority 6 months or shorter; females accounted for 80% or more of participants in specific trials; seven had a cross-over design and the rest a parallel design; all included trials had some level of blinding except for one study. Effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) varied: eight studies found no difference versus LT4 alone, two reported significantly higher TSH with combination therapy, and two reported significantly lower TSH, including suppression to 0.07 mIU/L in a highest dose combination group using a 5:1 ratio of LT4 to LT3. Health-related quality-of-life/mood results across 13 trials were heterogeneous, with two trials showing marked superiority of combination treatment on multiple measures, two showing superiority on a minority of measurements (including improvements at 3 months but not 12 months in one trial), and eight trials showing no statistically significant superiority over LT4.

Thyroid nodule management — medical treatment for benign nodules: LT4 (levothyroxine) suppressive therapy is not recommended. In geographic areas with mild iodine deficiency, iodine supplementation, and/or TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) nonsuppressive LT4 treatment may be considered for young patients with a small nodular goiter and high-normal TSH levels. Nonsuppressive LT4 treatment is recommended for young patients with subclinical hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis. LT4 therapy is not recommended for preventing recurrence after lobectomy when serum TSH remains in reference range.

### Biochemical markers reflecting thyroid function in athyreotic patients on levothyroxine monotherapy [^760728e8]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, few studies of the effects of thyroid hormone on biochemical markers of bone turnover or bone mineral density (BMD) according to the presence of both latent hypoparathyroidism and subclinical thyrotoxicosis have been reported. The authors and other investigators studied the BMD in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy, and the results revealed that BMD values were higher in the patients with latent or overt hypoparathyroidism than they were in the patients without hypoparathyroidism. Thus, the reason why the effect of the TSH-suppressive treatment by LT4 on bone metabolism in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy is unclear may be that such patients not only have mildly decreased PTH levels but also have normal serum T3 levels. As a factor that reflects bone metabolism in patients who have undergone a thyroidectomy, it has been proposed that TSH may be a direct negative regulator of bone turnover acting via the TSH receptor on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. However, the existing data on the potential role of TSH on bone remodeling are conflicting.

Athyreotic patients who have undergone a total thyroidectomy live in a chronic condition of abnormal thyroid hormone status for the remainder of their lives. Therefore, even though the thyroidal dysfunction may be subtle, its long-term effects cannot be overlooked. The ATA states in its guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism that there is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that treatment with LT4 be targeted to achieve low-normal TSH values or high-normal T3 values in patients with hypothyroidism who are athyreotic. The results of the present study suggest that a mildly TSH suppression of LT4 can be recommended to achieve preoperative native fT3 levels and euthyroid status in athyreotic patients who have undergone a total thyroidectomy. The ATA guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and DTC state that the serum TSH should be maintained < 0.1 mIU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications in patients with persistent disease in the long-term follow-up of DTC. The present findings suggest that a mildly TSH-suppressive treatment (approximately 0.1 mIU/L by LT4) may not necessarily cause thyrotoxicosis. Rather, it may result in euthyroidism in patients who have undergone a total thyroidectomy for DTC.

Laboratory evaluation for thyroid disease and nodules — The initial evaluation for all patients should include a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). If TSH is suppressed, a free T4 and total T3 should be obtained, and a thyroid uptake scan should be obtained to assess if the index nodule is hyperfunctioning; such nodules have a low risk of malignancy and do not require FNAB.

Resistance to thyroid hormone syndromes — biochemical patterns and tissue effects: The clinical syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), caused by inactivating mutations in TRα (RTHα) or TRβ (RTHβ) could perhaps also be considered as a very particular example of how TSH may not necessarily reflect thyroid hormone signaling in other tissues than the pituitary and the hypothalamus; patients with RTHα have normal levels of TSH in combination with a low FT4 and a high T3 and suffer from local hypothyroidism in tissues that predominantly express TRα, while patients with RTHβ have normal or elevated levels of TSH despite elevated levels of FT4 and FT3 and suffer from thyroid hormone overexposure in TRα-expressing tissues; the molecular pathology of RTHβ is an unbalanced hormonal signaling due to the combination of defective TRβ and otherwise normal TRα receptors exposed to supraphysiologic levels of thyroid hormone, resulting in a mix of hypothyroid symptoms and signs related to tissues such as the liver where the β-isoform is present in higher concentrations, and hyperthyroid symptoms and signs in tissues enriched with TRα such as the myocardium.
