## Question

Did infusion speed modify the effect of balanced solution versus 0.9% saline on 90-day mortality in BaSICS, and how should that influence practice?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether infusion speed modified the effect of balanced solution versus 0.9% saline on 90-day mortality in the BaSICS trial, and how that should influence practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and whether the factorial structure allows testing for interaction. Then, I should verify the primary results for fluid type and infusion rate separately. Next, I will check the reported interaction P value and what it means statistically. After that, I should consider subgroup or sensitivity analyses that might look like effect modification but are not the formal interaction. Finally, I will translate this into practical implications for fluid choice and infusion strategy, making sure I don't over-interpret exploratory findings.

> Let me first confirm the trial design, because I need to ensure we are interpreting the interaction correctly. BaSICS was a large, multicenter, double-blind, factorial randomized clinical trial that simultaneously assigned patients to balanced crystalloid versus saline and to slower versus faster infusion rates, which means the design explicitly permits testing for an interaction between fluid type and infusion speed on outcomes, including 90-day mortality [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5].

> Now, I should verify the primary outcomes for each intervention separately. For fluid type, 90-day mortality was 26.4% with balanced solution versus 27.2% with saline, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.97 and a 95% CI that crossed 1, indicating no statistically significant mortality difference. For infusion speed, mortality was 26.6% with slower infusion versus 27.0% with faster infusion, again with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.03 and a 95% CI that crossed 1, so no significant mortality difference there either [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about effect modification. I need to check the formal test for interaction. The authors explicitly reported that there was no significant interaction between fluid type and infusion speed, with a P value of 0.98, which means the effect of balanced versus saline did not vary meaningfully by slower versus faster infusion speed, and vice versa. This is the key statistical answer to the user's question [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5].

> Wait, let me verify whether any subgroup or exploratory analyses might have looked like effect modification but were not the prespecified interaction. Secondary analyses of BaSICS examined whether prior fluid exposure before ICU enrollment modified the effect of assigned fluid, and they found signals suggesting benefit of balanced crystalloids when patients had received only balanced fluids before enrollment, but that is a different question than infusion speed and should not be conflated with the formal interaction test for speed [^136dfba2] [^cca765c9].

> I should double-check the practical implications so I don't overstate anything. Since there was no significant interaction, the lack of a mortality benefit for balanced versus saline stands regardless of infusion speed, and the lack of a mortality benefit for slower versus faster infusion stands regardless of fluid type. Therefore, neither fluid type nor infusion speed independently improved 90-day survival in this trial, and there is no evidence that slower infusion enhances or diminishes the relative effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on mortality [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5].

> But wait, what if slower infusion reduced harm via less edema or acidosis even if mortality did not change? The trial did not show a mortality signal for slower infusion, and while physiologic reasoning about edema and acid-base effects is plausible, the clinical outcomes in BaSICS did not demonstrate a benefit of slower boluses on the primary endpoint, so practice should not be changed solely to adopt slower infusion rates based on this study [^f0c9e1a5].

> Next, I should review the broader context to ensure consistency. Meta-analyses and subsequent large trials have shown mixed results overall, with some analyses suggesting a small probability of benefit for balanced crystalloids on mortality or kidney outcomes, but no consistent, large, definitive mortality benefit across all settings. This aligns with BaSICS showing no mortality difference and reinforces that neither fluid type nor infusion speed should be considered a mortality-modifying strategy based on this trial alone [^8463534c] [^c056c98b] [^009fa59c].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. No, infusion speed did not modify the effect of balanced solution versus saline on 90-day mortality in BaSICS, because the interaction P value was 0.98, indicating no statistically significant modification of treatment effect by speed. Practically, this means clinicians should not expect a mortality advantage from slower infusion rates, nor should they assume that slower infusion changes the relative merits of balanced crystalloids versus saline for survival outcomes in this population [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5].

---

Infusion speed did not modify the effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on 90-day mortality in the BaSICS trial (interaction P = 0.98) [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5]. Both slower (333 mL/h) and faster (999 mL/h) infusion rates yielded similar mortality outcomes, so **practice should not prioritize infusion speed** when choosing between balanced crystalloids and saline. Instead, clinicians should base fluid choice on patient-specific factors and the broader evidence suggesting balanced crystalloids may reduce renal complications, especially in sepsis [^e6118be9] [^1ba0ea3d] [^8463534c].

---

## Trial design and interventions

The BaSICS trial used a **factorial design**, randomly assigning patients to both fluid type (balanced crystalloid vs saline) and infusion speed (slower vs faster bolus rates) [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5]. The slower infusion rate was 333 mL/h, and the faster rate was 999 mL/h; both groups received a median of about 1.5 L on day 1, ensuring comparable total volumes across arms [^f0c9e1a5].

---

## Primary outcomes and interaction analysis

The primary outcome was **90-day mortality**, with no significant difference between balanced crystalloids and saline (26.4% vs 27.2%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.90–1.05; P = 0.47) [^92d0997c]. Similarly, there was no significant difference between slower and faster infusion rates (26.6% vs 27.0%; aHR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96–1.11; P = 0.46) [^f0c9e1a5]. Crucially, there was **no significant interaction** between infusion speed and fluid type on 90-day mortality (P = 0.98), indicating that infusion speed did not modify the effect of fluid type on mortality [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5].

---

## Clinical implications and practice recommendations

Given the absence of an interaction, **infusion speed should not influence the choice** between balanced crystalloids and saline. Clinicians should instead consider patient-specific factors and the broader evidence base:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Severity of illness, presence of sepsis, renal function, acid-base status, and electrolyte imbalances should guide fluid selection [^2e784ad3] [^4c2ad389].

- **Broader evidence base**: Although BaSICS showed no mortality difference, other studies suggest balanced crystalloids may reduce renal complications, particularly in sepsis [^e6118be9] [^1ba0ea3d] [^8463534c].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests using balanced crystalloids over saline for resuscitation in sepsis, albeit with weak evidence [^2e784ad3] [^5a2c1332].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While the BaSICS trial provides robust evidence, several limitations should be considered:

- **Generalizability**: The trial was conducted in Brazilian ICUs, and results may not directly translate to other healthcare systems or patient populations [^92d0997c].

- **Physiological considerations**: Although slower infusion rates may theoretically reduce edema and organ dysfunction, this did not translate into improved mortality outcomes in BaSICS [^f0c9e1a5].

- **Individualized care**: Clinicians should remain flexible, adjusting fluid choice and infusion speed based on ongoing patient assessment and response [^afe605d8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Infusion speed did not modify the effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on 90-day mortality in the BaSICS trial [^92d0997c] [^f0c9e1a5]. Therefore, **clinicians should not prioritize infusion speed** when selecting between these fluids. Instead, fluid choice should be individualized based on patient-specific factors and the broader evidence suggesting potential renal benefits of balanced crystalloids, particularly in sepsis [^e6118be9] [^1ba0ea3d] [^8463534c].

### Effect of intravenous fluid treatment with a balanced solution vs 0.9% saline solution on mortality in critically ill patients: the BaSICS randomized clinical trial [^92d0997c]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Intravenous fluids are used for almost all intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Clinical and laboratory studies have questioned whether specific fluid types result in improved outcomes, including mortality and acute kidney injury.

Objective

To determine the effect of a balanced solution vs saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride) on 90-day survival in critically ill patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, factorial, randomized clinical trial conducted at 75 ICUs in Brazil. Patients who were admitted to the ICU with at least 1 risk factor for worse outcomes, who required at least 1 fluid expansion, and who were expected to remain in the ICU for more than 24 hours were randomized between May 29, 2017, and March 2, 2020; follow-up concluded on October 29, 2020. Patients were randomized to 2 different fluid types (a balanced solution vs saline solution reported in this article) and 2 different infusion rates (reported separately).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either a balanced solution (n = 5522) or 0.9% saline solution (n = 5530) for all intravenous fluids.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 90-day survival.

Results

Among 11 052 patients who were randomized, 10 520 (95.2%) were available for the analysis (mean age, 61.1 [SD, 17] years; 44.2% were women). There was no significant interaction between the 2 interventions (fluid type and infusion speed; P = 0.98). Planned surgical admissions represented 48.4% of all patients. Of all the patients, 60.6% had hypotension or vasopressor use and 44.3% required mechanical ventilation at enrollment. Patients in both groups received a median of 1.5 L of fluid during the first day after enrollment. By day 90, 1381 of 5230 patients (26.4%) assigned to a balanced solution died vs 1439 of 5290 patients (27.2%) assigned to saline solution (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.90–1.05]; P = 0.47). There were no unexpected treatment-related severe adverse events in either group.

Conclusion and Relevance

Among critically ill patients requiring fluid challenges, use of a balanced solution compared with 0.9% saline solution did not significantly reduce 90-day mortality. The findings do not support the use of this balanced solution.

### Effect of slower vs faster intravenous fluid bolus rates on mortality in critically ill patients: the BaSICS randomized clinical trial [^f0c9e1a5]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Slower intravenous fluid infusion rates could reduce the formation of tissue edema and organ dysfunction in critically ill patients; however, there are no data to support different infusion rates during fluid challenges for important outcomes such as mortality.

Objective

To determine the effect of a slower infusion rate vs control infusion rate on 90-day survival in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Unblinded randomized factorial clinical trial in 75 ICUs in Brazil, involving 11 052 patients requiring at least 1 fluid challenge and with 1 risk factor for worse outcomes were randomized from May 29, 2017, to March 2, 2020. Follow-up was concluded on October 29, 2020. Patients were randomized to 2 different infusion rates (reported in this article) and 2 different fluid types (balanced fluids or saline, reported separately).

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive fluid challenges at 2 different infusion rates; 5538 to the slower rate (333 mL/h) and 5514 to the control group (999 mL/h). Patients were also randomized to receive balanced solution or 0.9% saline using a factorial design.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was 90-day survival.

Results

Of all randomized patients, 10 520 (95.2%) were analyzed (mean age, 61.1 years [SD, 17.0 years]; 44.2% were women) after excluding duplicates and consent withdrawals. Patients assigned to the slower rate received a mean of 1162 mL on the first day vs 1252 mL for the control group. By day 90, 1406 of 5276 patients (26.6%) in the slower rate group had died vs 1414 of 5244 (27.0%) in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96–1.11; P = 0.46). There was no significant interaction between fluid type and infusion rate (P = 0.98).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients in the intensive care unit requiring fluid challenges, infusing at a slower rate compared with a faster rate did not reduce 90-day mortality. These findings do not support the use of a slower infusion rate.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults – A systematic review with meta-analysis [^8463534c]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: The comparative efficacy and safety of balanced crystalloid solutions and saline for fluid therapy in critically ill adults remain uncertain. METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the use of balanced crystalloids with saline in critically ill adults. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality after pooling data from low-risk-of-bias trials using a random-effects model. We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis to describe the primary treatment effect in probability terms. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), new treatment with renal replacement therapy (RRT), and ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days to day 28. RESULTS: We identified 13 RCTs, comprising 35,884 participants. From six trials (34,450 participants) with a low risk of bias, the risk ratio (RR) for 90-day mortality with balanced crystalloids versus saline was 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91 to 1.01; I2 = 12.1%); using vague priors, the posterior probability that balanced crystalloids reduce mortality was 89.5%. The RRs of developing AKI and of being treated with RRT with balanced crystalloids versus saline were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.02) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.11), respectively. Ventilator-free days (mean difference, 0.18 days; 95% CI, −0.45 to 0.81) and vasopressor-free days (mean difference, 0.19 days; 95% CI, −0.14 to 0.51) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated effect of using balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults ranges from a 9% relative reduction to a 1% relative increase in the risk of death, with a high probability that the average effect of using balanced crystalloids is to reduce mortality.

### Back to BaSICS: early treatments matter in critical illness [^c8cd7e82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, this secondary analysis of the BaSICS trial modestly adds to the evidence supporting the use of balanced crystalloids for most critically ill adults in the emergency department and ICU. The findings are consistent with a recent meta-analysis of randomized trials (including BaSICS) that found a 90% probability that balanced crystalloids decrease mortality compared with saline. They are consistent with prior analyses suggesting that the beneficial effects of balanced crystalloids may be greater for patients with sepsis and that balanced crystalloids may increase mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. The findings also reinforce that fluid management early in critical illness may meaningfully affect longer-term outcomes.

Finally, the analysis by Zampieri and colleagues informs the design of future randomized trials. The effects of fluid therapy, antimicrobial therapy, ventilator management, and other fundamental treatments may be greatest early in critical illness. Randomized trials that begin enrollment in the days after ICU admission risk missing the key phase of the critical illness and biasing toward falsely "null" results. Going forward, ICU, emergency department, and prehospital clinicians and researchers must continue to develop the collaborations and research methods needed to conduct randomized trials that begin as soon as possible after the onset of critical illness. Critical illness research must transcend its historical focus on the ICU and expand to include the full continuum of critical illness, from prehospital care to posthospital recovery.

### Effect of intravenous treatment with a balanced solution vs saline solution on mortality… [^eb0aef83]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Question Among intensive care patients requiring intravenous fluid challenges, does the use of a balanced solution compared with saline solution improve 90-day survival. Findings In this randomized clinical that included 10 520 patients in intensive care units, intravenous fluid bolus treatment with a balanced solution vs saline solution resulted in 90-day mortality of 26. 4% vs
27. 2%, respectively, a difference that was not statistically significant. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned 1: 1 to receive either a balanced solution or 0. 9% saline solution for all intravenous fluids. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was 90-day survival. Results. By day 90, 1381 of 5230 patients assigned to a balanced solution died vs 1439 of 5290 patients assigned to saline solution.

There were no unexpected treatment-related severe adverse events in either group. Conclusion and Relevance Among critically ill patients requiring fluid challenges, use of a balanced solution compared with 0. 9% saline solution did not significantly reduce 90-day mortality. The findings do not support the use of this balanced solution. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT02875873. The study was designed to enroll 11 000 patients. 8 The sample size was calculated by estimating 35% mortality within 90 days in the control group, with an estimated 89% power to detect a hazard ratio for mortality of 0. 90 or less with an α level of.

### Back to BaSICS: early treatments matter in critical illness [^d6aead14]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid is the most common therapy received by critically ill adults. Recent randomized trials have examined the optimal volume and composition of intravenous fluid in critical illness. Because the effects of fluid on physiology and outcomes may be greatest during the earliest phases of critical illness, randomized trials of fluid volume have predominantly focused on initial management in the emergency department or operating room before ICU admission. In contrast, trials examining fluid composition have frequently controlled fluid therapy only after ICU admission, an approach that could predispose to finding no difference between trial groups either by missing the phase of illness in which patients receive the most fluid (decreasing "separation between groups") or by exposing patients to the nonassigned fluid before enrollment ("contamination"). This trial design consideration may apply to the four large trials that recently compared balanced crystalloids versus saline in acutely ill adults. The two trials in which fluid composition was controlled in the emergency department before admission reported a benefit to the use of balanced crystalloids, whereas the two trials in which fluid composition was controlled only after ICU admission reported no statistically significant difference. Could fluid therapy early in critical illness be a key determinant of the effect of fluid composition on outcomes?

In this issue of the Journal, Zampieri and colleagues (pp.) address this question through a secondary analysis of one of the two large trials of balanced crystalloids versus saline that enrolled patients in the ICU. BaSICS (Balanced Solutions in Intensive Care Study) was a multicenter, randomized trial comparing balanced crystalloids versus saline among 10,520 patients in the ICU. Most patients were enrolled within 1 day after ICU admission, and 68% had received balanced crystalloids, saline, or both before enrollment. The primary outcome, 90-day mortality, did not significantly differ between the balanced crystalloid and saline groups (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.9–1.05).

This secondary analysis of the BaSICS trial examined whether the type of fluid patients received in the 24 hours before enrollment modified the effect of trial group assignment on mortality. Patients were categorized as having received only balanced crystalloid, only saline, a mix of both, or no recorded fluid before enrollment. The authors hypothesized that among patients who had received only balanced crystalloids before enrollment, those randomized to balanced crystalloids would experience lower 90-day mortality than those randomized to saline.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^94d871ce]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our rigorous meta-analysis with adequate adjustments for design factor for cluster randomized controlled trials could not find differences in mortality at the longest follow-up, the incidence of moderate to severe AKI or the need for new RRT when administering balanced crystalloids or normal saline in the setting of intensive care medicine or emergency medicine. This relegates the findings from the two largest studies to date on the topic favouring balanced crystalloids over normal saline based on improved outcome, albeit on the composite outcome of major adverse kidney events.

Having established the current lack of evidence for using balanced fluids over normal saline, it is relevant to assess the feasibility of obtaining such evidence should any difference actually exist. This may be quantified in terms of required information size and the currently accrued information size.

The required information size depends mostly on assumptions regarding baseline outcome rate, relative risk reduction and desired power. So what is a reasonable estimate for the true baseline mortality? Obviously, this depends on disease severity of included patients. For our trial sequential analysis, we chose the control group mortality for the various settings and subgroups. However, it could be argued that a lower value should be chosen to account for publication bias.

And what is a reasonable estimate for the hypothesized relative risk reduction? We chose 5% as a reasonable minimum clinically relevant effect. The true difference might be higher, but given the ubiquity of fluid administration and the small cost differences, it seems reasonable to accept any smaller effect as clinically relevant. Our point assumptions on the baseline outcome rate and the relative treatment effect result in a very high required information size. Figure 5 displays the required sample sizes over a broader range of assumptions.

Regarding the differences in estimations of required information size in previous meta-analysis, it is clear from Table 2 that assumptions on baseline mortality and relative risk vary substantially. To account for publication bias, it is reasonable to assume that the true baseline mortality and relative risk reduction are lower than those found in the meta-analysis. However, none of the previous meta-analysis used mortality rate assumption lower than the rate found in the included studies, and only one previous meta-analysis used a lower relative risk reduction as compared to their findings from the included studies. Would these previous meta-analyses have used more appropriately conservative assumptions, their estimations of required information size would have been much larger.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6af1f482]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Within this context and the considerations on required information size, let us now take a closer look at the two large ongoing trials on the topic, BASICS and PLUS. Both studies are carried out in the setting of intensive care medicine. Table 2 shows that for sample size estimation they assumed baseline mortality/relative risk reduction to be 35%/10% and 23%/12% respectively. Although the trialist based these on databases from their previous studies, and these studies aim to include the more severely ill patients of the spectrum, these estimations are arguably high. Thus, their sample size may prove inadequate. But from the perspective of meta-analysis, more problems arise. Should these studies yield an equivocal result or even a result favouring balanced solutions — which in itself would be at risk of a type I error, then their uptake in meta-analysis is not likely to yield conclusive evidence. And if these studies should yield a result favouring normal saline, uptake in meta-analyses will definitely not yield convincing evidence. Importantly, in case of a result favouring one type of fluid over the other, this will only be the case for the more severely ill that will have been included in these trials. This will therefore not silence the debate for patients less severely ill. It is even questionable whether trials are not generally overestimated in this era of personalized medicine. In any case, regardless of the outcome of the two ongoing trials, physiology will continue to guide the choice of fluids in the setting of intensive care medicine and emergency medicine. And currently, physiology favours balanced solutions.

### Saline versus balanced solutions: are clinical trials comparing two crystalloid solutions really needed? [^54b3c500]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Some of our colleagues believe that everything should be tested in prospective, randomized clinical trials. Some of our colleagues also believe that so-called pragmatic trials can help improve the care of critically ill patients. The designs of such studies are based on the postulate that patients are all the same and will be globally either improved or harmed by one strategy compared with another. This may be true for some interventions but is certainly not true for all, including choice of crystalloid solution.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^ac347e4b]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative Fluid Management

Balanced versus Saline Crystalloid Solutions

Saline (0.9% sodium chloride; "normal saline") has historically been the most commonly used intravenous crystalloid for intraoperative resuscitation and maintenance fluid therapy; however, physiologically balanced crystalloids, like lactated Ringer's solution, more closely approximate the physiologic levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride found in plasma. Because normal saline has a superphysiologic concentration of chloride (154 mM, compared to 94 to 111 mM in plasma), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a known consequence of normal saline administration, but whether this is of any clinical consequence is unresolved.

A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies on the use of balanced versus normal saline in the perioperative period demonstrated (1) uncertain effect on postoperative mortality (low certainty), (2) uncertain effect on need for renal replacement therapy (low certainty), and (3) improved postoperative acid–base status (moderate certainty). Further studies are necessary in specific surgical populations. For example, the Saline versus Lactated Ringer's Solution: The Saline or Lactated Ringer's (SOLAR) trial of elective colorectal and orthopedic surgery patients found no difference in composite postoperative complications or AKI between patients receiving perioperative saline or lactated Ringer's solution. However, balanced crystalloid improved postoperative electrolyte (lower chloride and higher bicarbonate) and acid–base (higher pH) status; the clinical implications of these changes remains unresolved.

This builds upon evidence from the critically ill population, which showed a high probability that using balanced crystalloids reduces AKI compared to saline, although evidence from key randomized trials has been conflicting. Specifically, the Balanced Solutions in Intensive Care Study (BaSICS) did not show a difference in 90-day mortality among critically ill patients bolused with saline compared to balanced solutions. This contrasts with the earlier Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART), which showed balanced crystalloid use resulted in lower rate of death, new renal replacement, or persistent renal dysfunction. Among noncritically ill emergency department patients in the Saline against Lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte in the Emergency Department (SALT-ED) trial, there was no difference in hospital-free days (primary outcome), but there was lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days (composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, and persistent renal dysfunction).

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^301f4c00]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this analysis of the CLOVERS trial, initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution as compared with 0.9% saline was associated with a reduced 90-day mortality and more hospital-free days at 28 days.

Current SSC guidelines suggest balanced crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis, including the initial fluid resuscitation phase of 30mL/kg within the first 3 hours. The suggestion to use balanced crystalloids is supported by a secondary analysis of the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) trial, which showed benefits with balanced crystalloids compared with 0.9% saline in patients with sepsis. The importance of early resuscitation fluid choice is shown in a secondary analysis of the Balanced Solutions in Intensive Care Study (BaSICS), which found a survival benefit with balanced crystalloids as compared with 0.9% saline in critically ill patients who exclusively received balanced crystalloids before trial enrollment. Furthermore, the benefit of balanced crystalloids may also be dependent on the timing of treatment initiation. However, no studies investigated the relevance of the type of crystalloid fluid used specifically for the initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis. In previous trials, comparing balanced crystalloids to 0.9% saline in critically ill patients (including the SMART trial), fluid treatment regimens lasted for a minimum of 24 hours up to the length of the ICU stay, which precludes the assessment of the initial resuscitation only.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a23d7f98]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our rigorous meta-analysis could not find a significant different effect on mortality, moderate to severe renal failure or new renal replacement therapy between administering balanced crystalloids or normal saline to patients treated in the setting of intensive care medicine and emergency medicine. In addition, our rigorous trial sequential analysis shows that borders for futility were not crossed, but that the currently accrued information size is smaller and the required information size is much larger than previously anticipated. Therefore, it is strongly debatable whether current ongoing trials on the topic will provide good guidance for practicing intensivists and emergency physicians. This implies that it is likely that the evidence base from physiology, individual trials and observational studies will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and saline in this setting. This evidence base is limited, but currently arguably places the burden of proof on normal saline and favours balanced crystalloids for the millions of patients treated worldwide with billions of litres of fluids in the setting of intensive care medicine and emergency medicine.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9efd2990]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Therefore, we now set out to perform a rigorous systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis focussing both on the setting of intensive care medicine and emergency medicine as these frequently represent a continuum of care for critically ill patients or those at risk to become critically ill. We also sought to compare our findings to those of other meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses and planned or ongoing large studies in the field.

Thus, the objective of our article was to examine the available evidence regarding the effect of balanced crystalloids versus normal saline on clinical outcomes (i.e. mortality at the longest follow-up, AKI and the need for RRT) in the setting of intensive care medicine and emergency medicine. Moreover, this report aims to provide a more precise estimate of the true current level of evidence and the potential contribution and relevance of future trials on choosing balanced crystalloids or normal saline in the setting of intensive care medicine and emergency medicine. This will allow us to address the ultimate question: can future trials be expected to provide definitive answers any time soon or will physiology continue to prevail when choosing between normal saline or balanced crystalloids?

Finally, the vast majority of included studies administered cumulative volumes of IV fluids as low as only 1 to 2 l to patients. Therefore, high-risk patients and more severely ill or septic patients that are more likely to receive moderate to high cumulative fluid volumes may not have been represented adequately. This is relevant given the subgroup analysis from the SMART study showed more pronounced differences in mortality and renal outcomes in septic patients and in those patients that required larger amount of fluids.

### Balanced crystalloids in sepsis: are we there yet? [^869f9ec3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read the post hoc analysis of the SMART (Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial) trial with great interest, agree with the authors' assertions that balanced crystalloids are likely to be the most appropriate choice for critically ill patients experiencing sepsis, and respect the concerns about unequivocally recommending their judicious use. Although the critical care community awaits results from the PLUS (Plasma-Lyte 148 versus Saline) and BaSICS (Balanced Solution versus Saline in Intensive Care Study) studies, many institutions and providers are considering or already have implemented pathways and protocols for sepsis management that provide guidance for the choice of crystalloids during resuscitation. These management strategies may be more completely informed if all of the high-quality data for fluid resuscitation with balanced crystalloids versus saline in sepsis, including the recently published post hoc analysis of SMART, were considered.

A recently published systematic review and meta-analysis attempted to clarify the impact of using balanced crystalloids in sepsis; however, including these new data with previously published controlled trials and observational studies improves on those efforts. When prior data are considered alongside the SMART post hoc analysis, the benefit on short-term mortality appears less certain, although potentially still impactful (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–1.01) (,–) (Figure 1). We have greater confidence in the decreased odds of patients developing acute kidney injury (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49–0.92) but uncertainty regarding progression to receipt of renal replacement therapy (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71–1.03) when receiving balanced crystalloids (,–). Although two of the three individual outcomes did not show significance, there was a lower incidence of major adverse kidney events in 30 days with balanced crystalloids compared with saline (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.94) in the two studies that evaluated this outcome. Differences in this composite outcome, which are not being driven by a particular intermediate clinical endpoint, are extremely encouraging for balanced crystalloid use.

### Association between type of fluid received prior to enrollment, type of admission, and effect of balanced crystalloid in critically ill adults: a secondary exploratory analysis of the BaSICS clinical trial [^136dfba2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The effects of balanced crystalloid versus saline on clinical outcomes for ICU patients may be modified by the type of fluid that patients received for initial resuscitation and by the type of admission. Objectives: To assess whether the results of a randomized controlled trial could be affected by fluid use before enrollment and admission type. Methods: Secondary post hoc analysis of the BaSICS (Balanced Solution in Intensive Care Study) trial, which compared a balanced solution (Plasma-Lyte 148) with 0.9% saline in the ICU. Patients were categorized according to fluid use in the 24 hours before enrollment in four groups (balanced solutions only, 0.9% saline only, a mix of both, and no fluid before enrollment) and according to admission type (planned, unplanned with sepsis, and unplanned without sepsis). The association between 90-day mortality and the randomization group was assessed using a hierarchical logistic Bayesian model. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 10,520 patients were included. There was a low probability that the balanced solution was associated with improved 90-day mortality in the whole trial population (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 89% credible interval [CrI], 0.66–10.51; probability of benefit, 0.58); however, probability of benefit was high for patients who received only balanced solutions before enrollment (regardless of admission type, OR, 0.78; 89% CrI, 0.56–1.03; probability of benefit, 0.92), mostly because of a benefit in unplanned admissions due to sepsis (OR, 0.70; 89% CrI, 0.50–0.97; probability of benefit, 0.96) and planned admissions (OR, 0.79; 89% CrI, 0.65–0.97; probability of benefit, 0.97). Conclusions: There is a high probability that balanced solution use in the ICU reduces 90-day mortality in patients who exclusively received balanced fluids before trial enrollment. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02875873).

Results

The flow diagram describing the study selection process is provided in Additional file 2: Figure S1. Our search strategy identified 1910 references after excluding duplicates. Following screening of titles and abstracts, 88 were selected for full-text assessment. Before resolution, agreement between authors was 91%. From these 88 articles, nine studies were considered for data extraction. Before resolution, agreement between authors was 82%. None of these were unpublished, but one was in abstract format only. Ultimately, all nine trials with a total of 32,777 participants were included in this systematic review. Four of these trials were cluster randomized trials, and five were randomized trials at the patient level. Eight of the trials had data available on mortality (n = 32,596), seven on AKI (n = 31,486) and six on the need for new RRT (n = 31,612). Please note that these numbers have not yet been adjusted for design effect.

### Balanced crystalloids or 0.9% saline in sepsis. beyond reasonable doubt? [^05b1247e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy with crystalloid solutions is one of the most common interventions for patients with sepsis. Both 0.9% saline and balanced crystalloids are widely used. However, with respect to mortality risk, the comparative effectiveness of these fluids is uncertain.

In this issue of the Journal, Brown and colleagues (pp.) report a post hoc analysis of SMART (Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial). SMART was a single-center, open-label, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial. A total of 15,802 patients were enrolled in five ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in under 2 years. This remarkable feat was possible because of the study's novel design. Random assignment to balanced crystalloids or 0.9% saline occurred at the level of the ICU, rather than at the level of the individual patient, and each ICU "crossed over" to use each fluid multiple times over the duration of the study. All patients who were admitted to an ICU during the study were included in the study by default. All data were obtained from the electronic health record, and a waiver of consent was granted. This novel methodology represents a major breakthrough for comparative effectiveness research in critical care and has resulted in a tremendously useful dataset that can now be used for hypothesis-driven exploratory analyses. Here the authors report one such analysis evaluating 30-day in-hospital mortality among the 1,641 trial patients who were admitted to the medical ICU with sepsis. Their hypothesis was that balanced crystalloids would reduce in-hospital mortality at day 30.

### Balanced crystalloid versus saline for resuscitation in pediatric septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9cd56c08]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results are consistent with several adult trials. The BASICS trial, a large RCT involving 11,052 adult patients, and a meta-analysis of RCTs with 32,777 patients demonstrated no difference in AKI, mortality, ICU length of stay, and initiation of RRT between BS and NS groups. However, unlike our findings, the BASICS trial showed no difference in hospital length of stay between the two groups (MR 0.98; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03). Additionally, a meta-analysis comprising 38,798 ICU patients from observational and RCTs studies demonstrated that children treated with balanced crystalloid solutions had a shorter hospital stay (WMD: −1.10 days; 95% CI − 2.10 to − 0.10; p = 0.03; I² = 17%; p = 0.30) compared to those treated with saline. Similarly, another meta-analysis involving 441 children with acute diarrhea and severe dehydration found that balanced solutions slightly reduced hospitalization time (MD: −0.35 days; 95% CI − 0.60 to − 0.10). These findings suggest that the impact of crystalloid choice on hospital length of stay may be influenced by multiple factors, including patient characteristics, illness severity, study design and specific clinical situations. Additionally, differences in patient numbers and the higher survival rates observed in those receiving balanced solutions can influence the quantification of hospitalization days in observational studies. Overall, the varying results from different studies highlight the complexity of fluid management in critical care settings.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline for critically ill patients (BEST-living): a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^c056c98b]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

The effect of balanced crystalloids compared with that of saline in critically ill patients overall and in specific subgroups is unclear. We aimed to assess whether use of balanced solutions, compared with 0·9% sodium chloride (saline), decreased in-hospital mortality in adult patients in intensive care units (ICUs).

Methods

For this systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases from inception until March 1, 2022 (updated Sept 1, 2023) for individually randomised and cluster-randomised trials comparing balanced solutions with saline for adult patients in the ICU. Eligible trials were those that allocated patients to receive balanced solutions or saline for fluid resuscitation and maintenance fluids, or for maintenance fluids only; and administered the allocated fluid throughout ICU admission or, for trials using landmark mortality as their primary outcome, until the timepoint at which mortality was assessed (if ≥ 28 days). Authors of eligible trials were contacted to request individual patient data. Data obtained from eligible trials were merged, checked for accuracy, and centrally analysed by use of Bayesian regression models. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Prespecified subgroups included patients with traumatic brain injury. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022299282).

Findings

Our search identified 5219 records, yielding six eligible randomised controlled trials. Data obtained for 34685 participants from the six trials, 17407 assigned to receive balanced crystalloids and 17278 to receive saline, were included in the analysis. The mean age of participants was 58·8 years (SD 17·5). Of 34653 participants with available data, 14579 (42·1%) were female and 20074 (57·9%) were male. Among patients who provided consent to report in-hospital mortality, 2907 (16·8%) of 17313 assigned balanced solutions and 2975 (17·3%) of 17166 assigned saline died in hospital (odds ratio [OR] 0·962 [95% CrI 0·909 to 1·019], absolute difference -0·4 percentage points [-1·5 to 0·2]). The posterior probability that balanced solutions reduced mortality was 0·895. In patients with traumatic brain injury, 191 (19·1%) of 999 assigned balanced and 141 (14·7%) of 962 assigned saline died (OR 1·424 [1·100 to 1·818], absolute difference 3·2 percentage points [0·7 to 8·7]). The probability that balanced solutions increased mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury was 0·975. In an independent risk of bias assessment, two trials were deemed to be at low risk of bias and four at high risk of bias.

Interpretation

The probability that using balanced solutions in the ICU reduces in-hospital mortality is high, although the certainty of the evidence was moderate and the absolute risk reduction was small. In patients with traumatic brain injury, using balanced solutions was associated with increased in-hospital mortality.

### Order substitutions and education for balanced crystalloid solution use in an integrated health care system and association with major adverse kidney events [^3e6b5fd8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous fluids are the most commonly prescribed medical therapy in the US, with an estimated 200 million liters of crystalloid administered annually. Emerging evidence suggests that normal saline (NS; 0.9% sodium chloride) solution is associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, increases in proinflammatory cytokines, decreased kidney perfusion, acute kidney injury, and mortality. Nevertheless, outcomes associated with different crystalloid formulations have historically been sparsely studied.

Recently, 2 randomized trials from a single center suggested preferentially administering balanced crystalloids instead of NS for almost all intravenous fluid therapy for emergency department (ED) and hospital inpatients decreases the rate of major adverse kidney events at 30 days (MAKE30), a composite outcome that comprises death, new persistent kidney dysfunction, or new dialysis within 30 days. Notably, these studies' predominant balanced crystalloid was lactated Ringer (LR) solution, and study interventions began immediately on ED arrival. In contrast, the 0.9% NS vs Plasma-Lyte 148 (Baxter International) for intensive care unit (ICU) fluid therapy (SPLIT) and the Balanced Solutions in Intensive Care Study (BASICS) studies randomly assigned patients to saline solution or Plasma-Lyte after ICU admission and demonstrated no between-group differences for the primary outcomes of acute kidney injury and mortality, respectively.

To date, the real-world effectiveness of using LR as the preferred intravenous fluid for patients throughout ED- and hospital-based care remains unknown. Furthermore, strategies for implementing a transition from preferentially prescribing NS to balanced crystalloid fluids have not, to our knowledge, been reported. We therefore performed a prospective type 2 hybrid implementation and comparative effectiveness research study — a design that gives equal weight to clinical and implementation outcomes — to evaluate practice change and clinical outcomes associated with a multimodal intervention program designed to transform intravenous fluid prescribing practices across an integrated health care system.

### Back to BaSICS: early treatments matter in critical illness [^cca765c9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The results confirmed the authors' hypothesis. Among the 3,202 patients who had received only balanced crystalloids before enrollment, mortality was 16% in the balanced crystalloid group and 20% in the saline group, and the probability that balanced crystalloids decreased mortality compared with saline was 92%. This high probability of benefit from balanced crystalloids was consistent across planned admissions (97%), unplanned admissions with sepsis (96%), and unplanned admissions without sepsis or traumatic brain injury (94%). As in the original trial, balanced crystalloids increased mortality compared with saline for patients with traumatic brain injury, potentially because of differences in tonicity.

In summary, this secondary analysis suggests that the effects of balanced crystalloids versus saline on mortality in the BaSICS trial may have been influenced by the type of fluid patients received in the emergency department, operating room, and ICU before enrollment. For patients who had only received balanced crystalloids before enrollment, the use of balanced crystalloids in the ICU appeared to decrease mortality. For patients who had received saline before enrollment, the choice of fluid in the ICU did not appear to affect outcomes.

This analysis has several strengths. First, BaSICS was a multicenter, randomized trial of balanced crystalloids versus saline, making it well-suited to this effect modification analysis. Second, the sample size allowed thousands of patients in each subgroup. Third, while this analysis was post hoc, the hypothesis it examined originated in a prior study; the concordance in findings decreases the likelihood that they are because of chance.

This analysis also has limitations. First, it was post hoc and reported multiple associations. Second, fluid receipt before enrollment was determined by treating clinicians and not trial protocol. Thus, the apparent effect modification by fluid type before enrollment may actually represent effect modification by other patient or clinician factors that are correlated with the type of fluid received before enrollment. Third, the mechanism is uncertain by which receipt of saline before enrollment could mitigate differences in outcomes between patients randomized to balanced crystalloids and saline. The data on chloride and hyperchloremia from this analysis do not appear to support these factors as mediating the observed effect modification.

### Crystalloid FLUID choices for resuscitation of hospitalized patients… [^dab2ffc7]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Until recently, the evidence base supporting the superiority of Ringer's Lactate has been derived from observational studies. Two recent pilot studies in critically ill patients comparing 0. 9% saline to balanced crystalloid fluids did not detect clinical outcome differences between the fluid groups, but the trials were not powered to do so. Furthermore, two multiple period cluster cross-over studies conducted at one institution comparing 0. 9% saline to balanced crystalloids in the emergency department and intensive care unit found small differences in a composite outcome which included death, requirement for dialysis or persistent renal dysfunction, in favor of balanced crystalloids.

In contrast, two large multi-centre randomized trials examined the efficacy of NS as compared with a balanced crystalloid on the primary outcome 90-day mortality. Neither of these trials detected a difference in 90-day mortality; in BaSICS, the mortality rate was 22. 0% versus
21. 8%; in PLUS, mortality was 27. 2% versus
26. 4%. In low risk of bias trials, there was no significant difference in mortality for the 0. 9% saline as compared with balanced crystalloid group
0. 96), nor renal function. However, authors concluded that there is a high probability balanced crystalloids reduce death since the CIs ranged from a 9% relative reduction to a 1% relative increase in death.

Authors and editorialists urge the conduct of large multi-centre randomized trials, with longer-term patient centred outcomes supported by health economic evaluations to provide confirmatory evidence to guide future clinical practice and resource allocation related to these usual care crystalloid fluids. Our trial will answer this fundamental fluid resuscitation question and determine if Ringer's Lactate is superior to 0. 9% saline at much lower cost in comparison to an individual patient randomized controlled trial, or even a conventional cluster RCT. Drug: Ringer's lactate Drug:

0. 9% saline

### Fluids in the ICU: which is the right one? [^ba477040]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2022 Finfer et al. reported the results of the Plasma-Lyte versUs Saline (PLUS) study trial, which compared Plasmalyte© versus saline in ICU patients. This also failed to detect a difference in mortality. Superficially then it may appear there is no difference in outcomes if these trials are accurate. However, closer examination suggests that there was likely insufficient separation of the interventions (due to the nature of postoperative ICU populations who have already received large quantities of what is largely buffered fluid) and a total dose of fluid that is unlikely to have been able to lead to a detectable difference. Perhaps a more accurate conclusion therefore is that both these trials were unable to find a difference because there was an insufficient dose of the putative hazard delivered, and too much contamination in the intervention groups. A post hoc analysis of the Balanced Solution versus Saline in Intensive Care (BaSICS) study trial found a high probability that the use of balanced solution improves 90-day mortality in patients without 'contamination' and who received only balanced fluids. Similar results were obtained by a secondary analysis of the SMART trial. Both of the above-mentioned problems are avoided by using a cluster crossover design and allowing naturally occurring randomization (i.e. date of ICU admission) to minimize bias in the trial. On the same day that PLUS was published, the BaSICs and PLUS investigators together reported a meta-analysis of the high quality trial data in this clinical space that concluded there is a 90% chance that 0.9% saline is associated with an increase in mortality in adult ICU patients (risk ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.91–1.01; I² = 12.1%). In addition, it must be mentioned that these trials used the corresponding fluid not only for resuscitation, but also for maintenance and replacement. This might lead to an overestimation of the effect on fluid boluses during fluid resuscitation alone.

### Effect of intravenous fluid treatment with a balanced solution vs 0.9% saline solution on mortality in critically ill patients: the BaSICS randomized clinical trial [^1111e594]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study BaSICS was published by Fernando G Zampieri and colleagues in 2021 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness, Acute kidney injury and Maintenance fluid therapy. In the BaSICS study, the trial question was: is a balanced solution superior to 0.9% saline solution in critically ill patients requiring fluid challenges? In the BaSICS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the BaSICS study, the population was: 10520 patients (4650 female, 5870 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients requiring fluid administration with ≥ 1 risk factors for worse outcomes. The key exclusion criteria were AKI treated or expected to require RRT within the next 6 hours, severe electrolyte disturbance, imminent death within 24 hours, brain death, receipt of palliative care. In the BaSICS study, the interventions were: n = 5522 balanced solution (Plasma-Lyte) n = 5530 saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride). In the BaSICS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in deaths at day 90 (26.4% vs. 27.2%; aHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.05). In the BaSICS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in need for RRT in the hospital (7.5% vs. 8.1%; OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06) No significant difference in AKI with KDIGO stage ≥ 2 at day 7 (23.4% vs. 23.3%; OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.3) No significant difference in hospital length of stay (8 days vs. 9 days; AD -0.3 days, 95% CI -1.1 to 0.5). In the BaSICS study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients requiring fluid administration with ≥ 1 risk factors for worse outcomes, balanced solution was not superior to saline solution with respect to deaths at day 90.

In a secondary analysis of "only the 1,641 patients admitted to medical ICUs with a diagnosis of sepsis", balanced solutions were associated with "reduced 30-day hospital mortality (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59–0.93) and MAKE30, and increased vasopressor- and RRT-free days".

### Balanced crystalloids versus normal saline for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^3c404aa0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fluid resuscitation is a fundamental component of the management of critically ill patients, but whether choice of crystalloid affects patient outcomes remains controversial. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of balanced crystalloids with normal saline.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central and EMBASE up to October 2018 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared balanced crystalloids versus normal saline in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary results were the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and risk of receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT). Two authors independently screened articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The meta-analysis was conducted using Revman 5.3, trial sequential analysis (TSA) 0.9 and STATA 12.0.

Results

Nine RCTs were identified. The pooled analyses showed that there were no significant differences in mortality (relative risk (RR) = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.86, 1.01, P = 0.08), incidence of AKI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88, 1.00, P = 0.06) or RRT use rate (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69, 1.27, P = 0.67) between balanced crystalloids and normal saline groups. However, TSA did not provide conclusive evidence.

Conclusions

Among critically ill patients receiving crystalloid fluid therapy, use of a balanced crystalloid compared with normal saline did not reduce the mortality, risk of severe AKI or RRT use rate. Further large randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm or refute this finding.

Trial Registration

A protocol of this meta-analysis has been registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42018094857).

### Balanced crystalloids or 0.9% saline in sepsis. beyond reasonable doubt? [^7665d909]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on these considerations, it is clear that the findings of this post hoc analysis do not constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt that balanced crystalloids reduce in-hospital mortality compared with 0.9% saline in patients with sepsis. Because millions of patients around the world with sepsis receive intravenous crystalloid fluid therapy every year, such proof is desirable to inform healthcare decision-making on a global scale. Although randomized controlled trials that are being conducted in Australia and New Zealand and in Brazil, respectively, may provide such proof, despite the caveats outlined here, the current data are already actionable by clinicians. This analysis includes data from 1,641 trial participants with sepsis, and the treatment groups appear very similar at baseline. Differences in outcomes observed could well be a result of differences in exposure to the fluids studied. Moreover, for trials that evaluate the comparative effectiveness of standard treatments, my view is that clinicians should not wait for proof beyond a reasonable doubt before they implement trial findings. Instead, the appropriate burden of proof to consider should be based on the balance of probabilities. Logically, given that in many countries both 0.9% saline and balanced crystalloids are available and widely used, clinicians should ask themselves, "On the basis of all of the available evidence (and considering the costs), is it more probable that 0.9% saline or a balanced crystalloid is the best choice for this patient?"

On the balance of probabilities, the data presented by Brown and colleagues suggest that balanced crystalloids are likely to be the best choice. Although these data do not represent proof beyond a reasonable doubt, they add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that balanced crystalloid fluids are preferred to 0.9% saline for intravenous fluid therapy. Although the results of ongoing trials are awaited, clinicians can reasonably use balanced crystalloids in preference to 0.9% saline. Doing so might well reduce the risk for death in critically ill patients with sepsis and potentially in other patients as well.

### Personalised fluid resuscitation in the ICU: still a fluid concept? [^4924cb8f]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Balanced fluids are crystalloid and colloid solutions with a more physiologically balanced electrolyte formulation, such as Hartmann's solution, PlasmaLyte, and Hextend. The use of these fluids for volume resuscitation can potentially prevent the development of hyperchloraemic acidosis, an electrolyte abnormality often encountered with the use of "normal" saline even after relatively low volume application. In addition, the use of 0.9% saline has been associated with potential adverse renal effects, possibly mediated by its effects on renal blood flow. For example, in a randomised controlled, double-blind cross-over study on the effects of 2-L infusions of 0.9% saline and PlasmaLyte 148 in healthy volunteers, intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline resulted in reductions in renal blood flow velocity and renal cortical tissue perfusion. A similar difference was seen in a subsequent study, comparing a balanced starch solution with starch in 0.9% saline, showing an increase in renal cortical tissue perfusion in the balanced group compared with the saline group. In experimental sepsis models, balanced fluids are associated with a better short-term survival. In a prospective, open-label, sequential period pilot study in 1533 critically ill patients, implementation of a chloride-restrictive strategy in a tertiary ICU was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of acute kidney injury and the use of renal replacement therapy. However, in the largest prospective randomised study to date, no signal towards harm was found regarding the use of 0.9% saline in ICU patients compared with PlasmaLyte 148. In this double-blind, cluster randomised, double cross-over trial, the effects of saline versus PlasmaLyte on renal complications in patients admitted to the ICU were compared. No differences between the two groups were found in mortality, development of acute kidney injury, and use of renal replacement therapy. Preparations are underway for the large PlasmaLyte versus Saline (PLUS) trial (NCT02721654) to test the hypothesis that 90-day all-cause mortality will be lower in patients assigned to receive PlasmaLyte for intravenous volume resuscitation and subsequent crystalloid therapy in the ICU compared to those assigned to receive 0.9% saline. Critics of this trial argue that: the design does not take into account patient heterogeneity, and assumes that all patients will be either improved or harmed by one strategy compared with another; the intervention deviates from normal clinical practice in which the choice of fluid usually would be guided by baseline factors and elements arising during therapy such as the results of electrolyte measurements; the outcomes of the trial are predictable because of the trial design; and education of clinicians is more likely to improve patient outcomes.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4c2ad389]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

As for the currently accrued information size, it should be emphasized that all previous trial sequential analyses have not applied adjustments for clustering effects and have therefore grossly overestimated the information size that is currently available. This implies that the number of patients still to be randomized to reach any required information size is equally grossly underestimated. In all, it appears that the available information size has previously been grossly underestimated and that the required information size has likely been grossly overestimated. The effort required for future trials is likely much greater than anticipated.

The ultimate goal of studies on this topic is to better inform the practicing intensivist or emergency physician on what fluid to choose for their patients. In the absence of solid evidence, we cannot ignore possible signal of harm for normal saline from physiology and individual trials. On the other hand, preference for balanced solutions with lower sodium also increased incidence of hyponatremia in the SMART study. In addition, the harmful effect of saline remains subject of debate. Also, the acetate in some balanced solutions may cause acidosis and hypotension when infusion exceeds metabolic capacity as shown in high flux dialysis. Still, subgroup analysis from the clinical SALT-ED and SMART studies did show that saline seems especially problematic in patients with signs of impaired renal function, in patients with sepsis and those patients receiving large amounts of fluids. In addition, subgroup analysis in this meta-analysis shows a survival benefit for patients with sepsis when balanced fluids are used. Therefore, the burden of proof is currently arguably on normal saline. At the very least, a personalized approach to choosing the right fluid based on physiological reasoning seems advocated.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

RCTs comparing NS and BSSs in critically ill adult patients.

Data Synthesis

Recently published large RCTs comparing NS with BSSs in heterogeneous populations of intensive care unit patients did not find significant differences in mortality, despite positive findings in some end points in prior RCTs. However, there were a number of methodologic issues common to the RCTs including: varying study designs and end points, clinician discretion for the majority or all treatments other than the primary intervention fluid, heterogeneous patients with varying levels of acuity, and lack of power to investigate potential subgroup differences. In addition, there were problematic issues related to blinding and use of nonstudy fluids.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Intravenous fluids are a mainstay of supportive care for critically ill patients. Similar to the so-called crystalloid-colloid debate, there has been a long-standing debate among critical care clinicians and researchers concerning the preferred crystalloid solution, NS versus one of the available BSSs.

Conclusions

Despite the recent publication of large multicenter RCTs, the preferred resuscitation fluid, NS or a BSS, for critically ill patients is still open for debate, although the available investigations do provide some direction for clinicians and for future investigations.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^c85754e8]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Hemodynamic management — evidence comparing balanced crystalloids with normal saline in sepsis includes the following: In the SPLIT multicenter, double-blinded clinical trial, the comparison between balanced solutions and normal saline yielded no differences in mortality or AKI, with septic patients comprising 4%. In 2016, the SALT pilot trial (n = 974) reported septic patients comprising 25% and 28% of the population, respectively, and the MAKE30 primary outcome was similar between groups (24.6% vs. 24.7%). In the SMART trial including 15,802 patients, in the pre-specified subgroup of patients admitted with sepsis in all participating ICUs, 30-day mortality was lower with balanced solutions versus normal saline (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94); in a secondary analysis including only the 1,641 patients admitted to medical ICUs with a diagnosis of sepsis, balanced solutions were associated with reduced 30-day hospital mortality (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59–0.93) and MAKE30, and increased vasopressor- and RRT-free days.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6f365094]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Comparisons

Five meta-analyses and two ongoing trials fulfilled our criteria for extraction. Included studies are given in Additional file 1: Table S6. Results for mortality, accrued and required information sizes and the underlying assumptions may be found in Table 2. For reference, this table also contains that information for the two largest trials that dominated the meta-analyses after their publication. Our meta-analysis adjusted studies for design effect, in contrast to previous meta-analyses, causing the estimated accrued information size to be very different. Additional file 1: Table S7 shows a sensitivity analysis using different imputations (i.e. 0.05, 0.011 and 0.005) for ICC to show its impact on the accrued information size (AIS), required information size (RIS) and AIS/RIS. Besides differences in estimated accrued information size, there were also large differences between observed versus assumed baseline mortality and relative risk reduction for some meta-analyses. Moreover, there were large differences between all meta-analyses and ongoing studies related to assumptions for baseline mortality, relative risk reduction and power, and therefore calculated required information size. Figure 5 illustrates the effect of assumed baseline mortality, relative risk reduction and power on sample size without adjustment for trial diversity.

### Effect of treatment with balanced crystalloids versus normal saline on the mortality of critically ill patients with and without traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7fd02612]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Some studies suggest that balanced solutions may improve outcomes in critical care patients. However, in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) existing data indicate that normal saline may be preferred. We hypothesized that mortality in critically ill patients with and without TBI would differ with the use of balanced salt solutions versus normal saline.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of balanced crystalloids versus normal saline on 90-day mortality in adult critical care patients with and without TBI. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, renal complications, need for vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, and mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) statement and estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) with a random-effects model.

Results

We included 15 clinical trials involving 35,207 patients. The OR of mortality with balanced solutions versus saline in patients without TBI was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87–0.98; P = 0.01; I² = 0%), while the OR for mortality in patients with TBI was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.03–1.65; P = 0.03; I² = 0%). We found no differences in secondary outcomes due to fluid choice although data were unavailable to calculate pooled estimates for some of the secondary outcomes for TBI patients. In patients with sepsis, the OR of mortality with balanced solutions was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.83–1.02; I² = 0%).

Conclusions

In comparison to normal saline, balanced solutions were associated with a reduction in mortality in critical care patients without TBI. However, balanced solutions were associated with an increase in mortality in patients with TBI. These findings suggest that the effect of fluid choice on intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes may depend partially on the type of critical illness and in particular in patients with TBI.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in noncritically ill adults [^4bd86ae9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study SALT-ED was published by Wesley H Self and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Maintenance fluid therapy and Acute kidney injury. In the SALT-ED study, the trial question was: what is the effect of balanced crystalloids in noncritically ill patients treated with intravenous fluids in the emergency department? In the SALT-ED study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the SALT-ED study, the population was: 13347 patients (6886 female, 6461 male). The inclusion criteria were noncritically ill patients who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of < 500 mL of crystalloids in the emergency department, age < 18 years, discharge from emergency department. In the SALT-ED study, the interventions were: n = 6708 balanced crystalloids (infusion of lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) n = 6639 normal saline (infusion of 0.9% saline). In the SALT-ED study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in hospital-free days (25 days vs. 25 days; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.04). In the SALT-ED study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the rate of major adverse kidney events within 30 days (4.7% vs. 5.6%; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95) No significant difference in stage 2 or higher AKI (8% vs. 8.6%; OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.03) No significant difference in death in the hospital (1.4% vs. 1.6%; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.16). In the SALT-ED study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, new RRT, final serum creatinine ≥ 200% of baseline. In the SALT-ED study, the conclusion was: in noncritically ill patients who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU, balanced crystalloids were not superior to normal saline with respect to a hospital-free days.

### Clinical effects of balanced crystalloids vs saline in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis: a subgroup analysis of cluster randomized clinical trials [^41a4f52d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Fewer patients experienced hypokalemia (potassium < 3.0 mmol/L) in the balanced crystalloids group than the saline group (adjusted odds ratio = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13–0.91). Other clinical outcomes were similar between groups (Table 3). Most patients in both groups received continuous intravenous insulin infusion (79 patients [84%] in the balanced crystalloids group; 65 patients [83%] in the saline group). In both the balanced crystalloids group and saline group, the percentage of patients who experienced in-hospital death (0 patients vs 1 patients [1%], respectively), major adverse kidney events within 30 days (5 patients [5%] vs 5 patients [6%], respectively), and mechanical ventilation (3 patients [3%] vs 2 patients [3%], respectively) was low.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults [^e6118be9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both balanced crystalloids and saline are used for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adults, but it is not known which results in better clinical outcomes.

Methods

In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial conducted in five intensive care units at an academic center, we assigned 15,802 adults to receive saline (0.9% sodium chloride) or balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) according to the randomization of the unit to which they were admitted. The primary outcome was a major adverse kidney event within 30 days - a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥ 200% of baseline) - all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first.

Results

Among the 7942 patients in the balanced-crystalloids group, 1139 (14.3%) had a major adverse kidney event, as compared with 1211 of 7860 patients (15.4%) in the saline group (marginal odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 0.99; conditional odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; P = 0.04). In-hospital mortality at 30 days was 10.3% in the balanced-crystalloids group and 11.1% in the saline group (P = 0.06). The incidence of new renal-replacement therapy was 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively (P = 0.08), and the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively (P = 0.60).

Conclusions

Among critically ill adults, the use of balanced crystalloids for intravenous fluid administration resulted in a lower rate of the composite outcome of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction than the use of saline.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^213a9d74]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Crystalloids are the most frequently prescribed drugs in intensive care medicine and emergency medicine. Thus, even small differences in outcome may have major implications, and therefore, the choice between balanced crystalloids versus normal saline continues to be debated. We examined to what extent the currently accrued information size from completed and ongoing trials on the subject allow intensivists and emergency physicians to choose the right fluid for their patients.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis with random effects inverse variance model. Published randomized controlled trials enrolling adult patients to compare balanced crystalloids versus normal saline in the setting of intensive care medicine or emergency medicine were included. The main outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up, and secondary outcomes were moderate to severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Trial sequential analyses (TSA) were performed, and risk of bias and overall quality of evidence were assessed. Additionally, previously published meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses and ongoing large trials were analysed for included studies, required information size calculations and the assumptions underlying those calculations.

Results

Nine studies (n = 32,777) were included. Of those, eight had data available on mortality, seven on AKI and six on RRT. Meta-analysis showed no significant differences between balanced crystalloids versus normal saline for mortality (P = 0.33), the incidence of moderate to severe AKI (P = 0.37) or initiation of RRT (P = 0.29). Quality of evidence was low to very low. Analysis of previous meta-analyses and ongoing trials showed large differences in calculated required versus accrued information sizes and assumptions underlying those. TSA revealed the need for extremely large trials based on our realistic and clinically relevant assumptions on relative risk reduction and baseline mortality.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis could not find significant differences between balanced crystalloids and normal saline on mortality at the longest follow-up, moderate to severe AKI or new RRT. Currently accrued information size is smaller, and the required information size is larger than previously anticipated. Therefore, completed and ongoing trials on the topic may fail to provide adequate guidance for choosing the right crystalloid. Thus, physiology will continue to play an important role for individualizing this choice.

### Balanced crystalloids or 0.9% saline in sepsis. beyond reasonable doubt? [^8fac8d67]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary finding of the current analysis was that 217 patients (26.3%) in the balanced crystalloids group died in-hospital within 30 days compared with 255 patients (31.2%) in the saline group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.59–0.93; P = 0.01). Based on the observed point estimate of treatment effect, this corresponds to a number needed to treat with balanced crystalloids instead of saline to prevent one death of just over 20.

Although the investigators' findings were robust in a number of sensitivity analyses, as they themselves have highlighted, caution is required in interpreting these findings. One methodological issue of potential concern is that the comparison between treatment groups undertaken was not truly randomized because patients were categorized as having sepsis based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision codes. These codes were determined after randomization had already occurred. Although it seems unlikely that assignment to balanced crystalloids or 0.9% saline affected such coding, it might have, and in doing so, could have introduced bias. According to the findings of previous research, the mechanism of harm from 0.9% saline was hypothesized to be via hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal injury. However, the mortality effect in the current analysis was not altered by either the baseline chloride or bicarbonate concentrations, and there was no apparent effect of study treatment on serum creatinine. Although these findings led the authors to conclude that the observed mortality effect might be explained by the hemodynamic effects of the fluids used, an alternative explanation is that the findings in relation to day 30 in-hospital mortality represent a false positive. In general, the volumes of fluids that patients received were very small. In both groups, the median volume of study fluid received in the emergency department was 1,000 mL (interquartile range [IQR], 0–2,000 ml). Between ICU admission and Day 30, patients allocated to 0.9% saline received a median of 2,000 mL (IQR, 500–4,830 ml) of 0.9% saline in total, and patients allocated to balanced crystalloids received a median of 1,500 mL (IQR, 0–4,000 ml) in total. Given the small volumes of fluid administered, one can only conclude either that 0.9% saline is extraordinarily toxic to patients with sepsis or that the mortality effect observed is a result of the play of chance. In favor of the latter explanation, it is notable that the 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratio for in-hospital mortality at Day 60 cross one (i.e. encompass no effect). Moreover, as there was no statistically significant heterogeneity of treatment effect for patients with and without sepsis either in the original SMART study or in the current analysis of medical ICU patients, the available data do not support the conclusion that patients with sepsis respond differently to other patients when given 0.9% saline as compared with balanced crystalloids.

### Determinants of fluid use and the association between volume of fluid used and effect of balanced solutions on mortality in critically ill patients: a secondary analysis of the BaSICS trial [^1551daa7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Fluid use could modulate the effect of balanced solutions (BS) on outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is uncertain whether fluid use practices are driven more by patient features or local practices. It is also unclear whether a "dose-response" for the potential benefits of balanced solutions exists.

Methods

The secondary analysis of the Balanced Solution in Intensive Care Study (BaSICS) compared 0.9% saline versus Plasma-Lyte 148 ® (BS) for fluid therapy in the ICU. The relative contribution of patient features and enrolling site (the random effect) on the volume of fluid used up to day 3 after admission was assessed using different methods, including a Bayesian regression, a frequentist mixed model, and a random forest, all adjusted for relevant patient confounders. Subsequently, a variety of methods were used to assess whether volume of fluid used modulated the effect of BS on 90-day mortality, including a traditional subgroup analysis for patients that remained alive and in the ICU up to 3 days, a Bayesian network accounting for competing risks, and an analysis based on site practices.

Results

10,505 patients were analyzed. Median fluid use in the BS arm and in the 0.9% saline arm were 2500 mL and 2488 mL, respectively. The random effect in the Bayesian regression explained 0.32 (95% credible intervals (CrI) 0.24–0.41) of all model variance (0.33, 95% credible intervals from 0.32–0.35). Frequentist and random forest models produced similar results. In the analysis including only patients alive and in the ICU at 3 days, there was a strong suggestion of interaction between fluid use and the effect of BS, driven mostly by a lower mortality with BS compared to 0.9% saline as fluid use increased for patients with sepsis. These results were consistent in the Bayesian network analysis and in an analysis based on site practices, where septic patients enrolled to BS at high fluid use sites had a lower mortality (absolute risk reduction of - 0.13 [95% credible interval - 0.27 to - 0.01]; 0.98 probability of benefit).

Conclusion

Baseline patient characteristics collected in the BaSICS trial explain less of the variance of fluid use during the first 3 days than the enrolling site. Volume of fluid used and the effects of BS appear to interact, mostly in the sepsis subgroup where there was a strong association between fluid use after enrollment and the effect of BS on 90-day mortality.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^498809d9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Restrictive versus liberal strategy — mortality effects and guideline status are summarized as follows: At 90 days after randomization, mortality rate in the liberal group was lower (59% vs 70%) than in the restrictive group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53–0.97), yet the update of the meta-analysis showed no difference in 28-day mortality (OR, 0.99 95% CI, 0.67–1.46, moderate quality). The overall balance of effects is uncertain and does not favor either the intervention or comparator, and the 2016 strong recommendation favoring a restrictive strategy is unchanged; however, the overall quality of evidence changed from strong to moderate.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3508f3d4]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study has several strengths. First, we took a rigorous approach to all aspects of the analyses, including adjustment for the design factor. We took a conservative approach to estimating the intracluster correlation coefficient as can be concluded from our sensitivity analysis in which different imputations for ICC were used to show its impact on the accrued information size (AIS) and required information size (RIS) (see also Additional file 1: Table S7). Second, we studied both the setting of intensive care medicine and emergency medicine. This is important, as it is obviously challenging to know which patients have elevated creatinine levels on presentation or to predict which patients will progress from mildly ill to being septic and which patients will eventually be needing large amounts of fluids. Surely, intensivists and emergency physicians are unlikely to be willing to conclude that they may not have chosen the most appropriate fluids for their patients in hindsight. Therefore, it may be useful to align standard fluid therapy between the two departments. However, unlike Kawano et al. who pooled studies from the setting of perioperative care and intensive care medicine, we chose to analyse patients treated in the setting of emergency medicine separately from those treated in the setting of intensive care medicine.

We recognize that our study has various limitations. First, the quality of evidence, or absence thereof, was downgraded to very low for mortality and to low for moderate to severe AKI and RRT. This was due to inconsistency, indirectness and publication bias. Moreover, the definition of our main outcome used in the meta-analysis (i.e. mortality ar longest follow up) differed from that registered at PROSPERO (i.e. in-hospital mortality and/or mortality at day 30). A sensitivity analysis using the main outcome registered in PROSPERO was performed, which did not alter the results (see also Additional file 9: Figure S8). We did not include perioperative studies as patients would typically not continue with the assigned fluids upon arrival on the intensive care unit. Also, adding these studies would only minimally increase information size and would risk inclusion of patients that are not acutely or critically ill, as was the case for three earlier meta-analyses. Finally, by definition, meta-analysis suffers from heterogeneity between included studies in terms of patient characteristics and volume administered. The latter may be particularly confounding as possible dosing effects may be masked. Finally, it may be argued that surrogate end points may be preferable to mortality as primary focus. However, all renal outcomes also failed to show a significant difference.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in sepsis. A secondary analysis of the SMART clinical trial [^1ba0ea3d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Administration of intravenous crystalloid solutions is a fundamental therapy for sepsis, but the effect of crystalloid composition on patient outcomes remains unknown. Objectives: To compare the effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on 30-day in-hospital mortality among critically ill adults with sepsis. Methods: Secondary analysis of patients from SMART (Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial) admitted to the medical ICU with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, Clinical Modification System code for sepsis, using multivariable regression to control for potential confounders. Measurements and Main Results: Of 15,802 patients enrolled in SMART, 1,641 patients were admitted to the medical ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis. A total of 217 patients (26.3%) in the balanced crystalloids group experienced 30-day in-hospital morality compared with 255 patients (31.2%) in the saline group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–0.93; P = 0.01). Patients in the balanced group experienced a lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days (35.4% vs. 40.1%; aOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63–0.97) and a greater number of vasopressor-free days (20 ± 12 vs. 19 ± 13; aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02–1.54) and renal replacement therapy-free days (20 ± 12 vs. 19 ± 13; aOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.08–1.69) compared with the saline group. Conclusions: Among patients with sepsis in a large randomized trial, use of balanced crystalloids was associated with a lower 30-day in-hospital mortality compared with use of saline. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02444988).

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^eee57a82]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The optimal resuscitative fluid remains controversial. Objective: To assess the association between crystalloid fluid and outcomes in critically ill adults. Methods: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials were searched from inception through July 2019. Cohort studies and randomized trials of critically ill adults provided predominantly nonperioperative fluid resuscitation with balanced crystalloids or 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) were included. Results: Thirteen studies (n = 30 950) were included. Balanced crystalloids demonstrated lower hospital or 28-/30-day mortality (risk ratio [RR] = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.75–0.99; I² = 82%) overall, in observational studies (RR = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.41–0.99; I² = 63%), and approached significance in randomized trials (RR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.88–1.02; I² = 0%). New acute kidney injury occurred less frequently with balanced crystalloids (RR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85–0.98; I² = 0%), though progression to renal replacement therapy was similar (RR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.79–1.04; I² = 38%). In the sepsis cohort, odds of hospital or 28-/30-day mortality were similar, but the odds of major adverse kidney events occurring in the first 30 days were less with balanced crystalloids than saline (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.66–0.91; I² = 42%). Conclusion and Relevance: Resuscitation with balanced crystalloids demonstrated lower hospital or 28-/30-day mortality compared with saline in critically ill adults but not specifically those with sepsis. Balanced crystalloids should be provided preferentially to saline in most critically ill adult patients.

### Order substitutions and education for balanced crystalloid solution use in an integrated health care system and association with major adverse kidney events [^57b195ac]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Intervention timing in our study, as with previous trials, appeared to be critical for patient level benefit. Our study, the Saline Against Lactated Ringer or Plasma-Lyte in the Emergency Department (SALT-ED) study, and SMART trial initiated preferred prescription of balanced crystalloid on hospital arrival. By contrast, SPLIT and BaSICS enrolled patients only after ICU admission and similar to our study, did not find a significant outcome difference in intravenous fluids in this population. As a result of the delayed initiation, patients often received substantial off-protocol intravenous fluids before enrollment; half of the participants in BaSICS, eg, received greater than 1 L of intravenous fluid prerandomization. Taken together with the negative finding from these "late" intervention trials as well as a secondary analysis of the SMART trial that found the beneficial effect of balanced crystalloid depended on its initiation in the ED, our results suggest that early intervention may be necessary to minimize normal saline exposure and maximize clinical benefits from the preferred prescription of balanced crystalloids. The fact that patients who received balanced crystalloid in the positive trials predominantly received LR solution whereas patients in the negative trials received Plasma-Lyte 148 raises the possibility that beneficial outcomes may be associated with the specific balanced crystalloid fluid administered.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^4656e7f5]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Is lactated Ringer's solution, as compared with 0.9% saline, for initial fluid resuscitation associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension?

Findings: In the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial population, death before discharge home by day 90 occurred in 12% of participants in the lactated Ringer's group and in 16% of participants in the 0.9% saline group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51–0.99).

Meaning: In line with the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, our results suggest that initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with 0.9% saline, might be associated with improved outcome in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.

Fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone treatment in the management of sepsis. The controversy of early resuscitation fluid choice and its effect on outcome remains a debated question. The use of 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) has been common practice and is highly prevalent in the ICU. However, recent data suggests potential harm, such as hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, renal vasoconstriction, and acute kidney injury, associated with its use. Previously, balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's solution) or 0.9% saline were equally recommended, but this changed with the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines favoring balanced crystalloids for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis. Evidence for this recommendation was based on studies investigating extended treatment periods exceeding the initial fluid resuscitation. The value of using balanced crystalloids specifically for initial fluid resuscitation has not been adequately studied. Hence, in contrast to previous literature, the present study investigated the fluid choice for the initial 1–3 L of fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension, irrespective of the subsequent fluid type used.

The Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial randomized participants with sepsis-induced hypotension to an early restrictive treatment strategy or liberal fluid treatment strategy and was unable to detect a significant difference in mortality. We used the CLOVERS trial data to investigate whether initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution is associated with improved survival as compared with 0.9% saline.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults [^8ea55b95]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study SMART-MED and SMART-SURG was published by Semler MW and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock, Traumatic brain injury and Critical illness. In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the trial question was: what is the effect of balanced crystalloids for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adult patients? In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the population was: 15802 patients (6705 female, 9097 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients requiring intravenous fluid administration. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years old. In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the interventions were: n = 7942 balanced crystalloids (either lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) n = 7860 normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride). In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of major adverse kidney event within 30 days (14.3% vs. 15.4%; aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99). In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in in-hospital death at 30 days (10.3% vs. 11.1%;) No significant difference in new RRT (2.5% vs. 2.9%; aOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02) No significant difference in persistent renal dysfunction (6.4% vs. 6.6%; aOR 0.96, 96% CI 0.84 to 1.1). In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in change in creatinine levels, death in the hospital before 60 days. In the SMART-MED and SMART-SURG study, the conclusion was: in critically ill adult patients requiring intravenous fluid administration, balanced crystalloids were superior to normal saline with respect to the rate of major adverse kidney event within 30 days.

### Balanced crystalloid versus saline for resuscitation in pediatric septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^54da5d9c]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The SMART trial, which randomized 15,802 critically ill adult patients, founded that the use of balanced crystalloids was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.93; P = 0.01) and no difference between groups in the occurrence of AKI and need for RRT. Another trial comparing balanced crystalloid with saline in 13,347 not critically ill adults did not determine a conclusive superiority of balanced crystalloid over normal saline therapy.

The SPLIT trial conducted across four ICUs with 2,278 patients, and the PLUS Trial, comprising 5,037 adults revealed no significant differences in AKI and mortality outcomes between critically ill patients who received BS or NS.

The 2020 Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock in children provide a weak recommendation (very low quality of evidence) for using balanced/buffered crystalloids, rather than 0.9% saline, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. This recommendation was based on two large observational studies in children with sepsis and by indirect evidence from adult RCTs trials.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in noncritically ill adults [^6cb9abb4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Comparative clinical effects of balanced crystalloids and saline are uncertain, particularly in noncritically ill patients cared for outside an intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

We conducted a single-center, pragmatic, multiple-crossover trial comparing balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) with saline among adults who were treated with intravenous crystalloids in the emergency department and were subsequently hospitalized outside an ICU. The type of crystalloid that was administered in the emergency department was assigned to each patient on the basis of calendar month, with the entire emergency department crossing over between balanced crystalloids and saline monthly during the 16-month trial. The primary outcome was hospital-free days (days alive after discharge before day 28). Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events within 30 days - a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥ 200% of baseline) - all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first.

Results

A total of 13,347 patients were enrolled, with a median crystalloid volume administered in the emergency department of 1079 mL and 88.3% of the patients exclusively receiving the assigned crystalloid. The number of hospital-free days did not differ between the balanced-crystalloids and saline groups (median, 25 days in each group; adjusted odds ratio with balanced crystalloids, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 1.04; P = 0.41). Balanced crystalloids resulted in a lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days than saline (4.7% vs. 5.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Among noncritically ill adults treated with intravenous fluids in the emergency department, there was no difference in hospital-free days between treatment with balanced crystalloids and treatment with saline.

### Why physiology will continue to guide the choice between balanced crystalloids and normal saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f0ce3b06]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Quality of evidence

The quality of evidence generated by the meta-analysis as classified according to the GRADE system was very low for mortality and low for moderate to severe AKI and the need for new RRT. See Additional file 1: Table S5 for details. Indirectness was the main reason for downgrading the quality of evidence; in most studies, the cumulative volume of study fluid was low (1–3 l). Studies may be representative for relatively low-risk patients; therefore, high-risk patients who need a moderate to high cumulative volume of fluid were not adequately and directly represented in the majority of studies.

For mortality, another important reason for downgrading evidence quality was the variation in the duration of follow-up. Finally, we downgraded evidence quality for moderate to severe AKI for inconsistency as two studies provided unclear definitions for AKI in their studies. Sensitivity analyses, in which data of the aforementioned studies was excluded, were performed for the development of moderate to severe AKI in the setting of intensive care medicine and emergency medicine. These sensitivity analyses did not alter the results (P values of 0.43 and 0.76, respectively) and may be found in Additional file 6: Figure S5. There was no disagreement between authors on the quality of evidence.

Question 2: What Is the Optimal Fluid for Sepsis Resuscitation?

What is known.

The current SSC guidelines recommend crystalloids as the fluid of choice for initial resuscitation and subsequent intravascular volume replacement in patients with sepsis and septic shock (Table 1). The guidelines also recommend using either buffered solutions or saline for resuscitation, based upon an absence of published data demonstrating a difference in survival. However, since the publication of the SSC guidelines, the SMART trial reported a decreased occurrence in the composite endpoint of major adverse kidney events, mortality, need for new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction in critically ill patients who received buffered solutions (lactated Ringers or acetated/gluconated buffered solution) compared with saline through 30 days or hospital discharge. The effect in this landmark trial was modest, preventing new renal replacement therapy initiation, persistent renal dysfunction, or death in one of every 94 ICU patients. Although the trial enrolled nearly 16,000 patients, the ICUs and hospital allocation were limited. Importantly, the biggest difference in the composite outcome was noted in septic patients and in those receiving larger amounts of volume resuscitation, suggesting the benefits may be greater in these patient populations. Additionally, a subset analysis of the SMART trial looking only at septic patients suggests a mortality benefit in patients treated with balanced crystalloid solutions. However, the generalizability of this trial is unclear since it was a single-center, unblinded trial. The SPLIT trial enrolled 2,278 patients in a cluster randomized controlled trial of four ICUs in New Zealand comparing saline or acetated/gluconated buffered solution. This trial found no difference in the 90-day rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) between treatment groups (point estimate, 0.4%; relative risk [RR], 1.04; p = 0.77), although the study included a majority of elective postoperative patients with a lower risk of AKI compared with medically ill patients.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in the intensive care unit. the SALT randomized trial [^e1340aab]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

Saline is the intravenous fluid most commonly administered to critically ill adults, but it may be associated with acute kidney injury and death. Whether use of balanced crystalloids rather than saline affects patient outcomes remains unknown.

Objectives

To pilot a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial using software tools within the electronic health record to compare saline to balanced crystalloids.

Methods

This was a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial among 974 adults admitted to a tertiary medical intensive care unit from February 3, 2015 to May 31, 2015. The intravenous crystalloid used in the unit alternated monthly between saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A). Enrollment, fluid delivery, and data collection were performed using software tools within the electronic health record. The primary outcome was the difference between study groups in the proportion of isotonic crystalloid administered that was saline. The secondary outcome was major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30), a composite of death, dialysis, or persistent renal dysfunction.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients assigned to saline (n = 454) and balanced crystalloids (n = 520) were similar at baseline and received similar volumes of crystalloid by 30 days (median [interquartile range]: 1,424 mL [500–3,377] vs. 1,617 mL [500–3,628]; P = 0.40). Saline made up a larger proportion of the isotonic crystalloid given in the saline group than in the balanced crystalloid group (91% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). MAKE30 did not differ between groups (24.7% vs. 24.6%; P = 0.98).

Conclusions

An electronic health record-embedded, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial comparing saline with balanced crystalloids can produce well-balanced study groups and separation in crystalloid receipt. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 02345486).

Circulation: the optimal resuscitation fluid

Fluid therapy is integral in achieving volume expansion and reaching the SBP targets mentioned previously. However, this must be balanced with maintaining a neutral fluid balance and avoiding hyponatremia and worsening cerebral edema. There has been an ongoing debate over the optimal crystalloid due to insufficient evidence concerning different aspects: how much volume should be given, does using a bolus versus infusion affect mortality rates, and whether the solution used should be hypertonic or isotonic. The initiative to compare crystalloid with colloid resuscitation for TBI has lost momentum since the publication of the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) trial in 2007. The trial showed that albumin resuscitation caused a twofold increase in mortality compared with saline resuscitation. However, the comparison of crystalloids is still a subject of ongoing research.

Rowell et al compared the use of normal saline and lactated Ringer's (LR) administration in prehospitalized patients and found a higher 30-day mortality rate with LR (HR 1.78; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.04) despite no difference in admission biochemical or physiological parameters, 6-hour RBC, or crystalloid requirement in either group. A possible explanation could be that balanced salt solutions closely resemble human plasma and thus have a lower sodium and chloride content than 0.9% saline with the addition of a buffer such as acetate or lactate. These fluids (eg, Ringer's lactate, Hartmann's solution) have minimal effects on pH but are relatively hypotonic which can exacerbate edema particularly cerebral edema in the injured brain.

The potential utility of hypertonic crystalloids in TBI is twofold; they are potent vascular compartment expanders, and they can reduce cerebral edema. A recent RCT compared the effect of continuous hypertonic saline (20%) for 48 hours with standard hospital care on 359 patients. The study showed that there was no significant difference in neurological outcome (GOS-E) at 6 months (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.47). There was no significant difference in the secondary outcomes of 6-month mortality (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.28) or development of intracranial hypertension (IHT) (absolute difference −2.6%; 95% CI −12.3% to 7.2%). These findings are in line with a recent meta-analysis of six RCTs comparing prehospital hypertonic fluids with isotonic fluids in terms of survival.

Practical Examples Using the ART, STAMINA, and BaSICS Trials

Background on the Trials

ART (the Alveolar Recruitment Trial) and the STAMINA (Strategy for Community Acquired Pneumonia) trial were designed to evaluate whether optimizing positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) could improve outcomes for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ART employed a recruitment maneuver followed by a PEEP titration strategy, whereas STAMINA used a PEEP titration method based on respiratory system compliance, but with less aggressive recruitment and a greater emphasis on maintaining low driving pressures. Both trials adopted the ARDSNet low PEEP/F O 2 table in the control group. Whereas ART included patients with ARDS of any cause, STAMINA specifically focused on patients with community-acquired pneumonia. ART enrolled 1,010 patients with the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality. Results indicated a higher mortality rate (55.3% vs. 49.3%; P = 0.041) and fewer ventilator-free days (VFDs; 5.3 vs. 6.4 d; P = 0.03) in the intervention group. STAMINA aimed to enroll 500 patients to evaluate VFD at 28 days as the primary endpoint but was halted after 214 patients as a result of site fatigue and funding issues. The mean VFD was 6 days in the intervention group compared with 7 days in the control group (P = 0.28). Both trials suggested potential harm from the intervention. BaSICS (the Balanced Solutions in Intensive Care Study) was a large (N = 10,520) pragmatic clinical trial comparing balanced solutions versus 0.9% saline solution for unselected critically ill patients, with 90-day mortality as the primary endpoint (26.4% in the balanced solution arm vs. 27.2% in the saline arm; P = 0.47).

### The precision resuscitation with crystalloids in sepsis (PRECISE) trial: a trial protocol [^e3ffb9a6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The ultimate impact of the PRECISE trial is use of the most commonly available data (vital signs) to guide the most commonly administered therapy (intravenous fluids) in one of the most common causes of preventable mortality (sepsis) responsible for 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Using routine vital signs available even in low-resource settings, we aim to prospectively identify a sepsis subgroup with a significant mortality reduction from use of balanced crystalloids compared with normal saline. Precision resuscitation in sepsis could fundamentally redefine international standards for intravenous fluid resuscitation. Given the more than 48 million annual cases of sepsis worldwide, the precision resuscitation approach could dramatically reduce mortality from sepsis.

The primary research question is whether an EHR alert that recommends use of balanced crystalloids to a sepsis subphenotype (previously shown to have mortality benefit from balanced crystalloids) will result in a lower 30-day mortality rate. Given the complexity of the study question and design, there will be numerous generalizable contributions from this trial. First, the trial will provide generalizable knowledge on fluid management in the group D subphenotype. If the significant mortality benefit from balanced crystalloids in group D is validated, the PRECISE trial could inform international guidelines, such as the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines, and could change the standard of care for fluid resuscitation in sepsis. Second, the trial may demonstrate the feasibility and limitations of real-time subphenotyping for precision medicine trials in sepsis. While there has been over a decade of research on sepsis subphenotypes, this will be one of the first clinical trials to use subphenotypes for precision enrollment. Third, the trial will allow us to understand the human factors in implementation of EHR-based interventions. We are aiming to decrease normal saline use in the intervention arm through the EHR alert design and a concerted education campaign. The resulting rate of normal saline use will be important in understanding the potential ceiling to behavioral changes through EHR alerts.

Clinical studies

Mortality in critically ill patients

The clinical relevance of the theoretical advantages of colloids (with regards to effects on the microvasculature) was questioned as early as the late 1970s. Clinicians would have to wait almost 30 years, until the completion of the landmark Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) trial, to begin to draw definitive conclusions. The SAFE trial compared the effects of 4% albumin versus normal saline in 6,997 critically ill patients and found no difference in the primary outcome (all-cause mortality at 28 days). Subgroup analysis revealed a possible association between the use of albumin and increased mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. It should be noted that this post hoc analysis was performed on only 492 patients or 7% of the original study population. In a follow-up report of 460 traumatic brain injury patients from the original SAFE trial, the association of albumin with higher mortality rates in this group persisted at 2 years following randomization.

The quality and power of previous trials on the safety of low molecular weight starches was questioned in a meta-analysis of 36 clinical studies (11 of which had previously been retracted). The more recent Scandinavian 6S trial compared low molecular HES (130/0.42) in a Ringer's acetate dispersion medium with Ringer's acetate without starch in the resuscitation of 804 septic ICU patients. This multicenter, randomized, and blinded clinical trial reported that use of up to 33 ml/kg of 6% HES (130/0.42) had a significantly higher risk of reaching the primary outcome, defined as death or need for renal replacement therapy at 90 days following randomization, in 51% of enrolled patients compared with 43% of enrolled patients receiving Ringer's acetate. As only one patient in each group was receiving renal replacement therapy at 90 days, HES 130/42 increased the absolute risk of death at 90 days by 8 percentage points. Rates of severe bleeding were numerically higher in the HES group compared with crystalloid (10% vs. 6%), although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09).

### Continuous infusion of hypertonic saline vs standard care and 6-month outcomes in TBI… [^9ca07021]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The estimate adjusted probability of death at 6 months is a hazard ratio of 0.
79. The median observation time was 180 days in both treatment groups. Graphical assessment indicates that the proportionality assumption was met. Within 24 hours after trauma, a 1-hour bolus infusion was injected immediately after randomization. Continuous infusion of 20% hypertonic saline solution was administered and adapted to patients' serum sodium levels to limit the risk of severe hypernatremia. The blood level of sodium was monitored every 8 hours for dose adaptation. The intervention was continued for a minimum of 48 hours and as long as a patient was considered at risk of intracranial hypertension.

The 20% NaCl infusion was stopped when all specific therapies against intracranial hypertension were suspended for 12 hours or more. In previous studies, continuous infusion of hypertonic saline solutions induced a relative reduction of mortality of 20%13 and of intracranial hypertension of 30%, 12 and we thus hypothesized that it would induce a similar relative reduction of 20% in the rate of poor neurological outcome. The intervention was significantly associated with higher blood osmolarity and sodium concentration. The intervention was also significantly associated with a reduction of the risk of intracranial hypertension, but there was a significant interaction between the treatment effect and time, suggesting a rebound of intracranial hypertension risk after intervention discontinuation.

There was no significant difference in 6-month mortality.

### Liberal or restricted fluid administration: are we ready for a proposal of a restricted intraoperative approach? [^1c952685]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Type of fluids and patients population

Normal saline solution (the most used crystalloid) has been used for over 50 years as an intraoperative, resuscitation and maintenance fluid; however its excessive use can lead to hyperchloremic acidosis and type I disorder. There is currently a debate regarding the morbidity associated with this condition, although its incidence is considered to be very low. The British Consensus Guidelines on Intravenous Fluid Therapy for Adult Surgical Patients recommend the use of balanced crystalloids rather then just saline solution to avoid hypercloremic acidosis.

The dispute in literature about fluids, as reported in the 6S, CRYSTMAS and CHEST studies, clearly highlights the problem of the use of the right fluid in the right setting (intensive care) and for the right patient (septic patient and hemodynamic unstable intensive care unit (ICU) patients). These three large randomized clinical trials evaluated outcome and adverse effects of fluid resuscitation in septic patients comparing hydroxyethyl starches (HES) versus normal saline or Ringer acetate's solution: the result is that no difference in mortality has been observed between the different types of fluids (except in 6S study). In terms of kidney injury, CHEST and 6S trials revealed that in HES group there is a greater risk of developing renal dysfunction; 6S trial is the only one study that evaluate HES 130/0.42 (tetraspan); but the CRYSTMAS trial did not reveal any difference in terms of adverse events in both fluid groups. The CRISTAL study has found instead that the use of colloids, compared to crystalloids, has resulted in a reduction of mortality at 90 days (not at 28 days).

### Intraoperative use of balanced crystalloids versus 0.9% saline: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled studies [^6618d71e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The evidence regarding optimal crystalloid use in the perioperative period remains unclear. As the primary aim of this study, we sought to summarise the data from RCTs examining whether use of balanced crystalloids compared with 0.9% saline (saline) leads to differences in patient-important outcomes.

Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane library, and Clinicaltrials.gov, from inception until December 15, 2022, and included RCTs that intraoperatively randomised adult participants to receive either balanced fluids or saline. We pooled data using a random-effects model and present risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs), along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed individual study risk of bias using the modified Cochrane tool, and certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Results

Of 5959 citations, we included 38 RCTs (n = 3776 patients). Pooled analysis showed that intraoperative use of balanced fluids compared with saline had an uncertain effect on postoperative mortality analysed at the longest point of follow-up (RR 1.51, 95% CI: 0.42–5.36) and postoperative need for renal replacement therapy (RR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.56–1.59), both very low certainty. Furthermore, use of balanced crystalloids probably leads to a higher postoperative serum pH (MD 0.05, 95% CI: 0.04–0.06), moderate certainty.

Conclusions

Use of balanced crystalloids, compared with saline, in the perioperative setting has an uncertain effect on mortality and need for renal replacement therapy but probably improves postoperative acid-base status. Further research is needed to determine whether balanced crystalloid use affects patient-important outcomes.

### Saline versus balanced crystalloids for adults with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a subgroup analysis of the SMART trial [^d0c24115]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether the composition of intravenous crystalloid solutions affects outcomes in adults with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains unknown. Therefore, we determined whether the use of saline is associated with lower risk of disability and death in aSAH patients compared to balanced crystalloids.

Methods

We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART), a pragmatic, unblinded, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover clinical trial that enrolled 15,802 adults between June 2015 and April 2017. We compared intravenous administration of saline to balanced crystalloids in consecutively enrolled aSAH patients aged 18 years or older whose ruptured aneurysm was procedurally secured at a single academic center in the United States. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale (mRS, range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days obtained from a prospective institutional stroke registry. Secondary outcome included death by 90 days. Logistic or proportional odds regression models were used to test for between-group differences adjusted for age, hypertension, aSAH grade, and procedure type.

Results

Of the 79 aSAH patients procedurally treated during the SMART study period, 78 were enrolled (median age, 58 years; IQR, 49 to 64.5; 64% female), with 41 (53%) assigned to saline and 37 (47%) to balanced crystalloids. Plasma-Lyte was the primary balanced crystalloid used. Among 72 patients with 90-day mRS assessment, the adjusted common odds ratio, aOR, for mRS was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.28–1.63; P = 0.39), with values less than 1.0 favoring saline. By 90 days, 2/39 patients (5%) in the saline group and 9/35 (26%) in the balanced-crystalloids group had died (aOR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.00–0.50; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Among procedurally treated aSAH patients, the risk of disability or death at 90 days did not significantly differ between saline and balanced crystalloids. Death occurred less frequently with saline than balanced crystalloids.

### The precision resuscitation with crystalloids in sepsis (PRECISE) trial: a trial protocol [^2e9103cd]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous fluids are the most common treatment given to hospitalized patients and are an essential part of resuscitation in patients with sepsis. Despite the ubiquity of intravenous fluids in sepsis, it remains unknown whether it is better to give balanced crystalloids or normal saline, the 2 major classes of crystalloid fluids. More than a dozen randomized clinical trials have enrolled in total more than 35 000 critically ill patients to compare balanced crystalloids vs normal saline, without finding a consistent mortality benefit from one fluid type vs the other. The one-size-fits-all approach has not worked in fluid resuscitation. Taking a precision medicine approach, a machine learning algorithm that uses bedside vital signs to identify a sepsis subgroup (group D) with a 15% absolute reduction in mortality with balanced crystalloids compared with normal saline has been reported. Compared with patients in the other subgroups, patients with group D sepsis have relatively lower body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, and are hypotensive. In the US, more than 1.5 million patients develop sepsis every year, and almost all patients with sepsis receive fluids. With such a large patient population, even a small reduction in mortality would have a large public health impact.

The Precision Resuscitation With Crystalloids in Sepsis (PRECISE) trial is a parallel-group, multihospital, single-blind, pragmatic randomized clinical trial in which we apply our machine learning algorithm to identify patients with group D sepsis and randomize them to usual care or intervention, with the intervention being an electronic health record (EHR) alert that nudges clinicians to use balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline. We hypothesize that the alert will reduce 30-day inpatient mortality in the intervention cohort through increased use of balanced crystalloids for patients with group D sepsis.

### Saline versus balanced solutions: are clinical trials comparing two crystalloid solutions really needed? [^451afdc5]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

How do we prescribe fluids?

The choice of intravenous fluid should be based on consideration of certain baseline factors, but also on elements that arise during therapy. For example, at baseline, administration of saline may be indicated in the presence of hypochloremia whereas a hypotonic fluid may be warranted in the presence of hypernatremia. Importantly, the situation may evolve with time as the fluid administered may induce metabolic changes leading to a different "best" fluid choice. Giving several liters of 0.9% saline will result in hyperchloremia, so continuing this fluid strategy is not rational.

Balanced chloride-restricted crystalloid solutions should be used for maintenance infusions and fluid boluses in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. There is no benefit to the routine use of colloid solutions for fluid boluses. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B

Results from studies conducted in healthy volunteers and from meta-analyses of small RCTs indicate that balanced chloride-restricted crystalloid solutions should be preferred to normal saline to decrease the risk of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Large propensity-matched observational studies have reported an association between the use of normal saline and an increased incidence of renal dysfunction, postoperative morbidity, and mortality in surgical patients. A large cluster randomized trial of 15,000 critically ill adults showed similar results, with lower rates of death and renal dysfunction attributed to the use of balanced crystalloids. Based on the evidence from this trial, the current recommendation was upgraded from a 1C in 2017 to a 1B.

There is little evidence that colloids offer any benefit over crystalloids for fluid boluses, either during abdominal surgery or postoperatively in intensive care. Meanwhile, there may be some benefit in individual cases, particularly in the setting of blood loss or when rapid resuscitation is needed. Colloids restore circulating volume faster than crystalloids and with a lower fluid volume (although this difference is less than traditionally taught with a ratio of around 1:1.5). Given that the evidence does not show an outcome benefit with colloids and that colloids are significantly more expensive, their routine use should be discouraged.

The difference between saline solutions and balanced solutions is that saline solutions contain 154 mEq/L of sodium and chloride (to be normotonic) and balanced solutions contain anions other than chloride. Hence, liberal administration of saline solutions results in hyperchloremia, which can have a number of unwanted effects, including altered intrarenal hemodynamics and perhaps coagulopathy and gastrointestinal symptoms. Without needing to review these effects in detail, one can already see that any deviation of any biological variable from the physiologic range of values will be associated with a worse outcome. Why would this be any different for chloride?

Balanced chloride-restricted crystalloid solutions — maintenance infusion recommendation for colorectal surgery states that balanced chloride-restricted crystalloid solutions should be used as maintenance infusion in patients undergoing colorectal surgery, with grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Supporting data indicate these solutions should be preferred to normal saline to decrease the risk of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and large propensity-matched observational studies have observed an association between the use of normal saline and increased renal dysfunction, postoperative morbidity, and mortality in surgical patients.

### Choice of fluid in acute illness: what should be given? An international consensus [^afe605d8]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid management during critical illness is a dynamic process that may be conceptualized as occurring in four phases: rescue, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation (mobilization). The selection and administration of resuscitation fluids is one component of this complex physiological sequence directed at restoring depleted intravascular volume. Presently, the selection of i.v. fluid is usually dictated more by local practice patterns than by evidence. The debate on fluid choice has primarily focused on evaluating outcome differences between 'crystalloids vs colloids'. More recently, however, there is interest in examining outcome differences based on the chloride content of crystalloid solutions. New insights into the conventional Starling model of microvascular fluid exchange may explain that the efficacy of colloids in restoring and maintaining depleted intravascular volume is only moderately better than crystalloids. A number of investigator-initiated, high-quality, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that modest improvements in short-term physiological endpoints with colloids have not translated into better patient-centred outcomes. In addition, there is substantial evidence that certain types of fluids may independently worsen patient-centred outcomes. These include hydroxyethyl starch and albumin solutions in selected patient populations. There is no evidence to support the use of other colloids. The use of balanced salt solutions in preference to 0.9% saline is supported by the absence of harm in large observational studies. However, there is no compelling randomized trial-based evidence demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with the use of balanced salt solutions compared with 0.9% saline at this time.

### Did balanced crystalloids really decrease mortality in patients with sepsis? [^3d3c3cbe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Relationship between mortality and the type of admission according to Table E2 in Zampieri and colleagues. This figure shows the strong relationship between mortality and the type of admission. BS = balanced solution; NS = normale saline.

The authors found that saline administered before enrollment was associated with an increase in mortality in patients with sepsis. However, the number of patients with sepsis is low, particularly for the mix groups. It would be interesting to have more characteristics of these patients, particularly the SOFA score, the volume of administered crystalloids, and the vasopressor use for the eight groups before enrollment and in the ICU.

In Table E2 in Zampieri and colleagues, in the mixed fluid group, the septic unplanned admission group represents 9.5% of the patients and not 20%.

In the ICU, as opposed to a nonblinded randomized controlled study, a double-blind randomized controlled study did not find any advantage to using BC instead of saline, even in patients with sepsis. Jackson and colleagues retrospectively analyzed patients with sepsis in the medical ICU from the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events (SMART) Trial study. They found that BC administered before ICU admission was associated with a decrease in mortality. Two meta-analyses were recently published for patients with sepsis. The first one, which found deleterious effects of saline, has several methodological biases: most of the studies did not compare BC and saline; the studies range between 1983 and 2018 for saline and between 2008 and 2018 for BC; the study with the lower mortality represents 79% of the patients for BC, but only 41% for saline; and in one study, only published as abstract, saline was administered as placebo without a hemodynamic target. For the second meta-analysis, deleterious effects of saline were mainly found in retrospective studies.

The choice of the crystalloid is important in clinical practice, as it could induce some morbidity. However, because of methodological limitations in published studies, the respective role of the type and volume of crystalloids remains to be determined in patients with sepsis.

### Balanced crystalloid versus saline in adults with traumatic brain injury: secondary analysis of a clinical trial [^7095cdf1]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Balanced crystalloids may improve outcomes compared with saline for some critically ill adults. Lower tonicity of balanced crystalloids could worsen cerebral edema in patients with intracranial pathology. The effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires further study. We planned an a priori subgroup analysis of TBI patients enrolled in the pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02444988, NCT02547779). Primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital discharge disposition (home, facility, death). Regression models adjusted for pre-specified baseline covariates compared outcomes. TBI patients assigned to balanced crystalloids (n = 588) and saline (n = 569) had similar baseline characteristics including Injury Severity Score 19 (10); mean maximum head/neck Abbreviated Injury Score, 3.4 (1.0). Isotonic crystalloid volume administered between intensive care unit admission and first of hospital discharge or 30 days was 2037 (3470) mL and 1723 (2923) mL in the balanced crystalloids and saline groups, respectively (p = 0.18). During the study period, 94 (16%) and 82 (14%) patients (16%) died in the balanced crystalloid and saline groups, respectively (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 1.75; p = 0.913). Patients in the balanced crystalloid group were more likely to die or be discharged to another medical facility (aOR 1.38 [1.02–1.86]; p = 0.04). Overall, balanced crystalloids were associated with worse discharge disposition in critically injured patients with TBI compared with saline. The confidence intervals cannot exclude a clinically relevant increase in mortality when balanced crystalloids are used for patients with TBI.

### The precision resuscitation with crystalloids in sepsis (PRECISE) trial: a trial protocol [^17c812fc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Intravenous fluids are an essential part of treatment in sepsis, but there remains clinical equipoise on which type of crystalloid fluids to use in sepsis. A previously reported sepsis subphenotype (ie, group D) has demonstrated a substantial mortality benefit from balanced crystalloids compared with normal saline.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that targeting balanced crystalloids to patients with group D sepsis through an electronic health record (EHR) alert will reduce 30-day inpatient mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Precision Resuscitation With Crystalloids in Sepsis (PRECISE) trial is a parallel-group, multihospital, single-blind, pragmatic randomized clinical trial to be conducted at 6 hospitals in the Emory Healthcare system. Patients with suspicion of group D infection in whom a clinician initiates an order for normal saline in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU) will be randomized to usual care and intervention arms.

Intervention

An EHR alert that appears in the ED and ICUs to nudge clinicians to use balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome is 30-day inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes are ICU admission, in-hospital mortality, receipt of vasoactive drugs, receipt of new kidney replacement therapy, and receipt of mechanical ventilation (vasoactive drugs, kidney replacement therapy, and mechanical ventilation are counted if they occur after randomization and within the 30-day study period). Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted.

Discussion

The PRECISE trial may be one of the first precision medicine trials of crystalloid fluids in sepsis. Using routine vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure), available even in low-resource settings, a validated machine learning algorithm will prospectively identify and enroll patients with group D sepsis who may have a substantial mortality reduction from used of balanced crystalloids compared with normal saline.

Results

On finalizing participant enrollment and analyzing the data, the study's findings will be shared with the public through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Conclusions

With use of a validated machine learning algorithm, precision resuscitation in sepsis could fundamentally redefine international standards for intravenous fluid resuscitation.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — albumin versus crystalloids for initial fluid resuscitation: A Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials with 12,492 patients found no difference between albumin and crystalloids in 30-day mortality (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04), 90-day mortality (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04), or need for RRT (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96–1.27); the ALBIOS trial in 1,818 patients also showed no difference in 28-day mortality (RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.87–1.14) or 90-day mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85–1.05), with albumin administered as a 20% solution targeting serum albumin 30 g/L until ICU discharge or 28 days, and a meta-analysis in septic patients showed no significant mortality difference (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89–1.08) with subgroup results for septic shock (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77–0.99) versus sepsis (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91–1.17) without a subgroup effect (P-interaction = 0.19); collectively, these support a "strong recommendation for the use of crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock", while "The suggestion to consider albumin in patients who received large volumes of crystalloids" is noted, and "Limited data precludes a cutoff value for crystalloid infusion above which albumin might be considered as part of resuscitation".

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^a95c4489]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Clear fluid resuscitation

The ongoing debate as to which group of fluid (synthetic colloid or crystalloid solutions) is best to use in the resuscitation phase of trauma patients remains unanswered with large studies showing little, if any benefit of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 over the traditionally used crystalloids. The CRISTAL trial did identify a potential mortality benefit in a heterogeneous hypovolemic patient cohort resuscitated with a variety of colloid solutions compared to crystalloid solutions. However, several limitations identified by the authors limits applicability: the lack of renal injury and potential 90-day outcome benefit, deserve further research. When reviewing the available literature, in several trials recruitment and consent requirements resulted in the comparison of fluids commencing after the initial resuscitation phase, resulting in interpretation difficulties of outcome benefit in trauma patients. These studies do, however, demonstrate a trend toward less synthetic colloid fluid required to achieve hemodynamic goals compared to crystalloids with a ratio (volume of colloid to crystalloid that results in similar physiological effects) varying between 1:1.1 and 1:1.6 (colloids:crystalloids). This ratio is smaller than previously thought (ATLS teaches a ratio of 1:3), and significance in subgroups of patients is yet to be determined. Concerns still exist about the adverse effects of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 on renal function and coagulopathy although crystalloid fluids are not without complications. Further studies need to be done comparing these crystalloids and colloids in the initial resuscitation phase of trauma patients. A further concern is the chloride load administered in these fluids and the potential contribution toward acidosis and renal injury. The resultant hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may have negative consequences. The meta-analysis by Krajewski et al. showed a significant association between high chloride content fluids and acute kidney injury, blood transfusion volume and mechanical ventilation time. Mortality was unaffected in this population of perioperative patients. Despite this, 0.9% saline remains widely used as a resuscitation fluid and remains the fluid of choice for patients with brain injury, hyponatremia and metabolic alkalosis. Balanced salt solutions (solutions with a physiological pH and isotonic electrolyte concentration), being more physiological in nature, are being used more frequently, showing a trend toward less harm than 0.9% sodium chloride — whether in isolation or as a medium carrying a colloid. Balanced salt solutions closely resemble human plasma and thus have a lower sodium and chloride content than 0.9% saline with the addition of a buffer such as acetate or lactate. These fluids (e.g. Ringer's lactate, Hartmann's solution) have minimal effects on pH but are hypotonic, so can exacerbate edema, particularly cerebral edema in the injured brain. In addition, when using Ringer's lactate solution, consideration should be given to the potential interaction between citrate found in stored blood and bicarbonate, explaining why 0.9% saline is still a commonly used resuscitation fluid in trauma patients, despite the high chloride load. The concerns regarding the inflammatory effects from Ringers lactate infusions, demonstrated in animal models, have not been demonstrated to influence outcomes in human studies. Of greater concern are the negative consequences of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. There are no large randomized control trials demonstrating a mortality benefit for 0.9% saline over balanced solutions. Currently, saline is preferred in brain-injured patients and balanced solutions are preferred in patients who are already acidotic. Although only in an porcine model, resuscitation after severe hemorrhage with 0.9% saline was inferior to ringers lactate due to vasodilatory effect, and risks of metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. In elective neurosurgical patients, lactated ringers also proved better than 0.9% saline in terms of electrolyte management (particularly sodium and chloride) and acid–base balance.

### Effect of a buffered crystalloid solution vs saline on acute kidney injury among patients in the intensive care unit: the SPLIT randomized clinical trial [^66ee2921]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is the most commonly administered intravenous fluid; however, its use may be associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and increased mortality.

Objective

To determine the effect of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline on renal complications in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Design and Setting

Double-blind, cluster randomized, double-crossover trial conducted in 4 ICUs in New Zealand from April 2014 through October 2014. Three ICUs were general medical and surgical ICUs; 1 ICU had a predominance of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical patients.

Participants

All patients admitted to the ICU requiring crystalloid fluid therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients with established AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. All 2278 eligible patients were enrolled; 1152 of 1162 patients (99.1%) receiving buffered crystalloid and 1110 of 1116 patients (99.5%) receiving saline were analyzed.

Interventions

Participating ICUs were assigned a masked study fluid, either saline or a buffered crystalloid, for alternating 7-week treatment blocks. Two ICUs commenced using 1 fluid and the other 2 commenced using the alternative fluid. Two crossovers occurred so that each ICU used each fluid twice over the 28 weeks of the study. The treating clinician determined the rate and frequency of fluid administration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was proportion of patients with AKI (defined as a rise in serum creatinine level of at least 2-fold or a serum creatinine level of ≥ 3.96 mg/dL with an increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL); main secondary outcomes were incidence of RRT use and in-hospital mortality.

Results

In the buffered crystalloid group, 102 of 1067 patients (9.6%) developed AKI within 90 days after enrollment compared with 94 of 1025 patients (9.2%) in the saline group (absolute difference, 0.4% [95% CI, -2.1% to 2.9%]; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.36]; P = 0.77). In the buffered crystalloid group, RRT was used in 38 of 1152 patients (3.3%) compared with 38 of 1110 patients (3.4%) in the saline group (absolute difference, -0.1% [95% CI, -1.6% to 1.4%]; RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.50]; P = 0.91). Overall, 87 of 1152 patients (7.6%) in the buffered crystalloid group and 95 of 1110 patients (8.6%) in the saline group died in the hospital (absolute difference, -1.0% [95% CI, -3.3% to 1.2%]; RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.67 to 1.17]; P = 0.40).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients receiving crystalloid fluid therapy in the ICU, use of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline did not reduce the risk of AKI. Further large randomized clinical trials are needed to assess efficacy in higher-risk populations and to measure clinical outcomes such as mortality.

### Fluid resuscitation in acute medicine: what is the current situation? [^9deca004]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The administration of intravenous fluids for resuscitation is the most common intervention in acute medicine. There is increasing evidence that the type of fluid may directly affect patient-centred outcomes. There is a lack of evidence that colloids confer clinical benefit over crystalloids and they may be associated with harm. Hydroxyethyl starch preparations are associated with increased mortality and use of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis; albumin is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Crystalloids, such as saline or balanced salt solutions, are increasingly recommended as first-line resuscitation fluids for the majority of patients with hypovolaemia. There is emerging evidence that saline may be associated with adverse outcomes due to the development of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, although the safety of balanced salt solutions has not been established. Fluid requirements vary over the course of critical illness. The excessive use of fluids during the resuscitative period is associated with increased cumulative fluid balance and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. The selection of fluid depends on the clinical context in which it is administered and requires careful consideration of the dose and potential for toxicity. There is an urgent need to conduct further high-quality randomized controlled trials of currently available fluid therapy in patients with critical illness.

### Effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in critically ill adults [^686227a7]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Administration of intravenous fluid is common in critical care. Historically, 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) has been the most frequently administered fluid. Balanced crystalloid solutions, such as lactated Ringer's solution and Plasma-Lyte, represent an increasingly used alternative to saline. Recent data from clinical trials suggest that crystalloid composition may affect patient outcomes, including kidney injury, but the mechanistic effects of balanced crystalloids versus saline on the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) remain uncertain.

Pre-clinical studies have found the chloride content of intravenous fluids influences renal vasoconstriction, glomerular filtration rate, biomarkers of AKI, and incidence of AKI by clinical criteria and histology. Randomized trials among healthy human volunteers suggest that intravenous solutions with high chloride content, such as 0.9% saline, may decrease renal artery blood velocity, renal cortical perfusion, and urine output. A small randomized trial among patients undergoing major abdominal surgery found lower concentrations of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), an early biomarker of renal tubular injury, with balanced crystalloids compared to saline. Observational studies have reported lower rates of AKI and renal replacement therapy (RRT) among acutely ill adults treated with balanced crystalloids rather than saline. Two recent clinical trials found balanced crystalloid solutions decreased the composite of death, RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction during acute illness. Although plasma creatinine concentration did not differ between the balanced crystalloids and saline in these trials, serum creatinine is an insensitive marker for tubular injury. Whether the differences in clinical outcomes between balanced crystalloids and saline in these trials were mediated by kidney injury or by other mechanisms remains unknown.

### Serum chloride concentration and outcomes in adults receiving intravenous fluid therapy with a balanced crystalloid solution or 0.9% sodium chloride [^02a12440]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether there is an interaction between baseline serum chloride concentration and pH and treatment effects in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients receiving intravenous fluid therapy with balanced solution versus 0.9% sodium chloride (saline).

Methods

A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial in which patients were divided into cohorts according to quartiles of baseline serum chloride concentration and pH. The primary outcome was day-90 mortality.

Results

From 4846 patients with outcome data available, 4823 with relevant baseline data were included in this analysis, with 1347, 1333, 993 and 1150 patients in the chloride quartiles of < 102, 102–106, 107–109 and > 109 mmol/L, respectively. Data were also analysed in pH quartiles of ≤ 7.27, 7.27–7.34, 7.34–7.39 and > 7.39. The risk-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) for day-90 mortality for patients assigned balanced solution compared to saline was 1.23 (0.95–1.58), 0.95 (0.73–1.25), 0.88 (0.64–1.21), and 0.76 (0.57–1.01) for lowest to highest chloride subgroups, respectively (P value for interaction = 0.10), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.69–1.15), 0.94 (0.70–1.27), 0.96 (0.67–1.38) and 1.15 (0.82–1.60) for pH quartiles from lowest to highest, respectively (P value for interaction = 0.63).

Conclusions

There were no significant differences in the treatment effect of balanced solutions compared to saline according to baseline serum chloride concentration or pH.

### Comment: balanced salt solutions for critically ill patients: nonplused and back to basics [^f5a1b08b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

The analysis of trial results of the intravenous fluids pharmacodynamics revealed problems common to all studies, such as varying study designs, clinical discretion for treatments, and heterogeneous patients. We believe that in the methodology of future research it is also necessary to pay due attention to the actual rather than theoretical physicochemical parameters of the solutions used, such as osmolality, pH, and potential excess of bases. Paying attention to these parameters of intravenous fluids will be useful for assessing their role in producing pharmacodynamic effects in critically ill patients.

### Should we avoid saline in sepsis? It's probably too early to definitively conclude [^949712eb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with great interest the study entitled "Balanced Crystalloids versus Saline in Sepsis: A Secondary Analysis of the SMART Clinical Trial". This study shows an increase in mortality in patients with sepsis receiving saline compared with balanced crystalloids. An increase in major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30) has already been found in a subgroup analysis of patients with sepsis.

However, we have some remarks to make. This study was not planned in the SMART (Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial) study protocol. The primary outcome of this study was death from any cause in patients with sepsis in the medical ICU. Moreover, the clinical trial number cited by the authors (NCT02444988) corresponds to "Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (SMART-MED)", in which the primary outcome measure was MAKE30 in all medical ICU patients, not only in patients with sepsis; 30-day in-hospital mortality was a secondary outcome.

Some patients received nonassigned intravenous fluids before or after enrollment, and the volume of crystalloids administered was higher in the balanced crystalloids group at Days 3 and 7, as previously found in another study. The amount of saline seems to be associated with an increase in MAKE30, particularly in patients with sepsis. In animal studies, chloride-containing solutions led to renal vasoconstriction and a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. In their analysis, did the authors take into account the amount of crystalloids (particularly saline) received before ICU admission in both groups? Did the authors find a relationship between the volume of chloride or saline administered and the incidence of kidney injuries, as suggested in different studies?

Several vasopressors were administered to the patients and converted to norepinephrine equivalents. However, these drugs are not strictly equivalent, particularly with regard to inotropism, heart rate, severe arrhythmias, and perhaps lactate concentration. Did the patients in both groups receive the same vasopressors?

We congratulate the authors for this interesting study, which provides important information about crystalloids in sepsis. These results should be confirmed by a randomized study.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — albumin versus crystalloids for resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock: a Cochrane review found no difference in 30-day (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04) or 90-day mortality (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04) or need for RRT (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96–1.27). A second meta-analysis found lower static filling pressures (MD, -2.3 cm H2O; 95% CI, -3.02–1.05) and mean arterial pressure (MD, -3.53 mmHg; 95% CI, -6.71 to -0.36) with crystalloid use, with no difference in 28-day (RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.92–1.10) or 90 days (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.76–2.29) mortality. The ALBIOS trial did not demonstrate a difference in 28-day (RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.87–1.14) or 90-day mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85–1.05), using 20% albumin targeting a serum albumin concentration of 30 g/L until ICU discharge or 28 days. Across studies in septic patients, mortality was not significantly different (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89–1.08); although septic shock showed a larger treatment effect (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77–0.99) than sepsis (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91–1.17), the subgroup analysis did not detect a subgroup effect (P-interaction = 0.19). Based on lack of proven benefit and higher cost of albumin, the panel issued a strong recommendation for the use of crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock, and the suggestion to consider albumin in patients who received large volumes of crystalloids; limited data precludes a cutoff value for crystalloid infusion above which albumin might be considered as part of resuscitation.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^142409e4]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Severe sepsis — hydroxyethylstarch (HES) and acute kidney injury (AKI) outcomes: The first major randomized trial in patients with sepsis compared HES 200/0.60 to 0.66 with gelatin and showed a greater incidence of AKI in the HES group, but no effect on survival, with criticisms including a shorter follow-up duration of 34 days. In the VISEP study, patients with severe sepsis were randomly assigned to receive a hypertonic (10%) low–molecular weight HES (HES 200/0.5), or an isotonic modified Ringer's lactate solution; patients in the HES group received a median cumulative dose of 70.4 mL per kilogram of body weight. Mortality was not significantly different, although showing a trend toward greater mortality at 90 days, but the hypertonic HES group had a significantly higher rate of AKI (34.9% vs. 22.8%) and more days on which renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required; critiques included exceeding the pharmaceutically recommended daily dose limit for 10% HES 200/0.5 by more than 10% in > 38% of patients and pre-existing renal dysfunction in 10% of study patients (a contra-indication). Dosing differed across studies, with the mean cumulative dose of HES in VISEP 70 ml/kg compared to 31 ml/kg in the study by Schortgen et al. In aggregate, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials in sepsis totaling 1062 patients, including 537 patients from VISEP, showed an almost two-fold increased risk of AKI with HES compared to crystalloids. Observational data are mixed: one large prospective study found HES infusion of any type (median volume 555 ml; administered in a range 500–1000) did not represent an independent risk factor for renal impairment, whereas in a large cohort of critically ill patients (approximately 8000 subjects), infusion of 10% HES 200/0.5 instead of HES 130/0.4 appeared to be an independent risk factor for RRT. A comprehensive Cochrane review concluded there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials that resuscitation with colloids, instead of crystalloids, reduces the risk of death in patients with trauma, burns, or following surgery.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^45900968]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is widely accepted that during the initial phase of haemorrhagic trauma shock, a restrictive volume strategy be supported with crystalloid solutions. The main reason for this is that all colloid solutions can alter haemostasis. However, if the bleeding is excessive and if crystalloids in combination with vasopressors are not able to maintain basic tissue perfusion, colloid infusions represent a further, however controversial, option to restore perfusion. If a colloid solution is administered, it is still unclear which colloid solution should be used in the initial treatment of the bleeding trauma patient.

In most trauma studies, 0.9% sodium chloride was used as the crystalloid solution. However, at least seven studies in both non-critically and critically ill patients suggest that the use of this crystalloid solution as the main i.v. fluid source results in harm to patients, e.g. reduced renal blood flow velocity and renal cortical tissue perfusion, hyperchloraemic acidosis, increased incidence of kidney injury or even reduced survival. In contrast to 0.9% sodium chloride, balanced electrolyte solutions comprise physiological or near-physiological concentrations of chloride and may therefore be advantageous. Similarly, in a retrospective analysis of ICU patients receiving more than 60 mL/kg 0.9% sodium solution over a 24 h period, each 100 mEq increase in chloride load was associated with a 5.5% increase in the risk of death, even after controlling for total fluid volume, age, and severity (p = 0.0015) over a 1-year period. The two most recent RCTs comparing balanced crystalloids vs 0.9% sodium chloride, one including 13,347 non-critically ill adults and the other including 15,802 critically ill patients, found variation in the negative side-effects of 0.9% sodium chloride, depending on the health status, and thereby on the physiological ability of each patient to compensate. In one of the studies, non-critically ill patients receiving balanced crystalloid solutions compared with saline were shown to have a lower incidence of major kidney-related adverse events within 30 days, without an influence on the length of hospital stay. In the other study, critically ill patients receiving balanced crystalloid solutions compared with saline were shown to have a lower rate of composite outcome death from any cause, new renal replacement therapy or persistent renal dysfunction. In a small prospective randomised trial involving 46 trauma patients, a balanced electrolyte solution improved acid-base status and resulted in less hyperchloraemia at 24 h post-injury compared with 0.9% sodium chloride. Moreover, a secondary analysis demonstrated that the use of balanced electrolyte solutions resulted in a net cost benefit in comparison to the use of 0.9% saline chloride. On the other hand, another recently published study could not exclude the possibility that an acetate-based balanced crystalloid solution increased patient bleeding during cardiac surgery, which warrants further investigation. In conclusion, for critically ill patients such as trauma patients, a balanced electrolyte solution should be favoured over 0.9% sodium chloride, and if a 0.9% sodium chloride solution is used, it should be limited to a maximum of 1–1.5 L.

Results

Our initial search yielded 1,945 results. After removing duplicates and applying exclusion criteria, we thoroughly reviewed 60 studies according to our inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). The final analysis included 8 studies: 4 RCTs and 4 observational studies, encompassing a total of 12,231 patients. Of these, 2,460 (20.1%) received BS, and 9,771 (79.9.%) received NS. Included studies employed various balanced crystalloid solutions: two studies used a combination of lactated Ringer's (LR) and PlasmaLyte or Sterofundin, three studies used LR exclusively, two studies used PlasmaLyte or Ringer's acetate, and one study did not specify the type of balanced solution used. There was significant variability among the included studies regarding the definitions of AKI, hospital mortality, follow-up periods, and site of infection, potentially contributing to the heterogeneity in the pooled analysis. The baseline characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 1.

Balanced Crystalloid Solutions Compared With Normal Saline

There are no trials evaluating balanced solutions compared with normal saline specifically in the post-CA population. However, several trials in other critically ill cohorts are informative. – The largest RCT, the SMART trial (Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial), demonstrated a lower rate of the composite outcome of death, renal replacement therapy (RRT), or persistent renal dysfunction in patients treated with balanced solutions compared with normal saline. Numerous systematic reviews evaluated the potential benefit of balanced crystalloid solutions. – These analyses had mixed results, which may be due to the end points chosen (eg, a composite end point in the SMART trial), the trial designs permitted (ie, prospective versus observational), and the patient populations included.

A single approach to fluid selection may not apply to patients with post-CA syndrome because of the associated neurological injury. Although data exist describing the potentially harmful effects of hypotonic solutions on cerebral edema, data comparing individual balanced solutions are limited. Clinicians must consider the fact that balanced solutions are slightly more hypotonic than normal saline and could aggravate cerebral edema. Additional prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effect of hyperchloremia on kidney failure and mortality.

Sodium Bicarbonate

Few data describe sodium bicarbonate use specifically in the post-CA period. Most studies investigate the role of sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis in heterogeneous critically ill populations, and the available data do not support routine administration of sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis. Two recent studies, however, suggest benefit with bicarbonate in patients with extreme acidosis and acute kidney injury (AKI). The lack of clear effect in the overall population could be due to the multitude of causes for metabolic acidosis and the possible benefit for some causes (ie, AKI) but not others (ie, lactic acidosis). Further prospective research is needed that is specific to patients with post-CA syndrome or focuses on subgroups most likely to have physiological benefit.

For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline for resuscitation (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using albumin in patients who received large volumes of crystalloids over using crystalloids alone (Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend against using starches for resuscitation (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis and septic shock, we suggest against using gelatin for resuscitation (Weak recommendation, moderate quality).

Fluid Management

13. Fluid administration should be tailored to avoid excessive fluid administration and volume overload or undue fluid restriction and hypovolemia. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A.

Both intravenous fluid overload and hypovolemia can significantly impair organ function, increase postoperative morbidity, and prolong hospital stay. Intraoperative infusion regimens based on definitions such as liberal, restrictive, or supplemental should typically be avoided because of the variability in the volumes of fluid infused among different studies using these qualifiers. However, more recently, within the ERP literature, the term "restrictive fluid management" has gained popularity and the amount of fluid recommended with restrictive fluid management has gradually decreased. The term "zero-balance" fluid management was introduced to describe a restrictive fluid regimen aiming to avoid postoperative fluid retention (as indicated by weight gain). However, although a zero-balance approach might improve postoperative GI function, it is associated with a slightly increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) (8.6% versus 5.0% in an RCT of 3000 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery).

Based on these considerations, the overall goal of fluid management should typically be a positive fluid balance at the end of surgery of ~1 L. This should be sufficient to avoid hypovolemia and AKI while limiting substantial postoperative weight gain (> 2.5 kg/d), which is associated with increased morbidity and prolonged hospital stay.

14. Balanced chloride-restricted crystalloid solutions should be used for maintenance infusions and fluid boluses in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. There is no benefit to the routine use of colloid solutions for fluid boluses. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.

Results from studies conducted in healthy volunteers and from meta-analyses of small RCTs indicate that balanced chloride-restricted crystalloid solutions should be preferred to normal saline to decrease the risk of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Large propensity-matched observational studies have reported an association between the use of normal saline and an increased incidence rate of renal dysfunction, postoperative morbidity, and mortality in surgical patients. A large cluster randomized trial of 15,000 critically ill adults showed similar results, with lower rates of death and renal dysfunction attributed to the use of balanced crystalloids. Based on the evidence from this trial, the current recommendation was upgraded from a 1C in 2017 to a 1B.

### Impact of continuous hypertonic (NaCl 20%) saline solution on renal outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI): a post hoc analysis of the COBI trial [^1251b6b5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This post hoc analysis of the COBI trial evaluated the impact of a continuous infusion of HSS (20%) on renal function after moderate-to-severe TBI. No association between the continuous infusion of HSS (20%) and AKI (KDIGO stage 2 or 3) from inclusion to Day 28 was find. Creatinine levels and eGFR were also similar between the two groups. Chloremia was significantly higher in the HSS group. No difference in acid/base metabolic status was found between the two groups.

Fluid therapy solutions, administered in ICU, contain different concentrations of electrolytes. Among these electrolytes, chloride has raised concern about its iniquity. Actually, an acute administration of a large amount of chloride-rich solution may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis associated with pathophysiological consequences such as: coagulopathy, hypotension, or splanchnic disorders. Furthermore, chronic hyperchloremia is also theoretically associated with an excessive vasoconstriction of afferent renal arteries leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate.

In the past decade, three large RCTs compared buffered crystalloid to normal (0.9%) saline solution in various settings. These RCT's did show a statistically significant difference between the groups regarding chloride intake or changes in chloremia and arterial acid–base balance. However, the clinical significance of these differences is questionable. Actually, in the SMART trial the difference of chloride intake between the two groups was of 0.5 g, and differences in terms of blood chloride levels were also small and probably not clinically relevant: 109 mmol/L (saline solution) versus 108 mmol/L (balanced crystalloid). These limitations are also found in the BaSICS and the PLUS trials. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude about the kidney toxicity of high chloride intake in ICU patients with these clinical trials.

### Balanced multielectrolyte solution versus saline in critically ill adults [^009fa59c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study PLUS was published by Simon Finfer and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness and Maintenance fluid therapy. In the PLUS study, the trial question was: what is the role of balanced multielectrolyte solution in critically ill patients in the ICU? In the PLUS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PLUS study, the population was: 5037 patients (1948 female, 3089 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients. The key exclusion criteria were specific fluid requirements; receipt of > 500 mL of fluid resuscitation; imminent risk of death or a preexisting life expectancy < 90 days; traumatic brain injury or at risk for cerebral edema. In the PLUS study, the interventions were: n = 2515 balanced multielectrolyte solution (Plasma-Lyte 148 for up to 90 days) n = 2522 saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride). In the PLUS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from any cause at day 90 (21.8% vs. 22%; OR 0.99, 99% CI 0.86 to 1.14). In the PLUS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in patients who received new RRT (12.7% vs. 12.9%; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16) No significant difference in maximum elevation in serum creatinine level (0.41 mg/dL vs. 0.41 mg/dL; AD 0.01 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.06) No significant difference in days alive without mechanical ventilation (68.3 days vs. 68.2 days; AD 0.06 days, 95% CI -1.79 to 1.91). In the PLUS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PLUS study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients, balanced multielectrolyte solution was not superior to saline solution with respect to death from any cause at day 90.

### Fluids in the ICU: which is the right one? [^c5ec55e0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The effect of albumin on mortality in liver cirrhosis depends on the indication. In contrast to beneficial effects in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, no such benefit has been seen in other infections. In hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis, recurrent albumin infusions to raise albumin levels to a target of 35 g/L did not improve outcome. However, in patients with cirrhosis and septic shock, 5% albumin for volume resuscitation had a beneficial effect on hemodynamics and short-term mortality compared with 0.9% saline. Clear recommendations for albumin are established for large volume ascites paracentesis, in hepato-renal syndrome and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis of patients with advanced liver disease, because albumin infusion can reduce the risk of AKI.

Conversely, hypo-oncotic 4% albumin solution can worsen the outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury. A landmark study in 2004 showed that 4% albumin for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients produced similar results to 0.9% saline at 28 days, although albumin significantly reduced the total amount of fluid administered (the ratio of saline to albumin was 1.4 for the first four days). Secondary analyses showed an increased risk of mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury, but in contrast there was a trend towards lower mortality in septic patients receiving albumin (P = 0.09). This led to the design of a randomized controlled trial in patients with severe sepsis, comparing the replacement of 20% albumin (to maintain plasma levels ≥ 3 g/dL) with crystalloids alone.

The Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) study (published 10 years later) showed that albumin did not improve 28- and 90-day survival, but post hoc analysis found a reduction in 90-day mortality for the albumin group in patients with septic shock. There is thus conflicting evidence on the role of albumin in critically ill patients with sepsis. In addition, it should be noted that the ALBIOS trial did not investigate the effectiveness of albumin during fluid resuscitation. In ALBIOS, during the early phase of volume resuscitation, fluids were administered in both groups according to early goal-directed therapy. After randomization, patients in the albumin group received 300 mL of 20% albumin solution from Day 1 until Day 28 or ICU discharge (whichever came first); 20% albumin was administered on a daily basis, to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g/L or more. In both groups, crystalloids were administered whenever it was clinically indicated by the attending physician.

### Effect of early balanced crystalloids before ICU admission on sepsis outcomes [^c31b2138]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies suggest that using balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) rather than saline (0.9% sodium chloride) may improve outcomes for patients with sepsis in the ED and ICU.

Research Question

What is the relative impact on sepsis outcomes of fluid composition during early resuscitation in the ED vs after ICU admission?

Study Design and Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) data set, examining medical ICU patients with a diagnosis of sepsis (n = 1,641). SMART was a cluster-crossover trial comparing balanced crystalloids vs saline among critically ill adults. During the first 7 months of SMART, fluid choice was controlled only in the ICU ("ICU-only period"). In the final 15 months, fluid choice was coordinated between the ED and ICU ("ED and ICU period"). We performed logistic regression modeling for 30-day in-hospital mortality with an interaction term between randomized group (balanced crystalloids vs saline) and study period (ICU-only period vs ED and ICU period).

Results

Three hundred and sixty-seven patients with sepsis were enrolled during the ICU-only period and 1,274 were enrolled during the ED and ICU period. Thirty-day in-hospital mortality occurred in 47 of 142 patients (33.1%) in the balanced crystalloid group vs 74 of 225 patients (32.9%) in the saline group during the ICU-only period (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.70–1.88) and in 170 of 682 patients (24.9%) in the balanced crystalloid group vs 181 of 592 patients (30.6%) in the saline group in the ED and ICU period (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52–0.89) (P value for interaction, .07), consistent with a beneficial effect of balanced crystalloid primarily in the ED and ICU period.

Interpretation

Among patients with sepsis, the effect of balanced crystalloids vs saline on mortality was greater among patients for whom fluid choice was controlled starting in the ED compared with starting in the ICU.
