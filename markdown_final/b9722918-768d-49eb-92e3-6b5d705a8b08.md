## Question

Tell me about management of pediatric glioma in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing pediatric-type gliomas in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the AYA population and why it is clinically distinct. Then, I should verify the molecular taxonomy that distinguishes pediatric-type from adult-type gliomas. Next, I will examine diagnostic and staging principles, including imaging and tissue acquisition. After that, I need to stratify management by grade and molecular subtype, starting with low-grade gliomas, then high-grade gliomas, and finally diffuse midline glioma. I should also consider special populations like NF1-associated tumors and the role of targeted therapies. Finally, I will address transition-of-care, survivorship, and evidence gaps, and close with a concise, risk-adapted algorithm that aligns with current guidelines and consensus statements [^116H8Mud] [^117P9BBR].

> Let me first confirm the AYA definition and its clinical relevance. AYA is commonly defined as ages 15–39 years, a group with unique epidemiology, tumor biology, and psychosocial needs, and with historically poorer outcomes than pediatric cohorts and underrepresentation in trials, which complicates evidence-based decision-making and care delivery [^116H8Mud] [^115gDmdt] [^112p6dYk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about biology; I need to check the molecular taxonomy that separates pediatric-type from adult-type gliomas. The 2021 WHO classification recognizes pediatric-type diffuse high-grade gliomas (pHGG) as distinct entities, including H3 G34-mutant hemispheric tumors, H3 K27-altered diffuse midline glioma, infant-type hemispheric glioma, and pediatric-type H3/IDH wild-type tumors, whereas adult-type gliomas are dominated by IDH-mutant astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma with 1p/19q co-deletion; importantly, pediatric-type tumors often lack IDH mutations and have different copy-number and driver landscapes, which has direct therapeutic implications [^112fTUuw] [^117P9BBR] [^113mJNeZ].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic workflow before discussing treatment. Integrated histology plus molecular testing is now standard; next-generation sequencing and methylation profiling should be obtained when feasible, and neuropathology review by an expert is recommended to correctly assign pediatric versus adult-type entities; for imaging, conventional MRI is foundational, with advanced modalities such as MR perfusion, spectroscopy, and amino-acid PET (e.g. FET-PET) helping distinguish recurrence from pseudoprogression and guiding biopsy or resection planning, particularly in challenging pediatric and AYA contexts [^1145SSQH] [^111DXCeR] [^115Vi4qs].

> I will now examine low-grade gliomas (LGG) in AYA, but I should confirm the key distinctions from adult LGG. Pediatric-type LGGs are typically IDH-wild-type, often MAPK-driven, and rarely transform, whereas adult LGGs are usually IDH-mutant and carry a risk of malignant transformation; in AYA, IDH-mutant LGGs behave more like adult disease with slower progression and relatively favorable prognosis, though young adults may have shorter progression-free survival and faster transformation than pediatric or older adult cohorts, underscoring the need for age-tailored strategies [^114eB8mn] [^115hhtfs] [^113mJNeZ].

> Let me think about first-line management for LGG in AYA. Maximal safe resection remains the cornerstone; gross total resection is often curative in circumscribed pediatric-type LGG, while residual disease warrants risk-adapted surveillance or adjuvant therapy; for unresectable or progressive disease, chemotherapy is frequently preferred over radiotherapy in younger patients to mitigate neurocognitive and endocrine late effects, and targeted agents such as MEK inhibitors are increasingly used for MAPK-altered tumors, with ongoing debate about optimal sequencing and duration of targeted therapy versus conventional chemotherapy [^113YQsZ1] [^114XwT3L] [^111KhGk4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought radiotherapy should be avoided entirely in AYA LGG to prevent late sequelae; let me reconsider and be precise. Radiation is not absolutely contraindicated in AYA LGG, but it is generally deferred when possible due to neurocognitive and endocrine toxicity; in select AYA patients with IDH-mutant LGG and residual disease, early radiotherapy can improve progression-free survival, so decisions should balance age, molecular subtype, residual tumor, symptoms, and patient preferences within a multidisciplinary framework [^114uFFm4] [^112sBfHE].

> Next, I should review high-grade gliomas (HGG) in AYA, and I need to ensure I separate pediatric-type from adult-type disease. For pediatric-type HGG, maximal safe resection followed by focal radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy is standard, with temozolomide benefit less consistent than in adults; enrollment in clinical trials is strongly preferred, and molecularly targeted strategies such as TRK inhibition for NTRK fusions or RAF/MEK inhibition for BRAF V600E are reasonable in appropriate molecular contexts; for adult-type HGG in AYA, adult protocols including concurrent chemoradiation with temozolomide and adjuvant temozolomide are typically applied, acknowledging the paucity of AYA-specific data [^115YPP4G] [^113PhrKh] [^116QS1fK].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of temozolomide in pediatric-type HGG because I recall conflicting data. Prospective pediatric trials show mixed results for temozolomide, with some studies showing no added benefit and others suggesting improved outcomes in specific subgroups; thus, routine temozolomide is not universally adopted in pediatric-type HGG outside of trials, reinforcing the need for molecular stratification and trial enrollment to guide therapy selection [^113PhrKh] [^115YPP4G].

> I will now examine diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, which is a special case. Biopsy is encouraged when feasible, but many cases are diagnosed radiographically; standard therapy is focal radiotherapy to 54–59.4 Gy, as surgery is typically noncurative and chemotherapy has limited impact; prognosis remains poor, and clinical trials exploring epigenetic or immune strategies are critical, with response assessment complicated by pseudoprogression, where RAPNO criteria and advanced imaging can aid interpretation [^111h3TRM] [^113iekfU] [^111VRuTY].

> Let me consider NF1-associated optic pathway gliomas, since they are common in pediatrics and can persist into AYA. Observation with ophthalmologic and MRI surveillance is appropriate for stable, asymptomatic cases; treatment is indicated for symptomatic progression or threat to vision, with chemotherapy favored over radiotherapy in younger patients to avoid neurocognitive and vascular late effects; targeted agents such as MEK inhibitors are under active investigation and may be considered in refractory cases or clinical trials [^111BBaWC] [^117Mf1kx].

> I should double-check the role of targeted therapies across subtypes and ages. BRAF/MEK inhibition has shown activity in BRAF V600E–mutant gliomas and is increasingly used in both pediatric-type and some adult-type settings, albeit with adult experience largely extrapolated from other cancers; TRK inhibitors are appropriate for NTRK fusion–positive tumors; and for IDH-mutant gliomas in AYA, IDH inhibitors such as vorasidenib can delay progression and defer radiotherapy, though multidisciplinary discussion is advised given evolving evidence and patient-specific factors [^112yz3LE] [^116QS1fK] [^116GSfYV].

> Next, I should review transition-of-care and survivorship, because AYA patients often fall through the cracks. Successful transition requires early planning, neuropsychological assessment of readiness, and coordinated handoffs to adult teams with pediatric neuro-oncology expertise; in practice, transition is frequently delayed and underutilized, leading to fragmented care; structured programs and joint clinics can mitigate this, and survivorship plans should address fertility, endocrine surveillance, neurocognitive rehabilitation, and psychosocial support [^113UM4xe] [^111udQTq] [^113LT51r].

> But wait, what about evidence gaps and how to navigate them in shared decision-making. High-quality, AYA-specific data are sparse, with many studies biased by inclusion of older adults; therefore, management often relies on extrapolation from pediatric and adult guidelines, expert consensus, and clinical trials; multidisciplinary tumor board review is strongly recommended, and patients should be offered trial participation whenever possible to advance AYA-specific evidence and access novel therapies [^113JZcKK] [^117P9BBR] [^116H8Mud].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-adapted algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. For any AYA with a suspected glioma, obtain expert MRI and proceed to maximal safe resection or stereotactic/open biopsy for tissue and molecular profiling; classify the tumor using WHO 2021 criteria into pediatric-type versus adult-type and low- versus high-grade; for pediatric-type LGG, favor observation after GTR or chemotherapy for residual/progressive disease, reserving radiotherapy for later-line or symptomatic cases; for adult-type LGG, consider early radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, especially with residual disease; for pediatric-type HGG, prioritize clinical trials and consider radiotherapy with or without temozolomide plus targeted agents based on molecular findings; for adult-type HGG, apply adult chemoradiation standards with adjuvant temozolomide; for diffuse midline glioma, proceed with radiotherapy and trial enrollment; throughout, embed transition planning and survivorship care early in the course [^111h3TRM] [^115YPP4G] [^117P9BBR] [^116H8Mud].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed the core question about "pediatric glioma in adults". The key point is that pediatric-type gliomas can and do occur in AYA, and their management should follow pediatric-informed, molecularly driven strategies rather than defaulting to adult protocols; conversely, AYA may harbor adult-type gliomas that warrant adult-standard approaches, so integrated molecular diagnosis and multidisciplinary, age-appropriate care are essential to optimize outcomes in this underserved population [^112fTUuw] [^117P9BBR] [^116H8Mud].

Management of pediatric glioma in adults requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^116H8Mud] that integrates pediatric and adult neuro-oncology expertise, with care tailored to tumor grade, molecular features, and patient age [^112p6dYk]. For low-grade gliomas, **maximal safe resection** is first-line [^113YQsZ1]; if residual tumor remains, observation or adjuvant therapy is used, with radiotherapy deferred to minimize late effects [^113YQsZ1]. For high-grade gliomas, **maximal safe resection** [^111cF1NA] is followed by radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy [^115YPP4G]; temozolomide is used selectively based on molecular features and age [^113PhrKh]. Molecular profiling is essential to guide targeted therapy [^1145SSQH] (e.g. BRAF/MEK, NTRK, IDH inhibitors) [^116QS1fK] and clinical trial enrollment [^112ZHv4G]. Transition care must address neurocognitive, endocrine, and psychosocial needs [^113LT51r], and patients should be managed in specialized centers with access to pediatric and adult protocols [^116H8Mud].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical presentation

- **Incidence**: Pediatric gliomas are the most common CNS tumors in children, with a median age at diagnosis of 8 years [^115BV8m2]. A subset persists or recurs into adulthood, necessitating ongoing management [^116Pytxc].

- **Clinical presentation**: Symptoms vary by tumor location and grade, including headaches, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and visual disturbances for optic pathway gliomas [^111BBaWC].

- **Transition to adult care**: Many patients require transition from pediatric to adult services, often inadequately managed, leading to gaps in care [^111udQTq].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging

MRI is the **standard modality** for diagnosis, surgical planning, and follow-up [^112rDPqb]; advanced techniques (MR perfusion, spectroscopy, PET) help differentiate recurrence from treatment effects [^111DXCeR]. Amino acid PET (e.g. FET-PET) aids in **diagnostic accuracy and management decisions**, particularly in complex cases [^115Vi4qs].

---

### Molecular profiling

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) [^1145SSQH] is recommended to identify **actionable mutations** (e.g. BRAF, NTRK, IDH) and guide therapy selection [^116QS1fK] [^1163wkiv]. Methylation profiling complements histology and **improves diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification** [^112fTUuw].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Low-grade gliomas (LGG)

#### Surgical management

Maximal safe resection is the **primary treatment** [^113YQsZ1]; gross total resection (GTR) is often curative, with > 95% 10-year overall survival [^114eQr5x]. Subtotal resection may warrant **adjuvant therapy** if residual tumor is present or progression occurs [^1168y4bZ].

---

#### Adjuvant therapy

Chemotherapy is preferred over radiotherapy in younger patients to **delay radiation and reduce late effects** [^115YPP4G]; regimens include carboplatin/vincristine or targeted agents (e.g. MEK inhibitors) for BRAF/MAPK-driven tumors [^116QS1fK]. Radiotherapy is reserved for **progressive or unresectable tumors**, with careful consideration of late cognitive and endocrine effects [^114XwT3L].

---

### High-grade gliomas (HGG)

#### Surgical management

Maximal safe resection is critical for **diagnosis, debulking, and symptom control** [^111cF1NA]; postoperative MRI within 24–48 hours is recommended to assess extent of resection [^116Lfayg].

---

#### Radiotherapy and chemotherapy

Radiotherapy is standard for patients aged ≥ 3 years, typically 54–59.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions [^115PciTH]; for those < 3 years, radiation is deferred or omitted when possible due to developmental risks [^115VouiH]. Temozolomide is used selectively; benefit is **less consistent than in adults** [^113PhrKh], so molecular features (e.g. MGMT, H3 status) guide use [^1175kekS].

---

#### Molecularly targeted therapies

BRAF/MEK inhibitors are used for **BRAF V600E-mutant tumors** [^116QS1fK], with growing evidence in pediatric and AYA populations [^1168y4bZ]. NTRK inhibitors are indicated for **NTRK fusion-positive tumors** [^116QS1fK]. IDH inhibitors (e.g. vorasidenib) are considered for **IDH-mutant gliomas**, particularly in older AYAs [^1163wkiv].

---

## Special considerations

### Neurocognitive and endocrine sequelae

Neurocognitive impairment is common after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; **cognitive rehabilitation** and neuropsychological support are recommended [^112uMiyC]. Endocrine dysfunction requires **regular endocrine evaluation** and hormone replacement, including growth hormone when indicated [^116gfrme].

---

### Transition of care

Transition planning should begin in adolescence, incorporating **developmentally appropriate education**, self-management skills, and coordinated transfer to adult services [^113UM4xe]. Multidisciplinary care involving pediatric and adult neuro-oncology, neurosurgery, radiation oncology, endocrinology, and psychology is essential [^116H8Mud].

---

## Prognostic factors

- **Tumor grade and molecular features**: H3 K27M mutations confer poor prognosis; BRAF alterations are more favorable [^111VRuTY].

- **Extent of resection**: GTR significantly improves outcomes in LGG [^114eQr5x].

- **Age at diagnosis**: Younger age correlates with better prognosis [^112bYNVE].

---

## Current research and clinical trials

Clinical trials are strongly encouraged, especially for HGG, to access **novel therapies** and improve outcomes [^115YPP4G]. Immunotherapy is under investigation, including **checkpoint inhibitors** for hypermutated tumors and **vaccine-based approaches** [^1175kekS]. Early-phase studies are evaluating targeted agents, including **FGFR, EGFR, and PI3K inhibitors** [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

MRI surveillance is recommended every **3–6 months** for the first 2 years, then annually if stable. Clinical monitoring should track neurologic status, endocrine function, and **neurocognitive outcomes**, with support services integrated into follow-up [^115VouiH].

---

Management of pediatric glioma in adults requires a **coordinated, multidisciplinary approach** that balances disease control with long-term quality of life. Molecular profiling and access to pediatric and adult protocols are critical to optimize outcomes [^116H8Mud].

### Pediatric gliomas: current concepts on diagnosis, biology, and clinical management [^114eB8mn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Gliomas are the most common CNS tumors in children and adolescents, and they show an extremely broad range of clinical behavior. The majority of pediatric gliomas present as benign, slow-growing lesions classified as grade I or II by the WHO classification of CNS tumors. These pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are fundamentally different from IDH-mutant LGGs occurring in adults, because they rarely undergo malignant transformation and show excellent overall survival under current treatment strategies. However, a significant fraction of gliomas develop over a short period of time and progress rapidly and are therefore classified as WHO grade III or IV high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Despite all therapeutic efforts, they remain largely incurable, with the most aggressive forms being lethal within months. Thus, the intentions of neurosurgeons, pediatric oncologists, and radiotherapists to improve care for pediatric patients with glioma range from increasing quality of life and preventing long-term sequelae in what is often a chronic, but rarely life-threatening disease (LGG), to uncovering effective treatment options to prolong patient survival in an almost universally fatal setting (HGG). The last decade has seen unprecedented progress in understanding the molecular biology underlying pediatric gliomas, fueling hopes to achieve both goals. Large-scale collaborative studies around the globe have cataloged genomic and epigenomic alterations in gliomas across ages, grades, and histologies. These studies have revealed biologic subgroups characterized by distinct molecular, pathologic, and clinical features, with clear relevance for patient management. In this review, we summarize hallmark discoveries that have expanded our knowledge in pediatric LGGs and HGGs, explain their role in tumor biology, and convey our current concepts on how these findings may be translated into novel therapeutic approaches.

### Unique molecular, clinical, and treatment aspects of gliomas in adolescents and young adults: a review [^112p6dYk]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with glioma have historically had poorer outcomes than similar patients of younger or older age, a disparity thought to be attributable to the social and economic challenges faced by this group in the transition from childhood to adult life, delays in diagnosis, low participation of AYA patients in clinical trials, and the lack of standardized treatment approaches specific to this patient group. Recent work from many groups has informed a revision of the World Health Organization classification schema for gliomas to identify biologically divergent pediatric- and adult-type tumors, both types of which may occur in AYA patients, and revealed exciting opportunities for the use of targeted therapies for many of these patients. In this review, the authors focus on the glioma types of specific concern to practitioners caring for AYA patients and the factors that should be considered in the development of multidisciplinary teams to facilitate their care.

### Central nervous system tumors in adolescents and young adults: a Society for Neuro-oncology consensus review on diagnosis, management, and future directions [^116H8Mud]. Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Adolescents and young adults (AYAs; ages 15–39 years) are a vulnerable population facing challenges in oncological care, including access to specialized care, transition of care, unique tumor biology, and poor representation in clinical trials. Brain tumors are the second most common tumor type in AYA, with malignant brain tumors being the most common cause of cancer-related death. The 2021 WHO Classification for central nervous system (CNS) Tumors highlights the importance of integrated molecular characterization with histologic diagnosis in several tumors relevant to the AYA population. In this position paper from the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO), the diagnosis and management of CNS tumors in AYA is reviewed, focusing on the most common tumor types in this population, namely glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and CNS germ cell tumor. Current challenges and future directions specific to AYA are also highlighted. Finally, possible solutions to address barriers in the care of AYA patients are discussed, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary and collaborative approaches that span the pediatric and adult paradigms of care, and incorporating advanced molecular testing, targeted therapy, and AYA-centered care.

### Pediatric high-grade glioma: biologically and clinically in need of new thinking [^111rQYih]. Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

High-grade gliomas in children are different from those that arise in adults. Recent collaborative molecular analyses of these rare cancers have revealed previously unappreciated connections among chromatin regulation, developmental signaling, and tumorigenesis. As we begin to unravel the unique developmental origins and distinct biological drivers of this heterogeneous group of tumors, clinical trials need to keep pace. It is important to avoid therapeutic strategies developed purely using data obtained from studies on adult glioblastoma. This approach has resulted in repetitive trials and ineffective treatments being applied to these children, with limited improvement in clinical outcome. The authors of this perspective, comprising biology and clinical expertise in the disease, recently convened to discuss the most effective ways to translate the emerging molecular insights into patient benefit. This article reviews our current understanding of pediatric high-grade glioma and suggests approaches for innovative clinical management.

### Advances in the management of paediatric high-grade glioma [^116qY1kR]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

High-grade gliomas represent a formidable challenge to paediatric oncologists. The second most common malignant brain tumour of childhood, little progress has been made in the outcome of these tumours in the last four decades. Outcome remains dire with less than 20% of patients surviving. Current treatment consists of maximal resection and radiotherapy, with chemotherapy both in conjunction with and adjuvant to radiotherapy being added more recently. Yet much of the evidence for the use of chemotherapy is extrapolated from adult data, and evidence for its use in the paediatric population is weak. Recent advances in the biology of high-grade glioma in children identify epigenomic subgroups distinct from those seen in adults, suggesting a separate tumourigenic mechanism and delineating a separate disease entity. The time may be to move forward with a different way of thinking about paediatric tumours. With biological insight comes the promise of more effective therapies, rationally targeted towards the biology of the tumour. This review addresses the current advances in paediatric high-grade glioma and how we can move forward to translate this into improved outcomes for these patients.

### Multidisciplinary management of pediatric low-grade gliomas [^113YQsZ1]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Low-grade gliomas comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors accounting for 30% to 40% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms in the pediatric population. Management of these patients has evolved significantly over the past 2 decades, the present emphasis being on surgery. Adjuvant therapies, such as radiation and/or chemotherapy are generally withheld until symptomatic or radiographic progression is evident. The goal of surgery is gross total resection, while preserving maximal neurologic function. The goal of radiation and chemotherapy is to provide symptom and tumor control with minimal acute and late toxicities. Chemotherapy has the additional goal of deferring radiation to allow maximal development and maturation of the child's CNS. The incorporation of these 3 modalities into the overall care of the pediatric low-grade glioma patient involves the multidisciplinary input of the neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, and pediatric neuro-oncologist both at time of diagnosis and throughout the course of their disease.

### EANO guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diffuse gliomas of adulthood [^117P9BBR]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

In response to major changes in diagnostic algorithms and the publication of mature results from various large clinical trials, the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) recognized the need to provide updated guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with diffuse gliomas. Through these evidence-based guidelines, a task force of EANO provides recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of adult patients with diffuse gliomas. The diagnostic component is based on the 2016 update of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System and the subsequent recommendations of the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumour Taxonomy — Not Officially WHO (cIMPACT-NOW). With regard to therapy, we formulated recommendations based on the results from the latest practice-changing clinical trials and also provide guidance for neuropathological and neuroradiological assessment. In these guidelines, we define the role of the major treatment modalities of surgery, radiotherapy and systemic pharmacotherapy, covering current advances and cognizant that unnecessary interventions and expenses should be avoided. This document is intended to be a source of reference for professionals involved in the management of adult patients with diffuse gliomas, for patients and caregivers, and for health-care providers.

OBJECTIVES

The objective is to define guidelines for the management of adult patients with glioma. The management of spinal, non-glial, hypophyseal, neuronal tumours and schwannomas and the management of childhood glioma are not covered in this document.

### Paediatric and adult malignant glioma: close relatives or distant cousins? [^113mJNeZ]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Gliomas in children differ from their adult counterparts by their distribution of histological grade, site of presentation and rate of malignant transformation. Although rare in the paediatric population, patients with high-grade gliomas have, for the most part, a comparably dismal clinical outcome to older patients with morphologically similar lesions. Molecular profiling data have begun to reveal the major genetic alterations underpinning these malignant tumours in children. Indeed, the accumulation of large datasets on adult high-grade glioma has revealed key biological differences between the adult and paediatric disease. Furthermore, subclassifications within the childhood age group can be made depending on age at diagnosis and tumour site. However, challenges remain on how to reconcile clinical data from adult patients to tailor novel treatment strategies specifically for paediatric patients.

### Management of high-grade gliomas in the pediatric patient: past, present, and future [^115NZjfb]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2014). Low credibility.

High-grade gliomas (HGGs) constitute ∼15% of all primary brain tumors in children and adolescents. Routine histopathological diagnosis is based on tissue obtained from biopsy or, preferably, from the resected tumor itself. The majority of pediatric HGGs are clinically and biologically distinct from histologically similar adult malignant gliomas; these differences may explain the disparate responses to therapy and clinical outcomes when comparing children and adults with HGG. The recently proposed integrated genomic classification identifies 6 distinct biological subgroups of glioblastoma (GBM) throughout the age spectrum. Driver mutations in genes affecting histone H3.3 (K27M and G34R/V) coupled with mutations involving specific proteins (TP53, ATRX, DAXX, SETD2, ACVR1, FGFR1, NTRK) induce defects in chromatin remodeling and may play a central role in the genesis of many pediatric HGGs. Current clinical practice in pediatric HGGs includes surgical resection followed by radiation therapy (in children aged > 3 years) with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide. However, these multimodality treatment strategies have had a minimal impact on improving survival. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating new molecular targets, chemoradiation sensitization strategies, and immunotherapy. Future clinical trials of pediatric HGG will incorporate the distinction between GBM molecular subgroups and stratify patients using group-specific biomarkers.

### Implications of new understandings of gliomas in children and adults with NF1: report of a consensus conference [^111BBaWC]. Neuro-Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Management and Therapeutic Approaches

General Aspects

In the pediatric and adolescent age group, NF1-associated LGG is often an indolent disease. In general, children with NF1 and MRI findings consistent with LGG receive tumor-directed therapies if they experience symptomatic progression such as functional deterioration, most commonly visual decline associated with OPG. However, most clinical trials to date have included patients with radiographically documented growth and/or lesions considered likely to threaten neurologic function or vision on study without objective documentation of functional loss. Because of the 15–20% incidence of OPGs in children with NF1, screening via ophthalmologic examinations is recommended annually until age 8 years (the age of highest risk), and then every other year until 18 years of age, after which the development of OPGs is exceedingly rare. Screening for LGG in other locations is not performed routinely, but rather prompted by suspicion based on history, physical examination findings, or symptoms. There is consensus that newly diagnosed NF1-LGG should be monitored with both imaging and ophthalmology for optic pathway tumors; however, there is limited data regarding the ideal frequency of such monitoring.

### Adolescent and young adult glioma: systematic review of demographic, disease, and treatment influences on survival [^115gDmdt]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

AYA, commonly defined as patients between 15 and 39 years of age, are a vulnerable subpopulation at the crossroads between pediatric and adult cohorts. National brain tumor registry data from the United States suggest that AYA glioma survival is more favorable than older adults (in whom HGG is more common), though survival rates are lower when compared to pediatric patients. However, AYA-specific prognostic and treatment data are rare due to overlapping inclusion in pediatric or adult cohorts combined with limited representation in clinical trials. Though it is now well accepted that glioma outcome varies by molecular alteration in both pediatric and adult cohorts, the molecular landscape of AYA glioma has not been well described, leading to a homogenous approach regardless of cancer genetics. This lack of AYA focus has consequences: mortality rates for AYA with CNS tumors have increased by 0.6% per year for males and 1% per year for females. Current literature is limited in defining the ideal treatment approach for this group. Thus, AYA patients treated in pediatric centers are most often treated according to pediatric guidelines, while those treated in adult centers are often treated with adult approaches.

Given the histological and molecular heterogeneity of glioma across the age spectrum, a rigorous evaluation of the available AYA glioma literature is required to inform patient counseling, therapeutic decisions, and future research priorities. Our objective was thus to review factors associated with survival outcomes in AYA glioma.

### Targeting the tumor microenvironment in pediatric gliomas: advances and future directions in immunotherapy [^1124YDFf]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical determinant of tumor progression and therapeutic response in gliomas. While pediatric gliomas have historically been treated using strategies derived from the management of adult gliomas, emerging evidence reveals that pediatric gliomas possess a unique TME. The pediatric TME is distinct, characterized not only by differences in cellular composition but a lower mutational burden, diminished neoantigen presentation, and heightened immunosuppressive activity. The unique immune landscape, developmental trajectories, and immune escape mechanisms in the pediatric TME create barriers to effective therapy. Recent studies show promising results in novel and advanced therapeutic strategies, highlighting the potential for innovative immunotherapeutic approaches. Advances in methodologies for modeling the TME, including computational approaches and animal-based models, provide new insights into pediatric glioma biology. Utilization of computational models may provide opportunities to predict tumor response to specific therapies and tailor immunotherapy regimes to individuals, allowing for personalized care. Leveraging the unique features of the pediatric TME offers an opportunity to overcome current barriers to immunotherapy and develop more effective, age- and tumor-specific treatment strategies.

### Adolescents and young adults with cancer: CNS tumors [^111UbBrj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tumors of CNS are common in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). As the second leading cause of cancer-related death, CNS tumors in AYAs require improved clinical management. In this review, we discussed the current diagnostic approaches and recommended management strategies for malignant tumors in adult-type (IDH-mutant gliomas) and pediatric-type gliomas (pediatric high-grade gliomas), ependymoma and medulloblastoma, which commonly occur in AYAs. The impact of advanced molecular diagnostic approaches on the understanding of tumor biology of AYA CNS tumors is emphasized. To enhance participation in clinical trials, which poses a unique challenge in AYAs with CNS tumors, we propose encouraging referrals to neuro-oncology specialty care and improving collaboration between oncologists who care for both pediatric and adult patients. This will ensure better representation of AYA patients in research studies. Finally, we discussed the importance of considering neurocognitive and psychological function in AYAs with CNS tumor.

Pediatric diffuse high-grade glioma — treatment overview notes that the main treatment paradigm includes surgery followed by systemic therapy with or without RT, with surgical goals to safely reduce tumor-associated mass effect and obtain adequate tissue for histologic and molecular classification; because cranial radiation may result in developmental impairments in young children, it is reasonable to defer or omit RT in children < 3 years, these tumors typically have a poor prognosis, and referral for cancer predisposition evaluation and/or genetic counseling should be considered.

### Adolescent and young adult glioma: systematic review of demographic, disease, and treatment influences on survival [^111uZmWN]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although this study reveals some traditional factors that appear prognostically important in AYA glioma, most, including tumor grade, pathological subtype and genetic mutations such as IDH1/2, need to be considered with care given bias from the inclusion of older adults in many studies. Interestingly, the role of cytoreductive surgery remains an important prognostic factor in AYA gliomas and may not change until effective adjuvant medical therapies emerge. As such, the current literature does not provide clinicians with an evidence-based approach to treating AYA with gliomas, particularly regarding the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Available evidence is heterogenous, of mixed quality, at high risk for confounding, and predominantly derived from older adult cohorts. Prospective studies of histopathological and molecularly-defined gliomas exposed to uniform treatment including both short- and long-term outcomes will allow the identification of optimal AYA-specific glioma management strategies.

### CNS tumors in adolescents and young adults: the need for a holistic specialized approach [^113LT51r]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

CNS tumors are one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in the 15- to 39-year-old age group. The management of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) who are diagnosed with brain tumors presents unique endocrine, developmental, and psychosocial issues. AYAs are frequently diagnosed late, after a prolonged period of misdiagnosis. The epidemiology, biology, prognosis, and overall management of these tumors differ from those of both older and younger age groups. AYAs are usually in a transitional phase in their lives, and brain tumors in this age group carry a better prognosis than in older adults; thus, special attention should be paid to survivorship care. Fertility and other treatment-related sequelae that affect the quality of life, as well as the increased risk of secondary malignancies in long-term survivors, are such examples. Although most AYAs are managed by adult or, to a lesser extent pediatric, oncologists, a multidisciplinary approach in the setting of specialized centers with increased participation in clinical trials is preferable. End-of-life and palliative care remain an unmet need for these patients, because most physicians lack the training to discuss such issues with young patients.

### Childhood brain tumors: current management, biological insights, and future directions [^112D4jQQ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children, and, unfortunately, many subtypes continue to have a suboptimal long-term outcome. During the last several years, however, remarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of these tumors have occurred as a result of high-resolution genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling, which have provided insights for improved tumor categorization and molecularly directed therapies. While tumors such as medulloblastomas have been historically grouped into standard- and high-risk categories, it is now recognized that these tumors encompass four or more molecular subsets with distinct clinical and molecular characteristics. Likewise, high-grade glioma, which for decades was considered a single high-risk entity, is now known to comprise multiple subsets of tumors that differ in terms of patient age, tumor location, and prognosis. The situation is even more complex for ependymoma, for which at least nine subsets of tumors have been described. Conversely, the majority of pilocytic astrocytomas appear to result from genetic changes that alter a single, therapeutically targetable molecular pathway. Accordingly, the present era is one in which treatment is evolving from the historical standard of radiation and conventional chemotherapy to a more nuanced approach in which these modalities are applied in a risk-adapted framework and molecularly targeted therapies are implemented to augment or, in some cases, replace conventional therapy. Herein, the authors review advances in the categorization and treatment of several of the more common pediatric brain tumors and discuss current and future directions in tumor management that hold significant promise for patients with these challenging tumors.

### "Aiming at a moving target"-the daily life experiences of adolescents and young adults with a low-grade glioma [^116GSfYV]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The third most common type of cancer among adolescents and young adults (AYAs — defined as individuals 18–39 years old at primary diagnosis) is central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Despite improvements in surgical management and better outcomes with the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy, there is no curative treatment for most patients.CNS tumors among AYA patients are distinctive and have different epidemiology (the frequency of the most common subtypes), tumor biology, and tumor location compared to pediatric or older adult patients. Low-grade gliomas (LGG) are among the most frequently occurring CNS tumors in AYA patients, and almost all grade II LGG present with an Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH1 or IDH2) mutation. This mutation causes these tumors to progress gradually into an aggressive disease; however, it is also associated with a relatively favorable impact on survival.

Treatment options for LGG are primarily based on age, histopathological diagnosis, performance status, tumor location, residual tumor, molecular profile, and the patient's preference. The primary treatment is surgical resection to safely remove as much of the tumor as possible. Patients are often stratified into risk groups, with AYA patients who undergo gross-total resection primarily identified as low-risk due to their age. Generally, low-risk patients are managed with a wait-and-scan policy after resection. For patients with residual tumors or tumor growth post-surgery, radiotherapy with chemotherapy is the mainstay of further treatment. A recent randomized phase 3 study with vorasidenib, targeting the IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, showed a prolongation of progression-free survival and time to the next intervention compared to placebo.

It is important to emphasize the relevance of pediatric LGG treatment to the wider problem of pediatric cancer. Because of the multifaceted care required to diagnose and treat LGGs, investments in improving outcomes for patients with LGGs will undoubtedly lead to enhancements in the coordination and integration of health systems, thereby benefitting the broader pediatric population. Cures should be limited only by our understanding of the biology of pediatric cancers, not by the availability of care.

### Management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma: guidelines development, value and application [^114W3SyE]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The movement to create guidelines for management of medical maladies has been gaining strength for quality, academic, financial and political purposes over the past two decades. This applies to neurological diseases, too. Evidence-based guidelines created in a multidisciplinary fashion using predetermined criteria for grading scientific data and translating this to similarly ranked recommendations is a valuable approach to meeting this goal. The following is a summary of the methods used for, and the results of, an evidence-based guideline for the management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In addition to outlining recommendations by discipline, it also addresses how concerns and conflicts were addressed in their development and provides comment on future directions in management of this situation that may improve outcome. It is important that clinicians directly experienced in patient management take the lead in creation of guidelines related to the diseases they deal with, as these clinicians are clearly the most suited to being able to arrive at a meaningful and useful product.

### Initial management of childhood brain tumors: neurosurgical considerations [^112NBp6a]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Intracranial tumors are the most common solid tumors in children. The infratentorial compartment will be the primary site for 60% to 70% of these tumors, including astrocytomas, medulloblastomas, and ependymomas. Several technological advancements have increased our knowledge of the cell biology of pediatric brain tumors, facilitated earlier diagnosis, and improved neurosurgical resections while minimizing neurological deficits. These in turn have not only improved the survival of children with brain tumors but also their quality of life. Current management strategies in most cases rely on surgery coupled with adjuvant therapies, including radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The vulnerability of the immature brain to adjuvant therapies creates many challenges for the treating physician. We review current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and outcome for children harboring the most common pediatric brain tumors: astrocytomas (low-grade and high-grade glioma), ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and craniopharyngioma. The emphasis will be on the neurosurgical management of children with these tumors.

### Brain tumors: from childhood through adolescence into adulthood [^1141RYqJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The transition from childhood to adulthood through adolescence has been clearly identified as a time of great physical, psychological, emotional, social, and sexual change. Clinical care is currently divided into adult or pediatric care; adolescent patients require specific expertise that most clinical practices do not have. When illness coincides with the adolescent transition, the health system is severely challenged. Health systems historically have varied widely in the age they choose for allocating an individual to the adult model of health care. Tumors of the CNS complicate the difficult adjustments required in adolescents and young adults by virtue of their morbidity, complex treatment, and prognosis. Some brain tumors are unique to children, some occur predominantly in adults, and others peak in adolescence. Delays in the diagnosis of brain tumors can occur at any age but are particularly common in adolescence because of difficulties of accessing health systems, the difficulties of discriminating pathologic from typical adolescent behavioral characteristics, and changing endocrine function. Coming to terms with the cancer diagnosis; coping personally, socially, and financially with cancer treatments; accepting the risk of a shortened life span; confronting acquired disability; and coping with complex rehabilitation and adjusted plans for life are challenges for which there are no established specialist health models. This article will discuss the changing brain tumor profile of children, adolescents, and adults, with a focus on our limited understanding of the adolescent/young adult transition period.

### A clinical approach to parasellar lesions in the transition age [^113reZPg]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

Many reviews have summarised the pathology and management of the parasellar region in adult patients, although an analysis of these aspects in the transition years, from puberty onset to the age of peak bone mass, has been lacking. A comprehensive search of English-language original articles, published from 2000 to 2020, was conducted in the MEDLINE database (December 2019 to March 2020). We selected all studies regarding epidemiology, diagnosis and management of the following parasellar lesions: germinoma, craniopharyngioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, optic glioma, hypothalamic hamartoma, tuber cinereum hamartoma, cranial chordoma, Rathke cleft cyst, hypophysitis and hypothalamitis during the transition age from childhood to adulthood. In the present review, we provide an overview of the principal parasellar lesions occurring in the transition age. Symptoms are usually a result of the mass effect of the lesions on nearby structures, as well as anterior pituitary deficits. Diabetes insipidus occurs frequently in these patients. In this age group, pubertal developmental disorders may be more evident compared to other stages of life. Parasellar lesions in the transition age mostly include neoplastic lesions such as germinomas, hamartomas, optic gliomas, craniopharyngiomas Langerhans cell histiocytosis and chordomas, and rarely inflammatory lesions (hypophysitis, hypothalamitis). There are limited data on the management of parasellar lesions in the transition age. Endocrine evaluation is crucial for identifying conditions that require hormonal treatment so that they can be treated early to improve the quality of life of the individual patient in this complex age range. The clinical approach to parasellar lesions involves a multidisciplinary effort.

### Pediatric high-grade glioma: current molecular landscape and therapeutic approaches [^1142qJiq]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

High-grade pediatric central nervous system glial tumors are comprised primarily of anaplastic astrocytomas (AA, WHO grade III) and glioblastomas (GBM, WHO grade IV). High-grade gliomas are most commonly diagnosed in the primary setting in children, but as in adults, they can also arise as a result of transformation of a low-grade malignancy, though with limited frequency in the pediatric population. The molecular genetics of high-grade gliomas in the pediatric population are distinct from their adult counterparts. In contrast to the adult population, high-grade gliomas in children are relatively infrequent, representing less than 20% of cases.

### Adolescent and young adult glioma: systematic review of demographic, disease, and treatment influences on survival [^113JZcKK]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Prognostic factors in adolescent and young adult (AYA) glioma are not well understood. Though clinical and molecular differences between pediatric and adult glioma have been characterized, their application to AYA populations is less clear. There is a major need to develop more robust evidence-based practices for managing AYA glioma patients.

Methods

A systematic review using PRISMA methodology was conducted using multiple databases with the objective of identifying demographic, clinical, molecular and treatment factors influencing AYA glioma outcomes.

Results

40 Studies met inclusion criteria. Overall survival was highly variable across studies depending on glioma grade, anatomic compartment and cohort characteristics. Thirty-five studies suffered from high risk of bias in at least one domain. Several studies included older adults within their cohorts; few captured purely AYA groups. Despite study heterogeneity, identified favorable prognosticators included younger age, higher functional status at diagnosis, low-grade pathology, oligodendroglioma histology and increased extent of surgical resection. Though isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant status was associated with favorable prognosis, validity of this finding within AYA was compromised though may studies including older adults. The prognostic influence of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on overall survival varied across studies with conflicting evidence.

Conclusion

Existing literature is heterogenous, at high risk of bias, and rarely focused solely on AYA patients. Many included studies did not reflect updated pathological and molecular AYA glioma classification. The optimal role of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted agents cannot be determined from existing literature and should be the focus of future studies.

### Response assessment in paediatric high-grade glioma: recommendations from the response assessment in pediatric neuro-oncology (RAPNO) working group [^113iekfU]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Response criteria for paediatric high-grade glioma vary historically and across different cooperative groups. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology working group developed response criteria for adult high-grade glioma, but these were not created to meet the unique challenges in children with the disease. The Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) working group, consisting of an international panel of paediatric and adult neuro-oncologists, clinicians, radiologists, radiation oncologists, and neurosurgeons, was established to address issues and unique challenges in assessing response in children with CNS tumours. We established a subcommittee to develop response assessment criteria for paediatric high-grade glioma. Current practice and literature were reviewed to identify major challenges in assessing the response of paediatric high-grade gliomas to various treatments. For areas in which scientific investigation was scarce, consensus was reached through an iterative process. RAPNO response assessment recommendations include the use of MRI of the brain and the spine, assessment of clinical status, and the use of corticosteroids or antiangiogenics. Imaging standards for brain and spine are defined. Compared with the recommendations for the management of adult high-grade glioma, for paediatrics there is inclusion of diffusion-weighted imaging and a higher reliance on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. Consensus recommendations and response definitions have been established and, similar to other RAPNO recommendations, prospective validation in clinical trials is warranted.

### Consensus framework for conducting phase I / II clinical trials for children, adolescents, and young adults with pediatric low-grade glioma: guidelines established by the international pediatric low-grade glioma coalition clinical trial working group [^116TK2PH]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Within the last few decades, we have witnessed tremendous advancements in the study of pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGG), leading to a much-improved understanding of their molecular underpinnings. Consequently, we have achieved successful milestones in developing and implementing targeted therapeutic agents for treating these tumors. However, the community continues to face many unknowns when it comes to the most effective clinical implementation of these novel targeted inhibitors or combinations thereof. Questions encompassing optimal dosing strategies, treatment duration, methods for assessing clinical efficacy, and the identification of predictive biomarkers remain unresolved. Here, we offer the consensus of the international pLGG coalition (iPLGGc) clinical trial working group on these important topics and comment on clinical trial design and endpoint rationale. Throughout, we seek to standardize the global approach to early clinical trials (phase I and II) for pLGG, leading to more consistently interpretable results as well as enhancing the pace of novel therapy development and encouraging an increased focus on functional endpoints as well and quality of life for children faced with this disease.

### Implications of new understandings of gliomas in children and adults with NF1: report of a consensus conference [^117Mf1kx]. Neuro-Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system tumors occurring in children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Over the past decade, discoveries of the molecular basis of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) have led to new approaches for diagnosis and treatments. However, these new understandings have not been fully applied to the management of NF1-associated gliomas. A consensus panel consisting of experts in NF1 and gliomas was convened to review the current molecular knowledge of NF1-associated low-grade "transformed" and high-grade gliomas; insights gained from mouse models of NF1-LGGs; challenges in diagnosing and treating older patients with NF1-associated gliomas; and advances in molecularly targeted treatment and potential immunologic treatment of these tumors. Next steps are recommended to advance the management and outcomes for NF1-associated gliomas.

Diffuse high-grade gliomas — multidisciplinary evaluation and primary treatment guidance emphasize team input and pathology: When a patient presents with a clinical and radiologic picture suggestive of pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas, input from a multidisciplinary team is needed for treatment planning, and the involvement of pediatric oncologists/neuro-oncologists, pediatric radiation oncologists, pathologists with expertise in neuropathology and molecular pathology, pediatric neuroradiologists, and pediatric neurosurgeons with specific expertise in the management of pediatric high-grade gliomas is strongly encouraged. Neurosurgical input is needed to determine the feasibility of maximal safe resection, a pathologic diagnosis is critical and may be difficult to accurately determine without sufficient tumor tissue obtained during biopsy, and review of the tumor tissue by an experienced neuropathologist is highly recommended. For primary treatment of pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas, the NCCN Guidelines recommend maximal safe resection.

### Summary version of the standards, options and recommendations for the management of adult patients with intracranial glioma (2002) [^115e518N]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Following the selection and critical appraisal of the articles, the working group produced a document with the proposed 'Standards', 'Options' and 'Recommendations' (SORs) for the management of adult patients with glioma, based on scientific evidence or expert agreement. The document was then peer-reviewed by independent experts, and their comments were integrated in the final version. When all the members of the working group agree, based on the best available evidence, that a procedure or intervention is beneficial, inappropriate, or harmful, it is classified as a ' Standard ', and when the majority agree, it is classified as an 'Option' (Table 1

Table 1
Definition of 'Standards, options and recommendations'). In the SORs, there can be several 'Options' for a given clinical situation. 'Recommendations' provide additional information that enable the available options to be ranked using explicit criteria (e.g. survival, toxicity) with an indication of the level of evidence. These recommendations thus help clinicians to select an appropriate option. Thus, clinicians can make choices for the management of patients using this information and taking into consideration local circumstances, skills, equipment, resources and/or patient preferences. The adaptation of the SOR to the local situation is allowable if the reason for the choice is sufficiently transparent and this is crucial for successful implementation. Inclusion of patients in clinical trials is an appropriate form of patient management in oncology and is recommended frequently within the SORs, particularly in situations where only weak evidence exists to support a procedure or an intervention.

The type of evidence underlying any 'Standard', 'Option' or ' Recommendation ' is indicated using a classification developed by the FNCLCC based on previously published methods. The level of evidence depends not only on the type and quality of the studies reviewed, but also on the concordance of the results (Table 2

Table 2
Definition of level of evidence). When no clear scientific evidence exists, judgement is made according to the professional experience and consensus of the expert group ('expert agreement' 1), and this is validated by the peer-review process.

### Molecular profiling and targeted therapy in pediatric gliomas: review and consensus recommendations [^1145SSQH]. Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

As the field of neuro-oncology makes headway in uncovering the key oncogenic drivers in pediatric glioma, the role of precision diagnostics and therapies continues to rapidly evolve with important implications for the standard of care for clinical management of these patients. Four studies at major academic centers were published in the last year outlining the clinically integrated molecular profiling and targeting of pediatric brain tumors; all 4 demonstrated the feasibility and utility of incorporating sequencing into the care of children with brain tumors, in particular for children and young adults with glioma. Based on synthesis of the data from these studies and others, we provide consensus recommendations for the integration of precision diagnostics and therapeutics into the practice of pediatric neuro-oncology. Our primary consensus recommendation is that next-generation sequencing should be routinely included in the workup of most pediatric gliomas.

### Mechanical properties of pediatric low-grade gliomas in children with and without neurofibromatosis type 1 [^113reLx8]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low grade gliomas (LGGs) are characterized by slow growth rates and relatively favorable prognosis compared to higher grade brain tumors. The mainstay of LGG therapy is surgical excision, which can be curative with total resection; patients who do not undergo a complete resection are often treated with standard chemotherapy or radiation therapy and have a 10-year progression-free survival rate of greater than 80% 3. Management techniques for adults with LGGs have improved to the point of making some LGGs low risk; however, pediatric LGGs require unique considerations.

Pediatric tumors differ in cytoarchitecture and behavior from adult tumors. Uniquely, pediatric LGGs rarely show malignant progression and rarely have IDH mutations. Despite these favorable conditions, prognoses for pediatric tumors remain suboptimal, as LGGs can demonstrate infiltrating behavior that affect critical neuroanatomical structures, and management techniques including surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation lead to tissue damage in the developing brain. Therefore, strategies for clinical management of LGGs must be weighed carefully in the pediatric brain to consider a patient's holistic health and development.

### Neuro-oncology practice clinical debate: targeted therapy vs conventional chemotherapy in pediatric low-grade glioma [^111KhGk4]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The treatment of children with low-grade glioma has evolved over the last several decades, beginning initially with focal radiotherapy, which has now been largely replaced by systemic treatment with conventional chemotherapy agents or more recently molecularly targeted therapeutics. A consensus standard of care is not well defined, leaving clinicians and parents to choose from an increasing number of options, often without complete information concerning the associated risks and benefits. Issues critical to this topic include timing of interventions (when to treat), preservation of neurological function (goals of treatment), choice of initial therapy strategy (conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy vs molecularly targeted therapy), duration of treatment (how long, and what clinical or imaging endpoints to consider), and perhaps most important, risk reduction relative to anticipated benefit. The groups from the University of California, San Francisco and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, moderated by Michael Prados, herein debate the merits of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapeutics as initial treatment strategies in pediatric low-grade glioma, a topic discussed daily in Tumor Boards across the United States and abroad. Prospective, randomized, phase 3 trials comparing the 2 strategies, conducted within homogenous disease settings, with consistently evaluated functional and imaging endpoints, are not available to guide the risks/benefit discussion. As is often the case in rare biologically diverse diseases, in a vulnerable population, therapy decisions are frequently based on incomplete data, physician experience, bias to some degree, and patient/family preference.

Box 1.

Subdivision of HGGs is based on an arbitrary histological classification system and age cutoff is not reflective of their unique disease biology, and is unhelpful for describing diffusely infiltrating gliomas of children and young adults.
Integration of genetics, epigenetics, and clinicopathological features better defines robust tumor subgroups with significant translational relevance.
While grouping patients into large cohorts reduces the number of patients needed for a clinical trial, heterogeneity in those groups limits the ability to interpret the data. Trials need to have clearly "defined" patients with the appropriate target to be eligible for a clinical trial using a treatment against that target.
Children are the healthiest dying patients but they do die of their tumors. Funders, regulatory agencies, pharma, and clinicians have to work together to develop strategies that limit unnecessary risk but also offer reasonable hope to these patients. They cannot be ignored simply because they are children and/or because their tumors are rare.

### Low grade gliomas in children [^113WP12p]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Gliomas represent the most common solid tumor of the nervous system, and can occur as both low and high-grade tumors. Current risk stratification and treatment approaches rely heavily on the morphological classification of gliomas whereby low-grade gliomas have an excellent prognosis, particularly pilocytic astrocytomas, while high-grade gliomas have a poor prognosis. The past decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in scholars' knowledge of the biology of pediatric low-grade gliomas particularly through the advent of integrated genomics and next generation sequencing. Indeed, many of these biological advances are changing treatment paradigms, particularly in low-grade gliomas, where rationale targeted therapies are currently being explored in clinical trials. In this review the authors summarize the current approach to pediatric low grade gliomas and outline the biological advances over the past 10 years, which will be driving the next generation of clinical trials.

If IDH-wt and IDH-mut AA are considered the same grade (grade III) by WHO, would you still change treatment and overall management and approach based on the IDH result?

Slightly over half of the respondents (n = 213/394, 54%) agreed that they would change patient treatment and overall management based on IDH status (Fig. 2A). One hundred and eight (27%) indicated "no" to this question, with 19% of the overall votes (n = 73/394) expressing no opinion. Respondents who self-identified as researchers showed a slightly higher rate of "yes" responses than the remainder of respondents.

(B) Responses addressing whether the treatment and overall management of GBM should be affected based on IDH mutation status (n = 392). (C) Responses to whether pediatric gliomas should be classified differently than their histologically similar adult counterparts due to their distinct molecular profile (n = 398).

If IDH-wt and IDH-mut GBM are considered the same grade (grade IV) by WHO, would you still change treatment and overall management and approach based on the IDH result?

Less than one-third of respondents (116/392, 30%) indicated that they would alter management for GBM based on the IDH result. Slightly over half of the respondents (n = 215/392, 55%) stated that they would not change treatment and overall management based on the IDH result, and the remainder (61/392, 15%) expressed no opinion (Fig. 2B). Radiation oncologists tended to respond "no" more often than the remainder of respondents.

Diffuse gliomas in the pediatric population do not show molecular findings seen in histologically similar adult counterparts. Based on these considerations, would you classify pediatric gliomas differently from histologically similar adult counterparts?

The majority of survey respondents, 77% (305/398), were in favor of classifying pediatric gliomas differently from adult gliomas according to WHO criteria, given the differences in molecular profiles (Fig. 2C).

Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. Molecular characterization in the last decade has redefined CNS tumor diagnoses and risk stratification; confirmed the unique biology of pediatric tumors as distinct entities from tumors that occur in adulthood; and led to the first novel targeted therapies receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for children with CNS tumors. There remain significant challenges to overcome: children with unresectable low-grade glioma may require multiple prolonged courses of therapy affecting quality of life; children with high-grade glioma have a dismal long-term prognosis; children with medulloblastoma may suffer significant short- and long-term morbidity from multimodal cytotoxic therapy, and approaches to improve survival in ependymoma remain elusive. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is uniquely positioned to conduct the next generation of practice-changing clinical trials through rapid prospective molecular characterization and therapy evaluation in well-defined clinical and molecular groups.

### H3K27M mutant glioma: disease definition and biological underpinnings [^111VRuTY]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

High-grade glioma (HGG) is the most common cause of cancer death in children and the most common primary central nervous system tumor in adults. While pediatric HGG was once thought to be biologically similar to the adult form of disease, research has shown these malignancies to be significantly molecularly distinct, necessitating distinct approaches to their clinical management. However, emerging data have shown shared molecular events in pediatric and adult HGG including the histone H3K27M mutation. This somatic missense mutation occurs in genes encoding one of two isoforms of the Histone H3 protein, H3F3A (H3.3), or HIST1H3B (H3.1), and is detected in up to 80% of pediatric diffuse midline gliomas and in up to 60% of adult diffuse gliomas. Importantly, the H3K27M mutation is associated with poorer overall survival and response to therapy compared to patients with H3 wild-type tumors. Here, we review the clinical features and biological underpinnings of pediatric and adult H3K27M mutant glioma, offering a groundwork for understanding current research and clinical approaches for the care of patients suffering with this challenging disease.

### Adolescent and young adult glioma: systematic review of demographic, disease, and treatment influences on survival [^112bYNVE]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

High-quality evidence on prognosticators in AYA glioma is lacking.
Literature to date is heterogenous, rarely focused only on AYA, and prone to bias/confounding.
Optimal role of chemotherapy and radiation cannot be determined.

Importance of Study

Glioma is a major contributor to oncologic morbidity and mortality in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) demographic. Historically, AYA have been poorly represented in glioma research due to limited enrollment and representation in both pediatric- and adult-focused cohorts. This systematic review synthesizes available prognostic, treatment and survival data for AYA glioma patients. We demonstrate the favorable impact of younger age and higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). This review identified a positive association with OS and EFS with low-grade histology, oligodendroglial histology, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant molecular status and extent of surgical resection, though many included studies exhibited high bias risk and included older adults. It also highlights limited consensus on the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in this population.

Gliomas represent a diverse histologic group of central nervous system tumors (CNS) with substantial molecular heterogeneity. Taken together, gliomas represent 29–35% of central nervous system tumors within the adolescent and young adult (AYA) demographic, of which two-thirds have been categorized as low-grade or World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 or 2 with the remainder either WHO grade 3 or 4. Grade alone inadequately captures the biologic and molecular complexity of these cancers, particularly among low-grade gliomas (LGG).

Studies have demonstrated distinct clinical trajectories and underlying molecular influences in pediatric vs. adult LGG. While childhood LGG have limited propensity to undergo malignant transformation, transformation occurs in the substantial majority of adult cases. These differing characteristics also result in important differences in treatment philosophy for children compared to adults. For example, adjuvant chemoradiation has shown benefits in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) among LGG that occurs in patients > 40 years and those < 40 with subtotal resection (STR). By contrast, recent combined molecular and clinical analyses have identified pediatric LGG risk-stratified subgroups that differ in the potential benefit of adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, in pediatric LGG, radiation therapy has been shown to act as an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS. There is less observed heterogeneity in the clinical trajectory and treatment of high-grade glioma (HGG) between pediatric and adult populations.

### Tackling pediatric low-grade gliomas: a global perspective [^114eQr5x]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

LGGs frequently have good outcomes, especially when substantial surgical resection can be achieved. Children can be cured through surgery in many instances as the overall survival is > 95% for children treated with gross total resection. These findings underscore the critical importance of addressing neurosurgical capacity to improve outcomes for children with LGGs. A recent study to identify gaps in pediatric neurosurgical care as it relates to pediatric neuro-oncology identified disparities in the infrastructure and services needed for pediatric neurosurgeons to provide quality care for children with CNS tumors. The pediatric oncology field has been inconsistent in its engagement of relevant stakeholders in neurosurgery, but this must change now across the world.

In the context of the transformation of the field of pediatric neuro-oncology, with the advent of molecular characterization to better classify CNS tumors, access to accurate and comprehensive diagnostics is essential. The increasing gap between high- and low-resource settings in terms of the ability to offer comprehensive molecular evaluations is worth highlighting. The publication of the 5 th edition of the WHO Classification of CNS Tumors in 2021 further aggravates the situation as precise classification of the many types of LGG now requires detailed molecular characterization, which is beyond reach for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although the implications of the new molecular insights on the management of pediatric CNS tumors are still being defined, strategies to increase the availability of quality neuropathologic evaluations can optimize patient management in all settings. Risk-adapted therapy on the basis molecular insights could lead to reduced intensity of therapy for many children with CNS tumors, ultimately leading to less long-term morbidity. To increase access to molecular platforms, novel strategies must be designed and implemented. For example, national or regional testing referral centers poised to evaluate pediatric CNS tumors could optimize available resources and increase their availability. Ultimately, the availability of molecular testing is not binary, and expanding testing capacity should be aligned with the clinical utility of molecular tests to inform therapeutic decision making.

### Approach to the patient: management of pituitary hormone replacement through transition [^113UM4xe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

However, meeting the recommended target for the best timing of transition might not always be possible. Transition was significantly delayed (> 20 years of age) in 2 of our cases. The presence of neurobehavioral disability as well as family psychosocial issues played a major role in case 3, whereas the simultaneous oncological surveillance performed at the pediatric hospital with delayed transition also by the oncology team was a contributory factor in case 2, as, again, were learning and psychological difficulties. It is not uncommon to see complex patients transferred late to adult services, probably compounded by a "resistance to change" by both the family/patient and the health care teams that they know well. For patients, it can be difficult to detach emotionally and move to the adult services. Additionally, it might be challenging to find adult services with sufficient expertise in the management of these rare conditions; many cohorts would not have survived to adulthood a few decades ago. However, although many pediatric providers and parents feel that delaying transition permits continuity of care, posttransition surveys from young adults indicate that young people felt more independent and in charge of their disease if transitioned earlier. It is also recognized that the process should be developmentally appropriate and take into account each young person's capabilities, needs and hopes for the future, as well as taking place at a time of relative stability for the young person. Access to nursing in the form of a CNS and psychological support may not be easily available when in adult care.

### [F] FET-PET in children and adolescents with central nervous system tumors: does it support difficult clinical decision-making? [^115Vi4qs]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The value of [18 F]FET-PET as an easy-to-read and robust tool in imaging for adults with gliomas has been established and has repeatedly been demonstrated over many years. Only a few studies have focused on its usefulness in and value for pediatric and adolescent patients with primary CNS tumors.

A recent prospective Danish study reported significantly increased diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact in 8% of scans when PET imaging was added to cMRI. Notably, in cases deemed clinically indicated due to difficult decision-making on cMRI alone, its impact was as high as 33%.

Our study further supports these findings. Our real-world data suggest that [18 F]FET-PET is a useful adjunct in challenging pediatric settings. In our cohort, inclusion of amino acid PET in the diagnostic algorithm impacted clinical management in two thirds of patients, either by avoiding surgery or biopsy, guiding targeted biopsy or surgery, changing further therapy management, or prompting alternative surgery. Consistent with the vast body of the literature available for adults, it reliably distinguished low-grade from high-grade glioma and unspecific changes (e.g. (late) pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis) from true tumor recurrence.

### Adolescent and young adult glioma: systematic review of demographic, disease, and treatment influences on survival [^113PhrKh]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Though HGG in pediatric and adult patients may share similarities in overall prognosis, there are important differences that exist between treatment regimens and biological considerations. At a molecular level, the profile of HGG is different with distinct copy number aberrations and driver mutations in pediatric HGG compared to adults. Furthermore, cancer predisposition syndromes are more common in pediatric populations compared to adults. The extent to which these pediatric-type alterations and predispositions exist in AYA demographics is not well known and was not clarified through this review, thus highlighting a major gap in understanding. Stupp et al showed that adults with HGG had improved OS with adjuvant temozolomide in combination with fractionated radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone. Radiotherapy typically begins 3–5 weeks following surgical resection and is typically administered at 50–60 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy fractions with limited evidence suggesting any added benefit at higher doses. For patients with MGMT methylated promoter glioblastoma, recurrent or progressive HGG, second line alkylating chemotherapeutics may be considered. By contrast, the benefit of adjuvant temozolomide in the treatment of pediatric HGG is debatable. This is highlighted by contrasting two prospective trials. Cohen et al. showed temozolomide administration during and after adjuvant radiotherapy in pediatric HGG did not improve outcomes. In contrast, Jakacki et aldemonstrated that children with maximally resected non-metastatic HGG treated with radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide followed by lomustine and temozolomide adjuvant chemotherapy experienced significantly improved outcomes. Despite the complexity in decision making surrounding HGG adjuvant therapy, our review highlights that AYA-specific data to guide clinicians is lacking.

Limitations stem from the predominance of retrospective studies included in this systematic review as well as the inclusion of older adults in many study cohorts. Despite intentions to identify and assess prognostic factors in AYA glioma, the inclusion of older adults skews the results and limits generalizability. However, stricter age-based inclusion criteria would have resulted in the exclusion of nearly all studies. Pediatric glioma mutational markers were rarely examined, precluding assessment of their prognostic value in AYA populations. Our review included all CNS gliomas, including spinal gliomas, though the latter may require different treatment approaches owing to differing biology anatomical considerations. Finally, the majority of studies were classified as at high risk of bias in at least one domain.

### Toward a transitional care from childhood and adolescence to adulthood in surgical neurooncology? A lesson from the necker-enfants malades and the sainte-anne hospitals collaboration [^116Pytxc]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Transitional care in surgical neurooncology is poorly studied. However, this period is pivotal, since it allows the patient to be empowered in his or her disease management. Here, the authors describe the experience of the Necker-Enfants Malades and the Sainte-Anne Hospital collaboration.

Methods

The mixed transitional consultations started in September 2019 in a dedicated space for transitional care, named the "La Suite" department, located in the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, Paris, France. The authors organized planned consultations to schedule the clinical and radiological follow-up in the adult neurosurgical department but also emergency consultations to manage tumor recurrence in young adult patients. Transitional care was performed jointly by pediatric and adult neurosurgeons who have developed clinical and research skills in the field of surgical neurooncology. Neuropathological analysis was performed by a neuropathologist who is specialized in pediatric and adult neurooncology.

Results

Fourteen patients benefited from a mixed transitional consultation. All of them accepted to start their management in an adult neurosurgical environment. Eleven patients (78.6%) for whom the disease was controlled benefited from a planned consultation. Three patients (21.4%) required rapid neurosurgical management for a tumor recurrence (n = 2) or for a new primary CNS tumor (n = 1) and benefited from an emergency consultation.

Conclusions

For adult patients harboring a brain tumor during childhood or adolescence, the authors suggest that neurosurgeons specialized in adult surgical neurooncology with a full knowledge in pediatric neurooncology will combine the required skills to optimize care management for these patients within a dedicated multidisciplinary organization framework.

### Racial disparities in pediatric malignant glioma management: current state of affairs in the United States [^111bpvXs]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of malignant glioma confers a poor prognosis in the pediatric population. In the adult demographic, racial disparities exist with respect to access to care and survival. Yet to date no efforts have been made to characterize racial disparities in the care of malignant pediatric gliomas. Correspondingly, the aim of this study was to understand if racial disparities exist in the setting of malignant pediatric gliomas.

Methods

All pediatric malignant gliomas patients with known race status (White, Black, Other) in the US National Cancer Database (NCDB) between the years 2005–2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data were then abstracted and analyzed by comparison and regression techniques.

Results

A total of 1803 pediatric malignant glioma cases were identified, with 48% female and a median age of 8 years old. Brainstem locations were reported in 48% of cases. Socioeconomically, there were statistically significant differences with respect to insurance status, yearly income, household education level and metropolitan residences between the racial groups (all P < 0.01). With respect to treatment, there was statistical difference in the proportion of patients treated with surgical resection (White 43% vs Black 34% vs Other 37%, P = 0.02). There were no differences between race groups for radiation therapy (P = 0.73) or chemotherapy (P = 0.12). The odds of surgical resection were significantly less in the Black group compared to the White group (OR 0.69, P < 0.01), although there was no difference in overall survival between the two groups in those treated with (P = 0.44) or without (P = 0.27) surgical resection. Primary associations of surgical resection in the Black group were brainstem location (P < 0.05) and lower yearly household income quartiles (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Racial disparities exist amongst the management of pediatric malignant gliomas, with undefined impact on survival and quality of life. In this perspective, we identified associations between Black patients and access to surgical treatment. Understanding that there are many elements to patient care, including quality of life, should encourage all clinicians and carers to consider racial disparities appropriately when managing malignant pediatric glioma patients.

Transition patients with CO-GHD — follow-up and rGH continuation: It is recommended that adults with CO-GHD caused by structural pituitary or brain tumors be followed up closely during transition as these patients tend to have lower bone mineral density, impaired bone microarchitecture, and more adverse body composition abnormalities and cardiovascular risk markers than those with AO-GHD (Grade A; BEL 1). Resuming rGH replacement therapy in patients with confirmed persistent GHD during the transition period after achievement of final height is recommended, with reported long-term improvement in body composition, bone health, quality of life, and lipid metabolism in adulthood (Grade A; BEL 1).

### Beyond childhood: exploring the state of transitional care in pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma [^111udQTq]. Neurosurgical Focus (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma (PPA) requires prolonged follow-up after initial resection. The landscape of transitional care for PPA patients is not well characterized. The authors sought to examine the clinical course and transition to adult care for these patients to better characterize opportunities for improvement in long-term care.

Methods

Pediatric patients (younger than 18 years at diagnosis) who underwent biopsy or resection for PPA between May 2000 and November 2022 at the authors' large academic center were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, recurrence, adjuvant therapies, and follow-up data were extracted from the electronic medical record via chart review. Charts of patients who were 18 years or older as of January 1, 2024, were reviewed for adult follow-up notes.

Results

The authors identified 315 patients who underwent biopsy or resection for PPA between May 2000 and November 2022. The most common tumor location was posterior fossa (59.7%), and gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 187 patients (59.4%). In patients with GTR, progression/recurrence occurred less frequently (8.6% vs 41.4%, p < 0.01) compared to patients with non-GTR. Among 177 patients found to be age-eligible for transition to adult care, the authors found that 31 (17.5%) successfully transitioned. The average age at transition from pediatric to adult care was 21.7 years, and the average age at last known adult follow-up was 25.0 years. The authors found that patients who transitioned to adult care were followed longer (12.5 vs 7.0 years, p < 0.01) and were diagnosed at an older age (12.1 vs 9.6 years, p < 0.01) than their untransitioned counterparts.

Conclusions

The authors found that there was a low rate of successful transition from pediatric to adult care for PPA; 17.5% of age-eligible patients are now cared for by adult providers, whereas an additional 18.6% completed appropriate follow-up during childhood and did not require transition to adult care. These findings underscore opportunities for improvement in the pediatric-to-adult transition process for patients with PPA, particularly for those with non-GTR who were not followed for at least 10 years, during which the risk of disease progression is thought to be highest.

### RAF and MEK inhibitor therapy in adult patients with brain tumors: a case-based overview and practical management of adverse events [^112yz3LE]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Targeted therapy has gained mainstream attention with notable successes against specific genetic mutations in many cancers. One particular mutation, the BRAF V600E mutation, is present in a small subset of gliomas in adults. Although clinical experience and trial data of RAF-targeted therapy in adults with glioma are lacking at this time, the poor prognosis of adult high-grade glioma has led neuro-oncology practitioners to consider the use of targeted therapy in these patients. In this manuscript, we describe the use of RAF and MEK inhibitors in adults with recurrent glioma. We discuss the utility of these agents, describe their toxicities, and give examples of management strategies. Given the significant toxicities of RAF and MEK inhibitors, along with the long potential duration of treatment, neuro-oncology providers should counsel patients carefully before initiating therapy and monitor them closely while undergoing treatment with RAF-targeted therapy.

### Advances in the management of low-grade gliomas [^114XwT3L]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) represent the most common childhood brain tumors and are a histologically heterogenous group of tumors. Most LGGs are surgically resectable with excellent 10-year overall survival outcomes of more than 90% with surgery alone. Tumors not amenable to surgical resection and those with an aggressive biology are more challenging to treat. Conventional radiotherapy is a more efficacious method of long-term tumor control than chemotherapy. However, radiation is associated with significant cognitive, endocrine, and cerebrovascular late effects, making chemotherapy an often-preferred modality over radiotherapy, especially in younger children. Multiple chemotherapy regimens have been evaluated over the past few decades with comparable survival outcomes and differing toxicity profiles. Newer regimens containing antiangiogenic agents also show promise. Recent molecular studies have implicated the BRAF oncogene, a key regulator of the MAPK pathway, and the AKT/mTOR pathway in pediatric LGG tumorigenesis. This has opened up promising new avenues for targeted therapy, with many agents currently under investigation.

### C-methionine PET for identification of pediatric high-grade glioma recurrence [^1138FZf5]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

It has only recently been discovered that pediatric high-grade gliomas (PHGGs) are biologically distinct from adult high-grade gliomas. However, this new knowledge has not yet changed diagnoses, classifications, World Health Organization grading, or treatment of PHGGs. PHGGs in children older than 3 y are treated with a combination of maximal safe surgical resection, radiation therapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, and subsequent continued chemotherapy, similar to the treatment regimen for adult high-grade gliomas. Despite this aggressive therapy, outcomes in young children are dismal, with a local 1-y failure-free survival rate of 60%, suggesting that recurrence is common. Accurate diagnosis of tumor recurrence is important because the median overall survival (OS) of recurrent PHGGs is 4–7 mo and because treatment of pseudoprogression is different from that of tumor recurrence. However, the diagnosis of recurrence is not always straightforward with MRI, which is the clinical standard-of-care test for assessing response to treatment. Indeed, treatment-related effects, including pseudoprogression, frequently mimic tumor recurrence, thereby leading to misdiagnosis and incorrect management.

### A comparative analysis of IDH-mutant glioma in pediatric, young adult, and older adult patients [^115hhtfs]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The frequency and significance of IDH mutations in glioma across age groups are incompletely understood. We performed a multi-center retrospective age-stratified comparison of patients with IDH-mutant gliomas to identify age-specific differences in clinico-genomic features, treatments, and outcomes.

Methods

Clinical, histologic, and sequencing data from patients with IDH-mutant, grades 2–4 gliomas, were collected from collaborating institutions between 2013 and 2019. Patients were categorized as pediatric (< 19 years), young adult (YA; 19–39 years), or older adult (≥ 40 years). Clinical presentation, treatment, histologic, and molecular features were compared across age categories using Fisher's exact test or analysis-of-variance. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to determine the association of age and other covariates with overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

Results

We identified a cohort of 379 patients (204 YA) with IDH-mutant glioma with clinical data. There were 155 (41%) oligodendrogliomas and 224 (59%) astrocytomas. YA showed significantly shorter PFS and shorter median time-to-malignant transformation (MT) compared to pediatric and adult groups, but no significant OS difference. Adjusting for pathology type, extent of resection, and upfront therapy in multivariable analysis, the YA group was independently prognostic of shorter PFS than pediatric and adult groups. Among astrocytomas, CDK4/6 copy number amplifications were associated with both shorter PFS and shorter OS. Among oligodendrogliomas, PIK3CA and CDKN2A/2B alterations were associated with shorter OS.

Conclusions

IDH-mutant glioma YA patients had significantly shorter PFS and time to MT but did not differ in OS compared to pediatric and adult groups. Treatment approaches varied significantly by patient age and warrant further study as addressable age-associated outcome drivers.

### Facilitating transitions to adulthood in pediatric brain tumor patients: the role of neuropsychology [^113etMig]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Transition-age patients with history of a pediatric brain tumor are at significant risk for difficulties transitioning to adulthood. We review current transition models and the potential role of neuropsychology in the transition process for adolescent and young adult brain tumor survivors.

Recent Findings

Several recently developed healthcare transition models include consideration of patients' cognitive and functional capacities, yet currently available transition readiness tools are limited in scope and do not possess adequate normative data across pediatric medical populations. We explore the potential utility and added benefit of systematically incorporating neuropsychology in the transition process for pediatric brain tumor survivors. The literature supports increased evaluation and intervention targeted at psychosocial barriers to transition. Based on these findings, we propose a family-centered and multidisciplinary care model that promotes both medical and broader psychosocial transition processes. Neuropsychology is ideally suited to assess the wide-ranging areas encompassed in transition readiness and to facilitate the transition process.

### Brain tumors across the age spectrum: biology, therapy, and late effects [^1162sZsP]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical difference between brain tumors in adults and children is striking. Compared with adults, pediatric tumor types (mostly glial and neuronal) are more sensitive to adjuvant irradiation and chemotherapy. Pediatric tumors more often require craniospinal irradiation based on their propensity to disseminate within the neuraxis. The spectrum of side effects is broader in the child based on age and extent of treatment: radiation therapy brings increased risk of severe long-term sequelae affecting neurologic, endocrine, and cognitive function. In this review of glioma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma, we highlight the differences between adults and children, including the higher incidence of spinal cord ependymoma and supratentorial high-grade glioma in the adult and a higher incidence of medulloblastoma in the child. With the exception of completely resected low-grade glioma, radiation therapy remains a standard of care for most patients. In some settings, the radiation oncologist should suggest further surgery or additional adjuvant therapy in an effort to optimize local tumor control. An effort is underway to better characterize adult and pediatric brain tumors biologically with an emphasis on improving our understanding of tumor genesis, malignant transformation, and some of the similarities and differences between tumor types and their response to conventional therapy.

### Childhood astrocytomas and other gliomas treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^1175kekS]. NCI (2009). Low credibility.

1, 2] Within these tumor types, various subtypes are recognized, and histological grading ranging from grade 1 to grade 4 is applied to some. Most children with circumscribed astrocytic gliomas, pediatric-type diffuse low-grade gliomas, and glioneuronal and neuronal tumors have a relatively favorable prognosis, especially when a complete surgical resection can be accomplished. Children with pediatric-type diffuse high-grade gliomas generally have a poor prognosis. For information about ependymal tumors, see Childhood Ependymoma Treatment. 19] For most of these tumors, existing conventional and molecular targeted therapies have limited efficacy. A rare subset of pediatric high-grade gliomas arising in patients with inheritable biallelic mismatch repair deficiency is characterized by an extraordinarily high mutational burden.

Correctly identifying these patients at the time of diagnosis is critical because of intrinsic resistance to temozolomide and responsiveness to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. ;. Patients with H3F3A variants are at high risk of treatment failure, but the prognosis is not as poor as that of patients with histone 3. 1 or
3. 3 K27M variants. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation is observed in approximately two-thirds of cases, and aside from the IDH1-altered subtype, the H3. 3 G34 subtype is the only pediatric high-grade glioma subtype that demonstrates MGMT methylation rates exceeding 20%. A retrospective multi-institutional review of pediatric patients with IDH-altered gliomas and available outcome data reported a 5-year PFS rate of 44% and a 5-year OS rate of 92%. Approximately 25% of the gliomas in the cohort were classified as high grade. There was no difference in 5-year PFS rates observed between tumor grades. However, patients with high-grade tumors had a worse 5-year OS rate of 75%.

### Adolescents and young adults with cancer: CNS tumors… [^112sBfHE]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Observation can be considered in IDH-mutant gliomas of WHO grade 2 if a gross total resection is achieved. This is performed with the intention of delaying the radiation therapy and minimizing its potential long-term impact on cognitive functions in the AYA population. However, early treatment is recommended to improve clinical outcomes in patients with residue disease and neurologic symptoms. A clinical study has demonstrated that early radiation after the surgery improved progression-free survival. 23Recommendation for management of high-grade astrocytoma is supported by the results of a phase III clinical trial in 1p/19q non–codeleted glioma study, In this study, 87% of randomly assigned patients had the information regarding IDHmutation status. Overall, adjuvant temozolomide after radiation is recommended for patients with astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, WHO grade 3.
24.

This highlights the importance of germline testing in this specific patient population as it may lead to a different therapeutic approach. 25, 27Identifying germline mutations may lead to genetic counseling and further help for their young families. Tissue diagnosis is highly recommended in all clinically suspected pHGGs in AYAs. Recognizing the challenging tumor locations for the surgical procedure in this group of disease, referring AYA patients to highly specialized neurosurgeons at high-volume brain tumor centers is recommended. Radiation therapy is usually offered after the surgery. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ are the main treatment for hemispheric H3 G34R-mutant HGGs. 42Depending on the amount of tumor DNA available, both next-generation sequencing and methylation profiling are recommended. Germline testing is also strongly recommended for all patients, but particularly in patients who are diagnosed with WNT or SHH medulloblastoma.

All patients who undergo germline testing should be offered genetic counseling. 43 Recommended Management. 2and/or metastatic disease) are recommended 36 Gy CSI with a RT boost to the primary tumor bed delivering a total dose of 54 Gy. Addition of once a week vincristine is not recommended as it does not affect outcome and adds significant morbidity. 45 After completion of RT, patients are recommended to take a 6-week break before starting adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of standard regimens used in pediatric protocols is strongly recommended.

### Pediatric gliomas: current concepts on diagnosis, biology, and clinical management… [^115BV8m2]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract Gliomas are the most common CNS tumors in children and adolescents, and they show an extremely broad range of clinical behavior. The majority of pediatric gliomas present as benign, slow-growing lesions classified as grade I or II by the WHO classification of CNS tumors. These pediatric low-grade gliomas are fundamentally different from. IDH-mutant LGGs occurring in adults, because they rarely undergo malignant transformation and show excellent overall survival under current treatment strategies. However, a significant fraction of gliomas develop over a short period of time and progress rapidly and are therefore classified as WHO grade III or IV high-grade gliomas. Despite all therapeutic efforts, they remain largely incurable, with the most aggressive forms being lethal within months.

Thus, the intentions of neurosurgeons, pediatric oncologists, and radiotherapists to improve care for pediatric patients with glioma range from increasing quality of life and preventing long-term sequelae in what is often a chronic, but rarely life-threatening disease, to uncovering effective treatment options to prolong patient survival in an almost universally fatal setting. The last decade has seen unprecedented progress in understanding the molecular biology underlying pediatric gliomas, fueling hopes to achieve both goals. Large-scale collaborative studies around the globe have cataloged genomic and epigenomic alterations in gliomas across ages, grades, and histologies. These studies have revealed biologic subgroups characterized by distinct molecular, pathologic, and clinical features, with clear relevance for patient management.

In this review, we summarize hallmark discoveries that have expanded our knowledge in pediatric LGGs and HGGs, explain their role in tumor biology, and convey our current concepts on how these findings may be translated into novel therapeutic approaches.
