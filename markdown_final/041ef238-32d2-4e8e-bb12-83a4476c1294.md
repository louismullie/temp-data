## Question

A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of a lump on her neck and a 1-week history of hoarseness. Examination shows a 3-cm, firm, non-tender nodule on the anterior neck. Further evaluation confirms a thyroid malignancy, and she undergoes thyroidectomy. Histopathologic examination of the surgical specimen shows lymphatic invasion. Genetic analysis shows an activating mutation in the RET/PTC genes. Microscopic examination of the surgical specimen is most likely to also show which of the following?
A. Sheets of polygonal cells surrounding amyloid deposition
B. Calcified spherules and large oval cells with empty-appearing nuclei
C. Cuboidal cells arranged spherically around colloid lakes
D. Hyperplastic epithelium with colloid scalloping

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which histopathologic feature is most likely to be seen in a thyroid malignancy with lymphatic invasion and a RET/PTC fusion, and to choose the best option among four alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what RET/PTC fusions define and how they correlate with histology. Then, I should verify the classic microscopic features of papillary thyroid carcinoma, especially nuclear changes and psammoma bodies. Next, I will examine each answer choice and map it to the expected entities. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting data about aggressiveness and confirm the single best fit with the provided clinical context.

> Let me first confirm the molecular–histologic correlation. RET/PTC rearrangements are prototypical drivers of papillary thyroid carcinoma and are enriched in certain aggressive PTC variants, including the diffuse sclerosing variant, which often shows numerous psammoma bodies and extensive lymphovascular invasion. This aligns with the reported lymphatic invasion in the vignette and supports expecting psammoma bodies on microscopy [^112cKN73] [^114dR8fN] [^113CK4ED].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic hallmarks of classic PTC so I don't over-attribute to psammoma bodies alone. Classic PTC is defined by nuclear features such as enlargement, oval shape, overlapping, clearing, irregular contours with grooves, and occasional pseudoinclusions, and these nuclear changes are expected regardless of architectural variant; psammoma bodies are supportive but not universal, so I should anchor on the nuclear phenotype while using psammoma bodies as a strong clue in RET-driven tumors [^1161uPVX] [^115xzK4q].

> Now, I will examine Option A, "sheets of polygonal cells surrounding amyloid deposition". Hold on, I should verify what this represents. Amyloid deposition with polygonal epithelial cells is characteristic of medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is a C-cell neuroendocrine tumor and not a follicular-cell PTC; RET/PTC fusions are not the defining driver of MTC, so this does not fit the molecular context of the case [^117QZUCe] [^1115ypxz].

> Next, Option B, "calcified spherules and large oval cells with empty-appearing nuclei". Let me think about this carefully. Calcified spherules correspond to psammoma bodies, which are well described in RET/PTC–positive PTC, particularly in diffuse sclerosing variants, and "empty-appearing nuclei" reflects the optically clear, ground-glass nuclear chromatin with peripheral chromatin margination that is classic for PTC. This combination matches both the molecular driver and the reported lymphatic invasion in the vignette [^112cKN73] [^113CK4ED] [^1161uPVX].

> I will now examine Option C, "cuboidal cells arranged spherically around colloid lakes". Hmm, wait a minute, this sounds like normal thyroid follicles rather than malignancy. PTC shows papillary architecture and characteristic nuclear atypia rather than simple cuboidal follicular cells around colloid, so this pattern would argue against carcinoma and does not reflect PTC morphology [^1161uPVX].

> Let me consider Option D, "hyperplastic epithelium with colloid scalloping". I should double-check what this implies. Colloid scalloping and hyperplastic epithelium are features of nodular hyperplasia or goiter, not papillary carcinoma; this benign pattern lacks the nuclear features and invasive behavior described in the case, so it is inconsistent with a confirmed thyroid malignancy with lymphatic invasion [^notfound].

> But wait, what if RET/PTC tumors are generally indolent — does that undermine choosing psammoma bodies here? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. While some series describe RET/PTC PTCs as indolent, multiple cohorts show RET fusion–positive PTCs can be more aggressive, with higher rates of extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, nodal and distant metastases, and frequent psammoma bodies; in fact, diffuse sclerosing PTC, which is enriched for RET/PTC, classically shows numerous psammoma bodies and lymphovascular invasion, which reconciles the apparent discrepancy and supports Option B in this clinical context [^116rcySh] [^115BnKLd] [^112cKN73] [^113CK4ED].

> Putting this together, the most likely additional microscopic finding in a RET/PTC–driven thyroid malignancy with lymphatic invasion is psammoma bodies with the classic PTC nuclear features, which corresponds to Option B. The other options either represent medullary thyroid carcinoma or benign thyroid conditions and do not match the molecular and morphologic profile of this case [^1161uPVX] [^112cKN73].

---

The correct answer is **B. Calcified spherules and large oval cells with empty-appearing nuclei**. This pattern reflects **psammoma bodies** and the classic nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), which is strongly associated with RET/PTC rearrangements and lymphatic invasion [^1161uPVX] [^112NbGg9] [^112cKN73]. The other options are incorrect: A shows medullary thyroid carcinoma with amyloid, C shows follicular adenoma, and D shows hyperplastic nodules.

## Histopathological features of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)

PTC is defined by **distinct nuclear features** and architectural patterns, including:

- **Nuclear features**: Enlarged, oval, overlapping nuclei with clearing (ground-glass appearance), irregular contours, nuclear grooves, and occasional pseudoinclusions [^1161uPVX].

- **Architectural patterns**: Papillary structures, follicular variants, and solid variants.

- **Psammoma bodies**: Calcified spherules (psammoma bodies) are a hallmark of PTC, particularly in classical and diffuse sclerosing variants [^112cKN73].

- **Lymphatic invasion**: Commonly observed in PTC, especially in aggressive variants and those with RET/PTC rearrangements [^112NbGg9].

---

## Molecular association: RET/PTC rearrangements

RET/PTC rearrangements are **genetic alterations** involving the RET proto-oncogene, resulting in constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway [^1156rCRU]. These rearrangements are present in approximately 10–20% of PTC cases, particularly in younger patients and those with a history of radiation exposure [^112CMACn] [^112NbGg9]. RET/PTC rearrangements are associated with aggressive clinicopathological features, including lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, and extrathyroidal extension [^112NbGg9] [^114F9XGc].

---

## Histopathological features associated with RET/PTC rearrangements

Tumors with RET/PTC rearrangements often exhibit **specific histopathological features**, including:

- **Psammoma bodies**: Calcified spherules frequently observed in RET/PTC-positive PTC, particularly in diffuse sclerosing variants [^114dR8fN].

- **Nuclear features**: Large oval cells with empty-appearing nuclei (ground-glass appearance), nuclear grooves, and pseudoinclusions [^1161uPVX].

- **Lymphatic invasion**: Commonly observed in RET/PTC-positive PTC, correlating with increased metastatic potential [^112NbGg9].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Histopathological feature** | **Associated thyroid malignancy** | **Relevance to ret/ptc** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Sheets of polygonal cells surrounding amyloid deposition | Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) | Incorrect. MTC is a C-cell-derived malignancy characterized by amyloid deposition and calcitonin expression, not associated with RET/PTC rearrangements [^117QZUCe]. |
| B | Calcified spherules and large oval cells with empty-appearing nuclei | Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) | Correct. Psammoma bodies and nuclear clearing are classic features of PTC, strongly associated with RET/PTC rearrangements and lymphatic invasion [^1161uPVX] [^112NbGg9]. |
| C | Cuboidal cells arranged spherically around colloid lakes | Follicular adenoma | Incorrect. Follicular adenomas are benign lesions characterized by follicular architecture without papillary nuclear features or lymphatic invasion [^1175mEC7]. |
| D | Hyperplastic epithelium with colloid scalloping | Hyperplastic nodule | Incorrect. Hyperplastic nodules are benign lesions characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and colloid scalloping, without malignant features [^notfound]. |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B. Calcified spherules and large oval cells with empty-appearing nuclei**. These features are characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinoma, particularly in tumors with RET/PTC rearrangements and lymphatic invasion [^1161uPVX] [^112NbGg9]. The other options are incorrect because they describe features of medullary thyroid carcinoma, follicular adenoma, or hyperplastic nodules, which are not associated with RET/PTC rearrangements or lymphatic invasion [^116rcySh] [^111oxKWY].

### Senescent tumor cells lead the collective invasion in thyroid cancer [^114EoEpR]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

PTC is a well-differentiated malignancy, mostly presenting an indolent clinical behaviour and a good prognosis. However, PTCs are frequently associated with lymph nodes metastasis. Regional lymph node metastases are identified in 30 to 50% of PTC cases at the time of initial diagnosis. In our series of BRAFV600E-expressing PTC, lymph node metastasis was detected in 48 of 79 cases (61%) (Supplementary Table 5). Although BRAFV600E mutation is one of the prognostic markers related to lymph node metastasis in PTC, mechanisms related to frequent lymph node metastasis in BRAFV600E-expressing PTC has not yet been clearly explained. Here, we found neoplastic senescent cells in metastatic foci of regional lymph nodes. This finding raised a question of whether senescent cells in metastatic foci were from the primary tumour together with cancer cells in the manner of collective invasion, or cancer cells metastasized from the primary lesion and then became senescent cells after arrival at the metastatic site in lymph nodes. To answer this question, we examined lymphatic channels, the middle part of metastasis, in PTC tissues and micrometastatic foci in the lymph nodes. SA-β-Gal and p16 INK4A immunopositive neoplastic senescent cells were detected in tumour emboli, as well as micrometastatic foci (Supplementary Fig. 17). Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of the latter hypothesis, these data supported that senescent tumour cells might move from the primary tumour mass to regional lymph nodes via lymphovascular circulation together with non-senescent tumour cells.

Comparison of clinicopathological features between PTCs positive for RET fusions and individual groups of PTCs with NTRK fusions, BRAF V600E and RAS mutations was performed (Table 4). Only patients with available clinicopathological data were included. Patients with RET fusion-positive PTCs were significantly younger than patients with BRAF V600E and RAS -mutated carcinomas (P < 0.001) and had significantly larger tumor than patients with the BRAF V600E-mutated carcinomas (P < 0.001). In RET fusion-positive PTCs, features associated with higher tumor aggressiveness were detected more often than in PTCs positive for other mutations. LNM and DM were significantly more frequent in patients with RET fusions than in patients with other mutations. Multifocality, extrathyroidal extension, and intravascular invasion were significantly more common in RET fusion-positive PTCs than in BRAF V600E and RAS -mutated PTCs.

Thyroid carcinoma — extent of thyroid surgery and active surveillance notes that lobectomy is preferred for patients with lower risk papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), while total thyroidectomy is a category 2B option. Lobectomy plus isthmusectomy is recommended for patients who cannot (or refuse to) take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the remainder of their lives. Most guidelines (eg, NCCN, ATA) do not recommend active surveillance for patients with PTC; however, for PTC ≤ 1 cm without concerning lymph node involvement or risk features such as posterior location, abutting the trachea, or apparent invasion, surgery may not be warranted and active surveillance with ultrasound may be sufficient.

### Genetic aspects of familial thyroid cancer [^1137aipx]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

Familial thyroid cancer is rare, accounting for < 10% of thyroid cancer cases. Activating germline point mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A, 2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC)-around 3% of thyroid cancer cases. Familial papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) have been identified as a distinct group of familial thyroid cancers. Sporadic nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) accounts for approximately 90% of all thyroid cancers-about 6% of NMTCs are familial (FNMTC). Although multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B and FMTC are well characterized, very little is known about the genetic predisposition to PTC and FTC. In this paper, the genetic types of FMTC and FNMTC are reviewed and the clinical features and screening are outlined.

ATA thyroid nodule/differentiated thyroid cancer — histopathologic evaluation and reporting (Recommendation 46): In addition to the basic tumor features required for AJCC/UICC thyroid cancer staging including status of resection margins, pathology reports should contain additional information for risk assessment, such as the presence of vascular invasion and the number of invaded vessels, number of lymph nodes examined and involved with tumor, size of the largest metastatic focus to the lymph node, and presence or absence of extranodal extension of the metastatic tumor (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). Histopathologic variants of thyroid carcinoma associated with more unfavorable outcomes (e.g., tall cell, columnar cell, and hobnail variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma [PTC]; widely invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma [FTC]; poorly differentiated carcinoma) or more favorable outcomes (e.g., encapsulated follicular variant of PTC without invasion, minimally invasive FTC) should be identified during histopathologic examination and reported (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Histopathologic variants associated with familial syndromes (cribriform-morular variant of papillary carcinoma often associated with FAP, follicular or papillary carcinoma associated with PTEN-hamartoma tumor syndrome) should be identified during histopathologic examination and reported (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Abstract… [^117RvdKA]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common in the general population, especially in women. 1 Nonpalpable nodules are often found when patients undergo diagnostic imaging such as ultrasonography and computed tomography of the chest and neck. For these incidentalomas, current guidelines recommend the same diagnostic strategy that is recommended for palpable nodules. 2 Although the risk of malignancy in any given nodule is small, thyroid cancer must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Family physicians should understand the rationale for the evaluation of nodules and be able to perform an evidence-based assessment. 3 However, they are found incidentally in up to 40% of patients who undergo ultrasonography of the neck, 4 and in 36% to 50% of persons at autopsy. 3 Some studies estimate that 20% to 76% of the population has at least one thyroid nodule. Thyroid cancer represents 1% of all malignancies. 10 The rate of malignancy is 1.

5% to 17% in nodules detected on imaging performed for non–thyroid-related reasons. 4 However, the true rate of malignancy is unknown, because many nodules are small enough to escape detection, and because many malignancies in small nodules appear to have a benign course and do not cause clinically evident disease. 6, 7 Factors associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer include history of radiation to the head or neck, especially in childhood. 3 The rate of malignancy for a palpable nodule in a previously irradiated thyroid is 20% to 50%. 11 Nodules in persons younger than 20 years or older than 70 years have an increased risk of malignancy. Presentation Thyroid nodules are often noticed by patients as a lump or protrusion in the lower anterior neck. Large nodules can cause compressive symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing or a choking sensation. Nodules may be single or multiple, hard or soft, and tender or nontender.

Nodules may also be found by physicians on routine examination. Clinical examination of the thyroid is difficult in persons with large necks. Nodules 1 cm or smaller are rarely detected by palpation. In the past, nuclear thyroid scintigraphy was often performed to evaluate all thyroid nodules. However, nonfunctioning nodules have only a 14% to 22% chance of being malignant. If the pathology is malignant or suspicious, surgery to remove the affected thyroid lobe or lobes is recommended.

### A comprehensive overview of the role of the RET proto-oncogene in thyroid carcinoma [^1115ypxz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene was identified in 1985 and, very soon thereafter, a rearrangement named RET/PTC was discovered in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). After this discovery, other RET rearrangements were found in PTCs, particularly in those induced by radiation. For many years, it was thought that these genetic alterations only occurred in PTC, but, in the past couple of years, some RET/PTC rearrangements have been found in other human tumours. 5 years after the discovery of RET/PTC rearrangements in PTC, activating point mutations in the RET proto-oncogene were discovered in both hereditary and sporadic forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast to the alterations found in PTC, the activation of RET in MTC is mainly due to activating point mutations. Interestingly, in the past year, RET rearrangements that were different to those described in PTC were observed in sporadic MTC. The identification of RET mutations is relevant to the early diagnosis of hereditary MTC and the prognosis of sporadic MTC. The diagnostic and prognostic role of the RET/PTC rearrangements in PTC is less relevant but still important in patient management, particularly for deciding if a targeted therapy should be initiated. In this Review, we discuss the pathogenic, diagnostic and prognostic roles of the RET proto-oncogene in both PTC and MTC.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1115a9Pm]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) — key clinical and molecular features that justify pediatric-specific guidance include a higher malignancy risk for nodules in children than adults (22%–26% versus 5%–10% in most series), adult papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) commonly harboring BRAF mutations (36%–83% of cases) that are rare in children, and RET/PTC rearrangements being more common in pediatric PTC and not leading to genomic instability; additionally, in a small pediatric series, distant metastases and recurrence occurred only with undetectable sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) and the activity of 131 I required to achieve remission was greater in those cancers, and these molecular differences may influence the utility of molecular testing for diagnosis in children.

### Molecular landscape and therapeutic strategies in pediatric differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^111oxKWY]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Oncogenes that are associated with a low risk for invasive behavior include RAS, DICER1, PTEN, and PAX8 :: PPARG rearrangements. On ultrasound, the lesions are typically unifocal, solid, isoechoic/hypoechoic in echogenicity, with smooth margins and without punctate echogenic foci or regional lymphadenopathy. FNA is most commonly indeterminate, either a TBSRTC category III atypia of undetermined significance or IV follicular neoplasm. These tumors are of follicular pattern, which could be benign (lack of capsular or vascular invasion) such as follicular adenoma and noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features, or malignant such as IEFVPTC and minimally invasive or encapsulated angioinvasive FTC. Histopathologic findings show encapsulation and lack of lymphatic invasion. A small percent of tumors will have capsular angioinvasion or high-grade features. Regional lymph node and distant metastasis are uncommon. Thyroid lobectomy is usually adequate to achieve remission. However, for lesions with high-grade histologic findings (solid, trabecular, or insular growth pattern, mitotic index ≥ 3 per 10 high-power fields, necrosis, convoluted nuclei) or vascular invasion (> 2 vessels) completion thyroidectomy should be considered. Germline mutational analysis should also be performed in individuals with lesions harboring somatic mutations in DICER1 and PTEN based on family history of cancer predisposition as well as physical findings, including macrocephaly in both DICER1 syndrome and PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome.

Oncogenes Associated With Intermediate Risk for Invasive Behavior

Case 3

A 15-year-old previously healthy female was found to have left neck swelling during routine physical examination. Thyroid ultrasound demonstrated a 3.5 cm solid, hypoechoic nodule, wider than tall, with an irregular margin, no extrathyroidal extension, but with multiple punctate echogenic foci. Several enlarged, round hypoechoic cervical lymph node with peripheral blood flow were identified on preoperative ultrasound in left level 6 (central neck, below the thyroid). FNA of the thyroid nodule was compatible with a TBSRTC category VI malignant lesion. The patient proceeded to thyroidectomy with ipsilateral central neck dissection. Molecular testing revealed a BRAF V600E mutation. Pathology demonstrated a 3.4 cm C-PTC without extrathyroidal extension but with lymphatic invasion. Tumor was present in 8/22 central lymph node. AJCC TNM staging was pT2N1aM0. The lesion was of ATA intermediate risk; the patient received RAI, with excellent response (Fig. 10).

### The adult neck mass… [^115WEk1y]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Computed tomographic scanning can usually demonstrate cystic masses medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the hyoid bone in the neck. Treatment is complete surgical excision, with preparation and examination of frozen sections to exclude malignancy. Fine-needle aspiration and biopsy should be performed before excision because of the possibility of cystic metastases from squamous cell carcinoma within Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. 4 Other congenital anomalies of the lateral neck include cystic hygromas and dermoids. Central Neck The thyroglossal duct cyst is the most common congenital anomaly of the central portion of the neck. This anomaly is caused by a tract of thyroid tissue along the pathway of embryologic migration of the thyroid gland from the base of the tongue to the neck. The thyroglossal duct cyst is intimately related to the central portion of the hyoid bone and usually elevates along with the larynx during swallowing.

It may contain the patient's only thyroid tissue. 5 Thyroid carcinoma has been reported within thyroglossal duct cysts. With regard to thyroglossal duct cysts, the extent of preoperative assessment is controversial and ranges from physical examination to serologic testing and diagnostic imaging. 6, 7 If serum thyroid function test results are abnormal, thyroid scanning should be performed to determine the amount of thyroid tissue in the neck. Some investigators advocate routine ultrasonography or nuclear scanning to avoid permanent hypothyroidism. As with branchial cysts, a history of infection, spontaneous discharge, and previous incision and drainage is not uncommon. The treatment of choice is the Sistrunk procedure, which involves complete excision of the thyroglossal duct cyst, including the central portion of the hyoid bone. If necessary, excision extends to the base of the tongue. Other congenital midline neck masses include thymic rests and dermoids.

INFLAMMATORY AND INFECTIOUS CONDITIONS. Thyroid and salivary gland nodules should undergo fine-needle aspiration and biopsy. This diagnostic procedure should also be performed when a neck mass persists beyond four to six weeks. In experienced hands, the sensitivity and specificity of fine-needle aspiration and biopsy exceed 90 percent. 33 Local recurrences have been reported following stereotactic core-needle biopsy of solid tumors, including breast, liver, colon, pancreas, and lung cancers.

### The variable phenotype and low-risk nature of RAS-positive thyroid nodules [^113RTN5z]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last two decades, the discovery of molecular pathways critical to oncogenic transformation has dramatically altered our understanding of thyroid malignancy. Reports initially suggested that nearly 70% of thyroid cancers harbor single gene mutations in the BRAF or RAS pathways, or balanced translocations of RET/PTC, or PAX8/PPARγ. More recently, reports confirm an oncogenic mutation in 97% of well-differentiated papillary carcinomas. Such mutations can increasingly be identified in both preoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology specimens and on post-operative histopathology. Many believe that the synergistic use of microscopic and molecular analysis is destined to improve the clinical management of this illness.

Mutations or translocations identified in most thyroid carcinomas are known to activate pathways regulating cellular growth, development, and/or malignant transformation, which has led to the assumption that thyroid nodules harboring such mutations are either cancerous, or at high risk for eventual malignant transformation. However, observational data question this assumption as absolute and suggest that all such pathways or activating mutations may not prove equally oncogenic or may require secondary molecular 'hits' before behaving in a malignant fashion. In particular, clinical outcomes of patients with mutations in the N-, K-, or H- isoforms of the RAS gene are highly variable. In contrast to homogeneous BRAF V600E mutations which strongly associate with higher-risk papillary carcinoma, initial observations suggest RAS mutations associate with variable histology, ranging from benign disease, to low-risk malignancy, to anaplastic carcinoma.

However, few prospective blinded assessments of RAS -positive thyroid nodules (treated or untreated) have been performed. Such an assessment is critically important, as diagnostic testing for these mutations is now widely available. To many clinicians, identification of an activating RAS mutation may prompt a belief that malignancy has been identified. This leads to downstream clinical recommendations usually favoring surgical resection. Such treatment is highly beneficial in many scenarios, but for those with benign disease, has subjected the patient to unnecessary cost, operative morbidity, and significant risk. Past experience involving papillary microcarcinoma provides a cautionary parallel supporting the importance of further study of RAS -positive thyroid nodules. For decades, widespread belief that all papillary carcinoma posed danger prompted recommendations for active removal of such thyroid nodules. This was true even when nodules were smaller than 1 cm and ultrasound confirmed the absence of abnormal adenopathy. Prospective data debunked this belief, confirming the indolent nature of these papillary microcarcinomas. Expert guidelines now recommend against evaluation of most nodules < 1 cm, and/or surgical treatment of sub-centimeter papillary carcinomas.

### Hallmarks of RET and Co-occuring genomic alterations in-aberrant cancers [^113vadrQ]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous efforts have analyzed over 30,000 cell-free DNA (cfDNA) patient samples and reported that activating RET alterations occur in 0.5% of cancer patients. Other efforts looking at over 4,000 samples, found that RET aberrations were present in 1.8% of diverse cancers. Roughly 43% to 71% of sporadic MTCs harboring mutations in RET have been previously targeted with multikinase inhibitors. Additionally, 20% of sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas harbor RET alterations. Fusions in RET are found in NSCLC at a rate of roughly 1% to 2%. These efforts have led to the development of specific RET inhibitors, which have yielded meaningful clinical benefit for patients with advanced cancers. Large-scale analysis of nearly 100,000 patient-tumor samples in this study has shown that there may be utility in studying the effects of these and other RET inhibitors in patients with advanced cancers. This analysis also revealed genes that may be found to be co-altered in RET-aberrant cancers, which may lend itself potentially to combination treatment strategy approaches.

Results

Clinicopathologic characteristics of the included patients

Among 108 patients, most patients were young and female, which PTC was the main histologic type among. Seventy-eight patients confirmed lymph node metastasis in postoperative pathologic examination. Most of the patients were confirmed to be early-stage tumors finally (Table 1).

Genetic variation landscape of thyroid disease

Among the included patients, PTC made up 91.67% of the total 108 patients (Fig. 1 A). The genetic mutation and gene fusion landscape of 108 patients was shown in Fig. 1 B. All patients had gene alteration including mutation and gene fusion (Fig. 1 C). The five most common mutated genes were BRAF, POLE, ATM, BRCA1, and RELN (Fig. 1 B). Two MTC patients had NRAS mutations (p.Q61L and p.Q61K), while one FTC patient had NRAS mutations (p.Q61R) (Fig. S 1 A). Notably, the mutation frequency of RAS is low (2%) in PTC patients (Fig. S 1 B). TERT mutation in the cohort was not as frequent as reported in some other studies, which accounted for 3% of our included patients (data not shown). BRAF mutation was as high as 79.8% in PTC, whereas it was 50.0% in follicular thyroid carcinoma (Fig. 1 D). Gene fusion was the most frequent in PTC, while no gene fusion was detected in other histologic types of THCA (Fig. 1 E). Fusion of RET with other genes was the most frequent type of gene fusion in the included patients (Fig. 1 F). Approximately 71% of PTC patients with gene fusion are younger than 30 years old (Fig. S 2). Moreover, two PTC patients had RET point mutations, and the mutation frequency was approximately 50% (Fig. S 3).

### Impact of mutation density and heterogeneity on papillary thyroid cancer clinical features and remission probability [^114yN96Y]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The need to integrate the classification of cancer with information on the genetic pattern has emerged in recent years for several tumors.

Methods

The genomic background of a large series of 208 papillary thyroid cancers (PTC) followed at a single center was analyzed by a custom MassARRAY genotyping platform, which allows the simultaneous detection of 19 common genetic alterations, including point mutations and fusions.

Results

Of the PTCs investigated, 71% were found to have pathognomonic genetic findings, with BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations being the most frequent monoallelic alterations (42% and 23.5%, respectively), followed by RET/PTC fusions. In 19.2% of cases, two or more point mutations were found, and the co-occurrence of a fusion with one or more point mutation(s) was also observed. Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations were detected in a subgroup of aggressive PTCs (12%). A correlation between several aggressive features and mutation density was found, regardless of the type of association (i.e., only point mutations, or point mutations and fusions). Importantly, Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that mutation density significantly correlated with a higher risk of persistent disease. In most cases, the evaluation of the allelic frequencies normalized for the cancer cell content indicated the presence of the monoallelic mutation in virtually all tumor cells. A minority of cases was found to harbor low allelic frequencies, consistent with the presence of the mutations in a small subset of cancer cells, thus indicating tumor heterogeneity. Consistently, the presence of coexisting genetic alterations with different allelic frequencies in some tumors suggests that PTC can be formed by clones/subclones with different mutational profiles.

Conclusions

A large mono-institutional series of PTCs was fully genotyped by means of a cost- and time-effective customized panel, revealing a strong impact of mutation density and genetic heterogeneity on the clinical features and on disease outcomes, indicating that an accurate risk stratification of thyroid cancer cannot rely on the analysis of a single genetic event. Finally, the heterogeneity found in some tumors warrants attention, since the occurrence of this phenomenon is likely to affect response to targeted therapies.

Molecular diagnostics in indeterminate FNA — BRAF V600E and prognostic associations: Molecular diagnostic testing to detect individual mutations (eg, BRAF V600E, RET/PTC, RAS, PAX8/PPAR gamma) or pattern recognition approaches using molecular classifiers may be useful in the evaluation of FNA samples that are indeterminate to assist in management decisions; the BRAF V600E mutation occurs in about 45% of patients with papillary carcinoma and is the most common mutation; some studies have linked the BRAF V600E mutation to poor prognosis, especially when occurring with TERT promoter mutation, whereas BRAF V600E mutation on its own is generally not considered associated with poor prognosis.

### Genomic characterization of cervical lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid carcinoma following the chornobyl accident [^112da6zA]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer, the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among adolescents and young adults, has a very good prognosis, with 5-year relative survival rates exceeding 99%. The most common form, papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), is a well-differentiated tumor that accounts for approximately 85% of thyroid cancers, is more common in women, and is typically managed with surgery (lobectomy and/or total thyroidectomy), post-surgery radioactive iodine (131 I) ablation, and/or systemic therapy. However, clinical uncertainties remain regarding optimal treatment approaches, in part because an estimated 20–50% of patients have cervical lymph node metastases (cLNM) at diagnosis, only a fraction of which are identified through pre-operative imaging. Patient and clinical factors that reportedly correlate with cLNM and impact surgical decisions include younger age at diagnosis, male sex, increased tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, multifocality, location in the upper pole of the thyroid, and history of exposure to ionizing radiation.

In the last decade, advances in molecular characterization of PTC have demonstrated promise for providing new insights into patient risk stratification that could inform therapeutic decision-making, mainly based on targeted profiling of somatic alterations. Tumor aggressiveness and occurrence of cLNM and distant metastases have been associated with gene alterations, including BRAF V600E, TERT promoter, or TP53 mutations; RET fusions; and 22q loss. However, published results are inconsistent, possibly due to small sample sizes and ascertainment biases; heterogeneity in patient characteristics, particularly age, which is associated with specific molecular alterations –; and variability in the molecular characteristics assessed in different studies. A recent report suggested that the relationship between thyroid tumor aggressiveness and molecular characteristics could depend on patient characteristics such as age; specifically, the increased frequency of cLNM and distant metastases in thyroid tumors with RET/NTRK fusions versus BRAF mutations was pronounced in a series of pediatric patients but much less so in older patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) — initial thyroidectomy recommendation states that the central compartment should be assessed for suspicious lymphadenopathy, and if clinical or imaged lymph node metastasis (LNM) is present (ie, macroscopic disease), a therapeutic central neck dissection (CND) is recommended; this is a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence.

In addition to recommend PTC subtyping, the 2022 WHO classification also endorses triaging of follicular variant PTC into infiltrative follicular variant PTC (IFVPTC) and invasive encapsulated follicular variant PTC (IEFVPTC), in which the latter should be subdivided into minimally invasive, encapsulated angioinvasive and widely invasive, similar to the subdivision of FTCs proposed in the former WHO classification (figure 3). While IFVPTC represents an invasive malignancy exhibiting all the classical features of PTC except papillae (such as florid nuclear atypia, psammoma bodies, a fibrous stroma, lymphatic invasion, often driven by BRAF mutations, RET translocations, NTRK or ALK fusions), IEFVPTCs are RAS -driven and resemble FTC, with a well-defined border and local invasion (through capsule and/or into veins) (figures3 4). Simply put, while IFVPTC most likely represents a variant of PTC, IEFVPTCs could in theory, be considered as FTCs with nuclear atypia. It will be intriguing to observe whether the latter diagnosis persists in future WHO classifications or if it transitions to the FTC category.

Novel aspects of thyroid tumour classification. The subclassification of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) into invasive encapsulated follicular variant PTC and infiltrative follicular variant PTC, based on overall architecture, nuclear atypia and genetics, is clinically significant. The former entity behaves akin to follicular thyroid carcinoma in terms of prognosis and metastatic routes, while the latter entity behaves more similarly to PTC in general, with local metastases to regional lymph nodes. Follicular thyroid carcinoma and other subtypes of PTC are introduced in this illustration for comparison. RAS -like: RAS gene mutations, PAX8::PPARG fusions, rare mutations in PTEN, DICER1 and BRAF K601E. BRAF -like: BRAF V600E mutations, RET translocations, NTRK fusions, ALK fusions.

MT to guide extent of surgery — prognostic utility and mutation associations are outlined as follows: To be useful for deciding extent of surgery, a given molecular test (MT) needs to first provide reliable prognostic information, and in a single-institution series of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), aggressive features such as CLNM, distant metastasis, and recurrence were associated with BRAF V600E and RET/PTC-1 and 3 rearrangement; when PTC is solitary and 4 to 6 cm in size, recurrence is more likely with positive BRAF V600E (9.5% vs 3.4%), and ThyroSeq v3 can also detect TERT promoter mutations which are found in ∼10% of PTC and are associated with cancer-specific mortality; currently, it is not necessarily recommended for initial risk stratification, but if MT is available and such mutations are present, they may be called out as being associated with increased risk of recurrence in the 2015 ATA risk classification.

BRAF V600E is associated with intermediate risk for invasive behavior. Sonographic features include solid composition, hypoechoic echogenicity, irregular margin, and/or the presence of extrathyroidal extension, and taller than wide shape. Punctate echogenic foci and/or peripheral calcification are typically present. Central and lateral neck lymphadenopathy are common. However, distant metastases are uncommon in pediatrics. FNA commonly reveals a TBSRTC category V suspicious for malignancy or VI malignant. The BRAF V600E somatic mutation is associated with C-PTC as well as TC-PTC. Invasive histologic findings including multifocality, extrathyroidal extension, lymphatic/ angioinvasion. In the presence of lateral neck lymph node metastasis, total thyroidectomy with therapeutic central and lateral neck dissection should be performed. Lobectomy with prophylactic central neck dissection may be sufficient to achieve remission in individuals without evidence of central or lateral neck lymph node metastasis; completion thyroidectomy should be considered if multifocality or ≥ 5 regional lymph node metastases are identified on prophylactic central neck lymph node dissection (Fig. 7).

### Response to RET-Specific therapy inFusion-positive anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^115zqULs]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare highly aggressive malignancy that accounts for only ∼1% of thyroid cancers in the United States, but up to half of thyroid cancer deaths. Median disease-specific survival is only 4 months, which has remained essentially unchanged for the past few decades. Although intensive multimodality treatment combining surgical resection with postoperative radiation and chemotherapy can improve local control and survival for some patients with disease confined to the neck, most patients will develop progressive disease or harbor metastatic disease at presentation. Metastatic ATC is incurable and poorly responsive to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in thyroid cancer has helped define the molecular landscape of ATC, distinguished it genomically from other more well-differentiated follicular-derived thyroid cancers with a better prognosis and suggested novel targeted treatment approaches. More than half of ATCs possess activating mutations in MAPK pathway genes, including BRAF and the three RAS genes. The efficacy and safety of the BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, plus the MEK inhibitor, trametinib, in BRAF V600E -mutant ATC led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of this combination for BRAF V600E -mutant ATC without locoregional treatment options, the first newly approved therapy for ATC in nearly 50 years. The activity of dabrafenib plus trametinib in BRAF V600E -mutant ATC has established a paradigm of matching a driver genomic alteration with a specific targeted therapy in ATC and has stimulated the search for additional targetable oncogenic drivers in the majority of ATC tumors that do not harbor BRAF mutations.

Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in oncogenic kinase gene fusions have emerged as actionable therapeutic targets in diverse human malignancies, including chronic myelogenous leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Kinase fusions have been identified in distinct histological subtypes of thyroid cancer, including papillary thyroid cancer (PTC; RET, NTRK1/2/3), medullary thyroid cancer (ALK), and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (RET, ALK). Although RET fusions were previously reported in ATCs, the samples analyzed also contained PTC tissue and/or co-occurring BRAF mutations. Therefore, the source of each identified RET gene fusion (i.e. PTC or ATC component) could not be determined. In recent NGS analyses of thyroid cancers, including ATCs, RET gene fusions were identified in more well-differentiated thyroid cancers, but were absent from ATCs.

### RET fusion genes in pediatric and adult thyroid carcinomas: cohort characteristics and prognosis [^116rcySh]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Thyroid cancer is associated with a broad range of different mutations, including RET (rearranged during transfection) fusion genes. The importance of characterizing RET fusion-positive tumors has recently increased due to the possibility of targeted treatment. The aim of this study was to identify RET fusion-positive thyroid tumors, correlate them with clinicopathological features, compare them with other mutated carcinomas, and evaluate long-term follow-up of patients. The cohort consisted of 1564 different thyroid tissue samples (including 1164 thyroid carcinoma samples) from pediatric and adult patients. Samples were analyzed for known driver mutations occurring in thyroid cancer. Negative samples were subjected to extensive RET fusion gene analyses using next-generation sequencing and real-time PCR. RET fusion genes were not detected in any low-risk neoplasm or benign thyroid tissue and were detected only in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), in 113/993 (11.4%) patients, three times more frequently in pediatric and adolescent patients (29.8%) than in adult patients (8.7%). A total of 20 types of RET fusions were identified. RET fusion-positive carcinomas were associated with aggressive tumor behavior, including high rates of lymph node (75.2%) and distant metastases (18.6%), significantly higher than in NTRK fusion, BRAF V600E and RAS -positive carcinomas. Local and distant metastases were also frequently found in patients with microcarcinomas positive for the RET fusions. 'True recurrences' occurred rarely (2.4%) and only in adult patients. The 2-, 5-, 10-year disease-specific survival rates were 99%, 96%, and 95%, respectively. RET fusion-positive carcinomas were associated with high invasiveness and metastatic activity, but probably due to intensive treatment with low patient mortality.

Background

PTC is the most prevalent malignancy of the thyroid gland. There has been an increasing incidence of PTC worldwide for the past few decades. The etiology of PTC is related to environmental, hormonal and genetic factors. About 5–15% of PTC patients show a familial occurrence, and fPTC is recognized as a distinct entity only in recent years. Families with accumulation of PTCs show an inherited trait of the disease and patients with fPTC often have early age at disease onset and increased severity in successive generations, also, fPTC patients frequently present more aggressive tumors with increased incidence of multifocality, local invasion, lymph node metastases than the sporadic PTC. Generally, fPTC is diagnosed when three or more family members have PTC and in the absence of other known associated syndromes. PTC has a significant gender bias with much more women affected than men; it is especially suggestive for the familial predisposition when men or children were diagnosed with PTC. While, because families share the same environment and a common genetic background, it is difficult to distinguish between environmental and genetic contributing factors, and also because the majority of fPTC pedigrees are small in size and may present with a variety of additional benign thyroid nodules, the genetic predisposition to fPTC is unknown and the molecular alterations at the origin of the pathology are only now beginning to emerge.

Sporadic PTC is known to be associated with point mutation of the BRAF genes and chromosomal rearrangements of RET / PTC. The BRAF encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase which plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway and affects cell division, differentiation and secretion; point mutations in BRAF are found in up to 45% PTC cases. The RET protooncogene is one of the receptor tyrosine kinases, cell-surface molecules that transduce signals for cell growth and differentiation; rearrangements of the RET are found in about 35% of sporadic PTC. Although somatic mutations of the genes like BRAF and RET exclusively play a causative role in sporadic thyroid cancer development, germline mutations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes were also reported to act as modifiers in the cancer process, it needs to mention here that in a Chinese population, SNPs of BRAF were shown to be associated with PTC, and thus it is intriguing to verify these mutations in fPTC families.

Non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) — definition, criteria, molecular profile, and outcomes are summarized as follows: NIFTP comprise approximately 2.1–9.6% of follicular cell-derived thyroid neoplasms; the original validation excluded tumors measuring ≤ 1 cm and those with oncocytic features, and the diagnostic criteria were revised from allowing < 1% papillae to require that papillae are absent. Molecular alterations are present in approximately 78% of cases, with approximately 30–54% harboring a RAS mutation. Several institutional series (largest sample, n = 363) have mostly reported zero risk of disease persistence or recurrence over a mean or median follow-up of up to 11.8 years; lymph node metastases have been seen in < 5% of the total cohort, and one retrospective analysis of 102 cases reported one case of distant metastasis with limitations including incomplete follow-up (∼80%) and more aggressive care. At present, there are no available data comparing the clinical benefits and harms of various short- and long-term monitoring strategies in patients with NIFTP.

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), lymphatic invasion, poorly differentiated and differentiated high-grade disease (≤ 1 cm without other high-risk features), or macroscopic multifocal disease (> 1 cm) may warrant a completion thyroidectomy; disease monitoring (category 2B) is another option.

### How molecular pathology is changing and will change the therapeutics of patients with follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer [^116agtou]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas comprise two well-defined histological types: papillary and follicular (PTCs and FTCs, respectively). Despite being derived from the same cell (thyroid follicular cell), these two types of tumour accumulate distinct genetic abnormalities during progression. The molecular pathology of thyroid cancer is now better understood because of our ability to identify RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations in the aetiopathogenesis of the large majority of PTCs and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8/PPARgamma rearrangements in follicular patterned carcinomas (FTCs and follicular variant of PTCs). This review summarises most of the molecular alterations currently used as targets for new biological treatments and looks at some of the changes that are already occurring or may occur in the treatment of patients with thyroid cancer. For simplicity, the review is divided up according to the major genetic alterations identified in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (RET/PTC rearrangements, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations and mitochondrial DNA deletions and mutations) and their respective treatments.

### Correlation of RET somatic mutations with clinicopathological features in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas [^112tZ9mL]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

A statistically significant correlation was shown between group 1 and the presence of lymph node metastases, as well as the number of positive lymph nodes at the time of surgery, multifocality and a non-disease free status, compared with group 2. This correlation may account for the significantly higher frequency of patients from group 1 in stage IV and with detectable serum CT level at last control, compared with groups 2 and 3, and also for the significantly increased levels of serum CT at the last control in group 1 cases in comparison with group 2. Furthermore, such correlation supports the hypothesis that mutations in RET exons 15 and 16 are related to a more aggressive behaviour of MTC. This could be explained by an earlier dissemination of Met918Thr and Ala883Phe cases to lymph nodes (Table 3). Indeed, 26.1% of MTC cases came to clinical attention because of lymph nodes in group 1, whereas this occurred in only 0.0% and 11.8% of the cases in groups 2 and 3, respectively.

The results presented in Table 3 show a trend towards the stratification of the three groups of sporadic MTC patients into risk levels on the basis of the statistically significant clinicopathological characteristics. Group 1 patients are at the highest risk for aggressive MTC, followed by group 3 at intermediate risk, and group 2 patients, which present the lowest risk for a worse clinical outcome. Therefore, our study shows that RET mutations in exons 15 and 16 are associated with a more aggressive behaviour of sporadic MTC than other RET mutations, as it has been shown in vitro, as well as in the hereditary variants of MTC.

Taken together, these results suggest that the screening of RET somatic mutations may be helpful in the management of patients with MTC, according to the presence and type of RET somatic mutation.

### Proteogenomics analysis unveils a TFG-RET gene fusion and druggable targets in papillary thyroid carcinomas [^112Bf8gR]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common form of thyroid cancer. A recent survey by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program estimates 53,990 new cases of thyroid cancer and 2060 deaths in the US, which would account for 3.1% of overall cancer cases and 0.3% of all cancer deaths in 2018. Although the death rate from thyroid cancer is low, its incidence increased annually by 3.6% from 1974 to 2013 and it is the most rapidly increasing cancer in the US. Thyroid cancer occurs three times more frequently in women than in men, though studies indicate that male patients are presented with more aggressive stages when diagnosed and have lower disease free survival as well as higher mortality. Nearly 80% of all thyroid cancers are PTCs. Other major types of thyroid cancer include follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and the distinction is primarily based on the cell of origin and tissue architecture. Thus far, surgery and radioiodine treatment (RAI) represent the major therapeutic avenue for patients. Even though patients with PTCs mostly have a good prognosis, recurrence and aggressive metastases have been found in an increasing number of patients in the last years. Central lymph node (LN) metastases are often detected in 20–90% PTC patients and considered as a factor contributing to recurrence and morbidity in a study employing a large cohort of patients. The BRAF mutation resulting in its highly kinase active protein form BRAFV600E and mutations in the RAS gene, especially NRAS, are the most common genetic alterations seen in PTC. Apart from BRAF and NRAS mutations, common genetic alterations in PTCs include gene fusions involving the RET gene giving rise to oncogenic fusion proteins that account for up to 13–25% of PTCs. Although BRAF mutations are prevalent in older patients, RET fusions are much more frequent in younger patients. RET fusions (also called RET/PTC rearrangements) are genomic rearrangements that are associated with ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. RET fusions were reported in up to 60% cases of post Chernobyl PTCs. Spatial contiguity of the genes involved in the fusion during interphase could be the structural basis of these chromosomal rearrangements. In oncogenic RET rearrangements the kinase domain-containing C terminus of the RET gene, which is normally not expressed in thyroid follicular cells, is fused to the promoter-containing N terminus of a ubiquitously expressed, unrelated gene.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — malignancy risk stratification for AUS/FLUS, FN, and SUSP nodules by molecular testing and ultrasound: AUS/FLUS or FN nodules benign by the 167 GEC, or AUS/FLUS nodules negative on a seven-gene mutation panel, have an estimated 5%–6% malignancy risk; FN nodules negative on the seven-gene panel have an estimated 14% risk. AUS/FLUS or FN nodules suspicious by the 167 GEC have an estimated 37%–44% risk, and SUSP nodules benign by GEC or negative by the mutation seven-gene panel have an estimated 15%–28% risk. AUS/FLUS or FN nodules positive for RAS mutations have an estimated 84% risk and should be considered similar to cytologically suspicious, while AUS/FLUS, FN, or SUSP nodules positive for BRAF V600E, RET/PTC, or PAX8/PPARγ have an estimated risk of > 95% and should be considered similar to cytologically diagnosed thyroid carcinoma. For AUS/FLUS cytology, a sonographically benign or seemingly very low risk pattern was malignant in only 8% of cases, versus 58% with low or intermediate suspicion and 100% with high suspicion; highly suspicious sonographic features had > 90% specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for malignancy.

### BRAF (V599E) mutation is the leading genetic event in adult sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas [^112WUPoU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Activating mutations of BRAF have been identified in a variety of human cancers, most notably melanomas and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). The aim of the present study was to disclose the role of BRAF mutations in thyroid carcinoma development. Seventy-two thyroid tumors, including 60 PTCs, six follicular adenomas, five follicular carcinomas, and one anaplastic carcinoma, were studied. BRAF mutation screening focused on exon 15 and exon 11 of the gene by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and sequence analysis. Search of RET/PTC expression was conducted with the RT-PCR technique. The molecular genetic study of the BRAF gene showed the presence of a missense thymine to adenine transversion at nucleotide 1796, resulting in the V599E substitution, in 24 of 60 PTCs (40%), none of six follicular adenomas, and none of five follicular carcinomas or one anaplastic carcinoma. Moreover, nine of 60 PTCs (15%) presented RET/PTC expression. A genetico-clinical association analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutation and development of PTCs of the classic papillary histotype (P = 0.038). On the contrary, no link could be detected between expression of BRAF(V599E) and age at diagnosis, gender, dimension, and local invasiveness of the primary cancer, presence of lymph node metastases, tumor stage, and multifocality of the disease. These data clearly confirm that BRAF(V599E) is the more common genetic alteration found to date in adult sporadic PTCs, that it is unique for this thyroid cancer histotype, and that it might drive the development of PTCs of the classic papillary subtype.

### Assessment of RET / PTC oncogene activation and clonality in thyroid nodules with incomplete morphological evidence of papillary carcinoma: a search for the early precursors of papillary cancer [^1137PtG9]. The American Journal of Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Noninvasive thyroid nodules that exhibit borderline morphological signs of papillary cancer are difficult to diagnose and we do not know if they represent papillary carcinoma precursor lesions. Forty-six such nodules were analyzed for RET activation by immunohistochemistry and, in selected cases, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on RNA extracted after laser capture microdissection (LCM) of the tumor foci with and without papillary carcinoma features and positive RET immunoreactivity. RET immunoreactivity was identified, at least focally, in 30 of 46 (65.2%) of the nodules where it closely paralleled the morphological changes. Enough RNA was obtained after LCM in seven samples. RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 were detected in microscopic foci with papillary carcinoma features in most of the thyroid nodules (five of seven cases). No RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 rearrangements were detected in areas of the same tumors that lacked the cytological alterations. Analysis of clonality in the same nodules selected for LCM demonstrated that two were monoclonal and six were polyclonal. We conclude that RET activation closely parallels the morphological changes, that it is restricted to those areas of the tumor with the cytological alterations and that it is detectable in both mono- and polyclonal tumors. Although the finding of microscopic foci indicative of papillary carcinoma in a hyperplastic or adenomatous nodule does not justify the interpretation of the entire lesion as papillary carcinoma, it is possible that such foci may precede the development of invasive papillary cancer.

### RET fusion-positive papillary thyroid cancers are associated with a more aggressive phenotype [^115BnKLd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear if different genetic drivers in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) confer different phenotypic tumor behavior leading to more aggressive disease. We hypothesized that RET-driven cancers are more aggressive.

Patients and Methods

We reviewed records of consecutive patients treated for newly diagnosed PTC at this single institution from 2015 to 2016. Tumor samples from these patients were genotyped to identify RET-translocated, BRAF V600E mutant, and HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS mutant tumors. Patient demographic, clinicopathologic, and outcomes data were compared to identify genotype-specific patterns of disease.

Results

Of the 327 patients who underwent initial surgery for PTC during the study period, 192 (58.7%) had BRAF V600E mutant tumors (BRAF), 14 (4.3%) had RET-rearranged tumors (RET), 46 (14.1%) had RAS mutant tumors (RAS), and 75 (22.9%) had BRAF, RET, and RAS wildtype tumors. RET-driven tumors were more likely to have extrathyroidal extension (50.0% versus 27.0% for BRAF and 2.2% for RAS, P < 0.001), multifocal disease (85.7% versus 60.3%, and 44.4%, respectively, P = 0.017), and distant metastases (14.3% versus 1.1%, and 0%, respectively, P = 0.019). RET and BRAF patients also had worse disease-free survival than RAS patients (Kaplan-Meier log rank, P = 0.027).

Conclusions

Patients with RET-driven PTCs had higher rates of extrathyroidal extension, multifocal disease, and distant metastases than patients whose tumors had BRAF V600E or RAS mutations. Patients with RET-rearranged tumors had similar disease-free survival to patients with BRAF V600E mutant tumors. RET rearrangement may confer an aggressive phenotype in PTC.

### Noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like nuclear features are genetically and biologically similar to adenomatous nodules and distinct from papillary thyroid carcinomas with extensive follicular growth [^1175mEC7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Context

- Proposed noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTPs), formerly noninvasive encapsulated papillary carcinoma, follicular variant (PTC-FV), is an indolent tumor with follicular growth and frequent RAS mutations.

Objective

- To detect histologic and molecular differences separating NIFTP from follicular adenomas (FAs) and invasive carcinomas, particularly papillary carcinomas with extensive follicular growth (PTC-EFGs) and invasive encapsulated PTC-FV (IE-PTC-FV).

Design

- Sixty-one tumors were reviewed histologically and reclassified into 32 NIFTPs (52%), 4 IE-PTC-FVs (7%), 14 PTC-EFGs (23%), and 11 FAs (18%). Next-generation sequencing for mutations in 50 genes was performed. Clinical outcomes were recorded.

Results

- The NIFTPs and FAs were well circumscribed and unencapsulated. The FAs had bland nuclei, whereas the NIFTPs showed at least 2 of 3 (67%; sufficient) nuclear features (enlargement, irregular contours, chromatin clearing). The IE-PTC-FVs had follicular growth, sufficient nuclear features, and extensive capsular invasion. The PTC-EFGs had a median of 5% papillae with intrathyroidal invasion (broad-based, sclerotic, or small follicle growth patterns); intranuclear pseudoinclusions were present only in PTC-EFGs (9 of 14; 64%). Mutations included RAS in 20 of the 32 NIFTPs (62%), 4 of the 11 FAs (36%), and 3 of the 4 IE-PTC-FVs (75%); BRAF K601E in 1 NIFTP (3%); BRAF V600E in 5 PTC-EFGs (36%). No NIFTPs or FAs recurred or metastasized. All 4 IE-PTC-FVs (100%) had hematogenous metastasis. Two PTC-EFGs (14%) had lymphatic metastasis.

Conclusions

- The morphologic similarity and RAS mutations in FAs, NIFTPs, and IE-PTC-FVs supports the genetic similarity of those follicular neoplasms in contrast to the unique presence of BRAF V600E mutations in PTC-EFGs. Using strict diagnostic criteria supported by molecular testing, tumors with extensive follicular growth can be classified into follicular type or RAS-like (FA, NIFTP, IE-PTC-FV) versus papillary type or BRAF V600E-like (PTC-EFG).

### Histopathological features of papillary thyroid carcinomas detected during four screening examinations of a Ukrainian-American cohort [^112NbGg9]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

There is accumulating evidence that the types of somatic mutations in PTC may indicate aetiology. Certain chromosomal rearrangements, for example, RET / PTC, ETV6-NTKR3, and EML4 - ALK, may be characteristic of radiation-related thyroid cancer, whereas point mutations in the BRAF or RAS genes may be characteristic of sporadic cancer. Our previous findings in a subset of UkrAm cases support this idea. We reported that the frequency of several chromosomal rearrangements as a group followed a linear-quadratic dose–response, whereas the frequency of the BRAF / RAS mutations was inversely and linearly associated with 131 I dose. Given that the association between dose and the combined characteristics of PTC invasiveness also followed a concave pattern, we evaluated the associations between somatic mutations and the invasive properties of PTCs.

Much evidence on this subject comes from non-irradiated patients in whom the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation has been associated with aggressive PTC histopathology and adverse clinical outcomes. By contrast, some studies of radiation-related post-Chernobyl PTCs have suggested that RET / PTC (particularly RET / PTC3) rearrangements occur frequently in morphologically aggressive solid variant tumours. In our study, five of eight RET / PTC3- positive tumours were of the solid variant, seven had evidence of extrathyroidal extension, and all eight had evidence of lymphatic/vascular invasion. In addition, we observed that PTCs with chromosomal rearrangements were significantly associated with lymphatic/vascular invasion compared with PTCs without chromosomal rearrangements or PTCs with BRAF / RAS point mutations after adjustment for age and 131 I dose. Therefore, PTCs with chromosomal rearrangements may be more aggressive (i.e. lymphatic/vascular invasion), regardless of the received thyroid dose and age. Moreover, PTCs with common chromosomal rearrangements and BRAF / RAS point mutations may have both different aetiologies and distinct phenotypes.

The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons thyroid surgery guideline — nodal dissection and imaging — states: "Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is often present at TC diagnosis and can occur subclinically in up to 75% and 80% of MTC and PTC patients, respectively". "Therefore, a preoperative diagnosis of TC by cytology or molecular testing should prompt imaging to assess for LNM". "Neck US that includes evaluation of central and lateral LN basins is recommended in patients with cytologic evidence of TC" and "may be performed in patients with indeterminate cytology to help identify nonpalpable lymphadenopathy". "In selected patients, CT of the neck and upper chest can provide additional data especially in extensive lateral neck disease".

### Molecular, morphologic, and outcome analysis of thyroid carcinomas according to degree of extrathyroid extension [^114PudGq]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of varying degrees of extrathyroid extension (ETE), especially microscopic ETE (METE), on survival in thyroid carcinomas (TC) has not been well established. Our objective was to analyze ETE at the molecular and histologic levels and assess the effect of its extent on outcome.

Methods

All cases of TC with ETE but without nodal metastases at presentation (NMP) were identified over a 20-year period and grouped into gross and METE. Twelve papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) without ETE and NMP were also analyzed. Cases with paraffin tissues were subjected to mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in TC: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, and AKT1, and other related genes were surveyed.

Results

Eighty-one (10%) of 829 patients in the database had ETE and no NMP. There was a much higher frequency of poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas (12/29, 41%) in patients with gross ETE than in those with METE (3/52, 6%) (p < 0.01). There was a higher disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with METE than in those with gross ETE (p < 0.0001). Except for an anaplastic case, no recurrences were detected in 45 patients with METE, including 23 PTC patients followed up for a median of 10 years without radioactive iodine therapy. Within patients with gross invasion into trachea/esophagus, tumors with high mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis correlated with worse DSS (p < 0.05). Fifty-six cases with ETE were genotyped as follows: BRAFV600E, 39 (70%); BRAFV600E-AKT1, 1 (1.8%); NRAS, 1 (1.8%); KRAS, 1 (1.8%); RET/PTC, 3 (5%); wild type, 11 (19.6%). Within PTCs, BRAF positivity rate increased the risk of ETE (p = 0.01). If PTC follicular variants are excluded, BRAF positivity does not correlate with ETE status within classical/tall cell PTC.

Conclusion

(i) PTCs with METE without NMP have an extremely low recurrence rate in contrast to tumors with gross ETE. (ii) High mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis confers worse DSS even in patients stratified for gross ETE in trachea/esophagus. (iii) BRAF positivity correlates with the presence of ETE in PTC, but this relationship is lost within classical/tall cell PTC if follicular variants are excluded from the analysis.

American Thyroid Association 2015 — molecular mutation testing for indeterminate thyroid nodules emphasizes that BRAF V600E single-mutation testing has high specificity but insufficient sensitivity to exclude malignancy, while broader panels show variable performance; specifically, "BRAF V600E single mutation testing has been estimated to have a specificity of approximately 99% (pooled data from 1117 nodules…)" yet "the sensitivity has been deemed to be too low to reliably rule out the presence of malignancy", seven‑gene panel sensitivity has "reports ranging from 44% to 100%", and next‑generation sequencing of expanded panels "has been reported to have a sensitivity of 90% for FN/SFN cytology specimens" in a single‑center study; panels typically include "BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS… as well as RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, with or without PAX8/PPARγ", though one study noted a limitation that histopathology reviewers were aware of prior molecular results.

### Tumor genotype determines phenotype and disease-related outcomes in thyroid cancer: a study of 1510 patients [^114VTLT9]. Annals of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To correlate thyroid cancer genotype with histology and outcomes.

Background

The prognostic significance of molecular signature in thyroid cancer (TC) is undefined but can potentially change surgical management.

Methods

We reviewed a consecutive series of 1510 patients who had initial thyroidectomy for TC with routine testing for BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC, and PAX8/PPARG alterations. Histologic metastatic or recurrent TC was tracked for 6 or more months after oncologic thyroidectomy.

Results

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) was diagnosed in 97% of patients and poorly differentiated/anaplastic TC in 1.1%. Genetic alterations were detected in 1039 (70%); the most common mutations were BRAFV600E (644/1039, 62%), and RAS isoforms (323/1039, 31%). BRAFV600E-positive PTC was often conventional or tall cell variant (58%), with frequent extrathyroidal extension (51%) and lymph node metastasis (46%). Conversely, RAS-positive PTC was commonly follicular variant (87%), with infrequent extrathyroidal extension (4.6%) and lymph node metastasis (5.6%). BRAFV600E and RET/PTC-positive PTCs were histologically similar. Analogously, RAS and PAX8/PPARG-positive PTCs were histologically similar. Compared with RAS or PAX8/PPARG-positive TCs, BRAFV600E or RET/PTC-positive TCs were more often associated with stage III/IV disease (40% vs 15%, P < 0.001) and recurrence (10% vs 0.7%, P < 0.001; mean follow-up 33 ± 21 mo). Distant metastasis was highest in patients with RET/PTC-positive TC (10.8%, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

In this large study of prospective mutation testing in unselected patients with TC, molecular signature was associated with distinctive phenotypes including cancers, with higher risks of both distant metastasis and early recurrence. Preoperative genotype provides valuable prognostic data to appropriately inform surgery.

### Papillary thyroid carcinoma: an overview [^114e5yTo]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Papillary carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the thyroid. It has a variable macroscopic appearance that differs according to the variant microscopic morphologies and the presence or absence of degenerative changes. The histologic variants can be challenging to the pathologist, and some are of clinical significance because of prognostic implications. In this short review, we discuss an approach to papillary carcinoma, the diagnostic dilemmas and controversies, and the ancillary studies that are helpful in resolving them, including immunohistochemistry and molecular studies.

In these 12 cases, the presence of the somatic mutations specific for papillary thyroid cancer could have been used to allow a more definitive initial treatment as all of these patients went on to have a completion thyroidectomy based on the malignant histologic diagnosis.

### Next-generation sequencing identified that RET variation associates with lymph node metastasis and the immune microenvironment in thyroid papillary carcinoma [^111f1Bk2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymph node metastasis is a crucial factor in the PTC progression. The distribution of immune subsets in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes differed in with and without lymph node metastasis of PTC. The profiles of PTC without nodal metastasis correlate with a more favorable biology for the host. Indeed, KEGG analysis showed that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules were enriched in PTC patients with RET alteration. RET alteration results in the interaction changes between tumor cells and the host, which trigger the nodal metastasis of PTC. Furthermore, abnormity of cellular protein metabolic process, T cell co-stimulation, cell adhesion, and immune response, may accelerate the metastasis progression in PTC. PTC has many morphologic subtypes, exhibiting different mutational, clinicopathological, and prognostic characteristics, which need to be considered in PTC research. Although we provided the genetic mutation profiles of PTC, more detailed subtype information is not available in our study. Therefore, the present findings may be totally or in part driven by specific PTC subtypes that are not assessable in the present cohort. Through comprehensive analysis, the molecular characteristics of PTC with and without node metastasis were characterized by a gene panel, which may guide significance for clinical application.

In the largest prospective single-institution AUS/FLUS series (653 consecutive nodules, 247 with surgical follow-up), detection of any of these mutations by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with fluorescent melting curve analysis conveyed an 88% risk of cancer among nodules with surgical follow-up; 63% of cancers were identified preoperatively with a positive mutation (22 of 35), and 94% of mutation-negative nodules had benign final histopathology (209 of 222).

### Intranodal thyroid inclusions revisited: a morphological analysis and application of BRAF VE1 immunohistochemistry [^113eMo91]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Important diagnostic features of intranodal thyroid inclusions

Table 5
Distinguishing features of benign thyroid inclusions suggested by the 5 th edition of WHO classification of head and neck tumours in comparison to the current study

Admittedly, the stringent distinction between intranodal thyroid inclusions and metastatic PTC is not always necessary. Subclinical microscopic metastases usually do not progress and seldom become clinically relevant even when left untreated. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) Management Guidelines, patients with ≤ 5 pathologic N1 micrometastases (< 2 mm in largest dimension) still belong to the low‐risk category, so reporting small unifocal intranodal thyroid inclusions as lymph node metastases would arguably have little clinical impact. However, some of the thyroid inclusions in our study were > 2 mm and involved multiple lymph nodes. If these were reported as metastases, patients might be upgraded to the intermediate risk category, which would affect clinical decision‐making and management. For incidentally discovered intranodal thyroid tissue in patients who underwent surgery due to other head and neck cancers, the distinction between thyroid inclusions and metastases is important, because directly reporting them as metastases could lead to thyroidectomy. In cases where the intranodal thyroid tissue is entirely bland‐looking or exhibits only focal atypia without full‐blown malignant features, communication with the clinician is always important to decide if there is clinicoradiological evidence of a primary thyroid tumour. In the absence of a thyroid tumour, active surveillance instead of direct thyroidectomy would be a reasonable approach.

The major limitation in our study is that our main cohort (Group A) consisted of only cases with BRAF p.V600E‐positive primary PTC. The features that we found helpful for the distinction between intranodal thyroid inclusions and metastatic PTC may not be applicable when the primary thyroid tumour is a RAS‐like follicular variant PTC, PTC with other molecular drivers such as RET or NTRK fusions, or a nonpapillary thyroid carcinoma, such as a well‐differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma. Nevertheless, based on a strictly controlled cohort with only BRAF p.V600E‐positive primary PTC (Group A), we minimized the major confounder and were able to draw comparisons between a large series of intranodal thyroid inclusions and metastatic BRAF p.V600E‐positive PTC. Further investigation of this subject considering the geographical differences and molecular diversity of thyroid carcinoma is needed. In addition, molecular studies must take into account the spatial admixture of intranodal thyroid inclusions and metastatic thyroid carcinoma within the same lymph node to avoid confounded results.

Figure 4
Microscopic features of infiltrative follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (IFVPTC) and minimally invasive encapsulated follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (miEVPTC). (A–C) The IFVPTC exhibits irregular contours with diffuse infiltration of the surrounding parenchyma (A), displays florid nuclear atypia (B) and usually carries a BRAF V600E mutation, as illustrated by the BRAF VE1 immunohistochemistry (C). (D–F) The miEVPTC is demarcated and encapsulated, with focal capsular invasion (D). Nuclear atypia is more subtle, but still present (E) and the entity is RAS driven and therefore lacks BRAF V600E mutations (F).

In terms of grading, a novel nomenclature has been introduced to precisely identify differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and oncocytic thyroid carcinoma (OTC)) exhibiting a particularly aggressive clinical course. The 2022 WHO classification introduces the term 'high-grade thyroid carcinoma', encompassing two distinct tumorous classifications with similar prognoses: differentiated high-grade thyroid carcinoma (DHGTC) and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC). Under the DHGTC umbrella, we encounter PTCs, FTCs and OTCs showcasing an elevated mitotic index (≥ 5 mitoses per 2 mm 2) and/or tumour necrosis (figure 5). These variables intricately intertwine, resulting in worse outcomes compared with differentiated thyroid carcinoma lacking these features. On the other front, PDTCs constitute a malignant, dedifferentiated entity, displaying a dominant solid, trabecular or insular growth pattern, accompanied by an increased mitotic index (≥ 3 mitoses per 2 mm 2) and/or tumour necrosis (the so-called 'Turin criteria'). The absence of PTC-related changes and the notable lack of the classic micro-acinar growth pattern of FTCs are essential to the diagnosis. DHGTCs and PDTCs exhibit some differences on the genetic level, potentially linked to the type of differentiated thyroid carcinoma from which they derive. While DHGTC appears to be preferentially associated with BRAF mutations and a PTC origin, PDTCs often exhibit RAS mutations, suggesting an ancestry related to FTCs or IEFVPTCs. Unveiling additional aberrations signalling a bleak prognosis, such as mutations of the TERT promoter and the TP53 gene, further contributes to the intricate tapestry of high-grade thyroid carcinoma.

Diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (DSVPTC) — DSVPTC is an aggressive form of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with a high prevalence in pediatric patients and those with a history of irradiation, and DSVPTC accounts for approximately 2% to 6% of PTCs. DSVPTC presents with diffuse involvement of 1 or both thyroid lobes with or without a discrete mass and has an increased incidence of extrathyroidal extension, lymph node involvement, and pulmonary metastasis. Recurrence-free survival in DSVPTC appears similar to high-risk PTC (23% vs 27%). Genetically, DSVPTC has rare BRAF and RAS mutations, but a high frequency of RET/PTC rearrangements.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) — outcomes and molecular drivers: Reported survival is 96% at 5 years, 93% at 10 years, and > 90% at 20 years; overall mortality rates for PTC are 1–5.6% with an overall recurrence rate of 15–35%, and recurrence usually involves the tumor bed, cervical lymph nodes, or distant sites. Most PTCs (90%) develop via activation of a Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway event through mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF or RAS, with a subset due to gene fusions involving rearranged during transfection (RET); BRAFV600E is the most common oncogenic mutation, while a minority show non-V600E mutations such as BRAFK601E or BRAF fusions.

### Management of recurrent / persistent nodal disease in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer: a critical review of the risks and benefits of surgical intervention versus active surveillance [^111wVgYs]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — molecular and tumor features informing risk are summarized as follows: The presence of a BRAF (p.V600E) mutation has been associated with aggressiveness and disease-specific mortality, and BRAF mutation analysis offers a very low positive predictive value (28%) and a high negative predictive value (87%) for disease recurrence; positivity for a BRAF mutation also has been associated with the loss of radioactive iodine avidity of recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Evidence on RAS, RET/PTC, and PAX8-PPARG alterations is mixed, with reports of associations with aggressive phenotypes or better prognosis, and the persistent detection of PAX8-PPARG rearrangements in benign tumors limits its value as a diagnostic molecular marker. Presence of lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with decreased tumor aggressiveness and with better locoregional control, lesser rates of recurrence, and greater overall and disease-free survival.

Diffuse sclerosing variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (DSVPTC) — epidemiology, imaging, pathology, cytology, and genetics are described as follows: DSVPTC occurs in approximately 2% to 6% of PTCs and presents with diffuse involvement of 1 or both thyroid lobes with or without a discrete mass. It has an increased incidence of extrathyroidal extension, lymph node involvement, and pulmonary metastasis, and histology shows squamous metaplastic features, numerous psammomatous calcifications, and extensive lymphovascular involvement in a background of chronic thyroiditis. Sonography demonstrates diffuse thyroid enlargement, hypoechoic heterogeneous patterns, mild to profuse blood flow, and regional lymphadenopathy with suspicious microcalcifications; diffuse, scattered microcalcifications can give a "snowstorm" appearance and findings overlap with chronic thyroiditis. Recurrence-free survival in DSVPTC appears similar to high-risk PTC (34% vs 27%). Fine-needle aspiration findings include solid and spherical epithelial groups containing lymphocytes, hobnail cells, estate cytoplasmic vacuoles, large uniocular vacuoles, squamous differentiation, admixed abundant psammoma bodies, and a lymphocytic nuclear features of PTC; molecularly, DSVPTC has rare BRAF and RAS mutations but a high frequency of RET/PTC rearrangements.

### Medullary thyroid carcinoma: recent advances in identification, treatment, and prognosis [^1121yZfm]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

There are several key differences in the presentation of hereditary compared to sporadic MTC. Hereditary MTC presents at a significantly younger age, even after excluding patients identified via genetic screening. However, in a large cohort of patients with MTC, Saltiki et al. found that compared to sporadic MTC, hereditary MTC patients had significantly more microscopic disease (≤ 1 cm), multifocality, C-cell hyperplasia, and smaller tumor size. Sporadic MTC patients had significantly more capsular invasion, soft tissue invasion, and distant metastases than hereditary MTC patients. Sporadic MTC patients with Stage-IV disease had significantly more progression.

A recent study comparing patients with moderate- to high-risk RET codon mutations found that patients with high-risk mutations were identified earlier (age 23.0 vs 42.3, p < 0.0001) and moderate-risk patients had more T3/T4 tumors at diagnosis. However, there was no significant difference in N or M stage at diagnosis. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that increasing age at diagnosis (HR: 1.05 per year; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.08), T3/T4 tumor (HR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.22–6.11), and M1 status at diagnosis (HR: 3.93; 95% CI: 1.61–9.59) — but not high-risk mutation — were significantly associated with an increased risk for death. There were no differences in time to development of distant metastatic disease or overall survival between moderate-risk and high-risk groups.

Similarly, a recent study of 387 RET germline mutation carriers with MTC found that age at thyroidectomy increased significantly from highest to moderate risk. Interestingly, despite younger age at diagnosis in highest-risk groups, primary tumor size and time to lymph node metastases were similar between groups. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the biological behavior of hereditary MTC is similar among risk categories. Perhaps, as posited by Voss et al.high-risk mutations might be better described by their presentation with MTC at an earlier age rather than by "aggressiveness".

Thyroid carcinoma – papillary carcinoma (consideration for initial postoperative use of RAI after total thyroidectomy) — RAI may not be required in patients with classic PTC who have T1b/T2 (1–4 cm) N0 or NX disease or small-volume N1a disease (fewer than 5 metastatic lymph nodes with < 2 mm of focus of cancer in node), particularly if the postoperative Tg is < 1 ng/mL in the absence of interfering Tg ab. RAI is recommended when the combination of individual clinical factors (such as the extent of the primary tumor, histology, degree of lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastases, postoperative thyroglobulin, and age at diagnosis) predicts a significant risk of recurrence, distant metastases, or disease-specific mortality.

RET variation is associated with lymph node metastasis

As PTC was the dominant histologic type in the cohort, we made further analysis of the PTC subgroup. The top 10 frequent alterations of mutated genes and gene fusion are show in Fig. 2 A. BRAF mutation occurred in about 80% of PTC. Co-occurrence analysis of the altered genes revealed that alteration of BRAF and RET fusion was mutually exclusive (Fig. 2 B). However, BRCA2 mutation was positively associated with RELN mutation (Fig. 2 B). Further analysis revealed that the altered genes affected seven different pathways (Fig. 2 C). Mutation or gene fusion was detected in multiple genes on RTK-RAS, TP53, WNT, PI3K-AKT pathway in PTC, which RTK-RAS pathway was found to have the most molecular switches in PTC among (Fig. 2 C).

C The fraction affected pathways of altered genes. D The variation frequency of top 20 altered genes in PTC patients with and without lymphatic metastasis. PTC, Papillary thyroid carcinoma; *, P < 0.05; ns, no significance

As lymph node metastasis is common in PTC, which has a negative impact on survival, the molecular switches or alterations in samples from the patients with and without nodal metastasis were compared. The alteration frequency of RET was higher in the patients with lymph node metastasis than those without RET variation (Fig. 2 D). However, there was no relationship between BRAF V600E mutation and lymph node metastasis in PTC (Fig. S 4 A). Although not statistically significant, an association between PTC with RET fusion and lymph node metastasis seems to exist (Fig. S 4 B). Next, we analyzed the relationship between the top 10 altered genes and lymph node metastasis and found that only RET variation was associated with lymph node metastasis (Fig. 2 D). Moreover, APC variation was enriched in the patients without lymph node metastasis (Table S 2).

### Thyroid carcinoma after chernobyl latent period, morphology and aggressiveness [^112j2ZhD]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The large numbers of papillary thyroid carcinomas that have occurred in those exposed to high levels of short-lived isotopes in fallout after Chernobyl provide a unique opportunity to correlate latency and tumour biology. We show that short latency is associated with tumours with a phenotype that is significantly less structurally differentiated, shows significantly less peritumour fibrosis, and significantly more invasive spread when compared to tumours with a longer latent period. In contrast, the type of differentiation (papillary or follicular architecture) is associated with age at exposure. These findings suggest that the initial mutation at the time of exposure played a major role in tumour latency and aggressiveness. We and others have shown that RET-PTC3 rearrangements are associated with the solid morphology seen in these short latency tumours, while classical papillary carcinomas more often show RET-PTC1 rearrangements. Studies in transgenic mice show similar findings, and in vitro studies show that RET-PTC3 induces more rapid growth than RET-PTC1. We therefore suggest that the solid morphology, high frequency of RET-PTC3 rearrangements and aggressive behaviour noted in early investigations of post-Chernobyl tumours were characteristic of short latency rather than the nature of the mutagen, and that successive overlapping waves of papillary carcinoma with differing latency, differing patterns of mutations and differing clinical behaviour are occurring in those exposed to Chernobyl fallout.

Case 4

A 12-year-old previously healthy male was referred to oncology clinic for a neck mass. Neck ultrasound showed a 2.3 cm solid, very hypoechoic nodule, taller than wide, with irregular margins and diffuse punctate echogenic foci. Multiple enlarged, round echogenic lymph nodes with punctate echogenic foci and peripheral blood flow on Doppler imaging were present in the bilateral lateral neck (level 2–4). FNA of the thyroid lesion and bilateral level 2 and 4 lymph nodes (lateral neck) were compatible with TBSRTC category VI malignant cytology. There was no evidence of pulmonary metastasis on preoperative chest computed tomography (CT). The patient underwent total thyroidectomy, bilateral central and lateral neck dissection. Histopathologic findings were consistent with high grade DS-PTC involving both thyroid lobes and the isthmus as well as 26 of 98 lymph nodes. Positive extrathyroidal and extranodal extension was present as well as extensive angioinvasion in the tumor. AJCC TNM staging was pT4aN1bM0. The lesion was of ATA high risk. Somatic oncogene molecular testing revealed a NCOA4 :: RET fusion (Fig. 11).

RET mutation risk category and age in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are linked, with onset and aggressiveness differing by risk group. The onset of MTC is significantly age related across the RET mutation risk categories, and compared with moderate-risk RET mutations, high-risk RET mutations are associated with an MTC onset nearly two decades earlier and presumably with greater MTC aggressiveness.

### Molecular pathology of thyroid tumours of follicular cells: a review of genetic alterations and their clinicopathological relevance [^116D7SXB]. Histopathology (2018). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. Knowledge of the molecular pathology of thyroid tumours originating from follicular cells has greatly advanced in the past several years. Common molecular alterations, such as BRAF p.V600E, RAS point mutations, and fusion oncogenes (RET-PTC being the prototypical example), have been, respectively, associated with conventional papillary carcinoma, follicular-patterned tumours (follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma, and the follicular variant of papillary carcinoma/non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features), and with papillary carcinomas from young patients and arising after exposure to ionising radiation, respectively. The remarkable correlation between genotype and phenotype shows how specific, mutually exclusive molecular changes can promote tumour development and initiate a multistep tumorigenic process that is characterised by aberrant activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-PTEN-AKT signalling. Molecular alterations are becoming useful biomarkers for diagnosis and risk stratification, and as potential treatment targets for aggressive forms of thyroid carcinoma. What follows is a review of the principal genetic alterations of thyroid tumours originating from follicular cells and of their clinicopathological relevance.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^113eFvXf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid carcinoma — anaplastic carcinoma, diagnostic and perioperative notes — state to consider core or open biopsy if FNA is "suspicious" for ATC or is not definitive, with morphologic diagnosis combined with immunohistochemistry necessary to exclude other entities; molecular testing should include BRAF, NTRK, ALK, RET, MSI, dMMR, and tumor mutational burden, and BRAF IHC testing is recommended due to faster turnaround compared to genetic testing. Preoperative evaluations need to be completed as quickly as possible and involve integrated decision-making in a multidisciplinary team and with the patient, and consider referral to multidisciplinary high-volume center with expertise in treating ATC. Resectability for locoregional disease depends on extent of involved structures, potential morbidity, and mortality associated with resection, and in most cases, there is no indication for a debulking surgery.

### Revised American Thyroid Association guidelines for the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma [^113qNpSj]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Morphological examination of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) — key immunohistochemistry (IHC), C‑cell hyperplasia (CCH) criteria, concurrent tumors, and microcarcinoma outcomes are described as follows: MTC cells express cytokeratins, NKX2.1, and chromogranin A, with calcitonin (Ctn) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) the most important markers, and the IHC reactivity of Ctn is often reduced whereas CEA is almost always strongly positive. Simultaneous MTC and papillary thyroid carcinoma occurred in 26 (2.6%) of 1019 PTCs, 6 (2.6%) of 235 hereditary MTCs, and 20 (4.1%) of 492 sporadic MTCs, totaling 3.6% among 727 German patients, versus 13.8% of 196 patients in Italy and 19% of 53 patients in Korea. CCH diagnosis is supported by more than seven C‑cells per cluster, complete follicles surrounded by C‑cells, and distribution beyond normal anatomy, with normal C‑cells restricted to the junction of the upper third and lower two‑thirds of the lateral lobes; secondary CCH is not a premalignant condition. In presumed sporadic MTC with CCH or multifocal hyperplasia after whole‑gland examination, patients should be evaluated for the presence of RET germline mutations. Microcarcinoma is defined as MTC < 1 cm and without capsular invasion; in a series of 776 patients with MTC, 232 (30%) had microcarcinomas, with hereditary cases showing lymph node metastases from 6% to 62%; cure rates from 96% to 71% and sporadic cases 13% to 43%; cure rates from 85% to 77%, while distant metastases in medullary thyroid microcarcinoma were only 1.3%.

### Impact of ultrasonographic features, cytomorphology and mutational testing on malignant and indeterminate thyroid nodules on diagnostic accuracy of fine needle cytology samples: a prospective analysis of 141 patients [^111v9skd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

In an attempt to improve accuracy in the indeterminate FNC category, several studies have evaluated different biological markers in thyroid FNC. Early immunohistochemical markers such as galectin‐3, 11 HBME‐1 12 and cytokeratin 19 13 have yielded less than optimal results. The relative low specificity and lack of reproducibility among different laboratories make immunohistochemical studies difficult to use as a daily diagnostic tool to differentiate benign from malignant thyroid lesions.

Advancements in molecular studies have allowed the identification of genetic alterations associated with different follicular cell‐derived neoplasms in thyroid. 14, 15, 16 Molecular tests on FNC samples significantly improve the accuracy of the cytological diagnosis of thyroid nodules, which could have a significant impact on clinical care. 9, 10, 17

A number of genetic mutations are associated with thyroid cancer. The most common genetic mutations in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are point mutations involving BRAF and RAS genes, while the most common chromosomal rearrangement is RET/PTC, which is involved in the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. 18, 19, 20 These mutations are found in more than 70% of PTCs, and most of the times, are mutually exclusive. 11, 13 RAS mutations or PAX8/PPARɣ rearrangement, which are mutually exclusive, occur in approximately 80% of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) 14; 60% of poorly differentiated and anaplastic tumours are due to mutations of BRAF and RAS genes. 21, 22 Medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) (both hereditary and sporadic types) frequently present point mutations in RET gene. In fact, MTC is transmitted in an autosomal‐dominant pattern in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome (MEN 2A and MEN 2B) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). 15 In cases where cytological analysis of a given thyroid neoplasm is unable to formulate a definitive diagnosis, information on the presence of specific mutations related to thyroid carcinogenesis may be useful and may provide elements for a correct histological diagnosis. 22, 23, 24

### Molecular profile and clinical-pathologic features of the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. An unusually high prevalence of ras mutations [^116nCpLW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The follicular variant (FV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma is characterized by a follicular growth pattern and cytologic features of papillary carcinoma. ret/PTC rearrangements are common in classic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and PAX8-PPAR gamma and ras mutations in follicular thyroid carcinoma. Their prevalence in FV has not been established. We studied these genetic alterations and clinical-pathologic features in 30 FV cases and compared those with 46 non-FV papillary carcinomas. FV cases revealed 1 ret/PTC rearrangement (3%) and 13 ras mutations (43%). Non-FV cases harbored 13 ret/PTC (28%) (P = .006) and no ras mutations (P = .0002). No PAX8-PPAR gamma was found in either group. FV cases demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of tumor encapsulation, angiovascular invasion, and poorly differentiated areas and a lower rate of lymph node metastases. These data indicate that the FV of papillary carcinoma has a distinct set of molecular alterations and is characterized by a high frequency of ras point mutations.

Analysis of genomic alterations and clinico-pathological data

Together, the use of the Oncomine Focus Assay and microfluidic dPCR allowed detection of genomic alterations in 13/16 examined samples, including 8 mutations and 5 fusions. Results of mutations/fusions analysis in function of clinico-pathological characteristics are summarized in Table 4.

Table 4.

In patients with PedCa and AdCa, mutations were detected in 1/4 (25%) and 7/12 (58.3%), respectively, p = 0.56; and fusions were detected in 3/4 (75%) and 2/12 (16.6%), respectively, p = 0.06. In patients with and without history of therapeutic irradiation, mutations were detected with the same frequencies (5/10 (50%), and 3/6 (50%), respectively, p = 1.0). Gene fusions were detected in patients with and without history of irradiation in 5/10 (50%) and 0/6 (0%), respectively, p = 0.09. Most of classical PTCs harbored BRAF V600E mutations or RET/PTC1 fusions, and follicular variant PTCs had RAS mutations (Figure 1).

### Clinicopathological parameters for predicting non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary features (NIFTP) [^116xz52i]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

BRAF V600E is an oncogenic mutation of the BRAF gene, which causes a valine-to-glutamic acid change in codon 600 of the BRAF protein and is associated with more invasive clinicopathologic characteristics of PTC, such as LN metastasis and ETE, and tumor aggressiveness.NRAS mutations occur in 5–15% of patients with thyroid cancers. Moreover, they are a characteristic of the follicular subtype and are found in tumors without BRAF mutations or RET/PTC rearrangements. NRAS mutations in the follicular thyroid carcinoma have been associated with more aggressive disease and distant metastasis.

NIFTPs predominantly have RAS -like mutations. Point mutations in the RAS (NRAS, HRAS, or KRAS) genes are observed in up to 60% of patients with NIFTP, and other point mutations are found in the EIF1AX, PTEN, and DICER1 genes. Gene fusions are noted in the PPARG and THADA genes. BRAF V600E mutations are not detected in NIFTP. However, BRAF K601E mutations are found in about 5% of patients with NIFTP.

Paulson et al. reported that among 27 RAS -mutant thyroid tumors, 15 (56%) showed NRAS mutation, nine (33%) showed HRAS mutation, and three (11%) showed KRAS mutation. Twenty-four cases had preceding FNA biopsy results and NIFTP accounted for 59% of the RAS -mutant carcinomas and 63% of the RAS -mutant carcinomas with indeterminate diagnosis. In our study, NRAS mutation was more commonly found in NIFTP and invasive EFVPTC than in infiltrative FVPTC. However, NRAS mutation could not be used to differentiate NIFTP from invasive EFVPTC.

A previous study has found that a small proportion of patients with NIFTP harbored BRAF V600E mutations. However, complete examination of the parenchyma and the strict use of the no papillae criterion for the diagnosis of NIFTP may have excluded these cases. After the molecular examination of 39 NIFTP cases, Brandler et al. reported that most (67%) patients harbored RAS mutations, of which 72% were NRAS mutations. None of the patients showed BRAF V600E mutations, which is in accordance with previous studies.

### RET fusion genes in pediatric and adult thyroid carcinomas: cohort characteristics and prognosis [^117RcPih]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, RET fusion genes were detected only in PTCs. A few rare cases of RET rearrangements in PDTCs, in eight ATCs, and in two MTCs have been described in the literature. There are also studies in which RET fusions have been found in benign samples, particularly in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Most of these studies were performed around year 2000, when the methods used had substantial technical limitations leading to a high risk of false-positive results. Although no recent case of RET fusion in a benign thyroid sample has been reported, their presence in these tissues has been questioned, the occurrence of RET fusions in Hashimoto's thyroiditis has been reported in recent review articles. In our study, no RET fusion was detected in any of the benign samples. Based on these results we conclude that the identification of an oncogenic RET fusion is associated with a 100% probability of malignancy.

Coexistence of CLT with RET fusion-positive PTC was found in 65.2% of our cases, similarly in pediatric and adult patients. The frequency of this coexistence is higher than the range of 15–40% reported in the literature for PTC cohorts with unknown genetic background. In another study, the authors found a negative correlation between the coexistence of CLT with PTC and the BRAF mutation. In addition, the presence of numerous psammoma bodies was found in our study. The association between them and RET fusions has been previously described. Thus, the presence of coexisting CLT as well as numerous psammoma bodies could indicate a higher probability of RET fusion gene in PTC.

Other examined clinicopathological features that were abundantly identified in RET fusion-positive PTCs were multifocality, extrathyroidal extension, intravascular invasion, LNM, and DM. RET fusion-positive carcinomas were associated with aggressive and invasive behavior. This correlation was also noticed by the authors of studies on small RET fusion-positive cohorts.

### Next-generation sequencing identified that RET variation associates with lymph node metastasis and the immune microenvironment in thyroid papillary carcinoma [^115SbPRj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

In the germline, point mutations of RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. RET somatic point mutations are rare in PTC patients. In this study, two PTC patients had RET point mutations, and the mutation frequency was approximately 50% (Fig. S 3). This suggests that these RET point mutations are most likely a germline variation. Furthermore, although RET point mutation co-occurs with BRAF V600E mutation, the mutation abundance of BRAF V600E was significantly lower than that of RET point mutation, suggesting that a large proportion of tumor cells have only RET point mutation but no BRAF V600E mutation. Indeed, other researchers found that there was no relationship between BRAF V600E mutation and lymph node metastasis in PTC. These suggest that lymph node metastasis may not be caused by the group of PTC cells with BRAF V600E, but is more likely to be caused by the group of PTC cells with only RET point mutations. Of course, further research is needed to confirm this.

Currently, more and more inhibitors targeting RET variation are used in the treatment of human cancers. For example, selpercatinib, a selective RET inhibitor designed to inhibit diverse RET fusions, was used in the thyroid, lung, and other cancers. We and others found that the variation form of the RET gene in the thyroid is mainly gene fusion. This suggests that selpercatinib is an ideal choice for THCA with RET fusion. Indeed, a phase 1–2 clinical trial showed that selpercatinib presents durable efficacy with low-grade toxic effects in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. However, in addition to gene fusion, missense mutations of RET also occur in THCA. Fortunately, ponatinib (AP24534) is a novel potent inhibitor of oncogenic RET mutants associated with THCA. Therefore, we can choose different RET inhibitors based on the mutation types. In clinical practice, a single RET inhibitor may not be effective for patients. Therefore, patients are usually given a combination of drugs. Unfortunately, the combination of RET inhibitors and other targeted drugs is easy to produce resistance. Here, we found that RET variation is associated with TME and CIC activities. Moreover, several immune checkpoints associated genes were upregulated in PTC with RET alteration. This suggests that RET inhibitors plus immunotherapy may be the ideal treatment for malignant tumors, which certainly need further clinical studies.

Clinical evaluation

Table 1 describes the clinical and pathological data of the fifty-one patients with sporadic MTC.

In the thirty-three MTC patients (19 females and 14 males) carrying somatic RET mutations, the mean age at surgery and mean follow-up time were 52.9 years (median 55, range 26–71) and 94.8 months (median 100, range 4–303), respectively. Lymph node and distant metastases were present in 23/33 (69.7%) and 11/31 (35.5%) cases, respectively. According to the TNM classification, four patients (12.1%) had stage I disease, three (9.1%) had stage II, two (6.1%) had stage III and twenty-four (72.7%) had stage IV. At the time of the last clinical screening, nine patients (29.0%) were free of disease, and twenty-two (71.0%) were non-disease free (seven of them were deceased from MTC). The status at last control from two patients was not available. Among the twenty-two patients with persistent disease, ten (47.6%) showed a biochemical persistence of the disease with detectable levels of serum CT, but no evidence of distant metastases, whereas eleven patients (52.4%) were affected by metastatic disease. Clinical data from one case were not available.

### RET activation and clinicopathologic features in poorly differentiated thyroid tumors [^115PHUkP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Poorly differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland (PDC) represents an heterogeneous group of epithelial neoplasms with morphologic features and clinical characteristics intermediate between well differentiated and anaplastic (undifferentiated) carcinomas. Unlike well differentiated tumors, PDCs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The general prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangement in thyroid PDC and its impact on patient outcome are unknown. To address these issues and to identify prognostically relevant clinicopathologic parameters, we have investigated a series of 62 PDCs. RET/PTC rearrangement, analyzed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for the tyrosine kinase and juxtamembrane portions of the RET protein, was identified in 8/62 (12.9%) PDCs. RET/PTC was more common in cases with histologic evidence indicating coexistence with or possible evolution from a well differentiated papillary carcinoma (5 of 25 tumors, 20%) but did not correlate with other clinicopathologic parameters. The relatively low prevalence of RET activation in PDCs argues against a major role for RET/PTC in the progression from well to poorly differentiated thyroid tumor phenotypes. Survival analysis demonstrates that poor survival in PDC is associated with old age, male sex, invasion of extrathyroidal soft tissues, coexistence in the same tumor of oncocytic features with insular growth pattern, and distant metastases but not RET activation.

NIFTP — classification, risk, prevalence, and molecular testing: NIFTP, formerly known as noninvasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC), is characterized by follicular growth, encapsulation or clear demarcation with no invasion, and papillary-type nuclear features; NIFTP tumors have a low risk for adverse outcomes and therefore require less aggressive treatment, and the entity was re-classified in 2016 with CAP protocols updated in June 2017. A systematic review of 29 studies reported pooled prevalence within EFVPTC of 43.5% (95% CI, 33.5%–54.0%) and within PTC of 4.4% (95% CI, 2.0%–9.0%), and a 2021 meta-analysis reported incidence among PTCs or other thyroid malignancies of 6.0% (95% CI, 4.4%–8.2%). Currently available molecular diagnostic tests were not validated using NIFTP samples; reported alterations include RAS, PAX8/PPARγ, and/or BRAF (with the exception of the aggressive BRAF V600E mutations), differing from subtypes that more frequently show BRAF V600E and RET/PTC alterations.

Indeterminate thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) molecular test types — the largest prospective studies have evaluated a seven-gene panel of mutations and rearrangements "(BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC, PAX8/PPARγ)", a gene expression classifier "(167 genes; mRNA expression of 167 genes)", and galectin-3 immunohistochemistry (cell blocks); mutational testing has been proposed for use as a rule-in test because of relatively high reported specificity "(86%–100%)".

The identification of capsular invasion is not difficult if invasion through the full thickness of a capsule can be readily identified (Figures 1 and 2). However, there is no consensus on whether tumor cells infiltrating INTO, but not through a capsule, represent invasion. Is invasion identified when the infiltration extends into the inner third of the capsule, must it go halfway through, or should the term be restricted only to invasion that penetrates through the full thickness of the capsule? The answer to this dilemma can often be obtained by examining multiple sections taken at different levels through the region of interest. In some cases, the invasion will become unequivocal (Figure 2), but in others, it disappears. The challenge in the latter situation is that the invasion may have been present in sections in the opposite direction, but that will never be known. In fact, the lack of invasive growth can never be proven, even if one submits the entire intersection of the tumor and nontumorous parenchyma for microscopic examination. The problem is compounded by the fact that almost no patient comes to surgery without a previous biopsy of the lesion, and that procedure can create artifact with fibrosis that can trap tumors and cause irregularity of the capsule, mimicking capsular invasion (supplementary material, Figure S1). The clue to this phenomenon is the identification of a biopsy site in close proximity to the focus of apparent invasion. In reality, additionally, the aggressiveness of diagnosing capsular invasion may also be driven by the identification of RAS‐like cytologic atypia in follicular patterned thyroid tumors.

### Molecular pathology of hereditary and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas [^112pvhrb]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a relatively uncommon type of thyroid malignancy, with unique histologic features and molecular pathology. It is important to recognize, because its management, which is in part driven by the genetic basis of this disease, is different from follicular-derived thyroid tumors. The aim of this article is to briefly review the histopathologic features of MTC and then explore its molecular pathology, including the role of molecular diagnostic testing and the use of targeted therapy for advanced disease.

Methods

A review of published literature was performed.

Results

A subset of MTC cases is hereditary and due to germline mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase receptor gene. Somatic mutations in either RET or RAS are also present in most sporadic tumors.

Conclusions

Molecular genetic testing is routinely performed to identify hereditary cases. In addition, understanding the molecular basis of both hereditary and sporadic MTC has led to the development of targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although additional data are needed, tumor mutation status may affect response to targeted therapy. Therefore, it is possible that genetic testing of tumor tissue to predict treatment response, as is currently done for other cancer types, may come into practice in the future.

### Medullary and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland occurring as a collision tumour: report of three cases with molecular analysis and review of the literature [^114gqVbN]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

We report the simultaneous occurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), presenting as spatially distinct and well-defined tumour components, in three cases. In the first patient, histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrated an MTC in the one nodule and PTC in two additional lesions. Non-neoplastic thyroid parenchyma separated the three nodules. Metastasis from PTC was diagnosed in a regional lymph node. Genetic analysis of both tumour components showed a distinctive mutational pattern: in the MTC a Cys634Arg substitution in exon 11 of the RET gene and in the two PTC foci a Val600Glu substitution in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. The other two patients are members of a large multigenerational family affected with familial MTC due to a germline mutation of the RET gene (Ala891Ser). Both patients harboured, besides medullary cancer and C-cell hyperplasia, distinct foci of papillary thyroid cancer, which was positive for Val600Glu BRAF mutation. Review of the literature disclosed 18 similar lesions reported and allowed the identification of different patterns of clinical presentation and biological behaviour. So far, the pathogenesis of these peculiar cases of thyroid malignancy has been completely unknown, but an underlying common genetic drive has been hypothesised. This is the first report in which two mutations, in the RET and BRAF genes, have been identified in three cases of MTC/PTC collision tumour, thus documenting the different genetic origin of these two coexisting carcinomas.

### Coexisting RET / PTC and TERT promoter mutation predict poor prognosis but effective RET and MEK targeting in thyroid cancer [^1156rCRU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

RET is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor tyrosine kinase, encoded by the proto-oncogene RET and containing an intracellular catalytic tyrosine kinase domain. Activating genetic alterations of RET include mutations in familial medullary thyroid cancer and MEN2 syndrome and, more commonly, genetic rearrangements in sporadic PTC — seen in about 25% of adult PTC and 50% of pediatric PTC.

RET rearrangement was first identified in PTC, hence designated as RET/PTC, in which the RET tyrosine kinase domain is fused to the N-terminus of a partner gene, resulting in ligand-independent constitutive kinase activation, which can activate both MAPK and PI3K pathways, causing oncogenesis and tumor progression. There are many types of RET/PTC rearrangements defined by different fusion partner genes, among which RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 are the most common. Unlike BRAF/RAS mutations, the clinical behaviors and oncogenic nature of RET/PTC rearrangements in PTC are controversial, although they are often shown to be nonaggressive on general analysis. This generates a dilemma in their clinical prognostic application. Inspired by the coexisting BRAF/RAS mutations and TERT promoter mutations in synergistically driving the aggressiveness of PTC, we hypothesize that the TERT promoter status may determine the nature of RET/PTC in affecting clinical outcomes. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the effects of these genetic alterations on the mortality of PTC patients and experimentally defining the molecular mechanism.
