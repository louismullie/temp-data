## Question

A 28-year-old woman presents to your clinic with her third episode of dysuria and urinary frequency in the past six months. She is otherwise healthy, not menopausal, and has no significant past medical history. On further questioning, she reports being in a new relationship and having sexual intercourse several times per week. She is concerned about why she keeps getting urinary tract infections.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most important risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in this patient, and how does this differ from the main risk factors in postmenopausal women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most important risk factor is for recurrent urinary tract infections in a healthy, premenopausal 28-year-old woman with new sexual activity, and how this differs from the main risk factors in postmenopausal women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of recurrent UTI and the baseline epidemiology in premenopausal women. Then, I should verify the strongest risk factors in this age group and rank them by evidence strength. Next, I will contrast these with the dominant risk factors in postmenopausal women and the pathophysiology behind them. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer and note any nuances or exceptions I need to check.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as at least three UTIs in 12 months or two in 6 months, and in otherwise healthy, nonpregnant women, most episodes are uncomplicated lower-tract infections due to reinfection rather than relapse, which frames both evaluation and counseling [^113fX5G2] [^113Ruog8].

> Now, I should identify the strongest risk factor in this 28-year-old. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy of risk factors in premenopausal women. Multiple sources consistently identify sexual intercourse frequency as the most important modifiable risk factor, with risk rising notably when intercourse occurs three or more times per week, alongside related sexual exposures such as new or multiple partners and spermicide use; a personal history of UTI before age 15 and maternal or family history also contribute, but sexual activity remains the dominant driver in this age group [^113fX5G2] [^111x7rEJ] [^111PCAzk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the magnitude and mechanism. Higher intercourse frequency increases opportunities for periurethral colonization and mechanical introduction of uropathogens, particularly E. coli, into the bladder, which explains the dose-response relationship with frequency and the clustering of infections around new sexual relationships; this mechanistic plausibility aligns with the epidemiologic signal seen across observational and guideline summaries [^113fX5G2] [^111x7rEJ].

> Next, I should review how this differs in postmenopausal women. In contrast to premenopausal patients, the main risk factors in postmenopausal women are hypoestrogenism and its urogenital sequelae, including vaginal atrophy, altered vaginal microbiota, and structural changes such as cystocele and postvoid residual, with diabetes and functional impairment adding risk; importantly, sexual activity is less predictive in this group after multivariable adjustment, whereas vaginal estrogen therapy is a key, evidence-based preventive intervention [^114AHHdU] [^111LLGES] [^111pjbSb] [^1177BtnJ].

> I need to ensure I capture the pathophysiology correctly. Estrogen deficiency after menopause thins the uroepithelium, raises vaginal pH, reduces Lactobacillus dominance, and impairs antimicrobial peptide expression and epithelial barrier integrity, collectively increasing susceptibility to uropathogen colonization and intracellular reservoirs; these changes are not prominent in reproductive-age women with intact estrogen, which is why sexual exposure predominates in the younger group [^114HvSQ3] [^114FBmxz] [^111pjbSb].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions or confounders in this case? I should confirm that no anatomic or functional red flags are present. In women under 40 with recurrent cystitis and no complicating features, routine imaging or cystoscopy is not recommended, and the focus should remain on behavioral risk modification and, if indicated, non-antibiotic or targeted antibiotic prevention rather than extensive urologic workup [^115qww6W] [^112vArZP].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer. For this 28-year-old, the most important risk factor is frequent sexual intercourse, particularly at or above three times per week, especially in the context of a new sexual relationship; counseling on postcoital voiding, hydration, and, if recurrences persist, considering non-antibiotic strategies such as increased fluid intake and, selectively, cranberry or methenamine, or antibiotic prophylaxis tailored to sexual exposure, is appropriate, whereas in postmenopausal women the priority is to address hypoestrogenism with vaginal estrogen and manage comorbidities like diabetes and urinary retention [^113fX5G2] [^113jrqYk] [^111kzGSH] [^1177BtnJ].

---

The most important risk factor for recurrent UTIs in a healthy, premenopausal 28-year-old woman is **frequent sexual intercourse** (≥ 3 times/week), especially with new or multiple partners, due to increased bacterial introduction into the urinary tract [^113fX5G2] [^111x7rEJ]. In contrast, **estrogen deficiency and vaginal atrophy** are the primary drivers of rUTIs in postmenopausal women, with vaginal estrogen therapy recommended to restore urogenital defenses and reduce recurrence [^1177BtnJ] [^115PjemB]. Management should be tailored: address sexual risk factors and consider non-antibiotic strategies in premenopausal women, while prioritizing vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal patients [^113jrqYk] [^1177BtnJ].

---

## Risk factors for recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women

Several factors contribute to rUTIs in premenopausal women, including:

- **Sexual activity**: Frequent intercourse (≥ 3 times/week), new or multiple partners, and spermicide use increase risk by facilitating bacterial entry into the urinary tract [^113fX5G2] [^111x7rEJ].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Personal history of UTI before age 15 and maternal/family history of UTIs increase susceptibility [^111x7rEJ].

- **Behavioral factors**: Delayed voiding, inadequate hydration, and poor hygiene practices can promote bacterial growth and colonization [^1171Aajo].

Among these, **sexual activity is the most significant modifiable risk factor** in healthy premenopausal women [^113fX5G2].

---

## Risk factors for recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal women

In postmenopausal women, rUTIs are primarily driven by **physiological changes** associated with estrogen deficiency:

- **Estrogen deficiency**: Lower estrogen levels cause vaginal atrophy, altered vaginal flora, and decreased epithelial defenses, increasing susceptibility to infection [^1177BtnJ] [^114HvSQ3].

- **Structural changes**: Pelvic organ prolapse, cystocele, and urinary incontinence contribute to incomplete bladder emptying and bacterial retention [^1116K7UU].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppression further elevate risk [^114AHHdU].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Understanding these differences guides **targeted management**:

| **Risk factor** | **Premenopausal women** | **Postmenopausal women** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary driver | Sexual activity | Estrogen deficiency |
| Management | - Behavioral modifications <br/> - Postcoital prophylaxis <br/> - Non-antibiotic options (e.g. cranberry, methenamine) [^113jrqYk] [^115mVcrU] | - Vaginal estrogen therapy [^1177BtnJ] <br/> - Address structural abnormalities [^notfound] <br/> - Manage comorbidities [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

In a healthy, premenopausal 28-year-old woman, **frequent sexual intercourse** is the most important risk factor for recurrent UTIs, whereas in postmenopausal women, **estrogen deficiency and vaginal atrophy** are the primary drivers. Management should be individualized: address sexual risk factors and consider non-antibiotic strategies in premenopausal women, and prioritize vaginal estrogen therapy in postmenopausal patients [^113fX5G2] [^1177BtnJ].

### Common questions about recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113fX5G2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women, including healthy women with normal genitourinary anatomy. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as three or more UTIs within 12 months, or two or more occurrences within six months. The same species that caused previous infections is typically responsible for recurrences. In premenopausal women, sexual intercourse three or more times per week, spermicide use, new or multiple sex partners, and having a UTI before 15 years of age are established risk factors. In postmenopausal women, risk is primarily increased by sequelae of lower estrogen levels. Episodes of recurrent UTI are typically characterized by dysuria and urinary frequency or hesitancy. Findings from the history or physical examination that suggest complicated infection or another disease process warrant additional evaluation. At least one symptomatic episode should be verified by urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Imaging is rarely warranted. Short courses of antibiotics are as effective as longer courses. Patient-initiated treatment lowers the cost of diagnosis, number of physician visits, and number of symptomatic days compared with physician-initiated treatment. It also reduces antibiotic exposure compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis effectively limits UTI recurrence but increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Cranberry products may reduce recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women, but are less effective than antibiotic prophylaxis, and data are conflicting. Optimal dosing is unknown. Postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis may benefit from topical estrogen therapy.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^113ZsabT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Risk factors, demographic profiles, and management of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infections: a single institution study [^115Pr7yj]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) are a common urologic chief complaint. Although rUTIs are a significant burden on the healthcare system, until recently there were no published guidelines to delineate optimal management of this condition. The objective of this study was to describe the demographic profile of rUTI patients and summarize practice patterns at a single tertiary health center, as well as to assess whether our real-life practice patterns parallel the recently published guidelines.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective record review of female patients presenting for diagnosis of uncomplicated rUTI/cystitis between October 2010 and September 2018. Analyses were conducted to investigate (a) whether pre- versus postmenopausal women differed in their risk factors for rUTI, (b) whether providers adjust their practice patterns when treating pre- versus postmenopausal women with rUTIs, and (c) whether certain treatment regimens led to lower rates of rUTI than others.

Results

Of the 125 cases included in the final analysis, pre- versus postmenopausal women did differ in their risk factors for rUTI, specifically age, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and comorbidities. Although common treatments were found across menopausal status, providers did adjust their practice patterns when treating pre- versus postmenopausal women, including the use of postcoital suppression, conservative measures, cranberry juice/extract, and probiotics for premenopausal women and daily suppression and vaginal estrogens for postmenopausal women. rUTI after treatment (< 40%) was highest after the use of conservative measures for all women and rates of rUTI after treatment generally did not differ as a function of menopausal status, but rather by treatment option.

Conclusions

This single institution report sheds light on practice patterns at a major academic center, specifically as it compares to the new American Urological Association guidelines and the use of estrogen cream for postmenopausal women.

(Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B)". Patients already on systemic estrogen can still receive vaginal estrogen because "Patients who present with rUTI and are already on systemic estrogen therapy can and should still be placed on vaginal estrogen therapy" and "There is no substantially increased risk of adverse events". The guideline also states "However, systemic estrogen therapy should not be recommended for treatment of rUTI", and, given formulation uncertainty, "there was insufficient evidence to favor one formulation of vaginal estrogen over another", so "clinicians should recommend the formulation of vaginal estrogen that is preferred by the patient".

### Updates in clinical management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^1171guRo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and burdensome in women. Here, we discuss challenges with our current models of care and how evolving insights into the female urogenital microbiome have advanced the understanding of how we diagnose, treat, and prevent recurrent UTIs in nonpregnant adult women. Traditional care models attribute recurrent UTIs mainly to gastrointestinal sources, resulting in significant emphasis on eradicating pathogens with potential overreliance on antibiotics. Evidence now shows that the bladder harbors a complex microbiome, with interactions between the urinary and vaginal environments and immune mechanisms at the bladder mucosal surface influencing infection susceptibility. Thus, in updated models of care, more emphasis is placed on enhancing the protective microbiome. This may be especially important in postmenopausal women, who experience microbiome shifts that increase vulnerability to recurrent infections, underscoring the role of estrogen therapy and microbiome-supportive interventions. Updated treatment approaches emphasize antimicrobial stewardship, advocating for confirmation of the diagnosis and delayed antibiotic initiation when safe, and judicious use of antibiotics for symptom relief. Prevention strategies highlight the importance of vaginal estrogen, methenamine salts, and other supplements rather than exclusive reliance on prophylactic antibiotics. Ongoing research into emerging therapies such as UTI vaccines and bacteriophage drugs may further decrease our reliance on antibiotics in the future. This clinical update underscores the need for individualized care plans that balance effective infection management while minimizing antibiotic-related harms, emphasizing a holistic, microbiome-centered approach to recurrent UTI prevention and treatment.

### D-mannose for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection among women: a randomized clinical trial [^115SQikz]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Summary of Findings

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial provides strong evidence that-mannose did not reduce the proportion of women with a history of rUTI experiencing a further UTI for which they contacted ambulatory care, with 95% CIs excluding the minimum treatment effect considered important by the patient advisory panel. This was unchanged when we compared premenopausal and postmenopausal status and those with higher vs lower numbers of previous UTIs or in sensitivity analyses, including per protocol analyses. The secondary outcomes were similar in both groups: we found no difference in symptom burden, time to the next UTI or number of UTIs, antibiotic use, hospitalizations, or serious adverse events. A similar proportion of women in both study groups believed themselves to have been allocated to-mannose.

### Oestrogens for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in postmenopausal women [^1116K7UU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infection (RUTI) is defined as three episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the previous 12 months or two episodes in the last six months. The main factors associated with RUTI in postmenopausal women are vesical prolapse, cystocoele, post-voidal residue and urinary incontinence, all associated with a decrease in oestrogen. The use of oestrogens to prevent RUTI has been proposed.

Objectives

To estimate the efficacy and safety of oral or vaginal oestrogens for preventing RUTI in postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), reference lists of articles without language restriction. Date of last search: February 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which postmenopausal women (more than 12 months since last menstrual period) diagnosed with RUTI received any type of oestrogen (oral, vaginal) versus placebo or any other intervention were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Authors extracted data and assessed quality. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Nine studies (3345 women) were included. Oral oestrogens did not reduce UTI compared to placebo (4 studies, 2798 women: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33). Vaginal oestrogens versus placebo reduced the number of women with UTIs in two small studies using different application methods. The RR for one was 0.25 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.50) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.86) in the second. Two studies compared oral antibiotics versus vaginal oestrogens (cream (1), pessaries (1)). There was very significant heterogeneity and the results could not be pooled. Vaginal cream reduced the proportion of UTIs compared to antibiotics in one study and in the second study antibiotics were superior to vaginal pessaries. Adverse events for vaginal oestrogens were breast tenderness, vaginal bleeding or spotting, nonphysiologic discharge, vaginal irritation, burning and itching.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on only two studies comparing vaginal oestrogens to placebo, vaginal oestrogens reduced the number of UTIs in postmenopausal women with RUTI, however this varied according to the type of oestrogen used and the treatment duration.

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^114K1pYv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This retrospective study spanning 5 years assessed risk factors associated with rUTI, an important source of morbidity among women of all ages. This study describes one of the largest and most recent and diverse cohorts of women with rUTIs to date. We found that rUTI is common, occurring in nearly 15% of women following an incident uUTI, underscoring the high frequency of UTI recurrences and the substantial burden of UTIs in women. Prior studies have defined UTI recurrences in several ways. Nevertheless, the rUTI rate that we observed (14.5%) is similar to that of ≥ 3 UTIs (index UTI plus ≥ 2 rUTIs) within 12 months of an index UTI observed in a smaller population (13%). However, it is lower than that of rUTI when defined as ≥ 2 UTIs (index UTI plus 1 rUTI) within 6 months of an index UTI in college-age women, who may be at greater risk of rUTI (26.6%), and when defined more permissively as ≥ 2 UTIs (index UTI plus ≥ 1 rUTI) within 12 months of an index UTI (26%).

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^111dDAdN]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause — recurrent urinary tract infections: In patients with GSM and recurrent urinary tract infections, clinicians should recommend local low-dose vaginal estrogen to reduce the risk for future urinary tract infections (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In a randomized study of postmenopausal women, the likelihood of being UTI-free at four months was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88–1.00) with vaginal estrogen versus 0.30 (95% CI: 0.16–0.46) with placebo, and at the end of follow-up the median incidence rate of UTI was 0.5 per patient year in the treatment arm versus 5.9 per patient year in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Another trial randomized 108 postmenopausal women to a 2mg vaginal ring (n = 53) or placebo (n = 55) and at the end of the 36-week follow-up, 45% of patients in the treatment arm were disease free versus 20% in the control group. A smaller study of 35 postmenopausal women followed for 6 months found intention-to-treat documented UTI in 11/18 treatment versus 16/17 placebo (p = 0.041), with as-treated 8/15 versus 10/15 by end of follow-up (p = 0.036). A systematic review reported reduced UTI frequency across 14 placebo-controlled studies (n = 4232 patients), whereas in 18 studies comparing estrogen types (n = 2236) evidence was insufficient to determine which estrogen intervention was better; the Recurrent Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections in Women: AUA/CUA/SUFU Guideline (2022) also recommends the use of local low-dose vaginal estrogen to reduce the risk for rUTI in peri- and postmenopausal women.

### Recurrent urinary tract infection and risk of bladder cancer in the nijmegen bladder cancer study [^114bB5qh]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) refer to the presence of microbial pathogens in the urethra or bladder (lower urinary tract), or ureter and pelvis of the kidney (upper urinary tract). In men, the prostate may be involved as well. UTIs are among the most prevalent infectious diseases with varying frequencies among sexes and age categories. About 80% of UTIs occur in women; it is estimated that 40–50% of females experience at least one symptomatic UTI and that half of them will experience a recurrence within 1 year. The majority of UTIs is caused by E. coli and manifests as cystitis. Risk factors for (recurrent) UTI include obstruction of the urinary tract, use of a bladder catheter, a suppressed immune system, oestrogen deficiency, a genetic predisposition, and sexual intercourse, and may differ between men and pre- and postmenopausal women.

There is strong evidence linking infection of the bladder by Schistosoma haematobium, endemic in certain low- and middle-income countries but rare in high-income countries, and by spinal cord injury-related catheter use to squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. However, whether common, recurrent UTIs are involved in the aetiology of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder remains unclear. Several epidemiological studies, most from the second half of the twentieth century and conducted in small populations, have investigated the association between episodes of (lower) UTI and the risk of urinary bladder cancer (UBC). The majority of these studies report increased UBC risks for any vs no UTI, in both men and women, whereas some do not support a positive association. A few studies specifically address the number of UTI episodes or the duration between UTI and UBC diagnosis, the latter to prevent potential misclassification. Overall, positive associations tend to weaken as the time lag between UTI and UBC increases and the number of UTIs decreases. In contrast to these findings, andreport a decreased risk of UBC with an increasing number of kidney and bladder infections with the lowest risk for more than three episodes of infection.

In this study, we analysed data of the Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study (NBCS), one of the largest case–control studies for UBC worldwide, as to gain better insights into the role of recurrent infections of the (lower) urinary tract as a risk factor for UBC.

### Effect of increased daily water intake in premenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections: a randomized clinical trial [^113jrqYk]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Increased hydration is often recommended as a preventive measure for women with recurrent cystitis, but supportive data are sparse.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of increased daily water intake on the frequency of recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, controlled, 12-month trial at a clinical research center (years 2013–2016). Among 163 healthy women with recurrent cystitis (≥ 3 episodes in past year) drinking less than 1.5 L of fluid daily assessed for eligibility, 23 were excluded and 140 assigned to water or control group. Assessments of daily fluid intake, urinary hydration, and cystitis symptoms were performed at baseline, 6- and 12-month visits, and monthly telephone calls.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to drink, in addition to their usual fluid intake, 1.5 L of water daily (water group) or no additional fluids (control group) for 12 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome measure was frequency of recurrent cystitis over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were number of antimicrobial regimens used, mean time interval between cystitis episodes, and 24-hour urinary hydration measurements.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the 140 participants was 35.7 (8.4) years, and the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes in the previous year was 3.3 (0.6). During the 12-month study period, the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.5–1.8) in the water group compared with 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0–3.4) in the control group, with a difference in means of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.8; P < .001). Overall, there were 327 cystitis episodes, 111 in the water group and 216 in the control group. The mean number of antimicrobial regimens used to treat cystitis episodes was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7–2.2) and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.3–4.0), respectively, with a difference in means of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3–2.1; P < .001). The mean time interval between cystitis episodes was 142.8 (95% CI, 127.4–160.1) and 84.4 (95% CI, 75.4–94.5) days, respectively, with a difference in means of 58.4 (95% CI, 39.4–77.4; P < .001). Between baseline and 12 months, participants in the water group, compared with those in the control group, had increased mean (SD) urine volume (1.4 [0.04] vs 0.1 [0.04] L; P < .001) and voids (2.4 [0.2] vs -0.1 [0.2]; P < .001) and decreased urine osmolality (-402.8 [19.6] vs -24.0 [19.5] mOsm/kg; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes of fluid daily.

### Recurrent urinary tract infection and risk of bladder cancer in the nijmegen bladder cancer study [^111TR2pC]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Association between UTI and UBC

A positive history of regular low-UTI was associated with an increased risk of UBC in both men (OR adjusted (95% CI) 6.6 (4.2–11)) and women (OR adj 2.7 (2.0–3.5)). In contrast, a positive history of UTI-ab was associated with a decreased UBC risk, again in both men (OR adj 0.76 (0.61–0.94)) and women (OR adj 0.82 (0.64–1.1)). Stratification on frequency of UTI-ab revealed that the protective effect was only seen for up to five episodes of infection. An increased UBC risk was observed for men with more than 10 UTI-ab episodes (OR adj 6.0 (1.2–30)) but numbers of male patients and controls in this stratum were low (Table 2).

As the symptoms of bladder cancer may be confused with those of a UTI, we repeated the analyses while omitting those regular low-UTI or UTI-ab that took place within 5 years prior to the date of diagnosis of bladder cancer (for patients) or the questionnaire (for controls). Resulting risks were only slightly changed (Table 2) and for subsequent analyses, we did not take the time lag between UTI and UBC into account.

The stratified analyses (Table 4) indicated that the UBC risk increase for regular low-UTI and multiple episodes of UTI-ab was more pronounced in muscle-invasive bladder cancer compared with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The UBC risk decrease for a low number of UTI-ab is specifically observed in those who (had) smoked and the group of subjects that experienced UTI at a younger age (i.e. below the sex-specific median age at onset UTI). For women, large differences in UTI-ab-associated risks for premenopausal (≤ 51 years) vs postmenopausal (> 51 years) state were seen. The decrease of UBC risk for a limited number of UTI-ab was only observed for premenopausal state UTI; a strong increase in risk for UBC was observed for postmenopausal state UTI-ab, irrespective of the number of episodes. Omission of UTI-ab that occurred within 5 years prior to UBC diagnosis/questionnaire led to even higher risks (data not shown).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Fbwkb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in healthy nonpregnant women — screening and treatment recommendation: In healthy premenopausal, nonpregnant women or healthy postmenopausal women, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). The prevalence of ASB in healthy, premenopausal women ranges from 1% to 5%, and in healthy postmenopausal women in the community from 2.8% to 8.6%. While symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs significantly more frequently in women with bacteriuria than in nonbacteriuric women, observational studies report no differences in rates of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, serum creatinine levels, abnormal intravenous pyelogram findings, or mortality in women with or without bacteriuria. Randomized data show there were no differences in the frequency of subsequent UTI during 1 year of follow-up after a 1-week course of nitrofurantoin versus placebo. Prior guideline conclusions were that healthy, premenopausal women with ASB have an increased risk for UTI, but no long-term adverse outcomes, and that treatment of ASB neither decreases the frequency of symptomatic infection nor prevents further episodes of ASB; similarly, the US Preventive Services Task Force stated that evidence does not support screening of nonpregnant women or men for ASB, as improved clinical outcomes cannot be demonstrated. A systematic review concluded antimicrobial treatment of ASB may improve short-term microbiologic outcomes, but resolution is not sustained and there is no measurable improvement in morbidity or mortality. Additional studies reported that during 15 months of follow-up there was no difference in symptomatic UTI and that ASB was not a predictor for symptomatic UTI, while a randomized trial found antimicrobial therapy was an independent risk factor for symptomatic UTI (hazard ratio, 3.09 [95% CI, 2.19–4.20]) with 1 episode of pyelonephritis in the untreated group and 2 in the treated group, noting a high proportion (33%) of Enterococcus species and that symptomatic episodes were not confirmed microbiologically.

### Menopause hormone therapy and urinary symptoms: a systematic review [^117Bu6Gt]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance

Urogenital changes associated with menopause are now classified as genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which includes symptoms of urgency, frequency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections for which the recommended treatment is estrogen. However, the association between menopause and urinary symptoms and the efficacy of hormone therapy for these symptoms is uncertain.

Objective

Our objective was to define the relationship between menopause and urinary symptoms including dysuria, urgency, frequency, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and urge and stress incontinence by conducting a systematic review of the effects of hormone therapy (HT) for urinary symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Evidence Review

Eligible studies included randomized control trials with perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with a primary or secondary outcome of the following urinary symptoms: dysuria, frequent UTI, urgency, frequency, and incontinence, included at least one treatment arm of estrogen therapy, and were in English. Animal trials, cancer studies and pharmacokinetic studies, secondary analyses, and conference abstracts were excluded. PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until April 2022. Two authors reviewed each article with discrepancies resolved through whole group consensus. Data extracted included the following: publication date, country, setting, subject number, follow-up, duration, age, race/ethnicity, study design, inclusion criteria, and main findings.

Findings

There is insufficient evidence to confirm that menopause is associated with urinary symptoms. The effect of HT on urinary symptoms depends on type. Systemic HT may cause urinary incontinence or worsen existing urinary symptoms. Vaginal estrogen improves dysuria, frequency, urge and stress incontinence, and recurrent UTI in menopausal women.

Conclusions and Relevance

Vaginal estrogen improves urinary symptoms and decreases the risk of recurrent UTI in postmenopausal women.

### Evaluation of systemic estrogen for preventing urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women [^111ZUkDh]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines for postmenopausal recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) prevention recommend the use of vaginal topical estrogen products but not systemic estrogens. Studies show that vaginal estrogen decreases the risk of rUTI, but evidence against use of systemic estrogen is less convincing.

Objective

We performed a comprehensive literature review to evaluate the effect of systemic estrogen on UTI occurrence among postmenopausal women.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched for manuscripts published in English between January 1990 and July 2020. The search terms were "urinary tract infection" and "estrogen". Inclusion criteria were studies of postmenopausal women who received systemic estrogen therapy (any regimen) that reported UTI frequency during any follow-up period. Case studies, commentaries, and reviews were excluded. A priori specifications of seven study criteria were set representing the ideal study for assessing efficacy of systemic estrogen for rUTI prevention and were used to evaluate each included study.

Findings

Searches identified 281 results, and after deduplication and review, 8 studies met inclusion criteria: 4 randomized controlled trials, 1 secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, 1 prospective cohort study, 1 case-control study, and 1 cross-sectional study. Of the eight included studies, only two enrolled postmenopausal women with a rUTI diagnosis, four had sufficient sample size to detect a clinically meaningful difference between systemic estrogen versus placebo, two used dosage regimens anticipated to achieve a therapeutic effect, and three assessed UTI rates for an adequate duration of 6months or more (the standard minimum duration of time needed to make a diagnosis of rUTI). Overall, none of the studies met all predefined criteria for the ideal study to assess the efficacy of systemic estrogen for rUTI prevention.

Conclusions and Relevance

UTIs will continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and hospitalizations in postmenopausal women unless more research is done to better understand the role of estrogen on UTI rates. The evidence arguing use (or abandonment) of systemic estrogen for the prevention of rUTI is based on few studies with substantial methodologic limitations; there is significant room for improvement.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^111x7rEJ]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Risk factors — a personal history of UTI before age 15 years and maternal UTI history are rUTI risk factors; a first-degree female relative with a history of at least 5 UTIs confers increased risk; sexual risk factors such as a new sexual partner, intercourse frequency, and spermicide use are more common in premenopausal women; women with pelvic floor disorders are at increased risk, especially postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence; some investigators suggest an association between postvoid residual of at least 50 mL and rUTI; after surgery for stress urinary incontinence there is a transient increased rUTI risk (11%) after retropubic tension-free vaginal tape, beyond the first 6 postoperative weeks rUTI was reported in 2.3% to 2.4% of participants in randomized trials, between 2 and 12 months midurethral sling postoperative rUTI rate was 2.3%, and no cases were reported during a 10-year follow-up of 71 women with transobturator midurethral slings.

### Estrogen for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111pjbSb]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are commonly encountered in postmenopausal women. Optimal non-antimicrobial prophylaxis for rUTIs is an important health issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of estrogen in the prevention of rUTIs versus placebo.

Methods

Eligible studies published up to December 2019 were retrieved through searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews. We included randomized controlled trials of estrogen therapies versus placebo regarding the outcomes of preventing rUTIs. Changes in vaginal pH and estrogen-associated adverse events were also analyzed.

Results

Eight studies including 4702 patients (2367 who received estrogen and 2335 who received placebo) were identified. Five studies including 1936 patients evaluated the use of vaginal estrogen, which resulted in a significant reduction in rUTIs (relative risk, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.30–0.59). Three studies including 2766 patients evaluated the outcomes of oral estrogen in the prevention of UTIs and showed no significant difference in the number of rUTIs compared to treatment with placebo (relative risk, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.92–1.35). Two studies reviewed changes in vaginal pH and showed a lower pH (mean difference, -1.81; 95% CI, -3.10–0.52) after vaginal estrogen therapy. Adverse events associated with vaginal estrogen were reported, including vaginal discomfort, irritation, burning, and itching. There was no significance increase in the vaginal estrogen group (relative risk, 3.06; 95% CI, 0.79–11.90).

Conclusions

Compared with placebo, vaginal estrogen treatment could reduce the number of rUTIs and lower the vaginal pH in postmenopausal women.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^112es4fn]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Women of reproductive age also have a significant risk of UTI. The National Ambulatory Care Survey reported almost 30 million physician office visits for UTI from 2002 to 2007 (6-year count), with women over 45 accounting for over 26 million (> 87%; 60% over 55 years old) of those visits. Hospitalization rates for UTI in women over 65 were 4–45 times higher than for younger women. However, the epidemiology and treatment of UTIs are complicated due to the lack of objective diagnostic measures, including variations in collection (clean catch versus catheterized), lack of routine cultures to confirm diagnosis, nonspecific symptoms, and lack of guidelines on the use of antibiotics.

New evidence showed that urine is not sterile, highlighting our lack of understanding of the roles of asymptomatic versus symptomatic bacteria. In addition, the definition of recurrent infections is debatable, further leading to either lack of appropriate treatment or mistreatment.

The prevalence of bladder pain syndrome (BPS) among women (3.8%) was as high as other painful conditions, such as migraine (2.1%), asthma (3.7%), and back pain (4.1%), and was much more prevalent in women than men. Women with bladder pain also had chronic pelvic pain. Women with BPS less than 30 years of age are more likely to experience urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria, dyspareunia, and pain in their external genitalia than older women who were more likely to experience nocturia, UI, and Hunner's ulcer disease. While we understand the impact BPS has on women, an improved understanding of the etiology is needed to develop targeted and effective therapies.

Menopause and aging

Menopause is associated with higher risk of recurrent UTI, UI, LUTSs, and OAB, among other conditions. In addition, there is limited understanding of whether hormones affect urological function and, if so, the underlying mechanism(s). For instance, 70% of women reported onset of UI at the onset of menopause, but epidemiological studies that controlled for age suggested the effect might be driven by aging and not menopause specifically.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^114TV6QX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in women and are frequently defined as ≥ 2 episodes in the last 6 months or ≥ 3 episodes in the last 12 months. In a primary care setting, 53% of women above the age of 55 years and 36% of younger women report a recurrence within 1 year. Thus, management and prevention of recurrent UTI is of utmost significance. This review aims to highlight the latest research in prevention strategies and suggest a management pathway.

Methods

A search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases for the latest systematic reviews and high-quality randomized controlled trials. Special emphasis was placed on the remit "recurrent" and strongly adhered to. Furthermore, a Google search was conducted for current guidelines on the management of UTIs.

Results

Current prevention strategies include eliminating risk factors that increase the risk of acquiring recurrent UTI and continuous, post-coital and self-initiated antimicrobial prophylaxis. Other prospective preventative strategies, currently under trial, include use of vaccinations, D-mannose and lactobacillus (probiotics).

Conclusion

Although risk factors should be identified and addressed accordingly, individualized antibiotic prophylaxis remains the most effective method of management. Non-antibiotic prevention strategies such as cranberry, vitamin C and methenamine salts lack strong evidence to be introduced as routine management options and as alternatives to antibiotics. Based on current evidence and guidelines, a management pathway is recommended. Emerging therapies require further evaluation before they can be recommended.

### Associations of estrogen with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for dementia: a narrative review [^112k7Wp9]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3 Infection

Males (both human and other species) appear to be more susceptible to infections than females are, with differences in susceptibility to, and sequelae of, bacterial and viral infections, as well as differences in the immune response. It is likely that these differences are driven by a complex picture of sex steroids as well as genetic and epigenetic factors. Estrogens are known to interact with, and regulate, both inflammation and immune pathways, altering the responses of host cells to microbes. In viral and bacterial infection and pathogenesis, estrogens and estrogen receptors regulate innate immune responses, such as by preventing the production of the type 1 interferons which are important in the immune cascade, and by suppressing proinflammatory cytokines.

Some viruses are known to change the duration or regularity of the menstrual cycle, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), although studies on this topic do not report on underlying associations with estrogen levels in relation to these changes. Pregnancy is a unique period for the immune system, with adaptations to protect the mother and the developing fetus, reducing risk of immune‐mediated fetal rejection while providing a mechanism to transfer maternal antibodies to the developing fetus. During this time of complex physiological and immune changes, viral infections can be associated with significant adverse effects for both the mother (such as SARS‐CoV‐2) and the fetus (such as the rubella virus). Estrogens are important for stimulating placental vascular endothelial growth factor, stimulating the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (particularly in the first trimester), and supporting an environment in the second and third trimesters in which there are reduced proinflammatory and increased anti‐inflammatory cytokine concentrations(see Creisher and Klein for a detailed reviewed of the pathogenesis of viral infections during pregnancy). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections seen within the health‐care system, with both pregnant and postmenopausal women at a high risk of non‐recurrent and recurrent UTIs. Recurrent UTIs can have many serious complications, ranging from sepsis to increased risk for, or acceleration of, several neuropsychiatric disorders. Changes in estrogen concentrations during the menopausal transition are thought to be one of the explanatory factors behind this increased risk for recurrent UTIs. Exogenous estrogen, in the form of local vaginal therapies, is a recommended treatment option for the prevention of UTIs in this population, although the evidence for the use of systemic estrogen is weaker. Further research is needed to uncover associations between estrogens and infections in the context of hormonal contraceptive and HRT use.

### Estrogens and the lower urinary tract [^113QMBwq]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

The urogenital tract is sensitive to the effect of oestrogen and progesterone throughout adult life. Epidemiological studies have implicated oestrogen deficiency in the aetiology of lower urinary tract symptoms occurring following the menopause. Although to date the role of oestrogen replacement therapy in the management of postmenopausal urinary incontinence remains controversial its use in the management of women complaining of urogenital atrophy is now well established. This aim of this paper is to review the recent evidence regarding the urogenital effects of hormone therapy with a particular emphasis on the management of postmenopausal urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, recurrent lower urinary tract infections and urogenital atrophy. In addition to a review of the available evidence suggestions are also made regarding priorities for further research in the field.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a review [^113vT7KH]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections most often present with symptoms of irritative voiding. In most cases, they are caused by reinfection with a previously isolated organism. Patients with one or more symptoms of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection should undergo thorough examination and screening for underlying comorbidities that increase susceptibility. When frequent reinfections, empiric treatment relapse, persistent infections, or risk factors for complicated infections are encountered, patients may benefit from urodynamics, cystoscopy, renal ultrasound, intravenous urogram, or voiding cystourethrogram to evaluate for anatomic, functional, or metabolic abnormalities affecting the urinary tract (e.g., stones, stricture, obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, lesions, detrusor underactivity). These patients may benefit from culture-guided empiric treatment and further evaluation by urology, nephrology, or infectious disease specialists. In patients with a history of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, empiric treatment guided by local antimicrobial resistance may efficiently treat a suspected recurrence. After successful treatment of the acute infection, postcoital prophylaxis, continuous prophylaxis, or self-start empiric treatment may be selected based on frequency of recurrent infections, temporal relation to intercourse, and patient characteristics. Ancillary measures such as probiotics, cranberry products, or local estrogen replacement may also be considered. This article will review the current definition, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, work-up, treatment, treatment side effects, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women. A suggested algorithm for evaluation and treatment based on current literature is provided.

### Urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women: effect of hormone therapy and risk factors [^116F5RuA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of hormone therapy on urinary tract infection frequency and to examine potential risk factors.

Methods

We used data from the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, a randomized, blinded trial of the effects of hormone therapy on coronary heart disease events among 2763 postmenopausal women aged 44–79 with established coronary heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate or placebo and followed for a mean of 4.1 years. History of physician-diagnosed urinary tract infections and risk factors were assessed by self-report at baseline and each annual visit.

Results

Urinary tract infection frequency was higher in the group randomized to hormone treatment, although the difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99, 1.37). Statistically significant risk factors for urinary tract infections in multivariable analysis included: women with diabetes on treatment (insulin OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.40, 2.34), oral medications OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09, 1.90), poor health (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14, 1.57), childbirth (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00, 1.90), vaginal itching (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.07, 2.50), vaginal dryness (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.04, 1.67), and urge incontinence (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.30, 1.75). Urinary tract infections in the previous year were strongly associated with a single urinary tract infection (OR 7.00, 95% CI 5.91, 8.29) as well as multiple urinary tract infections (OR 18.51, 95% CI 14.27, 24.02).

Conclusions

Oral hormone therapy did not reduce frequency of urinary tract infections. Potentially modifiable risk factors in postmenopausal women are different from those in younger women, and include diabetes, vaginal symptoms, and urge incontinence.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^111nvBTv]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In 2019 the American Urological Association (AUA) released the evidence-based guideline "Recurrent Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections in Women: AUA/CUA/SUFU Guideline". Information supporting the guideline came from a 2019 systematic evidence review prepared for the AUA by the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC). The AUA used evidence found for 11 Key Questions (Appendix C) in the EPC's report to derive 16 Guideline Statements. In 2021 the EPC conducted an Update Literature Review (ULR) assessing abstracts from new studies published since the 2019 systematic review. The AUA asked the EPC to further assess a subset of studies included in the ULR report, to support potential changes to the 2019 guideline.

Materials/Methods

A systematic-review utilized research from the Oregon Health & Science University. Pacific Northwest EPC was used to update the 2019 AUA Guideline on rUTI in women with new evidence published through 2021.

Results

Updates were made to reflect changes in literature since 2019. Updates include recent publications on antibiotic prophylaxis, non-antibiotic prophylaxis, and estrogen therapy.

Conclusion

The presence of rUTI is crucial to the health of patients and its effects must be considered for the welfare of society. This document will undergo updating as the knowledge regarding current treatments and future treatment options continues to expand.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — AUA nomenclature linking recommendation type to evidence strength — Strong Recommendations are directive statements that an action should or should not be undertaken because net benefit or net harm is substantial; Moderate Recommendations are directive statements that an action should or should not be undertaken because net benefit or net harm is moderate; and Conditional Recommendations are non-directive statements used when there is no apparent net benefit or harm or the balance between benefits and risks/burden is unclear. All three statement types may be supported by any body of evidence strength grade. For Strong or Moderate Recommendations, Grade A indicates that the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances and future research is unlikely to change confidence; Grade B indicates that the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances, but better evidence could change confidence; and Grade C indicates that the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances, but better evidence is likely to change confidence. Conditional Recommendations also can be supported by any evidence strength; with Grade A the statement indicates that benefits and risks/burdens appear balanced, the best action depends on patient circumstances, and future research is unlikely to change confidence; with Grade B, benefits and risks/burdens appear balanced, the best action also depends on individual patient circumstances and better evidence could change confidence; with Grade C, there is uncertainty regarding the balance between benefits and risks/burdens, alternative strategies may be equally reasonable, and better evidence is likely to change confidence.

### Recurrent urinary tract infection and risk of bladder cancer in the nijmegen bladder cancer study [^1151ahTk]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

A number of the previous studies into the association between UTI and UBC have described a decrease in the OR for UTI and bladder cancer risk after excluding those UTI that occurred within the years prior to UBC diagnosis. These findings support the existence of a diagnostic bias. This is underlined by studies that have described UTI diagnosis as a cause for delay in bladder cancer diagnosis. The results of our study were, however, only marginally affected by omission of infections occurring within 5 years prior to UBC diagnosis.

We showed that our results for UTI-ab were similar for men and women; the increased UBC risk for regular cystitis was higher in men though. However, note that, in contrast to women, regular cystitis is rare among the male population. Further stratified analyses, more or less hampered by limited numbers in specific subcategories, did identify deviating findings in some subgroups. Timing of the onset of UTI was found to be of importance; the protective effect of a small number of UTI-ab was only found for those UTI that were experienced at a relatively young age (i.e. below the sex-specific median age) and the increase in UBC risk for recurrent cystitis was more pronounced for an older age of UTI-onset. Especially the increased risk of bladder cancer for history of UTI-ab, irrespective of frequency, in postmenopausal women was striking and warrants further research. It is notable that these subgroups that showed stronger increased UBC risk for recurrent cystitis, that is, men, those with UTI onset at an older age, and postmenopausal women, are also more likely to experience a complicated and recurrent (course of) UTI because of the presence of anatomical, functional, or metabolic conditions (e.g. prostatitis, diabetes, vaginal atrophy). Furthermore, the higher UBC risk for regular cystitis was much stronger in muscle-invasive bladder cancer compared with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, in line withand. The protective effect of a small number of UTI-ab was only seen in (former) smokers; we could not confirm the positive interaction between smoking and history of cystitis on UBC risk as reported in earlier studies.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^1171Aajo]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most prevalent medical conditions among women in primary care. Approximately 60% of women experience symptomatic acute bacterial cystitis in their lifetime. An estimated 20–40% of women who have had one previous uncomplicated UTI episode are likely to experience recurring UTI. Commonly, recurrent UTI is defined as a recurring UTI with a frequency of three or more episodes in the last 12 months or two or more episodes in the last 6 months. It was shown that the prevalence of UTI (at least one physician-diagnosed UTI per year) increased with age, and in women over 65 years was ~20%, compared with ~11% in the overall population.

Risk factors for recurring UTI can be classified into four categories, (i) factors that decrease normal urogenital flora, e.g. frequent antibiotic use, personal hygiene, spermicide use, diaphragm/pessary use and menopause; (ii) factors that facilitate bacterial entry into the bladder, e.g. sexual intercourse, frequent catheterization and menopause; (iii) factors that decrease bacterial removal, e.g. decreased fluid intake, delayed voiding, incomplete bladder emptying and pelvic organ prolapse and; (iv) factors that impair the immune response, e.g. diabetes, steroid use, tobacco use and HIV/AIDS. A US study among women aged 18–49 years showed that UTI histories in first-degree female relatives were a strong and consistent risk factor with an increased risk for each type of relative and higher risk with greater number of infections. This study has also showed that the risk in women with combined exposures of a family UTI history and sexual intercourse frequency was considerably higher than with either exposure category alone.

The burden of recurring UTI has both personal and societal aspects. The societal burden includes the clinical and economic burden of illness. The personal burden comprises social and psychological effects which have a negative impact on the quality of life. Costs may be both direct and indirect: work absenteeism, for example, can impact both the economy and a patient's sense of wellbeing. Education about behavioural risk factors is advised for women with recurrent infections, but this may be relevant also for women with a recurrence of UTI after an interval of one or more years without UTI.

At present no large population-based studies have determined what proportions of women with uncomplicated UTI develop patterns of recurrences. This paper aims to provide insight in patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated UTI over a 5-year period in community dwelling women.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114xto5v]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^111PCAzk]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### Differences in the pattern of antibiotic prescription profile and recurrence rate for possible urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes [^115g7ucM]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Furthermore, because follow-up was only 30 days, it is possible that pregnant women might have been misclassified (delivery after > 30 days). Another limitation is that the level of sexual activity was unknown despite the fact that this is an important risk factor for UTI in premenopausal women. However, we do not expect that a higher percentage of pregnant women (and therefore women with a complicated UTI) were included in the diabetic women group or that diabetic women had a higher frequency of sexual intercourse. Moreover, pregnant women with a UTI are mostly treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or a cephalosporin in the Netherlands and therefore would not have been included in this study at all. Therefore, it is unlikely that this possible misclassification or lack of information on risk factors would have influenced our results.

Furthermore, no differences were found after analyzing only the prescriptions of the general practitioners. Another limitation is that women with a recurrence could have underlying anatomical abnormalities like bladder neuropathy. Therefore, we excluded all women who had a UTI in the previous year to minimize this group.

In conclusion, we showed that both pre- and postmenopausal women with diabetes and a UTI receive a more aggressive and longer treatment but still have more recurrences of their UTIs than women without diabetes. Whether therapy with a longer duration or an antibiotic with high tissue penetration contributes to lower recurrence rates needs further investigation. Therefore, a prospective randomized control trial with different treatment strategies must determine which treatment strategy is optimal in diabetic women with a UTI.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^116fcpV2]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results show that more than half of the women still visiting the same pharmacy at the end of the study period had at least one recurring dispensing of a guideline antibiotic for uncomplicated UTI during 5 years of follow-up. Within a subsequent year the proportions of another UTI dispensing were between 20% and 23%. This proportion is within the range of 20–40% that was reported earlier for recurrent UTI. A Finnish study among women aged 17–82 years reported 44% UTI recurrence within one year. In these studies recurrent UTIs were defined as three or more episodes in 12 months. Our definition of recurring UTIs was less strict, counting at least one recurring prescription of an UTI antibiotic.

About 2% of the women included in our study received at least one recurring dispensing during every year in five years of follow-up. Most of these women belonged to the age category 51–70 years. In this age category most women are menopausal, and menopause was reported as one of the risk factors for UTI.

As UTI is one of the most prevalent medical conditions among women in primary care and ~60% of women experience symptomatic acute bacterial cystitis in their lifetime, UTI provides a high workload for primary care. In recent years, there have been increasing concerns in several countries about the rising workload in general practice, amongst others caused by the increase of multi-morbidity and chronic diseases, an aging population, and the pressure to reduce access to secondary care. Moreover, the increasing costs of the healthcare system demand changes in the organisation of care. Stimulating patients' self-management to prevent recurring episodes of uncomplicated UTI seems to be a logical approach. There is of course always concern on overuse of antibiotics resulting in increasing antimicrobial resistance.

Women with recurring UTI may need additional care to improve self-management, aimed at prevention of uncomplicated UTI in the future. The GP or another health care provider can provide this additional care for women with recurring UTI. However, it may be preferable to educate women on preventive measures or discuss with them delay of antibiotic treatment with increased fluid intake and painkillers, before starting patient-initiated treatment. A study showed that UTI symptoms recovered spontaneously within one week in about 50% of symptomatic women not taking antibiotics. Other studies showed that more than one third of women with UTI symptoms were willing to delay antibiotic treatment when asked by their GP. Women preferred not to take antibiotics and were open to alternative management approaches.

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^112bLb2m]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections, with an estimated annual incidence of > 150 million cases worldwide. In the United States, UTIs result in approximately 10.5 million office visits as well as 3 million emergency department (ED) encounters and 400 000 hospitalizations annually with an estimated annual cost > $4.8 billion. UTIs primarily affect women, followed by male infants and older men. Based on epidemiologic data from a study in the United States, about 1 in 3 women have at least 1 UTI diagnosed by a clinician that requires antibiotic medication, and the lifetime risk of UTIs among women is > 60%.

Clinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs) can be differentiated into lower (cystitis) and upper (pyelonephritis). uUTIs typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy. Approximately 75% of uUTIs are caused by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and other pathogens. Complicated UTIs are associated with factors compromising the urinary tract or host defense, such as urinary obstruction, immunosuppression, renal failure/transplantation, and indwelling catheterization. In the United States, 70% to 80% of complicated UTIs are attributable to indwelling catheters, accounting for 1 million cases per year.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^115mVcrU]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

For the primary outcome, the incidence rate in each group was the total number of UTI episodes divided by the total follow-up (exposure) time, reported with 95% confidence intervals calculated using a resampling procedure (bootstrap). The absolute difference between groups was calculated and reported with a 90% bootstrap confidence interval. Non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper limit of the confidence interval was below one UTI episode/year. We estimated relative treatment differences using a negative binomial model with follow-up time included as an exposure variable, recruiting centre as a random effect, and baseline stratification factors (menopausal status and prior UTI frequency) as fixed effects. This model yielded an estimate of the incidence rate ratio, presented with a 95% confidence interval.

Sensitivity analyses excluded days when participants took therapeutic antibiotics for UTI from the follow-up time. We analysed a binary indicator of at least one UTI episode using a mixed effects logistic regression model adjusted for centre and baseline stratification factors. Analyses were primarily conducted in a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all participants observed for at least six months, because these participants were assumed to provide a reliable estimate of UTI incidence. Prespecified sensitivity analyses were conducted in intention-to-treat and per protocol populations (participants achieving ≥ 90% adherence with preventive treatment; switching between treatment strategies was considered adherent). We also conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis in a strict per protocol population that included only those participants achieving ≥ 90% adherence with initially randomised treatment.

Symptomatically diagnosed UTI incidence in the post-treatment period and microbiologically confirmed UTIs were analysed as for the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle and included all participants with data available. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria and antibiotic resistance were compared by χ² or Fisher's exact tests. These analyses are considered exploratory and should be interpreted with caution. We made no adjustments for multiple testing. Domain scores of the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for drug treatment were compared between groups using a two sample t test and an analysis of covariance model adjusted for baseline stratification factors. To account for switching between treatment strategies, adverse events were reported according to treatment received at the time with data summarised by numbers of participants receiving each intervention. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 16. Independent trial steering and data monitoring committees had oversight throughout the trial. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN70219762).

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^1115Z5Fu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Consistent with an earlier report, we found a bimodal age distribution for women with the greater risk of rUTIs among the youngest and oldest participants (18–27 and ≥ 78 years vs 28–67 years). The increased risk of rUTIs among younger women is thought to reflect behavioral risk factors, including sexual activity, and genetic risk factors, including nonsecretor status and personal and familial history of UTI. The higher risk of rUTI among women who received oral contraceptive prescriptions in this study is similar to the greater risk of UTI associated with diaphragm use reported in prior studies, reflecting sexual activity as a likely risk factor for rUTI. In contrast, hormonal changes that increase colonization with uropathogens, as well as structural changes, are thought to have a greater role in increasing the risk of rUTIs among older women. Similarly, in keeping with prior reports, in the main analysis, we found a higher incidence of rUTI among White participants vs participants of other races and ethnicities. Nonetheless, characteristics associated with greater risk of rUTI were mostly similar across subgroups in our analysis when stratified by race and ethnicity, although a higher risk of rUTI among older women in the main analysis was not seen among older Black and Asian/Pacific Islander women but was observed among older women of other races and ethnicities. However, sample size was limited for Black and Asian/Pacific Islander women in the oldest age groups, and observed differences in the risk of UTIs among races likely reflect unexamined confounders.

### The urinary microbiome in postmenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections [^113TiGMn]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The etiology of postmenopausal recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is not completely known, but the urinary microbiome is thought to be implicated. We compared the urinary microbiome in menopausal women with recurrent UTIs to age-matched controls, both in the absence of acute infection.

Materials and Methods

This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from 64 women enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study. All women were using topically applied vaginal estrogen. Women > 55 years of age from the following groups were enrolled: 1) recurrent UTIs on daily antibiotic prophylaxis, 2) recurrent UTIs not on antibiotic prophylaxis and 3) age-matched controls without recurrent UTIs. Catheterized urine samples were collected at least 4 weeks after last treatment for UTI and at least 6 weeks after initiation of vaginal estrogen. Samples were evaluated using expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Results

With EQUC, there were no significant differences in median numbers of microbial species isolated among groups (p = 0.96), even when considering Lactobacilli (p = 0.72). However, there were trends toward different Lactobacillus species between groups. With 16S rRNA sequencing, the majority of urine samples contained Lactobacillaceae, with nonsignificant trends in relative abundance among groups. Using a Bayesian analysis, we identified significant differences in anaerobic taxa associated with phenotypic groups. Most of these differences centered on Bacteroidales and the family Prevotellaceae, although differences were also noted in Actinobacteria and certain genera of Clostridiales.

Conclusions

Associations between anaerobes within the urinary microbiome and postmenopausal recurrent UTI warrants further investigation.

### Differences in the pattern of antibiotic prescription profile and recurrence rate for possible urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes [^113mFfbT]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Exclusion criteria

To limit the study population to women with uncomplicated UTIs, we wanted to exclude all women with possible recurrent UTIs because of secondary diseases or underlying abnormalities. Therefore, all factors that belong to the definition of complicated UTIs were considered exclusion criteria:
Pregnancy (delivery during the follow-up period or folic acid prescription in the preceding year and during the follow-up).
Patients with known anatomical abnormalities, for example, indwelling urinary catheter or hospitalization for a urethral stricture in the follow-up period.
The use of the following medication in the preceding year and during the follow-up: antiretroviral treatment for HIV; immune suppressive drugs; chemotherapy; and medication for renal insufficiency, such as calcium binding agents.
Patients receiving a first prescription with duration of > 30 days.
Patients with a second prescription within 5 days after their first prescription, indicating acute side effects or loss of recipe or medication.
Patients receiving in the preceding year trimethoprim, norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin, indicating prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs.

Outcome parameters

The primary outcome was the prescription for a second antibiotic course or a hospitalization admission for a UTI during the follow-up period.

Definitions

The cohort entry date was defined as the day that the patient received her first prescription trimethoprim, norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin. The history period was defined as 1 year before study inclusion. The follow-up period was defined as the duration of the first prescription plus 30 days after the cohort entry date. Patients with diabetes were defined by prescription of one or more glucose-lowering medications (tablets or insulin) in the history or in the follow-up period.

Premenopausal women were defined as aged ≤ 55 years at the dispensing date of their first prescription. Postmenopausal women were women aged > 55 years at the moment of the dispensing date of their first prescription. This is a conservative definition of postmenopausal women, since the worldwide mean age of menopause is 49.2 years.

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^11579e51]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this study include detailed clinical and health outcomes data extracted from a large patient sample drawn from a racially, socioeconomically, and age-diverse population receiving care at multiple medical centers over 5 years. In addition, this study focused on participants without UTI in the 12 months prior to the index uUTI, avoiding biases introduced by studying populations with recent UTI who are at higher risk of rUTI. Limitations include the use of a threshold for positive culture that is lower than the threshold of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL used in some studies but is higher than that used in other prior studies. Furthermore, the definition did not include clinical symptoms or dipstick or microscopic urinalysis, which are not consistently captured in the electronic health record. Instead, we created definitions using routinely collected electronic health record data that would be feasible to use across health systems. Together, the limitations of our definitions improved the sensitivity of the diagnosis of UTI but may have resulted in inclusion of some members with asymptomatic bacteriuria. However, testing and treatment are typically prompted by clinical symptoms, and we required combinations of diagnosis codes, antibiotic prescriptions, and positive urine culture results, likely reducing the impact of this limitation.

In conclusion, we report the epidemiology of rUTI in a large, sociodemographically diverse population of women without a history of recent UTI, providing recent data that may be more generalizable than most earlier studies that focused on smaller cohorts of a limited age range or on cohorts with recent UTI or a history of rUTI that raised the risk of rUTI among their study populations. We found that rUTI following uUTI is common, particularly among younger and older women, those with comorbidities, and those with more antibiotic prescriptions in the year prior to the index uUTI or with an index uUTI caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. The rising incidence of UTI and worsening antibiotic resistance underscore the growing unmet medical and public health need to develop preventive measures directed against UTI, including vaccines. Current assessment of the epidemiology of rUTI provided by this report may help guide development and use of preventive therapies, including potential vaccines against common uropathogens.

### Estrogenic modulation of uropathogenic Escherichia coli infection pathogenesis in a murine menopause model [^114jhLZU]. Infection and Immunity (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), primarily caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), annually affect over 13 million patients in the United States. Menopausal women are disproportionally susceptible, suggesting estrogen deficiency is a significant risk factor for chronic and recurrent UTI. How estrogen status governs susceptibility to UTIs remains unknown, and whether hormone therapy protects against UTIs remains controversial. Here, we used a mouse model of surgical menopause by ovariectomy and demonstrate a protective role for estrogen in UTI pathogenesis. We found that ovariectomized mice had significantly higher bacteriuria, a more robust inflammatory response, and increased production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon UPEC infection compared to sham-operated controls. We further show that response of the urothelial stem cell niche to infection, normally activated to restore homeostasis after infection, was aberrant in ovariectomized mice with defective superficial urothelial cell differentiation. Finally, UPEC-infected ovariectomized mice showed a significant increase in quiescent intracellular bacterial reservoirs, which reside in the urothelium and can seed recurrent infections. Importantly, this and other ovariectomy-induced outcomes of UTI were reversible upon estrogen supplementation. Together, our findings establish ovariectomized mice as a model for UTIs in menopausal women and pinpoint specific events during course of infection that are most susceptible to estrogen deficiency. These findings have profound implications for the understanding of the role of estrogen and estrogen therapy in bladder health and pathogen defense mechanisms and open the door for prophylaxis for menopausal women with recurrent UTIs.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria and pyuria in premenopausal women [^116g7Dmu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and pyuria in healthy women often trigger inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, but there is a paucity of data on their prevalence and persistence.

Methods

To evaluate the prevalence and persistence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and pyuria in women at high risk of recurrent urinary tract infection, we conducted an observational cohort study in 104 healthy premenopausal women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection with daily assessments of bacteriuria, pyuria, and urinary symptoms over a 3-month period.

Results

The mean age of participants was 22 years, and 74% were white. Asymptomatic bacteriuria events (urine cultures with colony count ≥ 105 CFU/mL of a uropathogen on days with no symptomatic urinary tract infection diagnosed) occurred in 45 (45%) women on 159 (2.5%) of 6283 days. Asymptomatic bacteriuria events were most commonly caused by Escherichia coli, which was present on 1.4% of days, with a median duration of 1 day (range, 1–10). Pyuria occurred in 70 (78%) of 90 evaluable participants on at least 1 day and 25% of all days on which no symptomatic urinary tract infection was diagnosed. The positive predictive value of pyuria for E. coli asymptomatic bacteriuria was 4%.

Conclusions

In this population of healthy women at high risk of recurrent urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria is uncommon and, when present, rarely lasts more than 2 days. Pyuria, on the other hand, is common but infrequently associated with bacteriuria or symptoms. These data strongly support recommendations not to screen for or treat asymptomatic bacteriuria or pyuria in healthy, nonpregnant women.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — colony count thresholds in symptomatic women: In symptomatic women with pyuria and UTI-consistent symptoms, subsets have colony counts < 10⁵ CFU/mL in voided urine; in a study of more than 200 premenopausal, non-pregnant women with at least 2 acute cystitis symptoms, approximately 40% with E. coli on catheterized specimen had < 10⁵ CFU/mL in the voided sample. Across multiple studies, a threshold of ≥ 10² CFU/mL of E. coli from voided specimens had 88% to 93% positive predictive value for bladder bacteriuria in patients with a high suspicion of UTI, and lower midstream counts (> 10² CFU/mL) have been associated with bladder bacteriuria, suggesting that a ≥ 10² CFU/mL of a single uropathogen may be a more appropriate cut-off in selected patients when there is strong suspicion of infection.

### Urinary tract infections in older women: a clinical review [^114AHHdU]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older women are commonly encountered in outpatient practice.

Objective

To review management of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI and review prevention of recurrent UTIs in older community-dwelling women.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) for English-language human studies conducted among adults aged 65 years and older and published in peer-reviewed journals from 1946 to November 20, 2013.

Results

The clinical spectrum of UTIs ranges from asymptomatic bacteriuria, to symptomatic and recurrent UTIs, to sepsis associated with UTI requiring hospitalization. Recent evidence helps differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is transient in older women, often resolves without any treatment, and is not associated with morbidity or mortality. The diagnosis of symptomatic UTI is made when a patient has both clinical features and laboratory evidence of a urinary infection. Absent other causes, patients presenting with any 2 of the following meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for symptomatic UTI: fever, worsened urinary urgency or frequency, acute dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness. A positive urine culture (≥ 105 CFU/mL) with no more than 2 uropathogens and pyuria confirms the diagnosis of UTI. Risk factors for recurrent symptomatic UTI include diabetes, functional disability, recent sexual intercourse, prior history of urogynecologic surgery, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence. Testing for UTI is easily performed in the clinic using dipstick tests. When there is a low pretest probability of UTI, a negative dipstick result for leukocyte esterase and nitrites excludes infection. Antibiotics are selected by identifying the uropathogen, knowing local resistance rates, and considering adverse effect profiles. Chronic suppressive antibiotics for 6 to 12 months and vaginal estrogen therapy effectively reduce symptomatic UTI episodes and should be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Establishing a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI in older women requires careful clinical evaluation with possible laboratory assessment using urinalysis and urine culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be differentiated from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older women should not be treated.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^111Gwyks]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Predictors of urinary tract infection after menopause: a prospective study [^111LLGES]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the incidence of and risk factors for acute cystitis among nondiabetic and diabetic postmenopausal women.

Methods

We conducted a population-based, prospective cohort study of 1017 postmenopausal women, aged 55 to 75 years, who were enrolled in a health maintenance organization and followed for 2 years. A wide range of behavioral and physiologic exposures were assessed at baseline interview and follow-up clinic visits; the main outcome measure was microbiologically confirmed acute symptomatic cystitis. Follow-up was 87% at 12 months and 81% at 24 months.

Results

During 1773 person-years of follow-up, 138 symptomatic urinary tract infections occurred (incidence, 0.07 per person-year). Independent predictors of infection included insulin-treated diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7 to 7.0) and a lifetime history of urinary tract infection (HR for six or more infections = 6.9; 95% CI: 3.5 to 13.6). Borderline associations included a history of vaginal estrogen cream use in the last month (HR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.0 to 3.4), a history of kidney stones (HR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0 to 3.7), and asymptomatic bacteriuria at baseline (HR = 1.8; 95% CI: 0.9 to 3.5). Sexual activity, urinary incontinence, parity, postcoital urination, vaginal dryness, use of cranberry juice, vaginal bacterial flora, and postvoid residual bladder volume were not associated with incident acute cystitis after multivariable adjustment.

Conclusion

Insulin-treated diabetes is a potentially modifiable risk factor for incident acute cystitis among postmenopausal women, whereas a lifetime history of urinary tract infection was the strongest predictor. Use of oral or vaginal estrogen was not protective, and a wide range of behavioral and physiologic factors was not associated with acute cystitis episodes in this generally healthy sample.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^111xwj4b]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) — epidemiology and recurrence risk include that more than 8 million ambulatory visits (84% women) in the United States in 2007 were due to UTI with 21% emergency department visits; in Canadian data with urine culture confirmation, the annual UTI incidence in women aged 20 to 79 years was 3% to 5% and in those aged 80 to 89 years was 12%, and two percent of these women had at least 6 UTIs in 2 years; after a single UTI, 30% to 44% of women will have a recurrent UTI, and 50% will have a third episode if they have had 2 UTIs in 6 months.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^117Y4w8b]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) management — Given the presence of bacteria in a healthy urinary tract, the text emphasizes that concepts about when antibiotics are necessary must evolve, noting that symptomatic treatment and expectant management can be appropriate for some even when acute bacterial cystitis is confirmed. It urges re-evaluating the assumption that all symptomatic bacteriuria requires antibiotics and states that rUTI care should focus on symptom relief and prevention of complications rather than bacterial eradication.

### Estrogen supports urothelial defense mechanisms [^114HvSQ3]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Epidemiological data imply a role of estrogen in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections (UTIs), although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. However, it is thought that estrogen supplementation after menopause decreases the risk of recurrent infections. We sought to investigate the influence of estrogen on host-pathogen interactions and the consequences for UTI pathogenesis. We analyzed urothelial cells from menstruating and postmenopausal women before and after a 2-week period of estrogen supplementation, and also studied the influence of estradiol during Escherichia coli UTI in a mouse infection model. Important findings were confirmed in two human urothelial cell lines. We identified two epithelial defense mechanisms modulated by estrogen. Estrogen induced the expression of antimicrobial peptides, thereby enhancing the antimicrobial capacity of the urothelium and restricting bacterial multiplication. In addition, estrogen promoted the expression and redistribution of cell-cell contact-associated proteins, thereby strengthening the epithelial integrity and preventing excessive loss of superficial cells during infection. These two effects together may prevent bacteria from reaching deeper layers of the urinary tract epithelium and developing reservoirs that can serve as a source for recurrent infections. Thus, this study presents some underlying mechanisms for the beneficial effect of estradiol after menopause and supports the application of estrogen in postmenopausal women suffering from recurrent UTI.

### Differences in the pattern of antibiotic prescription profile and recurrence rate for possible urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes [^1132yuwT]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind with this amount of (more than 200,000) patients. In addition, in contrast to most earlier studies in which the recurrence rate of UTIs were described, we also compared the different treatment strategies between women with and without diabetes and analyzed pre- and postmenopausal women separately. The risk factors for UTIs are partly different in pre- and postmenopausal women, and therefore they should not be regarded as identical entities. Furthermore, it is only possible to interpret the recurrence rates when the initial treatment strategies of the two groups are known.

This study has several limitations. In the first place, it is retrospective and we do not have records on what the reasons of the treating physician were when prescribing a specific antimicrobial agent or a longer treatment duration. It can be possible that diabetic patients more often had symptoms of a UTI with tissue invasion (pyelonephritis or urosepsis). We have shown before that only 0.5% of diabetic patients with a UTI had clinical symptoms of a pyelonephritis compared with 0.2% in control subjects. Others have demonstrated that the risk ratio for pyelonephritis in patients with compared with those without diabetes ranges from 1.86 to 4.4. These numbers make clear that even when more women with diabetes had clinical symptoms of a pyelonephritis and therefore were treated with norfloxacin during a longer period, this cannot totally explain the demonstrated differences. It therefore seems likely that the physician took diabetes status into account when prescribing antibiotic therapy. Based on drug-dispensing data, we may have missed diabetic women treated with diet and exercise only. On the other hand, we know that many patients with diabetes are not diagnosed, so any definition of diabetes in this type of database research has imperfections. Furthermore, it is not possible to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes because patients in both groups could receive a treatment with insulin. This division is, for this study, not that important because in an earlier study we showed a comparable incidence of UTI in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, because we did not have urine culture results, we were not able to distinguish between a relapse and a reinfection, which could have influenced the subsequent treatment decision.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our perceptions of recurrent UTI (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

Materials and Methods

In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021 and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this Guideline in 2021.

Results

The Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

Conclusions

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis. This Guideline will require further review as the diagnostic and treatment options in this space continue to evolve.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113gEoge]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women: Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

### The role of estrogens in female lower urinary tract dysfunction [^1137WwPP]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The urogenital tract and lower urinary tract are sensitive to the effects of estrogen and progesterone throughout adult life. Epidemiologic studies have implicated estrogen deficiency in the etiology of lower urinary tract symptoms that occur after menopause. Although the role of estrogen replacement therapy in the management of postmenopausal urinary incontinence (UI) remains controversial, its use in the treatment of women with urogenital atrophy is now well established. This review summarizes recent evidence of the urogenital effects of hormone therapy, particularly emphasizing management of postmenopausal UI and recurrent lower urinary tract infections. Estrogen therapy alone has little effect in the management of urodynamic stress UI, although in combination with an alpha-adrenergic agonist, it may improve urinary leakage. Estrogen therapy may be of benefit for the irritative symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and urge UI, although this effect may result from reversal of urogenital atrophy rather than a direct action on the lower urinary tract. The role of estrogen replacement therapy in the treatment of women with recurrent lower urinary tract infections remains to be determined, although there is now some evidence that vaginal administration may be efficacious. Low-dose, vaginally administered estrogens have a role in the treatment of urogenital atrophy in postmenopausal women and appear to be as effective as systemic preparations.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^113fyWm7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections worldwide, being experienced by one in three women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent UTI is defined as more than three infections per year or more than two infections per 6 months, and it has a significant impact on quality of life, as highlighted by an international web-based survey of 1941 affected women. There is also a significant economic burden due to the costs of preventive strategies and sick leave. Most recurrent UTIs occur in otherwise healthy women who have no structural genitourinary tract abnormalities.

CPGs are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare in specific clinical circumstances" and are developed to optimize and standardize care. The successful implementation of a CPG depends on rigorous development, a clear implementation strategy, and adequate dissemination. Multiple studies across different clinical areas have shown that variability exists in the quality of CPGs, indicating that there is considerable room for improvement, especially in rigour of development and applicability. This is important because diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty can ensue if CPGs differ in core recommendations because of these limitations.

Differences in clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for the preventive treatment of recurrent UTI have been mentioned previously, but the authors of that report did not assess methodological quality. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty might ensue. We could find not a systematic appraisal of the quality of CPGs for the prevention and diagnostics of recurrent UTI in women. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument is often used to assess the methodological quality of CPGs in other areas. We therefore aimed to assess the methodological quality of CPGs for recurrent UTI and to summarize recommendations to help clinical decision makers choose the correct CPG for treatment or diagnostics.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112tRjeX]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114midvA]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — scope and exclusions specify that for the purposes of this Guideline the Panel considers only recurrent episodes in women of localized cystitis restricted to the lower urinary tract; infections with suspected upper urinary tract or systemic involvement should be managed differently, and in this Guideline the term urinary tract infection (UTI) will refer to acute bacterial cystitis. This Guideline does not specifically consider patients in whom complicating factors may put them at higher risk for decreased treatment efficacy or for progression of a localized UTI to systemic infection, including an anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract such as stone disease, diverticulum, or neurogenic bladder, an immunocompromised host, or urinary foreign bodies such as indwelling urethral catheters or ureteral stents.
