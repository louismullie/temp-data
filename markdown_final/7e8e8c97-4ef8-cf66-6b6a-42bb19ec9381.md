## Question

betablocker dosis to reduce mortality in heart faliure with reduced ejection fraction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal beta-blocker dosing strategy to reduce mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including which agents to choose, what target doses to aim for, how to titrate, and how to handle special populations and scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the strength of evidence for beta-blockers in HFrEF. Then, I should verify which beta-blockers are proven to reduce mortality and what the trial-based target doses are. Next, I will examine whether dose-response matters and how to titrate safely. After that, I need to consider special populations such as older adults, women, and those with atrial fibrillation. Finally, I will integrate contemporary guidance on rapid GDMT implementation and summarize a practical, stepwise approach with monitoring and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the strength of evidence. Beta-blockers are a cornerstone of HFrEF therapy with consistent, large mortality reductions across randomized trials and meta-analyses, on the order of roughly 30–35% relative risk reduction in mortality and substantial reductions in hospitalizations, establishing a Class I, Level A recommendation in major guidelines [^6fd56023] [^44ebd4d4] [^04fa9124] [^d17f6312].

> Wait, let me verify which agents are proven and what doses were used in trials. Only three beta-blockers have replicated mortality benefit in HFrEF: carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate (extended-release). Carvedilol trials used 25–50 mg twice daily, bisoprolol trials used 10 mg once daily, and metoprolol succinate trials used 200 mg once daily, with MERIT-HF showing a 34% mortality reduction and a mean achieved dose around 159 mg/day, which aligns with the 200 mg target in many patients [^6fd56023] [^44ebd4d4] [^8c224027] [^9030e71e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose-response. I initially thought that any beta-blocker exposure might be enough, but I should double-check whether higher doses confer greater benefit. Observational and trial-derived analyses suggest a dose–response relationship, with higher achieved doses associated with better outcomes up to target doses, and meta-analytic data indicate that the magnitude of heart rate reduction tracks with mortality benefit, reinforcing the mechanistic rationale for titration to maximally tolerated doses rather than stopping at low doses [^5290cce7] [^4772ec93] [^1fb4b857] [^55275355].

> I need to ensure the titration strategy is safe and evidence-aligned. Guidelines recommend starting very low and doubling about every 2 weeks as tolerated, with closer follow-up during initiation and up-titration, and they advise against abrupt withdrawal unless there is a compelling reason. In decompensated HF, avoid starting new beta-blockers but continue existing therapy while treating congestion, and consider faster titration in stable patients to reach target doses within roughly 6–12 weeks when feasible [^6fd56023] [^59c0ca0c] [^a2da1a2f].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with older adults. I should confirm whether the benefit persists with advancing age. Individual patient data meta-analyses show consistent mortality benefit across age strata, including patients up to age 85, though the absolute benefit may be smaller and tolerability can be lower, so careful titration with attention to blood pressure, heart rate, and renal function remains essential [^2c9fa972] [^912f8576] [^9facfee0].

> Next, I should review sex-related dosing considerations. Observational cohorts suggest women may achieve optimal outcomes at about 50% of guideline-recommended target doses for ACE inhibitors/ARBs and possibly beta-blockers, though this remains hypothesis-generating and not a substitute for guideline targets; given women's lower body weight and different pharmacokinetics, I should individualize titration while still aiming for the highest tolerated dose and reassessing symptoms, blood pressure, and heart rate at each step [^5679814a] [^514daa00].

> I will now examine atrial fibrillation, because I need to check whether the same dose principles apply. In AF, beta-blockers are used primarily for rate control, and the prognostic benefit seen in sinus rhythm is attenuated; moreover, overly aggressive rate lowering can be harmful, so a more modest resting heart rate target of 80–90 bpm is reasonable, and dose titration should be guided by symptoms, exertional heart rate, and hemodynamics rather than the HFrEF target doses used in sinus rhythm [^b091f2b3] [^74c371ed].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a beta-blocker and still has a high heart rate despite guideline-directed therapy. In sinus rhythm with persistent resting heart rate ≥ 70 bpm and LVEF ≤ 35%, adding ivabradine reduces heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular events, with the earliest separation of curves around 2–3 months; this is a Class IIa recommendation and should be considered only after optimizing beta-blocker therapy and excluding bradyarrhythmias or atrial fibrillation [^f9e745da] [^9aa55cdc].

> Next, I should review contemporary implementation guidance. Recent expert consensus emphasizes rapid initiation of quadruple foundational therapy (ARNI preferred over ACEi/ARB when feasible, evidence-based beta-blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitor) within 2–4 weeks when stable, using low starting doses and titrating every 1–2 weeks as tolerated. This approach accelerates benefit and addresses the historically low rates of target-dose attainment seen in registries and trials [^a2da1a2f] [^f4ae5b31] [^d8fa5d1b].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, confirm HFrEF diagnosis and stability before initiating or up-titrating beta-blockers. Second, select carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol succinate and start at the low end of the trial dosing range. Third, titrate every 2 weeks toward the trial target dose unless limited by hypotension, bradycardia, or congestion, monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and symptoms at each visit. Fourth, if the resting heart rate remains ≥ 70 bpm in sinus rhythm with LVEF ≤ 35% despite maximally tolerated beta-blocker, consider ivabradine. Fifth, in older adults or women, individualize titration pace and consider lower final doses if intolerance emerges, while recognizing that many will still tolerate and benefit from target doses with careful monitoring [^6fd56023] [^59c0ca0c] [^f9e745da] [^5679814a].

> Finally, I should double-check the bottom line. The mortality benefit of beta-blockers in HFrEF is robust and consistent across trials, and the best-available evidence supports using carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol succinate and titrating to the maximally tolerated dose that approximates the trial targets, because both higher dose and greater heart rate reduction correlate with improved outcomes. In select cases, adjunctive ivabradine can further reduce events when heart rate remains elevated despite optimized beta-blocker therapy [^6fd56023] [^5290cce7] [^f9e745da].

The optimal beta-blocker dose to reduce mortality in HFrEF is the **maximally tolerated dose** of a guideline-recommended agent (carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol succinate) [^6fd56023], titrated every 1–2 weeks to the trial-proven target dose when possible [^59c0ca0c]. If the target dose is not tolerated, **maintain the highest tolerated dose** [^59c0ca0c], as even subtarget doses reduce mortality and hospitalizations [^ea713cff]. Higher doses confer greater benefit, but dose escalation should be individualized based on blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms [^5290cce7] [^e1d3602c].

---

## Evidence-based target doses

The following **target doses** are supported by major randomized trials and contemporary guidelines:

| **Beta-blocker** | **Target dose** |
|-|-|
| Carvedilol | 25 mg twice daily (50 mg twice daily if ≥ 85 kg) [^67594dc2] |
| Bisoprolol | 10 mg once daily [^67594dc2] |
| Metoprolol succinate (CR/XL) | 200 mg once daily [^67594dc2] |

---

These doses are associated with significant reductions in mortality and heart failure hospitalizations [^6fd56023] [^8c224027].

---

## Dose-response relationship and mortality benefit

Higher beta-blocker doses are associated with greater mortality reduction, but the relationship is **nonlinear**, with most benefit achieved as dose increases toward target; additional gains beyond target are modest and may be limited by hypotension or bradycardia [^5290cce7] [^ea713cff]. Even at subtarget doses, beta-blockers reduce mortality and hospitalizations, though less than at target doses [^ea713cff] [^1fb4b857].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose titration

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show that **titration to target doses** improves outcomes:

- **MERIT-HF**: Metoprolol succinate 200 mg/day reduced all-cause mortality by 34% and all-cause mortality plus hospitalization by 19% [^8c224027].
- **CIBIS-II**: Bisoprolol 10 mg/day reduced all-cause mortality by 34% and HF hospitalizations by 32%.
- **COPERNICUS**: Carvedilol 25 mg twice daily reduced all-cause mortality by 35% in severe HF [^notfound].

These benefits are **dose-dependent**, with greater effects at higher doses, but plateau near target doses [^5290cce7].

---

## Factors influencing dose titration

Dose titration should be **individualized** based on:

- **Blood pressure**: Avoid excessive hypotension; adjust dose if systolic BP < 90 mmHg.
- **Heart rate**: Target resting HR 55–60 bpm; avoid bradycardia < 50 bpm.
- **Symptoms**: Watch for fatigue, dizziness, or worsening HF.
- **Comorbidities**: Adjust for COPD, diabetes, or renal impairment as needed [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly patients**: Tolerability may be lower; start low and titrate cautiously, but benefit persists even in older adults [^2c9fa972] [^9facfee0].
- **Women**: May achieve optimal benefit at lower doses due to pharmacokinetic differences; titrate to tolerance and symptoms [^5679814a].
- **Atrial fibrillation**: Beta-blockers are still indicated for rate control, but dose titration should balance rate targets with tolerability [^b091f2b3].

---

## Practical approach to dose titration

A **stepwise approach** is recommended:

- **Start low**: Begin at the lowest effective dose (e.g. carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily, bisoprolol 1.25 mg once daily, metoprolol succinate 12.5–25 mg once daily) [^67594dc2].
- **Titrate gradually**: Increase dose every 1–2 weeks as tolerated to the target dose [^59c0ca0c].
- **Monitor closely**: Check blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and symptoms at each visit.
- **Adjust as needed**: If adverse effects occur, reduce dose or slow titration; maintain the highest tolerated dose if target is not reached [^59c0ca0c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The optimal beta-blocker dose for HFrEF is the **maximally tolerated dose** of carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol succinate, titrated to the trial-proven target when possible [^6fd56023]. If the target is not tolerated, maintain the highest tolerated dose, as even subtarget dosing provides meaningful mortality and hospitalization benefits [^ea713cff]. Dose escalation should be individualized and guided by blood pressure, heart rate, and clinical symptoms [^59c0ca0c].

Heart failure (HF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although initially thought to be harmful in HF, beta-adrenergic blockers (β-blockers) have consistently been shown to reduce mortality and HF hospitalization in chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. Proposed mechanisms include neurohormonal blockade and heart rate reduction. A new therapeutic agent now exists to target further heart rate lowering in patients who have been stable on a "maximally tolerated β-blocker dose", but this definition and how to achieve it are incompletely understood. In this review, the authors summarize published reports on the mechanisms by which β-blockers improve clinical outcomes. The authors describe differences in doses achieved in landmark clinical trials and those observed in routine clinical practice. They further discuss reasons for intolerance and the evidence behind using β-blocker dose and heart rate as therapeutic targets. Finally, the authors offer recommendations for clinicians actively initiating and up-titrating β-blockers that may aid in achieving maximally tolerated doses.

### Meta-analysis: β-blocker dose, heart rate reduction, and death in patients with heart failure [^5290cce7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure receive beta-blockers in doses used in the trials that have proven their efficacy. Although the adverse effects of beta-blockade are dose-related, it is unclear whether the benefits are.

Purpose

To determine whether the survival benefits of beta-blockade in heart failure are associated with the magnitude of heart rate reduction or the beta-blocker dose.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SIGLE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, supplemented by hand-searches of bibliographies.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled heart failure trials that reported all-cause mortality.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, beta-blocker dosing and heart rate reduction, and death.

Data Synthesis

The mean left ventricular ejection fraction in the 23 beta-blocker trials ranged from 0.17 to 0.36, and more than 95% of the 19 209 patients had systolic dysfunction. The overall risk ratio for death was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.84); however, heterogeneity testing revealed moderate heterogeneity among trials (I (2) = 30%), which was associated with the magnitude of heart rate reduction achieved within each trial (P for meta-regression = 0.006). For every heart rate reduction of 5 beats/min with beta-blocker treatment, a commensurate 18% reduction (CI, 6% to 29%) in the risk for death occurred. No significant relationship between all-cause mortality and beta-blocker dosing was observed (risk ratio for death, 0.74 [CI, 0.64 to 0.86]) in high-dose beta-blocker trials vs. 0.78 [CI, 0.63 to 0.96] in low-dose beta-blocker trials; P for meta-regression = 0.69).

Limitations

The analysis is based on aggregate data and resting heart rates. Few patients in these trials had bradycardia or diastolic dysfunction at baseline.

Conclusion

The magnitude of heart rate reduction is statistically significantly associated with the survival benefit of beta-blockers in heart failure, whereas the dose of beta-blocker is not.

### Effect of age and sex on efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: individual patient data meta-analysis [^de8332cf]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

β blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and are a cornerstone of modern evidence based treatment. Current heart failure guidelines do not differentiate treatment on the basis of age or sex, although initiation and maintenance of treatment is suboptimal both in older people and women. With increasing age, patients are more likely to be women (with less marked reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction). This interaction, along with relatively low numbers of older patients in randomised controlled trials, has created uncertainty about the optimum management of elderly patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), both in women and men. Moreover, there are theoretical concerns about altered pharmacokinetics in older people that might affect the dose required or the tolerability of treatment. Although subgroup data and the results from SENIORS (Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure) suggest that the efficacy of β blockers is retained in older patients, low uptake and poor maintenance of treatment continue to be a clinical reality.

The Beta-blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group was set up to combine individual patient data from major randomised controlled trials in heart failure and provide clear direction on clinically relevant subsets of patients in which there is uncertainty about the balance of safety and efficacy of β blockers. Meta-analysis of individual patient data allows more robust examination of treatment effects in subgroups and enables of time to event analyses adjusted for baseline covariates, making it ideal for the appropriate pooling of original data. We have previously shown that morbidity and mortality are not improved by β blockers in patients with HFrEF and concomitant atrial fibrillation, in contrast with patients in sinus rhythm, who had substantial reductions in admission to hospital and all cause mortality.

In this analysis, we explored the interactions of β blocker efficacy and tolerability with age and sex, using the largest and most robust dataset of pooled data from randomised trials. Our aim was to inform clinicians on the appropriate use of these important therapeutic agents for patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm.

LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; NA = not available or applicable or reported.

All β blockers showed improvements in mortality; the numerically largest effect was seen with carvedilol (lowest odds ratio). However, when we made a comparison between the individual β blockers, the mortality advantage conferred by each was not statistically different from another. Carvedilol also had the best numerical advantage in tolerability (lowest pooled discontinuation rates), while not being statistically superior to other β blockers. Bucindolol improved the ejection fraction to the greatest extent in our analysis, but it was not significantly superior to the other drugs in its class. Exclusion of trials with pharmacologically active comparators did not alter our findings to a significant effect. We also determined the absolute risk reductions and the numbers needed to treat to prevent one death for each of the β blockers assessed (appendix table D). Congruent with our primary analysis, the absolute risk reduction for mortality was greatest with carvedilol — 6.6% reduction, with a number needed to treat of 15 to prevent one death. Our analysis also showed that different target dosages of individual β blockers used in the randomized trials, as well as the mean doses achieved, did not influence the logarithm of the odds ratio of mortality, as determined by weighted meta-regression analysis. An exploratory sub-analysis of trials conducted in the United States only showed significant reduction in mortality with β blocker use in the US (odds ratio 0.48, 0.29 to 0.82) (appendix figure C). The consistency and directionality of the effect persisted even when we relaxed our inclusion criteria to include smaller studies of sample size 50 or above (appendix figure D).

### Beta-blockers for heart failure with reduced, mid-range, and preserved ejection fraction: an individual patient-level analysis of double-blind randomized trials [^74c371ed]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Recent guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40–49% should be managed similar to LVEF ≥ 50%. We investigated the effect of beta-blockers according to LVEF in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data meta-analysis of 11 trials, stratified by baseline LVEF and heart rhythm (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT0083244; PROSPERO: CRD42014010012). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death over 1.3years median follow-up, with an intention-to-treat analysis. For 14262 patients in sinus rhythm, median LVEF was 27% (interquartile range 21–33%), including 575 patients with LVEF 40–49% and 244 ≥ 50%. Beta-blockers reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to placebo in sinus rhythm, an effect that was consistent across LVEF strata, except for those in the small subgroup with LVEF ≥ 50%. For LVEF 40–49%, death occurred in 21/292 [7.2%] randomized to beta-blockers compared to 35/283 [12.4%] with placebo; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34–1.03]. Cardiovascular death occurred in 13/292 [4.5%] with beta-blockers and 26/283 [9.2%] with placebo; adjusted HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.24–0.97). Over a median of 1.0years following randomization (n = 4601), LVEF increased with beta-blockers in all groups in sinus rhythm except LVEF ≥ 50%. For patients in atrial fibrillation at baseline (n = 3050), beta-blockers increased LVEF when < 50% at baseline, but did not improve prognosis.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers improve LVEF and prognosis for patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm with a reduced LVEF. The data are most robust for LVEF < 40%, but similar benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with LVEF 40–49%.

Rationale and recommendations for dosing of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction emphasize outcome benefits and titration to target or maximally tolerated doses. The rationale states that use of guideline-recommended beta blockers "has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, and studies have supported a dose-response relationship of beta blockers with improved outcomes," and that "treating at less than the target dose may result in worse clinical outcomes" with "the percentage of patients achieving these doses is low and remains low over time." It adds, "Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual incremental increases in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials." The 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline specifies, "Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality" with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)." The 2017 ACC decision pathway adds, "After a diagnosis of heart failure is made, GDMT should be initiated and therapies should be adjusted no more frequently than every 2 weeks to target doses (or maximally tolerated doses)" and "To achieve the maximal benefits of GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF, therapies must be initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses."

### Titration of medical therapy and clinical outcomes among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from the HF-ACTION trial [^1fb4b857]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend titration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and beta-blockers among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to maximally tolerated doses. Patient characteristics associated with dose titration and clinical outcomes subsequent to dose titration remain poorly characterized.

Methods

Among 1999 ambulatory patients with chronic HFrEF in the HF-ACTION trial, use and dosing of ACEi and evidence-based beta-blockers were examined at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with dose escalation (medication initation or dosing increase) or dose de-escalation (medication discontinuation or dosing decrease). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine associations between dose trajectory group (stable target, stable sub-target, dose escalation, and dose de-escalation) and subsequent mortality and hospitalization outcomes.

Results

For both ACEi and beta-blockers, hospitalization for heart failure in the 6 months prior to enrollment (odds ratio [OR] 2.32 [95% confidence interval 1.58–3.42]) for ACEi; 1.42 [1.05–1.9] for beta-blockers) and higher systolic blood pressure (OR 1.01 [1.00–1.03] per 1 mmHg increase for ACEi; 1.01 [1.00–1.02] for beta-blockers) were associated with dose escalation. Hospitalization 6 months prior to enrollment for any cause (including HF or non-HF causes) was associated with dose de-escalation (OR 1.60 [1.14–2.25] for ACEi; 1.67 [1.20–2.33] for beta-blockers). After adjustment for patient characteristics, compared with stable target dosing, dose de-escalation of either medication was associated with greater all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.64 [1.11–2.42] for ACEi; 1.62 [1.04–2.53] for beta-blockers). Compared with stable target dosing, both dose de-escalation (aHR 1.98 [1.36–2.87]) and stable sub-target dosing (aHR 1.49 [1.18–1.87]) of beta-blockers were associated with greater cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for heart failure.

Conclusions

Among outpatients with chronic HFrEF, patient characteristics including recent hospitalization status and blood pressure were associated with odds of subsequent escalation and de-escalation of ACEi and beta-blocker therapy. Compared with patients receiving guildeline-recommended target doses, dose de-escalation of either medication and sub-target dosing of beta-blockers were associated with greater morbidity and mortality over long-term follow-up.

### Role of high-dose beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and elevated heart rate [^ae556b5e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers in high target doses are recommended for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but not for preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Treatment benefits are often more pronounced in high-risk subgroups, and patients with HFpEF with heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute have emerged as such a high-risk subgroup. We examined the associations of high-dose beta-blocker use with outcomes in these patients.

Methods

Of the 8462 hospitalized patients with heart failure with ejection fraction ≥ 50% in the Medicare-linked Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry, 5422 had a discharge heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute. Of these, 4537 had no contraindications to beta-blocker use, of which 2797 (2592 with dose data) received prescriptions for beta-blockers. Of the 2592, 730 received high-dose beta-blockers, defined as atenolol ≥ 100 mg/day, carvedilol ≥ 50 mg/day, metoprolol tartrate or succinate ≥ 200 mg/day, or bisoprolol ≥ 10 mg/day, and 1740 received no beta-blockers. Using propensity scores for the receipt of high-dose beta-blockers, we assembled a matched cohort of 1280 patients, balanced on 58 characteristics.

Results

All-cause mortality occurred in 63% and 68% of matched patients receiving high-dose beta-blocker vs no beta-blocker, respectively, during 6 years (median, 2.8) of follow-up (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.98; P = 0.027). The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause readmission and the combined endpoint of all-cause readmission or all-cause mortality associated with high-dose beta-blocker use were 0.90 (0.81–1.02) and 0.89 (0.80–1.00), respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with HFpEF and heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute, high-dose beta-blocker use was associated with a significantly lower risk of death. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to examine this association.

### Heart rate or beta-blocker dose? Association with outcomes in ambulatory Heart failure patients with Systolic dysfunction: results from the HF-ACTION trial [^e1d3602c]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to compare whether reduced heart rate (HR) or higher beta-blocker (BB) dose affected outcomes to a greater extent in the HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trial population.

Background

Recent data have shown that HR is an important modifiable factor in reducing mortality in heart failure (HF) patients. It has also been shown that titration of doses of BBs improves outcomes of morbidity and mortality in chronic HF patients with reduced ejection fraction. We aimed to compare whether reduced HR or higher BB dose affected outcomes to a greater extent in the HF-ACTION trial population.

Methods

HF-ACTION was a randomized, multicenter trial enrolling 2,331 ambulatory HF patients with systolic dysfunction (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV, left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.35) randomized to exercise training versus usual care, with median follow-up of 2.5 years. BB dose at baseline was standardized by use of carvedilol equivalents. BB dose and HR were analyzed by discrete groups (higher/lower dose; higher/lower HR). The relationship of BB dose, HR, and the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization and other cardiovascular secondary endpoints were determined before and after adjustment for variables found to be significantly associated with outcome in the HF-ACTION cohort.

Results

There was a significant inverse relationship between either BB dose (higher was better) or HR (lower was better) and all-cause death or hospitalization in unadjusted analysis; however, only BB dose was significant for improved mortality outcomes. After adjustment for other predictors of outcome, only BB dose remained significant for improving all-cause death or hospitalization. BB dose, but not HR, was associated with improved outcomes of other cardiovascular endpoints in unadjusted analysis but did not remain significant when adjusted for other predictors of outcome in this cohort.

Conclusions

There were more associated improvements in outcomes with higher BB dose than with reduced HR in this well-treated HF cohort with systolic dysfunction, which suggests that titration of BB doses may confer a greater benefit than reduction of HR in such patients.

Pillar 3: Antagonism of the sympathetic system with selected beta-blockers

Sympathetic overactivity is a hallmark of HFrEF. Increased peripheral vasoconstriction and elevated heart rates attempt to maintain cardiac output and vital organ perfusion but are ultimately maladaptive. It may worsen myocardial ischaemia, and high catecholamine levels may increase myocyte automaticity, increasing the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia. The use of selected βB is, therefore, recommended for HFrEF (table 5) and results in a relative mortality reduction of 35% when compared with placebo.

Table 5
Beta-blockers indicated in HFrEF

The use of βB may worsen acute heart failure and so clinical assessment is required to ensure that the patient with HFrEF is not decompensated at the time of βB initiation. Patients may often feel less well for 48–72 hours following initiation of βB or dose escalation and they should be warned of this to improve compliance with life-saving therapy. Where patients with HFrEF have decompensated on stable doses of βB, they should be continued at the same dose, while managing the decompensation. Dose titration should be to the maximum tolerated (starting at low dose) with a target resting heart rate of 60–70 bpm in sinus rhythm. Use of βB in patients with HFrEF with AF is recommended, although prognostic benefits are less well proven and aggressive rate control does not appear to provide any significant benefits when compared with more modest rate control. Some patients may not tolerate βB at higher doses and where the heart rate remains above 70 bpm then the I f channel blocker, Ivabradine, may be used to slow the sinus rate and improve symptoms and mortality.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^b091f2b3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

### Β-blockers in heart failure… [^54f003e5]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

β-Blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and stable fluid status. The successful adoption of β-blocker guidelines for these patients requires an understanding of the value of this therapy and effective systems to maintain safety and ensure high quality of care. This article distills scientific evidence and. consensus guidelines into a series of cases and practical answers about patient selection, discussions with patients, management and monitoring, and systems improvements to optimize quality of care, safety, and benefit for all patients with heart failure. Once thought harmful for patients with heart failure, 1, 2 β-blockers have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients.

### Heart rate achieved or β-blocker dose in patients with chronic heart failure: which is the better target? [^18835f25]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether the mortality of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is more strongly related to beta-blocker dose or to heart rate. It is known that beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients with CHF and LVSD, but the primary mechanism of action is uncertain.

Methods and Results

Patients with an ejection fraction ≤ 40%, who were in sinus rhythm both at an initial (visit 1) and at a 4-month clinic review (visit 2), were followed for a maximum of 36 months. The relationships between heart rate, beta-blocker dose, and survival in a multivariable model were examined. Of 654 eligible patients, 381 (58%) were started on beta-blockers prior to the initial visit, increasing to 537 (82%) by visit 2. During follow-up, 142 (22%) patients died. Neither resting heart rate nor beta-blocker dose at visit 1 predicted mortality (P = 0.09 and P = 0.99), but resting heart rate at visit 2 did (P = 0.02). Beta-blocker use at visit 2 was associated with better outcome (P = 0.03) but with little variation in outcome according to dose. Patients with a heart rate of 58–64 b.p.m. at visit 2 had the best prognosis.

Conclusions

The use of beta-blockers and resting heart rate at visit 2 both independently indicated prognosis, but beta-blocker dose did not. Beta-blockers may reduce mortality by several mechanisms; one that may be specific to blockade of adrenergic receptors and another related to heart rate reduction. Achieving a target heart rate range may be an appropriate therapeutic goal for patients with CHF.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^87728cd6]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In trials enrolling patients with HFpEF, defined using an LV ejection fraction ≥ 40%, beta-blockers reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant effect of ACE inhibitors, ARB or MRA on the same outcomes. The effect of treatments on functional and quality of life outcomes was limited. Further adequately powered RCTs in beta-blocker therapy in this patient group is warranted to confirm this finding.

Key messages

What is already known on this subject?

There have been no individual large randomised controlled trials which demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. This is represented in the latest European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure guidelines, which advocate treatment of comorbidities and symptoms.

What might this study add?

This meta-analysis shows that pooled analysis of beta-blocker trials demonstrates reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively, with no pooled effect seen in ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker and mineralocorticoid antagonist trials. There may also be a small benefit in terms of quality of life with several of the drug classes tested, although no difference in functional outcomes.

How might this impact on clinical practice?

Clinicians should consider using beta-blockers when there is an existing indication for them. There may be benefit in repeating a randomised controlled trial of beta-blockers in heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with contemporary patient cohorts.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^d17f6312]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results

After screening 720 citations (fig 1), we included 21 studies, with a total of 23 122 patients, treated with atenolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, nebivolol, or placebo/standard treatment. Patients had a median age of 61 years, 77% were male, ischemic heart failure was present in 57%, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 25%, and patients were followed for a median of 12 months. In addition to standard anti-heart failure treatment except β blockers, the control group received placebo in all but two trials (in which the control group received an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor but no β blocker) (fig 2). One study compared carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate directly, although that has been criticized for under-dosing of metoprolol and for the use of a short acting formulation instead of an extended release form. Characteristics of studies are summarized in table 1and appendix table A. All trials had a low risk of bias according to Cochrane metrics (appendix table B).

Overall pair-wise meta-analysis confirmed a significant reduction in mortality with use of β blockers versus all comparators (both active and placebo) — odds ratio 0.71, 95% credible interval 0.64 to 0.80; P < 0.001 (fig 3). Separate meta-analyses incorporating odds ratios from individual trials with shorter duration of follow-up (< 12 months) (odds ratio 0.57, 0.46 to 0.70) and hazard ratios from trials with longer duration of follow-up (> 12 months) (hazard ratio 0.70, 0.60 to 0.81) to account for the differential follow-up periods showed effect sizes consistent with the results of the overall primary pair-wise meta-analysis (appendix figures A and B). We further corroborated this with another separate network meta-analysis of hazard ratios using a random effects Poisson regression model (appendix table C).

### Relationship of β-blocker dose with outcomes in ambulatory heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction: results from the HF-ACTION (heart failure: a controlled trial investigating outcomes of exercise training) trial [^4772ec93]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the association between baseline beta-blocker (BB) dose and outcomes in the HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trial.

Background

Beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction, but it is unclear whether titrating to higher BB doses improves outcomes in this setting.

Methods

The HF-ACTION trial was a randomized, multicenter trial enrolling 2,331 ambulatory HF patients with systolic dysfunction (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV, left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.35) randomized to exercise training versus usual care, with median follow-up of 2.5 years. The BB dose at baseline was standardized with carvedilol equivalents and analyzed as a continuous variable and by discrete dose groups. The relationship between BB dose and the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization and other cardiovascular secondary endpoints was determined before and after adjustment for variables significantly associated with outcomes in the HF-ACTION cohort.

Results

Ninety-five percent of patients were receiving a BB. There was a significant inverse relationship between BB dose and all-cause death or hospitalization but not other cardiovascular endpoints after adjustment for other predictors of outcome, with a linear benefit up to the 50-mg daily dose. There was a significant association between BB dose and change in peak VO(2) at 3 months. There was no increase in bradycardia with higher doses of BB.

Conclusions

There was a significant inverse relationship between BB dose and the endpoint of all-cause death or all-cause hospitalization in this well-treated HF cohort with systolic dysfunction, supporting recommendations that titrating doses up to 50 mg/day might confer a benefit in such patients.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) dosing and titration: To achieve maximal benefits, therapies must be rapidly initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses, and doses higher than those studied in randomized clinical trials are generally not recommended; rapid achievement of target or maximally tolerated doses is the goal, and more than 1 drug may be started and, in certain circumstances, all 4 classes may be started at once. Beta‑blocker doses should be adjusted every 1 to 2 weeks in a patient with no evidence of decompensated HF or contraindications, and for those taking an ARNI, doses can be increased every week with monitoring of kidney function, potassium, and blood pressure; for optimal ARNI titration, lower loop diuretic doses and restriction of supplemental and/or dietary potassium may be necessary.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^6fd56023]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

### Identifying optimal doses of heart failure medications in men compared with women: a prospective, observational, cohort study [^5679814a]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Guideline-recommended doses of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and β blockers are similar for men and women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), even though there are known sex differences in pharmacokinetics of these drugs. We hypothesised that there might be sex differences in the optimal dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers in patients with HFrEF.

Methods

We did a post-hoc analysis of BIOSTAT-CHF, a prospective study in 11 European countries of patients with heart failure in whom initiation and up-titration of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers was encouraged by protocol. We included only patients with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, and excluded those who died within the first 3 months. Primary outcome was a composite of time to all-cause mortality or hospitalisation for heart failure. Findings were validated in ASIAN-HF, an independent cohort of 3539 men and 961 women with HFrEF.

Findings

Among 1308 men and 402 women with HFrEF from BIOSTAT-CHF, women were older (74 [12] years vs 70 [12] years, p < 0·0001) and had lower bodyweights (72 [16] kg vs 85 [18] kg, p < 0·0001) and heights (162 [7] cm vs 174 [8] cm, p < 0·0001) than did men, although body-mass index did not differ significantly. A similar number of men and women reached guideline-recommended target doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (99 [25%] vs 304 [23%], p = 0·61) and β blockers (57 [14%] vs 168 [13%], p = 0·54). In men, the lowest hazards of death or hospitalisation for heart failure occurred at 100% of the recommended dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers, but women showed approximately 30% lower risk at only 50% of the recommended doses, with no further decrease in risk at higher dose levels. These sex differences were still present after adjusting for clinical covariates, including age and body surface area. In the ASIAN-HF registry, similar patterns were observed for both ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers, with women having approximately 30% lower risk at 50% of the recommended doses, with no further benefit at higher dose levels.

Interpretation

This study suggests that women with HFrEF might need lower doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers than men, and brings into question what the true optimal medical therapy is for women versus men.

### Effect on mortality of higher versus lower β-blocker (metoprolol succinate or carvedilol) dose in patients with heart failure [^f85fc750]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the effect of β-blocker dose and heart rate (HR) on mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The Veteran Affairs databases were queried to identify all patients diagnosed with HFrEF based on International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision codes from 2007 to 2015 and β-blocker (carvedilol or metoprolol succinate) use. 36,168 patients on low dose β blocker were then matched with 36,168 patients on high dose β-blocker using propensity score matching. The impact of β-blocker dose and HR was assessed on overall mortality using Cox proportional hazard model. After dividing average HR into separate quartiles and adjusting for patient characteristics, high β-blocker dose was associated with lower overall mortality as compared with a low dose of β blocker (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.77, p < 0.01) independent of the HR achieved. The results held for all 4 quartiles of average HR. A higher β-blocker dose or a lower HR were independently and jointly associated with lower mortality for all quartiles of HR. In conclusion, higher dose of β-blocker therapy and a lower achieved HR were independently associated with a reduction in mortality in HFrEF patients.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^4d8d3daf]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We report categorical outcomes as numbers and continuous outcomes as median (interquartile range). We derived the raw event rates from individual studies and constructed 2×2 tables with raw number of events and total population of the trial. In trials that did not report raw event rates, investigators reported the percentage or proportion of patients having the event under consideration, which we rounded off to whole numbers by using the sample size of the population; we then calculated the risk difference by using the formula 1/(1+%OR), where OR = odds ratio. We calculated number needed to treat and corresponding absolute risk reduction from the 2×2 tables. We abstracted data in duplicate, and the inter-rater agreement was good (κ statistic = 0.88). Considering different lengths of follow-up for individual trials, and to account for censored data, we obtained the rates of outcomes for all trials with follow-up longer than 12 months and calculated the log hazard ratios (assuming a constant rate of hazards for individual trials) from the event rates reported and mean duration of follow-up. We did standard pair-wise meta-analysis comparing β blockers with comparators, with 95% confidence intervals. We also used a random effect model (DerSimonian and Laird) to calculate prediction intervals for all cause mortality, using RevMan v5.1 and Stata version 11. We assessed and quantified heterogeneity with the help of the I 2 statistic computed with the Cochran Q test.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f0524bdc]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical drug trials in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction have failed to demonstrate improvements in mortality.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing pharmacological treatments in patients with heart failure with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≥ 40% from January 1996 to May 2016. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, exercise capacity (6-min walk distance, exercise duration, VO 2 max), quality of life and biomarkers (B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled relative risks (RR) for the binary outcomes, and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% CI.

Results

We included data from 25 RCTs comprising data for 18101 patients. All-cause mortality was reduced with beta-blocker therapy compared with placebo (RR: 0.78, 95%CI 0.65 to 0.94, p = 0.008). There was no effect seen with ACE inhibitors, aldosterone receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and other drug classes, compared with placebo. Similar results were observed for cardiovascular mortality. No single drug class reduced heart failure hospitalisation compared with placebo.

Conclusion

The efficacy of treatments in patients with heart failure and an LV ejection fraction ≥ 40% differ depending on the type of therapy, with beta-blockers demonstrating reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Further trials are warranted to confirm treatment effects of beta-blockers in this patient group.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^8b7ee7bf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In the past few years, two new therapies have received a class I recommendation in guidelines for the treatment of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and four agents – a renin–angiotensin system blocker or sacubitril/valsartan, a beta‐blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor – are advised for most patients, in addition to a diuretic, as needed. Collectively, recent guidance documents on the treatment of HFrEF have suggested a prioritization of early introduction of all key pharmacological treatments over the up‐titration of the dose of these therapies., This change in emphasis has surprised many prescribers aware of the focus of previous guidelines on attaining the 'target dose' of each of the evidence‐based drugs for HFrEF. Although up‐titration of dose, guided by patient tolerability, remains important, introduction of each guideline‐recommended therapy may be the more important first step, with dose titration the second, recognizing the trade‐offs between the benefits of initiating a new therapy and up‐titrating the dose of current therapy. Here we revisit the evidence regarding the dosing of pharmacological therapy in heart failure and the background to the changed emphasis in recent guidance.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e0f7f55c]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this meta-analysis show significant reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in RCTs using beta-blockers, while RAAS blockade (using ACE inhibitor, ARB and MRA individually) demonstrated no effect on mortality. Improvements in functional outcomes and quality of life were not significantly or consistently demonstrated using pooled results. Heterogeneity within trials that reported biomarker outcomes was too high to allow comparison.

The effect of beta-blockade on mortality suggests favourable outcomes in patients with LV ejection fraction > 40%. Similar benefits have been demonstrated in pooled analysis of observational studies and previous meta-analyses. Of the three beta-blocker trials, only one trial individually showed a significant reduction in mortality, and contributed the greatest weight to overall effects due to the high event rate. The two larger RCTs showed neutral results, although were both underpowered to detect effects on mortality. Notably, all three beta-blocker trials used an LV ejection fraction threshold of 40%, whereas trials using ACE inhibitor, ARB and MRA tended to use higher ejection fraction thresholds. The demonstrated reduction in mortality with beta-blockers may have been augmented by their effects on the HFmrEF population within these trials; a group that an emerging body of evidence suggests is more closely aligned with HFrEF. The beneficial effect of beta-blockers on mortality appears to be through preventing cardiovascular death, supported by a 25% reduction in cardiovascular mortality. We did not further investigate causes of cardiovascular death, although the pleiotropic effects of beta-blocker (such as its anti-arrhythmic properties) are likely to be important. Future sufficiently powered clinical trials and observational or registry data will be important in discerning if there is a true effect in patients with heart failure with an LV ejection fraction of 40% or more, and whether this benefit extends to those with LV ejection fraction > 50%. While we did not demonstrate a benefit for beta-blockers in hospitalisation for heart failure, 'hospitalisation' should not be interpreted in isolation since mortality events will impact future hospitalisation events.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^5548d041]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

Unlike renin–angiotensin system blockers and MRAs, the early benefit of beta‐blockers is less clear. After initiation, beta‐blockers may cause worsening of heart failure. Indeed, careful scrutiny of the Kaplan–Meier curves in the placebo‐controlled trials and comparison of the first 6 months of treatment with either enalapril or bisoprolol in CIBIS III demonstrates an early excess of heart failure hospitalizations following initiation of a beta‐blocker, although there is no indication of an increase in risk of death., Indeed, it is clear that the risk of death is reduced relatively early after starting treatment with a beta‐blocker, for example in combined analysis of the trials in the US carvedilol programme.

Understanding the importance of dose with sacubitril/valsartan is more difficult because of the design of the PARADIGM‐HF trial, as mentioned above. In this trial, outcomes were compared in patients having either their dose of either sacubitril/valsartan (42% of randomized participants) or enalapril (43%) reduced compared to those who remained on the starting (target) doses or each treatment. The treatment benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril following a dose reduction was similar (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70–0.93, p < 0.001) to that seen in patients who did not have any dose reduction (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71–0.88, p < 0.001) and consistent whether the reduction was to 50%–100% of target or to < 50% of target dose.

### Are the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction influenced by background therapy? Expectations and realities of a new standard of care [^98fbfe03]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

This editorial refers to 'Effects of dapagliflozin in DAPA-HF according to background heart failure therapy' †, by K.F. Docherty et al. on page.

Many drugs that antagonize endogenous neurohormonal systems reduce the risk of death in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Importantly, the magnitude of the survival benefit with each agent has not been influenced by concomitant treatment with other life-prolonging drugs. In the post-infarction patient, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decreased the mortality rate in patients already receiving beta-blockers. Conversely, in patients with established heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, beta-blockers reduced the risk of death in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. The mortality reduction with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in an early trial where few patients were treated with a beta-blocker was similar to that seen in a later trial where most patients were receiving a beta-blocker. In subgroup analyses of clinical trials, the survival benefits of a neurohormonal antagonist have not been meaningfully affected by the intensity of use of other important treatments for heart failure.

The concept that each neurohormonal antagonist exerts favourable effects that are independent of the benefits of other treatments is critically important to physicians. In clinical practice, most patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction are treated with only a conventional inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system and a beta-blocker, often in doses that are much smaller than the target doses that were effective in large-scale clinical trials. Presumably, some practitioners believe that such limited neurohormonal antagonism is sufficient, perhaps based on an assumption that a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker achieves adequate normalization of the neurohormonal environment. However, this belief is not supported by the available evidence. The addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a neprilysin inhibitor to an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker leads to a further substantial reduction in the risk of death; modelling estimates suggest that mortality can be reduced by an additional 40–50% with more comprehensive neurohormonal blockade.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. There is uncertainty whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and a comprehensive review of the evidence is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trial registries on 25 July 2017 to identify eligible studies. Reference lists from primary studies and review articles were checked for additional studies. There were no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design enrolling adult participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 40 percent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. The outcomes assessed included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, all-cause mortality and quality of life. Risk ratios (RR) and, where possible, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous data, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) were calculated. We contacted trialists where neccessary to obtain missing data.

Main Results

37 randomised controlled trials (207 reports) were included across all comparisons with a total of 18,311 participants. Ten studies (3087 participants) investigating beta-blockers (BB) were included. A pooled analysis indicated a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (15% of participants in the intervention arm versus 19% in the control arm; RR 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; 3 studies). However, the quality of evidence was low and no effect on cardiovascular mortality was observed when the analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29; 643 participants; 1 study). There was no effect on all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation or quality of life measures, however there is uncertainty about these effects given the limited evidence available.12 studies (4408 participants) investigating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were included with the quality of evidence assessed as moderate. MRA treatment reduced heart failure hospitalisation (11% of participants in the intervention arm versus 14% in the control arm; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB 41; 3714 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence) however, little or no effect on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and quality of life measures was observed. MRA treatment was associated with a greater risk of hyperkalaemia (16% of participants in the intervention group versus 8% in the control group; RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; 4291 participants; 6 studies; high-quality evidence). Eight studies (2061 participants) investigating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as moderate. The evidence suggested that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. Data for the effect of ACEI on hyperkalaemia were only available from one of the included studies. Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as high. The evidence suggested that treatment with ARB has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. ARB was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia (0.9% of participants in the intervention group versus 0.5% in the control group; RR 1.88; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence). We identified a single ongoing placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA treatment reduces heart failure hospitalisation in heart failure with preserverd ejection fraction, however the effects on mortality related outcomes and quality of life remain unclear. The available evidence for beta-blockers, ACEI, ARB and ARNI is limited and it remains uncertain whether these treatments have a role in the treatment of HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication for their use. This comprehensive review highlights a persistent gap in the evidence that is currently being addressed through several large ongoing clinical trials.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^4596f4e2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

What other dosing and dose–response information do we have?

The ideal way to compare the effect of different doses of a drug is to randomize patients to those doses and, understandably, this has rarely been done. The only examples examining clinical outcomes used renin–angiotensin system blockers which, unfortunately, had not by themselves been shown to be superior to placebo (Table 4). Consequently, we do not know how to compare either the higher or lower dose of the drugs used to the doses of enalapril or candesartan proven to reduce death and hospital admission.

Table 4
Randomized clinical outcome trials comparing effects of low and high‐dose renin–angiotensin system blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

However, in each of these two dose‐comparison trials, the larger dose of treatment resulted in a lower event rate. As can be seen, the incremental benefit was modest and was driven by a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure, as opposed to mortality. In a meta‐analysis adding some smaller trials, among a total of 5829 randomized participants, there was still no difference in mortality (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88–1.02).

### A computable algorithm for medication optimization in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^2e3b16a8]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimizing heart failure medication confers significant morbidity and mortality benefit. Specifically, GDMT has been shown to reduce mortality by 17%, 34%, and 30% for ACEI/ARBs, beta-blockers, and MRAs, respectively. Furthermore, outcomes have also been shown to correlate with increasing doses of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. The ATLAS (Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival) trial compared the effect of low-dose lisinopril (2.5–5 mg daily) to high-dose lisinopril (32.5–35 mg daily) on all-cause mortality and CV hospitalizations. While the high dose lisinopril did not improve all-cause mortality compared to low dose lisinopril, the high dose lisinopril did significantly reduce all-cause hospitalizations by 13% (P = 0.021) and heart failure hospitalizations by 24% (P = 0.002). If all other medications were optimized, the MOS from this algorithm is 78% for a patient on lisinopril 2.5 mg daily and 89% for a patient on lisinopril 40 mg daily. Based on our analysis, this 11% change in MOS would lead to about a 9% lower risk of CV death or HF hospitalization.

### Determinants and clinical outcome of uptitration of ACE-inhibitors and β-blockers in patients with heart failure: a prospective European study [^75e8a541]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite clear guidelines recommendations, most patients with heart failure and reduced ejection-fraction (HFrEF) do not attain guideline-recommended target doses. We aimed to investigate characteristics and for treatment-indication-bias corrected clinical outcome of patients with HFrEF that did not reach recommended treatment doses of ACE-inhibitors/Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and/or beta-blockers.

Methods and Results

BIOSTAT-CHF was specifically designed to study uptitration of ACE-inhibitors/ARBs and/or beta-blockers in 2516 heart failure patients from 69 centres in 11 European countries who were selected if they were suboptimally treated while initiation or uptitration was anticipated and encouraged. Patients who died during the uptitration period (n = 151) and patients with a LVEF > 40% (n = 242) were excluded. Median follow up was 21 months. We studied 2100 HFrEF patients (76% male; mean age 68 ± 12), of which 22% achieved the recommended treatment dose for ACE-inhibitor/ARB and 12% of beta-blocker. There were marked differences between European countries. Reaching < 50% of the recommended ACE-inhibitor/ARB and beta-blocker dose was associated with an increased risk of death and/or heart failure hospitalization. Patients reaching 50–99% of the recommended ACE-inhibitor/ARB and/or beta-blocker dose had comparable risk of death and/or heart failure hospitalization to those reaching ≥ 100%. Patients not reaching recommended dose because of symptoms, side effects and non-cardiac organ dysfunction had the highest mortality rate (for ACE-inhibitor/ARB: HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.43–2.01; for beta-blocker: HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.36–2.05).

Conclusion

Patients with HFrEF who were treated with less than 50% of recommended dose of ACE-inhibitors/ARBs and beta-blockers seemed to have a greater risk of death and/or heart failure hospitalization compared with patients reaching ≥ 100%.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^2b61453d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation strategy and phenotype considerations indicate that a combination of 4 classes can be started at the same time at low doses with more than one titration at a time, while sequencing may be necessary in other cases; the Writing Committee affirms directly initiating ARNI whenever possible to avoid delays; initiation and titration may require considering patient phenotype, with ARNI often better tolerated when the patient is still congested ("wet") and beta-blockers better tolerated when the patient is less congested ("dry") with an adequate resting heart rate; beta-blockers should not be newly initiated in decompensated signs or symptoms but can be continued in decompensated HF, and only evidence-based beta-blockers should be used in HFrEF.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^d1077a04]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

PM-4: Beta-blocker therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — The performance measure defines the percentage of patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge. The numerator is patients who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge, where outpatient includes a prescription at ≥ 1 visits in the 12-mo measurement period or documentation that the patient is already taking a beta blocker, and inpatient includes a prescription at discharge or documentation to continue therapy after discharge; beta-blocker therapy should include bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate. The denominator is all patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior LVEF ≤ 40%, with denominator exclusions of heart transplant and LVAD and denominator exceptions for documentation of medical reason(s) (e.g., intolerance) or patient reason(s) (e.g., patient refusal) for not prescribing beta-blocker therapy. Rationale states that beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization for patients with stable heart failure and reduced LVEF, and treatment should be initiated as soon as a patient is diagnosed with reduced LVEF and does not have prohibitively low systemic blood pressure, fluid overload, or recent treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Clinical recommendations cited are that use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I, Level of Evidence: A), and that initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents; therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients, with caution when patients have required inotropes during their hospital course (Class I, Level of Evidence: B).

### A computable algorithm for medication optimization in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^15cbf9bb]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers have also been shown to have a dose-related effect on heart failure outcomes. The HF-ACTION study revealed a 13% relative risk lower risk of all-cause death or all-cause rehospitalization when comparing high dose beta-blockers (≥ 25 mg daily carvedilol equivalents) vs low dose beta-blockers when adjusting for various factors. If all other medications were optimized, the MOS from this algorithm is 78% for a patient on carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily and 89% for a patient on carvedilol 25 mg twice daily. Based on our analysis, this 11% change in MOS would lead to about a 9% lower risk of CV death or HF hospitalization.

With the absence of optimal GDMT in a significant portion of the HF population and the increase in complexity of HFrEF GDMT with the addition of newer drug classes, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have the potential to improve therapeutic regimens for a larger portion of patients with HFrEF. Prior attempts at CDSS in the HF population have shown poor results, but failed to include all 4 features shown to predict improved clinical practice when using CDSS. Embedding this HF medication optimization algorithm into CDSS within or outside the EHR may allow for clinicians to improve morbidity and mortality outcomes in patients by fully optimizing HF regimens. The MOS score could be presented in an EHR clinical dashboard for providers to prioritize the patients that need optimization. The recommendations generated from the algorithm could be shown to patients before a clinic visit to facilitate patient-provider communication about GDMT optimization, like in the EPIC-HF (Electronically delivered, Patient-activation tool for Intensification of Chronic medications for Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction) trial, or in an EHR alert, like in the PROMPT-HF (Pragmatic Trial Of Messaging to Providers Trials Heart Failure) trial. This algorithm could be the basis for many tools used for GDMT optimization.

### Medication dosing for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction-opportunities and challenges [^e3112b14]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple drug classes have shown incremental benefits in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Most of these trials were designed to achieve specific doses of the investigational agent. Clinical practice guidelines recommend using the same target dosing of therapies, as tolerated. However, with the increasing number of available therapies, clinicians face the challenge of simultaneously using several drugs, achieving target doses, and managing side effects that are often overlapping. Blood pressure, renal function, hyperkalaemia, and other factors may impede achieving target doses of all medications, leaving clinicians with dilemmas as to how to sequence and dose these various classes of drugs. The guideline-directed eligibility for certain drugs and devices requires stability on maximally tolerated doses of background therapies. However, significant variability exists in dosing achieved in clinical practice. We discuss the existing background data regarding the doses of heart failure medications in clinical trials and in practice, and provide recommendations on how to navigate this complex therapeutic decision-making.

### Benefits of inpatient initiation of β-blockers [^1f8c139a]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers effectively reduce mortality in patients after a myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with chronic heart failure. Treatment guidelines recommend that all patients after MI without a contraindication receive early beta-blocker treatment. Initiation of beta-blockers also should be considered for stable patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite well-documented benefits, however, beta-blockers are still underused. Barriers that cause reluctance by physicians to initiate therapy include the traditional belief that beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, complexity of management, perceived risk of adverse events, and potential for short-term clinical deterioration. Intervention programs promoting beta-blockers for inpatients have increased their use at discharge and after long-term follow-up. Because of pharmacologic differences, agent selection is also critical. Agents must have proven clinical efficacy, an established dose-titration regimen, and desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Increasing the use of these life-saving agents has the potential for substantial clinical impact.

### Nurse-led titration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, β-adrenergic blocking agents, and angiotensin receptor blockers for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^edcba562]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure is associated with high mortality and hospital readmissions. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can improve survival and reduce hospital readmissions and are recommended as first-line therapy in the treatment of heart failure. Evidence has also shown that there is a dose-dependent relationship of these medications with patient outcomes. Despite this evidence, primary care physicians are reluctant to up-titrate these medications. New strategies aimed at facilitating this up-titration are warranted. Nurse-led titration (NLT) is one such strategy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in terms of safety and patient outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL Issue 11 of 12, 19/12/2014), MEDLINE OVID (1946 to November week 3 2014), and EMBASE Classic and EMBASE OVID (1947 to 2014 week 50). We also searched reference lists of relevant primary studies, systematic reviews, clinical trial registries, and unpublished theses sources. We used no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and/or ARBs comparing the optimisation of these medications by a nurse to optimisation by another health professional in patients with HFrEF.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (AD & JC) independently assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias. We contacted primary authors if we required additional information. We examined quality of evidence using the GRADE rating tool for RCTs. We analysed extracted data by risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data to measure effect sizes of intervention group compared with usual-care group. Meta-analyses used the fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel method. We assessed heterogeneity between studies by Chi(2) and I(2).

Main Results

We included seven studies (1684 participants) in the review. One study enrolled participants from a residential care facility, and the other six studies from primary care and outpatient clinics. All-cause hospital admission data was available in four studies (556 participants). Participants in the NLT group experienced a lower rate of all-cause hospital admissions (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.88, high-quality evidence) and fewer hospital admissions related to heart failure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) compared to the usual-care group. Six studies (902 participants) examined all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality was also lower in the NLT group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92, moderate-quality evidence) compared to usual care. Approximately 27 deaths could be avoided for every 1000 people receiving NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs. Only three studies (370 participants) reported outcomes on all-cause and heart failure-related event-free survival. Participants in the NLT group were more likely to remain event free compared to participants in the usual-care group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.77, moderate-quality evidence). Five studies (966 participants) reported on the number of participants reaching target dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This was also higher in the NLT group compared to usual care (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.47, low-quality evidence). However, there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity in this pooled analysis. We rated the risk of bias in these studies as high mainly due to a lack of clarity regarding incomplete outcome data, lack of reporting on adverse events associated with the intervention, and the inability to blind participants and personnel. Participants in the NLT group reached maximal dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in half the time compared with participants in usual care. Two studies reported on adverse events; one of these studies stated there were no adverse events, and the other study found one adverse event but did not specify the type or severity of the adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

Participants in the NLT group experienced fewer hospital admissions for any cause and an increase in survival and number of participants reaching target dose within a shorter time period. However, the quality of evidence regarding the proportion of participants reaching target dose was low and should be interpreted with caution. We found high-quality evidence supporting NLT as one strategy that may improve the optimisation of beta-adrenergic blocking agents resulting in a reduction in hospital admissions. Despite evidence of a dose-dependent relationship of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs with improving outcomes in patients with HFrEF, the translation of this evidence into clinical practice is poor. NLT is one strategy that facilitates the implementation of this evidence into practice.

### Β-blockers and 1-year postdischarge mortality for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and slow discharge heart rate [^8baa7832]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Because of the nature of the study design, albeit a large prospective cohort study, we were unable to exclude confounding factors that may have influenced the variable effect of the β‐blockers according to patients' heart rates. The results remain to be proven in a randomized clinical trial of patients with low heart rate treated by β‐blockers or placebo. The proportion of β‐blocker usage and the prescribed doses were lower in this study compared with other clinical trials. Although these details may accurately reflect actual clinical practice in Asia, the study results cannot be extrapolated to other patients who receive higher dose of β‐blockers. Finally, it is unknown whether the same cutoff value for low heart rate can be applied for both atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm. This cutoff should be tested in a larger cohort with atrial fibrillation patients.

### Effect of age and sex on efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: individual patient data meta-analysis [^2c9fa972]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in a broad age range of women and men with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by pooling individual patient data from placebo controlled randomised trials.

Design

Prospectively designed meta-analysis of individual patient data from patients aged 40–85 in sinus rhythm at baseline, with left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.45.

Participants

13,833 patients from 11 trials; median age 64; 24% women.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was all cause mortality; the major secondary outcome was admission to hospital for heart failure. Analysis was by intention to treat with an adjusted one stage Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

Compared with placebo, β blockers were effective in reducing mortality across all ages: hazard ratios were 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.83) for the first quarter of age distribution (median age 50); 0.71 (0.58 to 0.87) for the second quarter (median age 60); 0.65 (0.53 to 0.78) for the third quarter (median age 68); and 0.77 (0.64 to 0.92) for the fourth quarter (median age 75). There was no significant interaction when age was modelled continuously (P = 0.1), and the absolute reduction in mortality was 4.3% over a median follow-up of 1.3 years (number needed to treat 23). Admission to hospital for heart failure was significantly reduced by β blockers, although this effect was attenuated at older ages (interaction P = 0.05). There was no evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and sex in any age group. Drug discontinuation was similar regardless of treatment allocation, age, or sex (14.4% in those give β blockers, 15.6% in those receiving placebo).

Conclusion

Irrespective of age or sex, patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm should receive β blockers to reduce the risk of death and admission to hospital. Registration PROSPERO CRD42014010012; Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00832442.

### Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: medical management [^8c972f85]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has advanced in recent decades, and patients are surviving longer. The goals of HFrEF treatment are to reduce mortality, hospitalizations, and the severity of symptoms while improving functional status and quality of life. Treatments shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, known as guideline-directed medical therapy, include renin-angiotensin system/neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Guidelines recommend initiation with target dose titration within 6 to 12 weeks of diagnosis. Secondary therapies such as digoxin, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, ivabradine, and vericiguat are indicated in certain patients with persistent or worsening symptoms. Guideline-directed medical therapy may require dosage adjustment due to adverse effects such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, and worsening kidney function. Intravenous iron replacement is recommended in patients with iron deficiency to improve functional status and quality of life. Device and interventional therapies may be indicated in those with prolonged QRS duration to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death. Point-of-care ultrasonography can help diagnose heart failure and assess effectiveness of diuretic therapy.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^a0c1c6ce]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

What was the rate of 'target dose' achievement in trials?

Tables 1, 2, 3 show the proportion of patients achieving the 'target dose' of treatment in trials, with all the caveats described above. As can be seen in trials using an ACE inhibitor or ARB, on average approximately 50%–70% of patients achieved a target dose, although the placebo‐controlled trials showed that the proportion of patients attaining the target dose in the placebo group was not 100% (Table 1). Indeed, in CONSENSUS, the trial that included patients with the most advanced heart failure, only 45% of patients in the placebo group were titrated to the target dose, indicating that failure to successfully up‐titrate therapy is often because of the patient's underlying condition, and changes in condition over time, or physician perception, independent of the effect of treatment. The data for beta‐blockers are generally similar with the exception of CIBIS‐ELD, a trial designed to compare target dose attainment and tolerability of bisoprolol and carvedilol. It is not clear why only 31% of patients reached the target dose, although all participants were aged 65 years or older. Importantly, the low rate of target dose attainment was despite the prescription of a beta‐blocker in 60% of participants before trial entry (Table 2). Similarly, the achievement of target dose appears to differ greatly between RALES and EMPHASIS‐HF. However, target dose achievement with MRAs is particularly hard to assess given the protocol mandated reasons not to increase dose and the higher rate of target dose achievement in EMPHASIS‐HF likely reflected the stratification of dose by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline in that trial.

Cardiac rhythm management devices: cornerstones of comprehensive, patient‐centred management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

According to current estimates, there are 60 million individuals with heart failure (HF) worldwide, and approximately one in four persons will develop HF during their lifetime.HF is a leading cause of hospitalization and its mortality remains high, with a 1‐year risk of 15–30% post‐hospital discharge. Half of the patients diagnosed with HF die within 5 years of diagnosis. Across European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries, HF accounts for 5.8% of total deaths (14.6% of cardiovascular disease deaths) in females and for 4.4% of total deaths (12.5% of cardiovascular disease deaths) in males.HF can affect quality of life (QoL) and the ability to carry out activities of daily living, as well as mental health and psychosocial well‐being. A patient‐centred, multidisciplinary approach is needed to achieve timely, evidence‐based and comprehensive care, optimizing the use of all therapeutic options including medications, medical devices, surgery or other procedures, lifestyle modifications, and regular patient monitoring, while considering patients' clinical characteristics and preferences.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is characterized by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%and affects 40% to 50% of patients with HF. Current HF guidelines make strong recommendations for quadruple drug therapy in HFrEF, namely (1) angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi) (or angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi]/angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB]), (2) beta‐blockers, (3) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and (4) sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)., Rapid initiation of foundational pharmacological therapy is recommended, and survival advantages support early initiation of comprehensive treatment over sequential initiation and titration to target doses., Practitioners are encouraged to personalize treatment based on patient characteristics and comorbidities. After initiation and optimization of quadruple therapy, additional drug therapies can be considered in selected patients.

Chronic heart failure — trial populations and outcomes with beta-blockers: Beta-blockers have been evaluated in more than 20 000 patients across more than 20 published placebo-controlled trials, enrolling patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as EF less than 35% to 45% who were already treated with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), with or without digitalis. Trials generally excluded or underrepresented patients with preserved systolic function, low heart rates (less than 65 beats per min), low systolic blood pressure (less than 85 mm Hg), hospitalization, or class IV HF; one carvedilol trial enrolled clinically stable NYHA class III and IV patients free of edema and showed a mortality reduction similar to less advanced disease. Collectively, long-term beta-blocker therapy can lessen HF symptoms, improve clinical status and well-being, and reduce the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization, with benefits seen regardless of coronary artery disease or diabetes status and in women and black patients; favorable effects were also observed in patients already taking ACEIs, suggesting additive effects from combined blockade of the 2 neurohormonal systems.

### Serial heart rates, guideline-directed beta blocker use, and outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^d334e8cb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

A single heart rate (HR) measurement may inform future prognosis in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The importance of elevated HR across serial assessment is uncertain, particularly with well-applied guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) with beta blockers (BBs). In this post hoc analysis of 129 patients with chronic HFrEF in sinus rhythm, who had aggressive medication titration over 10.6 months, HR and BB use were assessed at each visit (average of 6 visits per patient). All-cause mortality was assessed. At baseline, 81 subjects (62.8%) had HR ≥ 70 beats/min; 40 subjects (31.0%) had high HR despite being on ≥ 50% of GDMT BB dose. At final visit, 30.4% of the subjects still had high HR despite achieving ≥ 50% target BB dose. There were no significant baseline differences in demographics or BB doses in patients with HR < 70 vs HR ≥ 70 beats/min. In adjusted model in which HR was treated as time-dependent covariate, an increase in HR of 10 beats/min was associated with an increased hazard of all-cause mortality during follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio per 10 beats/min = 2.46; 95% confidence interval 1.46–4.16, p < 0.001). In conclusion, in well-managed patients with HFrEF, high HR was frequent even after aggressive medication titration, and often despite being on at least 50% of GDMT BB dose. An increase in HR was associated with worse clinical outcomes (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT#00351390).

OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT DRUG TREATMENT OF HF IN PATIENTS WITH A PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION

The objectives of HF treatment are to increase survival, reduce hospitalizations for worsening HF, and improve quality of life. To achieve these objectives, current Americanand EuropeanHF guidelines have developed specific treatment recommendations for patients with HFrEF. In contrast, most patients with a mildly reduced and a midrange LVEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF, respectively, have been left with symptomatic supportive care due to an alleged lack of evidence. Due to data that have emerged from recent RCTs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved new HF drugs, and American guidelines have been revised accordingly. Also, the European Medical Agency (EMA) and European HF Guidelines may follow, at least partly with the SGLT2Is but not with the traditional drug classes mentioned above.

The treatment recommendations for HFrEF include renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (ACEI or ARB, alternatively ARNI), selected beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2Is. The results of major outcome trials and the scientific basis for using these drug classes, "cornerstones," in HFpEF, are summarized in Figure 3 and are further discussed based on information included in Tables 2 and 5.

Figure 3.
The cornerstones of drug treatment of heart failure. Abbreviations are defined in the footnotes in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol are included because these beta-blockers have been proven to reduce mortality in HFrEF. Hypertensive patients with severe HF may have low blood pressure because of very high total peripheral resistance and may need careful in-hospital up-titration of medications from all 4 corners, as indicated in the lower part of Figure 3.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^548a7635]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations

A correlation between tolerability to the target doses or titration success and mortality cannot be established on the basis of our data due to the short follow-up. Another limitation might be that there is no recommended beta-blocker target dose for patients with preserved LVEF. However, despite a lack of proven reduction in mortality, there is an expert-based recommendation of heart rate lowering using beta-blockers in diastolic heart failure and for reasons of comparison, we used the same dose. In addition, recent data from SENIORS suggest that beta-blockers may possibly be effective in patients with LVEF > 35%. It may be considered a limitation that only 25% of patients reached the primary endpoint though a target of 50% was planned. However, this should first be seen as an unexpected outcome which deserves consideration when speaking about the meaning of target dose, and second, it is not a true limitation as the power of the study was not reduced. Further, it was not mandatory for CIBIS-ELD investigators to document reasons for titration failure. Therefore, a blinded endpoint committee assessed the patients' clinical data at the time of titration failure (for failures unrelated to adverse events) and potential reasons for titration failure were recorded where possible.

### Benefit of beta blockers in patients with heart failure… [^d957da61]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Although beta-blocking medications have been demonstrated to improve left ventricular function and morbidity in patients with heart failure, concerns about safety and the overall effect on mortality have limited the routine use of these agents. Meta-analysis of several clinical trials has shown an estimated reduction in mortality of about 30 percent. A large European multicenter trial reports on the effect of beta blockade on rates of mortality in patients with heart failure. The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study group included over 100 investigators in 20 countries, and 2, 647 symptomatic patients with heart failure were enrolled. Patients were 18 to 80 years of age with symptoms consistent with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractions of 35 percent or less. The study was stopped early because the mortality rate in the bisoprolol patients was significantly less than that in patients receiving placebo.

The mean follow-up time was 1. 3 years. During this period, 156 treated patients died, compared with 228 patients in the placebo group. Patients receiving bisoprolol were significantly less likely to die from or be admitted to the hospital for a cardiovascular event. These differences were maintained when data were analyzed by cause and severity of heart failure. The incidence of sudden death was reduced by 42 percent in patients receiving bisoprolol. Hospital admission for deteriorating heart failure was reduced by 32 percent. Admissions were also significantly reduced for ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and hypotension but were increased for stroke, although the increase was not significant.

The authors conclude that beta blockade has a significant benefit in patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure. These findings confirm the benefit projected from meta-analyses and other studies. They recommend that beta blockers be added to standard therapeutic regimens of diuretics and ACE inhibitors in patients with stable heart failure. Since much remains to be elucidated about the optimal use of these combinations of treatments, they recommend starting with a low dosage of a beta blocker and progressively increasing to the maximum tolerated dosage. In this study, 10 mg daily was the most common maintenance dosage.

### Should β-blocker therapy be reduced or withdrawn after an episode of decompensated heart failure? Results from COMET [^af12e2ec]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether beta-blocker therapy should be reduced or withdrawn in patients who develop acute decompensated heart failure (HF). We studied the relationship between changes in beta-blocker dose and outcome in patients surviving a HF hospitalisation in COMET.

Methods

Patients hospitalised for HF were subdivided on the basis of the beta-blocker dose administered at the visit following hospitalisation, compared to that administered before.

Results

In COMET, 752/3029 patients (25%, 361 carvedilol and 391 metoprolol) had a non-fatal HF hospitalisation while on study treatment. Of these, 61 patients (8%) had beta-blocker treatment withdrawn, 162 (22%) had a dose reduction and 529 (70%) were maintained on the same dose. One-and two-year cumulative mortality rates were 28.7% and 44.6% for patients withdrawn from study medication, 37.4% and 51.4% for those with a reduced dosage (n.s.) and 19.1% and 32.5% for those maintained on the same dose (HR,1.59; 95%CI, 1.28–1.98; p < 0.001, compared to the others). The result remained significant in a multivariable model: (HR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.02–1.66; p = 0.0318). No interaction with the beneficial effects of carvedilol, compared to metoprolol, on outcome was observed (p = 0.8436).

Conclusions

HF hospitalisations are associated with a high subsequent mortality. The risk of death is higher in patients who discontinue beta-blocker therapy or have their dose reduced. The increase in mortality is only partially explained by the worse prognostic profile of these patients.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation and titration for HFrEF emphasize early, rapid implementation of the 4-drug regimen based on contemporary evidence. Established pharmacological therapies for chronic HFrEF include angiotensin II receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), evidence-based beta-blockers, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors, mineralocorticoid antagonists, loop diuretic agents, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate, ivabradine, and vericiguat, and in contrast, use of digoxin as a treatment for HFrEF lacks contemporary data and is focused on rate control in atrial fibrillation in those with low blood pressure. Using a therapeutic standard 4-drug regimen (ARNI, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist, SGLT inhibitor), 4-class initiation reduced the hazard of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for HF compared with ACE inhibitor/ARB plus a beta-blocker (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.3–0.47). Among patients admitted with acute HF, a high-intensity strategy targeting doses within 6 weeks of discharge was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with a reduced risk of 180-day all-cause death or HF readmission compared with usual care. In higher-risk HFrEF with worsening symptoms, vericiguat was superior to placebo in reducing HF hospitalization and/or cardiovascular death and subsequently received a Class 2b recommendation in the updated 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline. The document notes the need for more frequent follow-ups, especially after initiation or titration, which may be in-person or virtual depending on patient stability and adjustments.

Critical factors that contribute to the widespread failure to achieve and maintain target doses of neurohormonal antagonists

Why are most patients with chronic heart failure treated for long periods of time with only one or two drugs or with doses that are much lower than the doses that have been shown to prolong life? There are several contributory factors.

First, many physicians may be unfamiliar with the doses of neurohormonal antagonists that have been shown to prolong survival in chronic heart failure. The target doses of most neurohormonal antagonists used to treat heart failure are typically higher than the doses of the drugs when they are used to treat other cardiovascular disorders. For example, the usual doses of candesartan and valsartan used for the treatment of hypertension (4–8 mg daily and 40–80 mg daily, respectively) are far lower than the target doses in the large‐scale trials in heart failure (32 and 320 mg daily, respectively). 30, 31 Similarly, the optimal dose for losartan for heart failure (150 mg daily) is higher than that approved in the US for any cardiovascular indication 19; the commonly prescribed dose of 50 mg daily appears to be inferior to ACE inhibitors with respect to mortality reduction. 32, 33 The dose of metoprolol succinate used for hypertension or angina is 25–100 mg daily, but the target dose used in the landmark heart failure trial was 200 mg daily. 34

### Β-blocker therapy in heart failure: scientific review [^04fa9124]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Care of patients with heart failure has been revolutionized throughout the past decade. A paradigm shift in the strategy for treating heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is in progress. Despite the initial perception about beta-blockers' safety, they are now the most extensively studied class of agents in the treatment of heart failure and have emerged as an important intervention to improve the clinical outcomes of heart failure patients.

Objective

To provide scientific rationale for the use of beta-blockers for patients with heart failure.

Data Sources

All English-language articles of large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the mortality benefits of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure were identified to provide the scientific rationale for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure. Basic science studies were reviewed to provide an overview of the potential physiologic role of beta-blockers in heart failure. Finally, clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with heart failure were assessed to determine current recommendations for the use of these agents.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled clinical trials of beta-blockers that included more than 300 subjects and assessed mortality as a primary end point.

Data Synthesis

Of the 4 beta-blockers tested in large randomized controlled clinical trials of patients with heart failure, 3 are available in the United States, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol; 2 of these, carvedilol and metoprolol, have Food and Drug Administration indications for the treatment of heart failure. Compared with placebo treatment, beta-blocker use is associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with class II and III heart failure.

Conclusions

Tested in more than 10,000 patients, beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, beta-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. The science supporting beta-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.

### Optimizing foundational therapies in patients with HFrEF: how Do we translate these findings into clinical care? [^f378516c]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the high risk of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), there is an urgent need for the initiation and titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines are now emphasizing the need for early and rapid initiation of therapies that have cardiovascular benefit. Recognizing that there are many barriers to GDMT initiation and optimization, health care providers should aim to introduce the 4 pillars of quadruple therapy now recommended by most clinical practice guidelines: angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. A large proportion of patients with HFrEF do not have clinical contraindications to GDMT but are not treated with these therapies. Early initiation of low-dose combination therapy should be tolerated by most patients. However, patient-related factors such as hemodynamics, frailty, and laboratory values will need consideration for maximum tolerated GDMT. GDMT initiation in acute heart failure hospitalization represents another important avenue to improve use of GDMT. Finally, removal of therapies that do not have clear cardiovascular benefit should be considered to lower polypharmacy and reduce the risk of adverse side effects. Future prospective studies aimed at guiding optimal implementation of quadruple therapy are warranted to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF.

### Heart failure medication dosage and survival in women and men seen at outpatient clinics [^b041f08f]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) may reach optimal treatment effect at half of the guideline-recommended medication dose. This study investigates prescription practice and its relation with survival of patients with HF in daily care.

Methods

Electronic health record data from 13 Dutch outpatient cardiology clinics were extracted for HF receiving at least one guideline-recommended HF medication. Dose changes over consecutive prescriptions were modelled using natural cubic splines. Inverse probability-weighted Cox regression was used to assess the relationship between dose (reference ≥ 50% target dose) and all-cause mortality.

Results

The study population comprised 561 women (29% HFrEF (ejection fraction (EF) < 40%), 49% heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥ 50%); HFpEF and 615 men (47% and 25%, respectively). During a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 252 patients died (48% women; 167 HFrEF, 84 HFpEF). Nine hundred thirty-four patients (46% women) received ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 795 (48% women) beta blockers and 178 (42% women) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). In both sexes, the mean target dose across prescriptions was 50% for ACEI/ARBs and beta blockers, and 100% for MRAs. ACEI/ARB dose of < 50% was associated with lower mortality in women but not in men with HFrEF. This was not seen in patients with HFpEF. Beta-blocker dose was not associated with all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

Patients with HF seen in outpatient cardiology clinics receive half of the guideline-recommended medication dose. Lower ACEI/ARB dose was associated with improved survival in women with HFrEF. These results underscore the importance of (re)defining optimal medical therapy for women with HFrEF.

### Association between the β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, all-cause mortality and length of hospitalization in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a53458ab]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF) is defined as the presence of heart failure in the absence of any evidence of reduced LV ejection fraction. This type of heart failure is also known as heart failure with intact left ventricular (LV) function. The incidence of HFpEF is on the rise, and research has linked it to an increase in the number of patients who require hospitalization. Numerous studies on patients with chronic heart failure have shown that this syndrome has a high mortality and morbidity rate. However, evidence from clinical studies revealing improvements in mortality has been variable and essentially unbiased; a few investigations suggest that pharmacological therapy may improve the tolerance for exercise and quality of life of these people. Given that patients with heart failure with intact left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are more likely to be older and have a greater number of comorbidities than their counterparts, the efficacy of pharmacological treatment may be best assessed by its impact on hospitalization and associated symptoms. This condition can be treated with neprilysin inhibitors, sacubitril, valsaltran, an interleukin‐1 blocker, Spironolactone, a RAAS blocker, a beta‐blocker (BB), Sildenafil, an aldosterone antagonist, empagliflozin, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs)., Even though there is a paucity of evidence supporting their advantages, BBs are often recommended for HFpEF. BBs, or beta‐adrenergic blocking medications, works by inhibiting the release of stress chemicals adrenaline and noradrenaline in specific regions, which decreases the heart rate and the force with which blood is pushed throughout the body. In their research articles, Yum et al.and Xu et al.found that over 80% of patients with HFpEF received BBs. However, current research suggests a link between the use of CCBs and better outcomes in individuals with HFpEF. CCBs improve HFPEF by reducing peripheral vasoconstriction and, thus, lowering left ventricular afterload. For instance, Vider et al.reported in their study article that the use of CCBs was related to reduced risks of death in patients with HFpEF, whereas Borlaug et al.observed that CCBs were the third‐ or fourth‐line therapy for hypertension in patients with HFpEF. Due to conflicting or insufficient information concerning the effects of medications in patients with HFpEF, it is essential to examine the efficacy of both current treatment choices to avert unembellished outcomes in patients with HFpEF. There is an immediate need for treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet there are currently no medications that have been shown to be successful. Patients with HFpEF routinely get BBs despite a lack of clinical evidence supporting their use. Recent clinical trials have shown that more than 75% of patients with HFpEF are being treated with BBs. Similarly, recent studies suggested that HFpEF patients who used CCBs had better results. In this meta‐analysis, we sought to examine the impact of BBs and CCBs on all‐cause mortality and hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and preserved LVEF.

### Effect of beta blockers in chronic heart failure… [^4c2f0081]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The 18 trials enrolled a total of 3, 023 patients with heart failure that was caused by idiopathic dilated cardiopathy and ischemic heart disease. For all end points, there was a significant effect in favor of treatment with beta blockers. Patients taking beta blockers experienced a 32 percent reduction in the risk of death and a 41 percent reduction in hospitalizations compared with the placebo-treated patients. Patients receiving beta blockers also showed a 32 percent improvement in NYHA classification and were 30 percent less likely to have worsening symptoms. The ejection fraction increased by 29 percent in patients treated with beta blockers compared with placebo-treated patients. Assuming a treatment period identical to the mean duration of follow-up, the authors determined that physicians would need to treat 38 patients to avoid one death, 24 patients to avoid one hospitalization and 15 patients to avoid one combined end point.

The effects of treatment in trials of nonselective beta blockers were compared with those in trials of beta 1-selective agents. The risk of death was reduced by 49 percent in trials of nonselective beta blockers but by only 18 percent in trials of beta 1-selective agents. This difference was statistically significant. The meta-analysis indicates that the use of beta blockers is associated with a reduction in mortality of about 30 percent in patients with heart failure. Any uncertainty about the effect of beta blockers on rates of survival is heightened by the finding that the magnitude of the mortality reduction depends on the pharmacologic properties of the drug used. While selective and nonselective beta blockers increased ejection fractions and decreased hospitalizations in a similar way, nonselective beta blockers were associated with a larger survival benefit than beta. 1 and beta 2 receptors.

It is possible that blockage of alpha receptors might account for the larger reduction in mortality observed with nonselective agents in the present analysis. The authors conclude that unlike other meta-analyses, this analysis did not confine itself to mortality but rather analyzed nonfatal measures of outcome such as hospitalizations. For these variables, the number of events was large and the treatment effects were robust. This meta-analysis demonstrates that the addition of a beta blocker to conventional therapy is associated with hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement as well as favorable effects on morbidity and mortality. Physicians have sufficient evidence to support the use of beta blockers in heart failure.

Ivabradine in HFrEF — indications, outcomes, and use are summarized: ivabradine is an adjunct to reduce heart rate in chronic HFrEF with an LVEF ≤ 35% and in sinus rhythm; in SHIFT, a trial of 6,505 subjects, adding ivabradine to guideline-directed medical therapy reduced heart failure hospitalizations (672 [21%] placebo vs 514 [16%] ivabradine; HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.66–0.83; P < 0.0001), with benefits noted especially for those on beta-blocker doses ≤ 50% of GDMT targets and resting heart rate ≥ 77 beats/min at entry; ivabradine is indicated only for patients mainly in sinus rhythm, not those with persistent or chronic AF, those experiencing 100% atrial pacing, or those who are unstable, and in SHIFT there was a requirement for sinus rhythm at least 40% of the time and nearly 10% had a history of paroxysmal AF; the guideline provides a Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B-R recommendation to reduce HF hospitalization in HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 35%) on GDMT and in sinus rhythm with a heart rate > 70 beats/min at rest, and the drug is titrated to a heart rate between 50–60 beats/min if possible; despite target beta-blocker dosing, some patients have persistent resting heart rates over 70 beats/min.

### Heart failure medication dosage and survival in women and men seen at outpatient clinics [^514daa00]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

We found that women with HFrEF receiving < 50% of the guideline-recommended ACEI/ARB target dose had a better prognosis than women receiving higher doses. The cubic spline analysis also suggested women might do better on lower dosages, while men may have a better prognosis on higher dosages, in line with previous findings. Literature has not identified definite sex differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for ACEI/ARBs, although pharmacogenomic data suggest the risk of ACEI-specific side effects may be influenced by sex. Despite this uncertainty about the biological mechanisms underlying our observations, our findings support the hypothesis that sex-specific ACEI/ARB target doses might benefit patients with HFrEF. Prospective dose-finding trials are needed to determine the exact optimal dosage. Importantly, our findings are based on patients with HF with above-average survival situated between the GP and the hospital and may therefore not be generalisable to patients with more severe HF.

In contrast to previous work, we did not find an association between beta-blocker dosage and mortality risk in patients with HFrEF. This was surprising because women have a lower distribution volume and slower clearance for this medication, which results in higher beta-blocker blood concentrations compared with men. These unintentional higher doses may lead to ADRs that negatively affect medication adherence and long-term prognosis, which advocates for sex-specific dosing. The cubic spline for beta blockers even showed a trend opposite to the previous study, with women doing better at higher doses. This might be an artefact due to the lower sample size or because of residual confounding.

Alternatively, the lack of association between dosage and all-cause mortality may be explained by the low prevalence of prior cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities in our population. Data on the effectiveness of guideline-recommended treatment in relatively healthy patients with HF treated by a GP are scarce. A meta-analysis of HF trials showed that treatment with ACEIs, beta blockers and MRAs reduced mortality risk equally for all New York Heart Association classes. However, the only trial that focused specifically on patients with mild HF (defined here as patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction) found no difference in all-cause mortality between treatment and placebo. ACEI treatment did reduce HF-related hospitalisations in those with mild HF and the incidence of HF in those with reduced EF but no symptoms, suggesting all-cause mortality might not be the most clinically relevant outcome in our HF population. Future work should include HF hospitalisations and QoL outcomes.

14.3 Heart Failure

MERIT-HF was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of TOPROL-XL in which 3991 patients with ejection fraction ≤ 0.40 and NYHA Class II-IV heart failure attributable to ischemia, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy were randomized 1:1 to TOPROL-XL or placebo. The protocol excluded patients with contraindications to beta-blocker use, those expected to undergo heart surgery, and those within 28 days of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The primary endpoints of the trial were (1) all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (time to first event) and (2) all-cause mortality. Patients were stabilized on optimal concomitant therapy for heart failure, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, and nitrates. At randomization, 41% of patients were NYHA Class II; 55% NYHA Class III; 65% of patients had heart failure attributed to ischemic heart disease; 44% had a history of hypertension; 25% had diabetes mellitus; 48% had a history of myocardial infarction. Among patients in the trial, 90% were on diuretics, 89% were on ACE inhibitors, 64% were on digitalis, 27% were on a lipid-lowering agent, 37% were on an oral anticoagulant, and the mean ejection fraction was 0.28. The mean duration of follow-up was one year. At the end of the study, the mean daily dose of TOPROL-XL was 159 mg.

The trial was terminated early for a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (34%, nominal p = 0.00009). The risk of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization was reduced by 19% (p = 0.00012). The trial also showed improvements in heart failure-related mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations, and NYHA functional class.

The table below shows the principal results for the overall study population.

### Meta-analysis of the effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol on all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure [^0e6de128]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with appropriate doses of carvedilol or metoprolol is currently recommended for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to decrease the risk of death, hospitalizations, and patients' symptoms. It remains unclear if the β blockers used in patients with HFrEF are equal or carvedilol is superior to metoprolol types. We performed a meta-analysis of the comparative effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate and succinate on all-cause mortality and/or hospitalization. We conducted an Embase and MEDLINE search for prospective controlled trials and cohort studies of patients with HFrEF who were received to treatment with carvedilol versus metoprolol. We identified 4 prospective controlled and 6 cohort studies with 30,943 patients who received carvedilol and 69,925 patients on metoprolol types (tartrate and succinate) with an average follow-up duration of 36.4 months. All-cause mortality was reduced in prospective studies with carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate. Neither all-cause mortality nor hospitalizations were significantly different between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in the cohort studies. In conclusion, in patients with HFrEF, carvedilol and metoprolol succinate have similar effects in reducing all-cause mortality.

14.3 Heart Failure

MERIT-HF was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in which 3,991 patients with ejection fraction ≤ 0.40 and NYHA Class II-IV heart failure attributable to ischemia, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy were randomized 1:1 to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or placebo. The protocol excluded patients with contraindications to beta-blocker use, those expected to undergo heart surgery, and those within 28 days of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The primary endpoints of the trial were (1) all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (time to first event) and (2) all-cause mortality. Patients were stabilized on optimal concomitant therapy for heart failure, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, and nitrates. At randomization, 41% of patients were NYHA Class II; 55% NYHA Class III; 65% of patients had heart failure attributed to ischemic heart disease; 44% had a history of hypertension; 25% had diabetes mellitus; 48% had a history of myocardial infarction. Among patients in the trial, 90% were on diuretics, 89% were on ACE inhibitors, 64% were on digitalis, 27% were on a lipid-lowering agent, 37% were on an oral anticoagulant, and the mean ejection fraction was 0.28. The mean duration of follow-up was one year. At the end of the study, the mean daily dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets was 159 mg.

The trial was terminated early for a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (34%, nominal p = 0.00009). The risk of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization was reduced by 19% (p = 0.00012). The trial also showed improvements in heart failure-related mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations, and NYHA functional class.

The table below shows the principal results for the overall study population. The figure below illustrates principal results for a wide variety of subgroup comparisons, including US vs. non-US populations (the latter of which was not pre-specified).

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^90dcc908]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

What drug treatments should be considered essential to the management of patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction?

Accordingly, for purposes of the present review, the treatments that are considered to be essential and broadly applicable to patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction are (i) inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system; (ii) neprilysin inhibitors (i.e. sacubitril/valsartan); (iii) beta‐adrenergic blockers that have been shown to prolong life (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol); and (iv) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 1, 2, 11 The evidence base for each of these drug classes is clinically persuasive and statistically robust. The magnitude of the incremental benefit of each drug class is meaningful (at least 20% reduction in the risk of death) for neprilysin inhibitors, beta‐blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 11 Furthermore, these three classes of drugs have each been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death 18; consequently, the utilization of these drugs cannot be reasonably delayed even if patients are clinically stable. 10, 11 In contrast, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have only a modest benefit on the risk of death (5–16% risk reduction) 19; the survival benefit cannot be enhanced by intensification of treatment 20, 21; and they do not reduce the risk of sudden death. 22

Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can prolong survival, but the combination may be inferior to ACE inhibitors with respect to mortality. 23 Use of this drug combination in the modern era is based on an analysis of a relatively small number of events in a select population. 11 Furthermore, sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors are not considered in the current framework, since the evidence base supporting their ability to reduce mortality in patients with established heart failure is still evolving. 24 If the survival benefits are confirmed by additional trials, these drugs can be included in our proposed system.

### Uptitration of renin-angiotensin system blocker and β-blocker therapy in patients hospitalized for heart failure with reduced versus preserved left ventricular ejection fractions [^2832ac06]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

In ambulatory patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (rEF), renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and β-blockers at guideline-recommended target dose reduce all-cause mortality and readmissions. Benefits in HF with preserved ejection fraction (pEF), as well as uptitration after a hospitalization, remain uncertain. This study assesses the impact of RAS- and β-blocker uptitrations in patients with HFrEF versus HFpEF during and immediately after a hospital admission. In consecutive patients (209 HFrEF with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% and 108 HFpEF with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%), RAS- and β-blocker dose changes were followed during 6 months after an index HF hospitalization. Patients with a RAS- and β-blocker dose increase of ≥ 10% of the recommended target dose were compared with patients without uptitration. Patients who received uptitration were significantly younger, with a higher heart rate and better renal function, and received spironolactone more often. Both RAS- and β-blocker uptitrations were associated with significant reductions in the composite end-point of all-cause mortality or HF readmissions in HFrEF (hazard ratio [HR] 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.60 and HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.81, respectively). After correction for age, heart rate, blood pressure, renal function, and spironolactone use, this association remained significant for RAS blockers (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93, p = 0.027) but not for β-blockers (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.09, p = 0.101). No benefit of RAS- or β-blocker uptitration was observed in HFpEF. In conclusion, uptitration of neurohumoral blockers after an HF hospitalization is more frequently performed in younger patients with low co-morbidity burden. RAS-blocker uptitration independently predicts clinical outcome in patients with HFrEF but not in those with HFpEF.

### Association between β-blocker use and mortality / morbidity in older patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A propensity score-matched analysis from the Swedish heart failure registry [^9facfee0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers reduce mortality and morbidity in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, patients older than 80years are poorly represented in randomized controlled trials. We assessed the association between beta-blocker use and outcomes in HFrEF patients aged ≥ 80years.

Methods and Results

We included patients with an ejection fraction < 40% and aged ≥ 80years from the Swedish HF Registry. The association between beta-blocker use, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality/HF hospitalization was assessed by Cox proportional hazard models in a 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort. To assess consistency, the same analyses were performed in a positive control cohort with age < 80years. A negative control outcome analysis was run using hospitalization for cancer as endpoint. Of 6562 patients aged ≥ 80years, 5640 (86%) received beta-blockers. In the matched cohort including 1732 patients, beta-blocker use was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79–0.99]. Reduction in CV mortality/HF hospitalization was not significant (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85–1.05) due to the lack of association with HF hospitalization, whereas CV death was significantly reduced. After adjustment rather than matching for the propensity score in the overall cohort, beta-blocker use was associated with reduced risk of all outcomes. In patients aged < 80years, use of beta-blockers was associated with reduced risk of all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92) and of the composite outcome (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99).

Conclusions

In HFrEF patients ≥ 80years of age, use of beta-blockers was high and was associated with improved all-cause and CV survival.

### Β-blockers and outcomes in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction… [^a7d25e78]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

In the matched HFREF cohort, β-blockers were associated with reduced mortality and also with reduced combined mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Quiz Ref IDIn this large prospective propensity score–matched registry analysis of unselected patients with HFPEF, β-blockers were associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Findings in HFPEF were also similar to findings in a positive-control consistency analysis in patients with HFREF, in whom β-blockers have been proven to reduce mortality. However, β-blockers used to treat HFPEF were not associated with improved combined all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Among those with an ejection fraction higher than 35%, 77% had coronary disease, 24 which may explain the benefit. In small RCTs, β-blockers improved the ratio of early to late ventricular filling velocity7 but not clinical outcomes.

9 Among observational studies, 2 reports from the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure registry did not find an association between β-blocker use and outcomes, 10, 11 but 2 small studies12, 13 and a meta-analysis25 suggested improved outcomes. In unadjusted analysis, there was a separation of survival curves, with a 23% reduction in mortality. This may partly be explained by differences in baseline characteristics. Thus, the reduction in mortality was attenuated after matching by age and propensity score, for which patient characteristics were virtually identical, and the separation in survival curves was more subtle. In the main analysis, with consideration of β-blocker use at baseline only, the mortality reduction was 7%.

However, unlike in RCTs, there were no specific efforts to maintain treatment, and considerable crossover occurred in both directions; in the per-protocol analysis, the mortality-reduction was greater at 14%. β-Blockers were associated with reduced mortality across subgroups. With only 30% prior myocardial infarction and no interaction with β-blockers, a potential benefit is unlikely mediated via ischemic heart disease. There was no interaction with ejection fraction, suggesting potential benefits are similar in ejection fraction levels of 50% or higher compared with ejection fraction values ranging 40% through 49%.

### Association between use of β-blockers and outcomes in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^9b031817]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) may be as common and may have similar mortality as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). β-Blockers reduce mortality in HFREF but are inadequately studied in HFPEF.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that β-blockers are associated with reduced all-cause mortality in HFPEF.

Design

Propensity score-matched cohort study using the Swedish Heart Failure Registry. Propensity scores for β-blocker use were derived from 52 baseline clinical and socioeconomic variables.

Setting

Nationwide registry of 67 hospitals with inpatient and outpatient units and 95 outpatient primary care clinics in Sweden with patients entered into the registry between July 1, 2005, and December 30, 2012, and followed up until December 31, 2012.

Participants

From a consecutive sample of 41,976 patients, 19,083 patients with HFPEF (mean [SD] age, 76 [12] years; 46% women). Of these, 8244 were matched 2:1 based on age and propensity score for β-blocker use, yielding 5496 treated and 2748 untreated patients with HFPEF. Also we conducted a positive-control consistency analysis involving 22,893 patients with HFREF, of whom 6081 were matched yielding 4054 treated and 2027 untreated patients.

Exposures

β-Blockers prescribed at discharge from the hospital or during an outpatient visit, analyzed 2 ways: without consideration of crossover and per-protocol analysis with censoring at crossover, if applicable.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was all-cause mortality and the secondary outcome was combined all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization.

Results

Median follow-up in HFPEF was 755 days, overall; 709 days in the matched cohort; no patients were lost to follow-up. In the matched HFPEF cohort, 1-year survival was 80% vs 79% for treated vs untreated patients, and 5-year survival was 45% vs 42%, with 2279 (41%) vs 1244 (45%) total deaths and 177 vs 191 deaths per 1000 patient-years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86–0.996; P = 0.04). β-Blockers were not associated with reduced combined mortality or heart failure hospitalizations: 3368 (61%) vs 1753 (64%) total for first events, with 371 vs 378 first events per 1000 patient-years (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04; P = 0.46). In the matched HFREF cohort, β-blockers were associated with reduced mortality (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82–0.97, P = 0.005) and also with reduced combined mortality or heart failure hospitalization (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.95; P = 0.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with HFPEF, use of β-blockers was associated with lower all-cause mortality but not with combined all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization. β-Blockers in HFPEF should be examined in a large randomized clinical trial.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^96466d1f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1

Table 2

Table 3

A further underappreciated consideration is the influence of concomitant therapy on the dosing of an added treatment. This can be best seen in two trials (CIBIS III and CARMEN) comparing initiation of treatment with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) or a beta‐blocker (bisoprolol or carvedilol) first and adding the alternative second., When enalapril was used first, the dose achieved was larger than when it was used second, i.e. added to a beta‐blocker rather than used before a beta‐blocker (Table 1). Of course, in the trial on which our target dose of enalapril is based on (the treatment arm of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction, SOLVD‐T) the use of a beta‐blocker was minimal.

This 'target dose' approach used in the original placebo‐controlled landmark trials using renin–angiotensin system blockers also influenced the design of subsequent trials comparing and adding alternative agents such as the neprilysin inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination sacubitril/valsartan and the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren. In these trials, all participants were required to demonstrate toleration of the target dose of enalapril (control therapy) before randomization to either the experimental therapy or control therapy. This was because the achievement of at least the mean dose of enalapril shown to be effective in SOLVD‐T was considered a prerequisite for demonstration of non‐inferiority or superiority of the experimental therapy over the established control treatment (enalapril). This design requirement renders understanding the dosing of sacubitril/valsartan particularly difficult as all patients were taking the target dose at the time of randomization (to either continue sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily or to enalapril 10 mg twice daily) – see below.

### Heart failure treatment up-titration and outcome and age: an analysis of BIOSTAT-CHF [^f4172cdb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Several studies have shown that older patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are undertreated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of up-titration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and beta-blockers on outcome across the age spectrum in HFrEF patients.

Methods and Results

We analysed HFrEF patients on sub-optimal doses of ACEI/ARB and/or beta-blockers from the BIOSTAT-CHF study stratified by age. Patients underwent a 3-month up-titration period. We used inverse probability weighting to adjust for the likelihood of successful up-titration to determine the association of achieved dose with mortality and/or heart failure hospitalisation, testing for an interaction with age. Over a median follow-up of 21months in 1720 HFrEF patients (76.5% male, mean age 67years), the primary outcome occurred in 558 patients. Increased percentage of target dose of ACEI/ARB and beta-blocker achieved at 3 months were both significantly associated with reduced incidence of the primary outcome, [ACEI-ARB: hazard ratio (HR) per 12.5% increase in dose: 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–0.94, P < 0.001; beta-blocker: HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95–1.00, P = 0.046], with a significant interaction with age seen for beta-blockers but not ACEI/ARB (P = 0.034 and P = 0.22, respectively).

Conclusions

Achieving higher doses of ACEI/ARB was associated with improved outcome regardless of age. However, achieving higher doses of beta-blockers was only associated with improved outcome in younger, but not in older patients.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^d3489e6e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is associated with an improvement in echocardiographic parametersand international guidelines provide an expert-based recommendation of heart rate lowering using beta-blockers in these patientsdespite a lack of proven reduction in mortality.

We therefore designed the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study in Elderly (CIBIS-ELD) to investigate the tolerability of two of the most widely used beta-blockers in elderly heart failure patients with impaired and preserved LVEF. This is the first randomized, double-blind trial to have as its primary endpoint the tolerability of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol when used at their guideline-recommended target doses.

### Beta-blocker benefit according to severity of heart failure [^e632b25e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Beta-blockers are an established treatment for chronic heart failure. However, the relationship between their benefit and the severity of the disease remains to be determined.

Methods and Results

We studied the relationship between amplitude of benefit of beta-blockers and severity of chronic heart failure, based on data for mortality and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, complementary subgroup analyses and analysis of individual data from the CIBIS II trial. In the meta-analysis, mortality was reduced by 22% (95%CI: 16 to 28) and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure by 24% (95%CI: 20 to 29). Benefit was similar with metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol. After exclusion of bucindolol trials, due to the heterogeneity of results for mortality, the reduction in mortality was similar according to the severity of heart failure, assessed either by left ventricular ejection fraction or by New York Heart Association classification. In CIBIS II, beta-blockers induced a significant reduction in mortality of 45% (95%CI: 9 to 66), 41% (95%CI: 17 to 59) and 23% (95%CI: 1 to 40) in the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively. Hospitalizations were reduced by 35% (95%CI: 2 to 57), 41% (95%CI: 18 to 58) and 23% (95%CI: 0 to 41), there was no significant difference between the three score groups.

Conclusion

We conclude that the amplitude of benefit of the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol on mortality and morbidity is similar, regardless of the severity of chronic heart failure.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^d8fa5d1b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Foundational therapy for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction consists of a combination of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. However, the conventional approach to the implementation is based on a historically-driven sequence that is not strongly evidence-based, typically requires ≥ 6 months, and frequently leads to major gaps in treatment. We propose a rapid sequencing strategy that is based on four principles. First, since drugs act rapidly to reduce morbidity and mortality, patients should be started on all four foundational treatments within 2-4weeks. Second, since the efficacy of each foundational therapy is independent of treatment with the other drugs, priority can be determined by considerations of relative efficacy, safety and ease-of-use. Third, low starting doses of foundational drugs have substantial therapeutic benefits, and achievement of low doses of all four classes of drugs should take precedence over up-titration to target doses. Fourth, since drugs can influence the tolerability of other foundational agents, sequencing can be based on whether agents started earlier can enhance the safety of agents started simultaneously or later in the sequence. We propose an accelerated three-step approach, which consists of the simultaneous initiation of a beta-blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor, followed 1-2weeks later by the initiation of sacubitril/valsartan, and 1-2weeks later by a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The latter two steps can be re-ordered or compressed depending on patient circumstances. Rapid sequencing is a novel evidence-based strategy that has the potential to dramatically improve the implementation of treatments that reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction.

### Effect of age and sex on efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: individual patient data meta-analysis [^654c3b4c]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Eligibility, search strategy, and data collection

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials were identified through computer aided searches (for example, Medline and Current Contents), scrutiny of reference lists of trials, trials registries, meeting abstracts, and review articles as well as discussion with group members and pharmaceutical manufacturers. We included randomised controlled trials that reported mortality as a primary outcome or part of a composite outcome comparing β blockers versus placebo. Only unconfounded head to head trials were eligible, with recruitment of over 300 patients and planned follow-up of more than six months to make the project technically feasible and clinically relevant. The search results, individual study demographics and a standardised data request form to obtain individual patient data from each trial have been published.

The 11 included studies account for 95.7% of eligible participants recruited in randomised controlled trials based on a systematic literature review: the Australia/New Zealand Heart Failure Study (ANZ), the Beta-Blocker Evaluation Survival Trial (BEST), the Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction Study (CAPRICORN), the Carvedilol Hibernating Reversible Ischaemia Trial: Marker of Success Study (CHRISTMAS), the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS I), the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS-II), the Carvedilol Prospective Randomised Cumulative Survival Study (COPERNICUS), the Metoprolol in Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy Study (MDC), the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF), the SENIORS Study, and the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Study (US-HF). All included studies had low overall risk of bias, as determined with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool.

Patient involvement

We have insufficient evidence to comment on whether patients were actively involved in the design or management of these 11 trials.

### Prescription of β-blockers in patients with advanced heart failure and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. clinical implications and survival [^845c0cb5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are not well established.

Aims

To assess the association between beta-blocker prescription at discharge and mortality in a cohort of patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF.

Methods and Results

We prospectively studied a cohort of 443 patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF (LVEF ≥ 40%). Mean age was 78 years, 56% female, 33% NYHA class IV. Overall, 227 patients (51%) had a beta-blocker prescribed at discharge. Mean duration of follow-up was 25 (± 18) months. Death (all cause) occurred in 40 patients (17.6%) who were receiving a beta-blocker at discharge and 73 patients (33.8%) who were not on a beta-blocker. In multivariate Cox analysis, including adjustment for propensity score, prescription of a beta-blocker remained associated with a 43% relative mortality risk reduction (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.88, p = 0.01).

Conclusions

In this cohort of patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF, prescription of a beta-blocker was associated with a significant mortality reduction. This beneficial effect of beta-blocker use needs to be further confirmed in prospective, randomised clinical trials.

### Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction [^3a8e6981]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

### Discharge heart rate and β-blocker dose in patients hospitalized with heart failure: findings from the OPTIMIZE-HF registry [^c291c9b0]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated heart rate of ≥ 70 beats/min despite β-blocker use may represent a new treatment target in patients in sinus rhythm with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, little is known about the proportion of patients with elevated heart rate despite β-blocker therapy.

Methods

We analyzed data from a large clinical registry to describe discharge heart rate as a function of β-blocker use and dose. We included patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% who were admitted with acute heart failure in 2003 and 2004; we excluded patients with a history of atrial arrhythmia or with a pacemaker or cardiac resynchronization therapy. We considered the β-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol, atenolol, and metoprolol tartrate and described discharge dose as a percentage of target dose (ie, < 25%, 25%-49%, 50%-99%, and ≥ 100%).

Results

Among 10,696 patients, median discharge heart rate was 76 beats/min (interquartile range [IQR] 66–86 beats/min). Of these, 7,826 (73%) were discharged on a β-blocker. For patients not on a β-blocker, median discharge heart rate was 80 beats/min (IQR 70–89 beats/min), compared with 78 beats/min (IQR 69–88 beats/min) on < 25% of target dose, 75 beats/min (IQR 66–85 beats/min) on 25% to 49% of target dose, 74 beats/min (IQR 66–82 beats/min) on 50% to 99% of target dose, and 72 beats/min (IQR 65% to 80%) on 100% of target dose or greater (P < .001). Most patients, 7,647 (71%), had a discharge heart rate of ≥ 70 beats/min, including 1,460 (63%) of 2,301 patients discharged on 50% of target dose or greater.

Conclusions

Despite treatment with β-blockers, a substantial proportion of patients hospitalized with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have elevated heart rate at discharge.

### Β-blockers and 1-year postdischarge mortality for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and slow discharge heart rate [^1649d0b5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Among patients with atrial fibrillation, there was no difference in heart rate between patients with and without β‐blocker use (at discharge: 76 ± 14 versus 76 ± 15 bpm, P = 0.652; at 12 months: 79 ± 18 versus 28 ± 17 bpm, P = 0.891). Patients with a β‐blocker at discharge had better baseline characteristics (Table 3). In Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, patients with a β‐blocker at discharge had better outcomes regardless of heart rate. Patients with slow heart rate and without β‐blocker prescription had numerically higher 1‐year mortality than those with β‐blocker prescription (P = 0.239). Nonetheless, patients without a β‐blocker and with high heart rate had the worst outcomes (Figure 4 B). After adjustment for significant covariates, β‐blocker was not associated with improved 1‐year all‐cause mortality in all patients with atrial fibrillation; however, under stratification by heart rate, β‐blocker was associated with 37% reduced risk for mortality (HR: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40–0.97; P = 0.037) in patients with high heart rate but not in those with slow heart rate.

### Effect of age and sex on efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: individual patient data meta-analysis [^912f8576]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

In general, the effect of β blockers was consistent on the major secondary outcomes analysed. We did identify attenuated prevention of hospital admission by β blockers with age (P = 0.05 for first hospital admission related to heart failure and P = 0.04 for first admission related to cardiovascular event). Adjusted hazard ratios, however, remained significant across age quarters and for all outcomes, apart from two secondary outcomes (hospital admission for cardiovascular event and the composite of cardiovascular death or admission for heart failure). Reassuringly, we did not identify differences in hospital admissions related to heart failure according to age or sex, and the length of hospital stay was similar in all patients, regardless of age or sex.

Clinical context: sex

Baseline demographics show that women with heart failure entered into randomised controlled trials tend to be older than men and differences such as higher systolic blood pressure, higher left ventricular ejection fraction, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate might simply reflect this age difference. Women have a lower incidence of ischaemic aetiology and previous myocardial infarct, although a similar prevalence of heart failure compared with men. Prognosis has been shown to be better in women, though mortality rates are still 25% over three years. Previous subgroup data from randomised controlled trials have provided conflicting results about the efficacy of β blockers in women, including equal benefit (for example the MERIT-HF and CIBIS trials), enhanced mortality reduction compared with men (US Heart Failure trial), and also no effectiveness in women (BEST trial). Our results confirm that there is no difference in β blocker efficacy in HFrEF according to sex. Cause of death in women and men showed identical proportions and patterns for sudden, heart failure, and non-cardiovascular deaths, which further support the concordance for recommendation of β blockers. Thus, treatment with β blockers should not be withheld from women with HFrEF, a practice that has been reported alongside fewer cardiology assessments and cardiac procedures. Women were under-represented in the clinical trials we analysed (24%), and this continues to be the case — for example, in the recent large randomised controlled trial of angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition versus enalapril in HFrEF, women accounted for only 22% of the patients recruited. There is a clear need to improve the enrolment of women to provide realistic expectations of their risk and benefit from treatment.

### Dose of metoprolol CR / XL and clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure: analysis of the experience in metoprolol CR / XL randomized intervention trial in chronic heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^ea713cff]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Chronic Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) with the aim of reporting on the heart rate (HR) response during the titration phase and clinical outcomes from the three-month follow-up visit to end of study in two dosage subgroups: one that had reached more than 100 mg of metoprolol CR/XL once daily (high-dose group; n = 1,202; mean 192 mg) and one that had reached 100 mg or less (low-dose group; n = 412; mean 76 mg).

Background

Clinicians have questioned whether patients need to reach the target beta-blocker dose to receive benefit. METHODS; Outcome (Cox-adjusted) was compared with all placebo patients with dose available at the three-month visit (n = 1,845).

Results

Data indicated somewhat higher risk in the low-dose group compared with the high-dose group. Heart rate was reduced to a similar degree in the two dose groups, indicating higher sensitivity for beta-blockade in the low-dose group. The reduction in total mortality with metoprolol CR/XL compared with placebo was similar: 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 55) in high-dose group (p = 0.0022) and also 38% (95% CI, 11 to 57) in the low-dose group (p = 0.010).

Conclusions

Risk reduction was similar in the high- and low-dose subgroups, which, at least partly, may be the result of similar beta-blockade as judged from the HR response. The results support the idea of an individualized dose-titration regimen, which is guided by patient tolerability and the HR response. Further research is needed to shed light on why some patients respond with a marked HR reduction and reduced mortality risk on a relatively small dose of a beta-blocker.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^9fb9812e]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

### Randomized trial to determine the effect of nebivolol on mortality and cardiovascular hospital admission in elderly patients with heart failure (SENIORS) [^12e8a9e3]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Large randomized trials have shown that beta-blockers reduce mortality and hospital admissions in patients with heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers in elderly patients with a broad range of left ventricular ejection fraction are uncertain. The SENIORS study was performed to assess effects of the beta-blocker, nebivolol, in patients ≥ 70 years, regardless of ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

We randomly assigned 2128 patients aged ≥ 70 years with a history of heart failure (hospital admission for heart failure within the previous year or known ejection fraction ≤ 35%), 1067 to nebivolol (titrated from 1.25 mg once daily to 10 mg once daily), and 1061 to placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of all cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admission (time to first event). Analysis was by intention to treat. Mean duration of follow-up was 21 months. Mean age was 76 years (SD 4.7), 37% were female, mean ejection fraction was 36% (with 35% having ejection fraction > 35%), and 68% had a prior history of coronary heart disease. The mean maintenance dose of nebivolol was 7.7 mg and of placebo 8.5 mg. The primary outcome occurred in 332 patients (31.1%) on nebivolol compared with 375 (35.3%) on placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.74–0.99; P = 0.039]. There was no significant influence of age, gender, or ejection fraction on the effect of nebivolol on the primary outcome. Death (all causes) occurred in 169 (15.8%) on nebivolol and 192 (18.1%) on placebo (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.71–1.08; P = 0.21).

Conclusion

Nebivolol, a beta-blocker with vasodilating properties, is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for heart failure in the elderly.

### A computable algorithm for medication optimization in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^b586ea3b]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) optimization can improve outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to determine if a novel computable algorithm appropriately recommended GDMT.

Methods

Clinical trial data from the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence-Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) and HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trials were evaluated with a computable medication optimization algorithm that outputs GDMT recommendations and a medication optimization score (MOS). Algorithm-based recommendations were compared to medication changes. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to estimate the associations between MOS and the composite primary end point for both trials.

Results

The algorithm recommended initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in 52.8%, 34.9%, and 68.1% of GUIDE-IT visits, respectively, when not prescribed the drug. Initiation only occurred in 20.8%, 56.9%, and 15.8% of subsequent visits. The algorithm also identified dose titration in 48.8% of visits for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers and 39.4% of visits for beta-blockers. Those increases only occurred in 24.3% and 36.8% of subsequent visits. A higher baseline MOS was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21–0.80; P = 0.009) in GUIDE-IT and all-cause death and hospitalization (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44–0.84; P = 0.003) in HF-ACTION.

Conclusions

The algorithm accurately identified patients for GDMT optimization. Even in a clinical trial with robust protocols, GDMT could have been further optimized in a meaningful number of visits. The algorithm-generated MOS was associated with a lower risk of clinical outcomes. Implementation into clinical care may identify and address suboptimal GDMT in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^947c6a5b]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

### Β-blocker therapy in heart failure… [^c3bfd59a]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

with class II and III heart failure. Conclusions Tested in more than 10 000 patients, β-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, β-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. As the neurohormonal hypothesis emerged, so too did a new understanding of the potential role of β-blockers in heart failure. Although acute treatment with β-blockers decreases blood pressure and cardiac index, long-term administration of β-blockers is associated with significant increases in ejection fraction64-77. and cardiac index and a decrease in left ventricular end diastolic pressure. 61, 77–87 β-Blockers reverse the deleterious changes associated with LV remodeling and decrease myocardial mass and LV volume, leading to improved hemodynamics. Finally, β-blockers may also mediate benefit via regulating heart rate and decreasing cardiac.

have arrived at the same conclusions: the use of β-blockers was associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with heart failure. In the most recent of these meta-analyses, 92 it was estimated that 26 patients would need to be. treated to avoid 1 death; 25, to avoid 1 hospitalization. Despite differences in patient selection, target doses, methodology, and clinical end points, results were remarkably consistent across these trials. The evidence suggests that virtually all patients with heart failure caused by LV systolic dysfunction benefit from β-blockers. heart failure and an ejection fraction less than 40% were randomized to placebo or metoprolol. Metoprolol initiated at a dose of 5 mg twice daily and titrated to a high dose of 100 to 150 mg/d was associated with a 34% decrease in the combined primary end point. Although the improvement was due entirely to a.

In practical terms, however, the observed 23% reduction in mortality represents a clinically important outcome. With the emergence of strong new evidence demonstrating that β-blockers decrease morbidity and mortality in a broad range of patients with heart failure, guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, 12 the European Society of Cardiology, 11 and the Heart Failure Society of America10 all strongly support the use of β-blockers in.

### Titration of medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^fbe48392]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have medical therapy titrated to target doses derived from clinical trials, as tolerated. The degree to which titration occurs in contemporary U.S. practice is unknown.

Objectives

This study sought to characterize longitudinal titration of HFrEF medical therapy in clinical practice and to identify associated factors and reasons for medication changes.

Methods

Among 2,588 U.S. outpatients with chronic HFrEF in the CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) registry with complete medication data and no contraindications to medical therapy, use and dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) were examined at baseline and at 12-month follow-up.

Results

At baseline, 658 (25%), 525 (20%), 287 (11%), and 45 (2%) patients were receiving target doses of MRA, beta-blocker, ACEI/ARB, and ARNI therapy, respectively. At 12 months, proportions of patients with medication initiation or dose increase were 6% for MRA, 10% for beta-blocker, 7% for ACEI/ARB, and 10% for ARNI; corresponding proportions with discontinuation or dose decrease were 4%, 7%, 11%, and 3%, respectively. Over 12 months, < 1% of patients were simultaneously treated with target doses of ACEI/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, and MRA. In multivariate analysis, across the classes of medications, multiple patient characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of initiation or dose increase (e.g., previous HF hospitalization, higher blood pressure, lower ejection fraction) and discontinuation or dose decrease (e.g., previous HF hospitalization, impaired quality of life, more severe functional class). Medical reasons were the most common reasons for discontinuations and dose decreases of each therapy, but the relative contributions from patient preference, health team, and systems-based reasons varied by medication.

Conclusions

In this contemporary U.S. registry, most eligible HFrEF patients did not receive target doses of medical therapy at any point during follow-up, and few patients had doses increased over time. Although most patients had no alterations in medical therapy, multiple clinical factors were independently associated with medication changes. Further quality improvement efforts are urgently needed to improve guideline-directed medication titration for HFrEF.

### Low utilization of beta-blockers among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^5fa1b1b5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The evidence-based beta-blockers carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate reduce mortality and hospitalizations among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Use of these medications is not well described in the general population of patients with HFrEF, especially among patients with potential contraindications.

Objectives

Our goal was to describe the patterns of prescription fills for carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for HFrEF, as well as to estimate the associations between specific contraindications for beta-blocker therapy and those patterns.

Methods and Results

With the use of the cohort of 15,205 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for HFrEF from 2007 to 2013 in the 5% Medicare random sample, we described prescription fills (30 days after discharge) and dosage patterns (1 year after discharge) for beta-blockers. By means of of Fine and Gray competing risk models, we estimated the associations between potential contraindications (hypotension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], asthma, and syncope) and prescription fill and dosing patterns while adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and health care utilization. For beneficiaries who did not die or readmitted to the hospital, 38% of hospitalizations were followed by a prescription fill for an evidence-based beta-blocker within 30 days, 12% were followed by prescription fills for at least 50% of the recommended dose of an evidence-based beta-blocker within 1 year, and 9% were followed by a prescription fill for an up-titrated dose of an evidence-based beta-blocker within 1 year. The prevalence of the contraindications were 21% for hypotension, 48% for COPD, 15% for asthma, and 12% for syncope. Among beneficiaries who did not fill a prescription for an evidence-based beta-blocker within 30 days, 67% had at least 1 of these contraindications. Hypotension, COPD, and syncope were each associated with a ∼10% lower risk of filling a prescription for an evidence-based beta-blocker.

Conclusions

Prescription fill and up-titration rates for evidence-based beta-blockers are low among Medicare beneficiaries with HFrEF, but contraindications explain only a minor part of these low rates.

### Dose response of β-blockers in adrenergic receptor polymorphism genotypes [^2ad4f2a1]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background In heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, 2 clinical trials, the BEST (β-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial) and HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training), have reported an effectiveness interaction between the ADRB1 (β-1 adrenergic receptor) Arg389Gly polymorphism and β-blockers (BBs). HF-ACTION additionally reported a dose-related interaction of unclear origin. If confirmed and pharmacogenetically resolved, these findings may have important implications for HF with reduced ejection fraction precision therapy. We used uniform methodology to investigate BB dose-ADRB1 Arg389Gly polymorphism interaction with major clinical end points in BEST/bucindolol and HF-ACTION/other BB databases. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively designed DNA substudies from BEST (N = 1040) and HF-ACTION (N = 957). Subjects were genotyped for ADRB1 Arg389Gly and ADRA2C (α2C adrenergic receptor) Ins322-325Del. BB dose was defined as either no/low dose or high dose, according to total daily dose of either bucindolol (BEST subjects) or other BB (HF-ACTION subjects) standardized to carvedilol equivalents. The main outcome of interest was all-cause mortality, and CV mortality/HF hospitalization was a secondary outcome. Results Subjects in each trial had less all-cause mortality with high- versus no/low-dose BB if they had ADRB1 Arg389Arg (BEST: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.40, P = 0.002; HF-ACTION: HR = 0.45, P = 0.005) but not Arg389Gly genotype (both P > 0.2). Among gene-dose groups, there was a differential favorable treatment effect of 46% for high-dose bucindolol with ADRB1 Arg389Arg versus Gly carrier genotype (HR, 0.54; P = 0.018), but not for no/low-dose bucindolol. In contrast, HF-ACTION Arg389Arg genotype subjects taking no/low-dose BB had greater all-cause mortality compared with 389Gly carriers (HR, 1.83; P = 0.015), whereas all-cause mortality did not vary by genotype among subjects taking high-dose BB (HR, 0.84; P = 0.55). Conclusions The enhanced HF with reduced ejection fraction efficacy of bucindolol in the ADRB1 Arg389Arg versus 389Gly carrier genotypes occurs at high dose. Other BBs taken at low dose have reduced efficacy for Arg389Arg genotype subjects compared with 389Gly carriers, suggesting a greater relative treatment effect at high dose. These data support guideline recommendations to use high, clinical trial target doses of all BBs to treat HF with reduced ejection fraction.

### Association between adrenergic receptor genotypes and β-blocker dose in heart failure patients: analysis from the HF-ACTION DNA substudy [^5a852f0d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction. However, there is heterogeneity in the response to these drugs, perhaps due to genetic variations in the β1-adrenergic receptor (ADRβ1). We examined whether the Arg389Gly polymorphism in ADRβ1 interacts with the dose requirements of beta-blockers in patients with systolic HF.

Methods and Results

HF-ACTION was a randomized, multicentre trial of ambulatory HF patients with systolic dysfunction who were randomized to exercise training or usual care. A subset of patients provided DNA. The relationships among beta-blocker dose, ADRβ1–389 genotype, and outcomes were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The interaction between beta-blocker dose and the ADRβ1–389 genotype was tested. DNA information was available for 957 patients. The alleles did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Patients with the ADRβ1–389 Arg/Arg genotype receiving low-dose beta-blockers had a two-fold increase in the risk of death compared with those receiving a high dose (hazard ratio 2.09; P = 0.015); this was not conferred in Gly carriers. There was also an interaction between improvements in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score and beta-blocker dose by genotype, suggesting that higher doses of beta-blockade might be needed to achieve benefit in Arg/Arg genotype patients.

Conclusion

There was a gene-dose interaction with the ADRβ1–389 Arg/Arg vs. Gly carrier genotype and beta-blocker dose, suggesting that patients with the Arg/Arg genotype might require a higher dose of beta-blockade to achieve a treatment response similar to that of Gly carriers.

### Time to benefit of heart rate reduction with ivabradine in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^9aa55cdc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

In the SHIFT (Systolic Heart failure treatment with the I f inhibitor ivabradine Trial, ISRCTN70429960) study, ivabradine reduced cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in sinus rhythm and with a heart rate (HR) ≥ 70bpm. In this study, we sought to determine the clinical significance of the time durations of HR reduction and the significant treatment effect on outcomes among patients with HFrEF.

Methods and Results

The time to statistically significant reduction of the primary outcome (HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death) and its components, all-cause death, and HF death, were assessed in a post-hoc analysis of the SHIFT trial in the overall population (HR ≥ 70bpm) and at HR ≥ 75bpm, representing the approved label in many countries. Compared to placebo, the primary outcome and HF hospitalizations were significantly reduced at 102days, while there was no effect on cardiovascular death, all-cause death, and HF death at HR ≥ 70bpm. In the population with a baseline HR ≥ 75bpm, a reduction of the primary outcome occurred after 67days, HF hospitalization after 78days, cardiovascular death after 169days, death from HF after 157days and all-cause death after 169days.

Conclusion

Treatment with ivabradine should not be deferred in patients in sinus rhythm with a HR of ≥ 70bpm to reduce the primary outcome and HF hospitalizations, in particular in patients with HR ≥ 75bpm. At HR ≥ 75bpm, the time to risk reduction was shorter for reduction of hospitalization and mortality outcomes in patients with HFrEF after initiation of guideline-directed medication, including beta-blockers at maximally tolerated doses.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^fa685216]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

One trial (CIBIS III) was specifically designed to determine if initiation of treatment with a beta‐blocker differed meaningfully from initiation of treatment with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor. A total of 1010 patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction were randomized to bisoprolol 10 mg daily or enalapril 20 mg daily for 6 months, followed by combined therapy thereafter; the primary endpoint was all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalization. There were 65 deaths and 151 hospitalizations for any reason in the bisoprolol‐first group, and 73 deaths and 159 hospitalizations for any reason in the enalapril‐first group. Patients treated with a beta‐blocker were less likely to die suddenly, but were more likely to experience early non‐fatal worsening of heart failure early following initiation of treatment. At 1 year, mortality was approximately 30% lower in the patients who had been first started on bisoprolol (P = 0.065). The results of the trial provide direct support for the premise that a beta‐blocker can be used successfully as the first neurohormonal antagonist for the treatment of heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, a situation akin to the use of beta‐blockers before angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors in the post‐infarction setting.
