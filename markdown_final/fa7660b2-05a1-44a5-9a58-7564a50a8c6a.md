## Question

Can vitiligo occur only in the genatalia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitiligo can occur only in the genitalia, that is, as a disease limited to the genital area without affecting other parts of the body. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how vitiligo is classified and whether localized forms are recognized. Then, I should verify direct evidence for genital-limited presentations in children and adults. Next, I will examine the differential diagnosis, especially lichen sclerosus and other mimics, and consider when biopsy is needed. After that, I should review management implications for truly genital-limited vitiligo. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded conclusion and outline follow-up and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework. Vitiligo is an acquired autoimmune depigmentation disorder with well-recognized localized and segmental variants, and it can affect any body site, including mucosal and genital skin, so anatomically a genital-only presentation is plausible if the autoimmune process localizes there [^112NCNGm] [^117WrJW9].

> Wait, let me verify direct evidence for genital-limited disease. A pediatric series explicitly described eight children with vitiligo beginning in the genital area, with contiguous involvement of inner thighs, buttocks, or scrotum in males. Notably, only one female had a solitary lesion elsewhere on the chest, supporting that most cases were genital-limited at onset, and the authors framed some of these as segmental disease limited to the genitalia, particularly in females [^114XRsgy]. I should also note that case reports document stable, localized genital vitiligo treated with autologous melanocyte transplantation, again consistent with localized genital disease in adults [^114u4MGP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the differential and potential pitfalls. Lichen sclerosus, including vitiligoid variants, can mimic vitiligo on the vulva or penis and may be pruritic, symptomatic, or architecturally altering; importantly, several series emphasize that depigmented vulvar lesions in patients with skin of color may be misdiagnosed as vitiligo when they are actually lichen sclerosus, so biopsy is warranted when symptoms, fissures, atrophy, or treatment resistance appear [^114Kqifm] [^111Dr6er] [^112UTefv]. But wait, what if I'm overcalling lichen sclerosus? Reflectance confocal microscopy can help distinguish genital lichen sclerosus from vitiligo in vivo and reduce unnecessary biopsies, though histopathology remains the gold standard when the diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms suggest inflammation or scarring [^117SLiiX] [^111zKMoH].

> I should double-check other mimics that can present as isolated genital hypopigmentation. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation, tinea versicolor, pityriasis versicolor, and even extramammary Paget disease can masquerade as vitiligo on the vulva or penis. In older adults with persistent or atypical hypopigmented vulvar plaques, a high index of suspicion for Paget disease and early biopsy is prudent to avoid delays in oncologic care [^116zcMQ2] [^113zE5No] [^113iqhi7].

> Next, I should review management implications if genital-limited vitiligo is confirmed. Guidelines endorse intermittent potent or very potent topical corticosteroids, often alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors for thin skin areas such as the genitalia, with careful counseling on safe use and monitoring for atrophy; for stable, refractory lesions, autologous melanocyte-keratinocyte transplantation has case-level evidence of success in genital vitiligo [^114hf543] [^113oo188] [^114u4MGP]. I need to ensure follow-up includes periodic reassessment and photography to track response or progression, as recommended by BAD guidance [^1141BsYG] [^113wYw9e].

> Let me consider prognosis and counseling. Even when disease appears genital-limited at onset, I should counsel that localized vitiligo may rarely evolve into more widespread nonsegmental disease over time, whereas segmental forms tend to stabilize. Pediatric series and longitudinal observations of localized vitiligo support this heterogeneity and the need for periodic skin examinations [^113Gx8e2] [^114XRsgy]. I should also screen for autoimmune comorbidities and discuss psychosexual impacts, as genital involvement can carry meaningful quality-of-life burden even when limited in surface area [^116ypkw5] [^113JS9L3].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Yes, vitiligo can occur only in the genitalia, documented both in children and adults as genital-limited or segmental disease, but I need to ensure careful clinical differentiation from lichen sclerosus and other mimics, and consider biopsy when symptoms, architectural change, or treatment resistance emerge. Management follows guideline-based topical regimens tailored to thin genital skin, with procedural options for stable, refractory lesions and structured follow-up to detect evolution or misdiagnosis [^114XRsgy] [^114u4MGP] [^114hf543] [^117SLiiX].

---

Vitiligo can present as **genital-only depigmentation** (genital-limited vitiligo), though this is uncommon and often misdiagnosed as lichen sclerosus or other hypopigmented disorders [^114XRsgy] [^112UTefv]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by Wood's lamp, and **biopsy is reserved for atypical or symptomatic cases** to exclude mimics such as lichen sclerosus, vitiligoid lichen sclerosus, post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, or neoplastic conditions like extramammary Paget disease [^116zcMQ2] [^117SLiiX]. Management is with gentle topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors, with close follow-up to monitor for progression or alternative diagnoses [^114hf543] [^1141BsYG].

---

## Clinical features of genital-only vitiligo

Genital-only vitiligo presents with **sharply demarcated, depigmented macules or patches** on the vulva, penis, scrotum, or perianal skin, typically asymptomatic and nonscarring, without pruritus, pain, or architectural change. Wood's lamp accentuates the contrast, aiding diagnosis [^1112D4Nk].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with Wood's lamp enhancing lesion visibility and supporting depigmentation [^117WrJW9]. Biopsy is not routine but should be considered when features are atypical, symptomatic, or refractory to therapy to exclude mimics such as lichen sclerosus or neoplasia [^111Dr6er].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Several conditions can mimic genital vitiligo, necessitating **careful differentiation**:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Differentiating features** |
|-|-|-|
| Lichen sclerosus | - White, atrophic plaques <br/> - Pruritus <br/> - Dyspareunia <br/> - Architectural change | - Histology: dermal sclerosis <br/> - Interface dermatitis [^116z9deb] |
| Vitiligoid lichen sclerosus | - Depigmentation with minimal inflammation <br/> - Histology: lichen sclerosus | - Histology: lichen sclerosus with depigmentation [^111Dr6er] |
| Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation | - Hypopigmentation after inflammation <br/> - Often transient | - History of inflammation <br/> - Partial pigment loss [^116YavuJ] |
| Extramammary Paget disease | - Chronic, eczematous, hypopigmented plaque <br/> - May itch or burn | - Histology: Paget cells <br/> - CK7 positive [^116zcMQ2] |

---

## Prevalence and epidemiology

Genital-only vitiligo is **rare**, with limited epidemiologic data; pediatric series suggest it is uncommon and may be underreported due to embarrassment and delayed care [^114Wuufh] [^117XGwT2]. Adult prevalence is unknown but likely low.

---

## Pathogenesis

Vitiligo reflects **autoimmune destruction of melanocytes**, with contributions from genetic susceptibility, oxidative stress, and innate/adaptive immune activation; localized genital disease likely shares these mechanisms, potentially triggered locally by friction, trauma, or inflammation [^114djova] [^114rkSAU].

---

## Psychological and quality-of-life impact

Genital vitiligo can cause **significant psychosexual distress**, anxiety, and reduced self-esteem, with sexual dysfunction reported in a substantial subset; addressing these impacts is essential to care [^113JS9L3] [^114THhiS].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment aims to stabilize disease and restore pigment; options include:

- **Topical corticosteroids**: first-line for localized genital vitiligo; use intermittent regimens to minimize atrophy [^114hf543].
- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: tacrolimus or pimecrolimus as steroid-sparing agents, especially for sensitive genital skin [^114hf543].
- **Phototherapy**: narrowband UVB may be considered for refractory or extensive cases, though genital skin requires caution [^11675B7N].
- **Surgical options**: autologous melanocyte transplantation for stable, refractory lesions [^114u4MGP].

---

## Prognosis

Course is **unpredictable**; some lesions remain stable, while others progress or generalize. Regular follow-up is important to monitor for progression or alternative diagnoses [^114onEu7].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be educated about the benign nature of vitiligo, potential triggers, and the importance of adherence to therapy. Counseling on sexual health, body image, and coping strategies is essential to mitigate psychosocial burden [^117U9y5a] [^117Mn2m7].

---

Vitiligo can present as **genital-only depigmentation**, though uncommon; accurate diagnosis relies on clinical features and selective biopsy, and management is with topical therapies and supportive care, with attention to psychosexual impact.

### Psychosocial effects of vitiligo: a systematic literature review [^114AKLj9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the past decade, interest in and publication of the overall and psychosocial QoL of patients with vitiligo have increased tremendously, highlighting the QoL burden in vitiligo. Several recent studies have reported meta-analyses of depression and/or anxiety in patients with vitiligo, with less focus on other psychosocial comorbidities experienced by patients with vitiligo. We sought to comprehensively review the prevalence of any psychosocial comorbidity reported by patients in peer-reviewed scientific articles.

Studies in this systematic review reported wide ranges (likely owing to differing assessment tools and geographically heterogeneous populations) for the majority of psychosocial comorbidities. Psychosocial comorbidities reported in > 50% of patients in any study were depression, major depressive disorder, anxiety, social phobia, feelings of stigmatization, adjustment disorders, sleep disturbances, avoidance and restriction behavior, self-consciousness, emotional impairment, relationship difficulties, and cognitive impairment. Psychosocial comorbidities reported in > 25% of patients included coexistent depression and anxiety, sexual dysfunction, alexithymia, anger, suicidality (unspecified suicidality and suicidal ideation), and dysthymic disorders. The breadth and severity of these comorbidities and the resulting effect on QoL in patients with vitiligo extend beyond what has previously been dismissed as a cosmetic disease.

### Immunopathogenesis of vitiligo [^1167bUUL]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a common depigmenting disorder which may have devastating psychological and social consequences and is characterized by the presence of circumscribed white macules in the skin due to the destruction of melanocytes in the epidermis. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathomechanisms involved in this disease, and studies have shown the participation of autoimmune processes in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Cellular and humoral immunities have been implicated in the development of vitiligo and their role continues to be investigated. Peripheral blood and skin biopsies of patients with vitiligo show that T-cells, mononuclear cells, various pro-inflammatory cytokines, and auto-antibodies can damage melanocytes. Further research is required to determine whether autoimmunity is the main mechanism of vitiligo or only a consequence.

### Vulvar pityriasis versicolor in an immunocompetent woman [^113iqhi7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of isolated vulvar pityriasis versicolor in a 24-year-old healthy woman.

Materials and Methods

A 24-year-old woman presented with variable color change on the vulva of 8 months in duration.

Results

Areas of tan and white skin were observed on the mons pubis. The pubic hair had been shaved. Initially, the paler areas were deemed abnormal suggesting vitiligo, but the biopsy showed normal skin including normal numbers of melanocytes. Subsequently, biopsy of the tan area showed pityriasis versicolor. She was successfully treated with topical 2% ketoconazole, with gradual fading of lesions.

Conclusions

With increased body awareness and the current popularity of pubic hair removal, young women may consult clinicians about color changes on the vulva. Clinicians should be aware that vulvar pityriasis versicolor may occur in healthy women with no other skin involvement.

### Unusual lesion on the vulva of a postmenopausal woman [^116zcMQ2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Focal vitiligo – Incorrect. Although vitiligo can present as an isolated itchy, hypopigmented patch at its initial inflammatory phase, the histopathologic features exclude the diagnosis of vitiligo.
B. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation – Incorrect. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation is an important differential diagnosis in this case, as the patient was undergoing vaginal laser rejuvenation at the time of presentation. However, given the age of the patient, the symptomatic nature of the lesion, and the unclear history of the preceding inflammatory dermatoses, a skin punch biopsy was considered.
C. EMPD – Correct. The skin biopsy finding in Fig 2 is consistent with EMPD, showing characteristic large round atypical intraepithelial cells with abundant pale cytoplasm (Paget cells) arranged singly or in clusters with dermal invasion. Pigmentary skin changes, such as hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, may be seen in association with a classic slowly expanding eczematous plaque of EMPD. However, EMPD masquerading as a subtle hypopigmented patch is highly uncommon. Interestingly, our patient was found to have invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast during staging workup. The patient underwent wide local excision of the EMPD lesion with a transposition flap closure. However, as the excision margins were infiltrated by tumor cells, the patient subsequently received radiation therapy. This case highlights that an isolated hypopigmented patch on the genital skin in an elderly patient can be an early sign of EMPD, and the consideration of an early diagnostic biopsy can avoid a poor outcome. Depigmented EMPD has been previously reported in few case reports and one case series from Japan and Taiwan.
D. Dermatomycosis – Incorrect. Dermatomycosis usually present as an annular scaly plaque. The histopathologic features observed in this case do not support the diagnosis of dermatomycosis.
E. Early lichen sclerosus – Incorrect. An early stage of lichen sclerosus may present as a single ivory white sclerotic plaque; however, typical sites are the inter-labial sulcus and labium minus.

### Reflectance confocal microscopy for identification of vulvar lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and vitiligo [^117SLiiX]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) is a chronic inflammatory disease. The clinical presentation is clustered distribution of porcelain white spots that can be fused together. Early diagnosis of LSA is difficult, especially in the vulva, where it is difficult to distinguish from vitiligo. Traditional diagnostic methods mainly rely on histopathology. In this study, we used reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) to study the characteristics of LSA and vitiligo. We investigated the clinical and confocal features of 40 cases of histopathologically proven genital LSA or vitiligo, and correlated the features with histopathologic findings. Through the analysis of the results, by RCM, we can easily distinguish genital LSA from vitiligo, which are clinically indistinguishable. This can reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, and help with early diagnosis and timely treatment.

### Basal cell carcinoma masquerading as vitiligo in a young woman [^113QMMPS]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition that presents with irregular patches of depigmentation commonly affecting individuals in their first few decades of life. In contrast, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) typically presents as a pink, pearly papule with telangiectasias and rarely affects younger individuals. This case emphasizes the importance of histologic evaluation in a patient with clinically diagnosed vitiligo refractory to treatment and raises suspicion when a patient with seemingly few risk factors for skin malignancy is evaluated.

### The genetics of generalized vitiligo and associated autoimmune diseases [^116dB8mg]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2006). Low credibility.

Generalized vitiligo is an acquired disorder in which patches of depigmented skin, overlying hair, and oral mucosa result from progressive autoimmune loss of melanocytes from the involved areas. Although vitiligo is perhaps the most common pigmentary disorder, insufficiently clear clinical definition of the disorder and lack of a good laboratory animal model have inhibited progress in understanding its pathobiology, its environmental triggers, and in developing specific and effective therapeutic approaches. Vitiligo results from a complex interaction of environmental, genetic, and immunologic factors, which ultimately contribute to melanocyte destruction, resulting in the characteristic depigmented lesions. In the past few years, studies of the genetic epidemiology of generalized vitiligo have led to the recognition that vitiligo is part of a broader, genetically-determined, autoimmune/autoinflammatory diathesis. Attempts to identify genes involved in vitiligo susceptibility have involved both allelic association studies of candidate genes and genome-wide linkage analyses to discover new genes, and these studies have begun to shed light on the mechanisms of vitiligo pathogenesis. It is anticipated that the discovery of biological pathways of vitiligo pathogenesis will provide novel therapeutic and prophylactic targets for future approaches to the treatment and prevention of vitiligo and its associated autoimmune diseases.

### Do we have to pay more attention to vitiligo patients? Peculiar histopathological features of primary cutaneous melanoma preceded by vitiligo [^112RX7XD]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired depigmenting skin disease characterized by the loss of functioning epidermal melanocytes. Vitiligo can be associated with an autoimmune disorder. An unusual and important aspect of vitiligo is its relationship to melanoma. We present herein a 34-year-old man who developed regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanoma 2 years after the diagnosis of vitiligo.

### Recurrent hypopigmented macules and papules in a young male: an extragenital presentation of guttate lichen sclerosus [^115CpBrk]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Correct answer: B. GLS – Homogenous structureless white to pink areas with irregular linear vessels and comedone-like openings.

GLS is an uncommon extragenital variant of lichen sclerosus (LS) presenting as small, scattered, drop-like atrophic or shiny white macules and papules. While LS frequently involves the genital region, ∼15% to 20% of cases are extragenital. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by histopathology revealing lichenoid interface dermatitis, dermal collagen homogenization, and epidermal changes, including hyperkeratosis, loss of rete ridges, and follicular plugging. Dermoscopy may aid diagnosis, revealing patchy yellow-white to white-pink structureless areas, linear or dotted vessels, comedone-like openings, and white chrysalis-like structures with surrounding erythema. Irregular linear vessels have been reported in "early" lesions.

GLS can be differentiated from other lichenoid or sclerotic dermatoses clinically, histologically, and with dermoscopy. Inflammatory vitiligo, which may be guttate, lacks the lichenoid infiltrate and collagen changes seen in LS. Histology shows epidermal melanocyte loss, while dermoscopy reveals depigmented macules with perifollicular pigmententation and marginal erythema. Atrophic lichen planus may mimic LS clinically with a lichenoid interface dermatitis histologically. However, it lacks dermal collagen changes and exhibits wickham striae under dermoscopy. Guttate morphea may resemble GLS clinically but is distinguishable dermoscopically by white fibrotic beams. Histology reveals deeper dermal sclerosis without the lichenoid band and follicular plugging seen in LS. Malignant atrophic papulosis can resemble GLS but is a thrombo-obliterative vasculopathy with histological wedge-shape pallor in the deep dermis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the reticular dermis, and vasculopathic features such as fibrin and thrombi. Dermoscopy reveals a central porcelain-white area with surrounding telangiectasias.

Dermoscopy, alongside histology, is useful in evaluating patients with atrophic papules and macules and identifying cases of GLS. Given the genital predilection of LS, genital exam should also be considered for patients with GLS to support early diagnosis and prevent functional complications. This case highlights an uncommon extragenital LS presentation in a young male without genital involvement, underscoring the importance of recognizing GLS as a distinct variant and including it in the differential for hypopigmented macules and papules.

### Vitiligo [^112NCNGm]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Vitiligo, an acquired pigmentary disorder of unknown origin, is the most frequent cause of depigmentation worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 1%. The disorder can be psychologically devastating and stigmatising, especially in dark skinned individuals. Vitiligo is clinically characterised by the development of white macules due to the loss of functioning melanocytes in the skin or hair, or both. Two forms of the disease are well recognised: segmental and non-segmental vitiligo (the commonest form). To distinguish between these two forms is of prime importance because therapeutic options and prognosis are quite different. The importance of early treatment and understanding of the profound psychosocial effect of vitiligo will be emphasised throughout this Seminar.

### British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for the management of people with vitiligo 2021 [^11675B7N]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for vitiligo, more specifically with respect to UV phototherapy, BAD 2022 guidelines recommend to inform patients with vitiligo eligible for NB-UVB phototherapy of the requirements (depending on local protocols: a pretherapy assessment, medical photographs taken prior to and during follow-up visits at 3–6 months, 2–3 sessions weekly possibly for up to 1 year), and the likely response depending on the affected anatomical site (for example, the face and trunk usually achieve better repigmentation than acral sites).

### A practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of vitiligo in children [^11278xX9]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a common inflammatory skin disease with a worldwide prevalence of 0.5% to 2.0% of the population. In the pediatric population, the exact prevalence of vitiligo is unknown, although many studies state that most cases of vitiligo are acquired early in life. The disease is disfiguring, with a major psychological impact on children and their parents. Half of vitiligo cases have a childhood onset, needing thus a treatment approach that will minimize treatment side effects while avoiding psychological impacts. Management of vitiligo should take into account several factors, including extension, psychological impact, and possible associations with other autoimmune diseases. This review discusses the epidemiology of vitiligo and outlines the various clinical presentations associated with the disorder and their differential diagnosis. In addition, the pathophysiology and genetic determinants, the psychological impact of vitiligo, and management strategies are reviewed.

### Psychosocial effects of vitiligo: a systematic literature review [^114S7z1g]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Factors Associated with Psychosocial Burden

Factors that were significantly associated with higher psychosocial (Fig. 3) or overall QoL burden were female sex (30 studies), lesion location in visible areas (e.g. face, hands [17 studies]) or genitals (eight studies), younger age (16 studies; particularly those aged < 30 years and more so in adolescents), and extensive body area involvement (13 studies). Unmarried and/or single relationship status (nine studies), longer disease duration (nine studies; particularly duration > 5 years), progressive disease (seven studies), Fitzpatrick skin phototype IV–VI (five studies), lower education status (five studies; particularly high school or lower level of education), non-segmental vitiligo (three studies; vs segmental or focal vitiligo), non-Caucasian race (three studies), positive family history of vitiligo (two studies), being employed (one study; compared with being students, unemployed, or retired), and higher socioeconomic level (one study) were also significantly associated with increased burden. Four studies reported that comorbid depression significantly reduced overall QoL. Management strategies including camouflage, cognitive behavioral therapy, phototherapy, and depigmentation cream (in patients with extensive vitiligo) were associated with decreased vitiligo-associated burden.

Coping Strategies Among Patients with Vitiligo

The most commonly discussed coping strategies in studies included the use of concealing clothing (six studies, 8.3–78.3% of patients), camouflage (four studies, 14.6–62.0% of patients), and altered body movements (three studies, 5.9–8.1% of patients). Other coping strategies included vitiligo acceptance, avoidance behavior, and psychotherapy or support groups.

### Presentations, signs of activity, and differential diagnosis of vitiligo [^116SqBws]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

Vitiligo has a variety of presentations, including focal, acrofacial, segmental, and generalized forms. Thorough knowledge of these presentations is important to make the correct diagnosis. Signs of activity are important to recognize so that treatment is optimized. Clinical findings of confettilike depigmentation, trichrome and inflammatory vitiligo, and the Koebner phenomenon should alert the clinician that a patient's disease is likely to worsen. These patients may require systemic treatment to stabilize their disease. Many other skin disorders present with hypopigmentation or depigmentation and must be distinguished to determine the right diagnosis, advise the patient on prognosis, and prescribe the correct treatment.

### Genital vitiligo treated by autologous, noncultured melanocyte-keratinocyte cell transplantation [^114u4MGP]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Genital vitiligo is common and has a deleterious effect on the psychosexual function of patients. It is well known that glabrous skin (non-hair-bearing skin such as below the ankles, genitalia, lips, distal ends of fingers) rarely responds to the therapy unless it has some residual pigment.

Objective

The objective was to report genital vitiligo treated successfully by autologous, noncultured, melanocyte-keratinocyte cell transplantation.

Methods

Three cases of clinically stable genital vitiligo were treated by autologous, noncultured melanocyte-keratinocyte cell transplantation.

Results

All lesions treated repigmented almost completely. All patients were very satisfied with the excellent cosmetic results.

Conclusion

Autologous, noncultured melanocyte-keratinocyte cell transplantation may be an effective surgical treatment for management of genital vitiligo.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^111zKMoH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of LS is usually clinical. When the clinical features are typical, histologic examination is not always essential. However, in the early stages of the disease the diagnosis can be difficult. The main differential diagnoses are lichen planus (LP), lichen simplex chronicus, vitiligo, immunobullous disorders such as mucous membrane pemphigoid and vulvar or penile intraepithelial neoplasia. In clinically inconclusive cases, a histologic examination is advisable and might close the gap, but should never be interpreted in isolation. One-third of men having sufficient symptoms and signs to be clinically diagnosed with LS, showed only nonspecific histology on biopsy or in the circumcised prepuce. A nonspecific biopsy does not rule out LS, but classic histologic findings confirm the diagnosis. Patients under routine follow-up will need a biopsy if: (1) there is a suspicion of neoplastic change, i.e. a persistent area of hyperkeratosis, persistent erosion, or erythema, or new warty or papular lesions; (2) there is an area resistant to adequate treatment; (3) there is extragenital LS, with features suggesting an overlap with morphea; (4) there are pigmented areas, in order to exclude an abnormal melanocytic proliferation; and (5) second-line therapy is to be used.

There are instances when it can be impossible to differentiate between LS and LP either on the basis of the clinical or the histologic features (Table 1). These cases are described as overlap syndrome and often show poor response to treatment.

Distinguishing features between lichen sclerosus and lichen planus

Clinical Features

Female Anogenital Lichen Sclerosus (LS): Adults

Meyrick Thomas et al. studied 350 women with clinically typical and histologically confirmed LS. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 45.5 years. In 9% of women the onset of LS was in prepuberty, in 41% in the reproductive years, and in 50% postmenopause. Cooper et al. studied a total of 253 women and 74 girls with the typical clinical features of vulvar LS. Twenty-three percent of the patients were premenarchal, 17% in their reproductive years, and 60% postmenopausal. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 5.4 years for girls and 55.1 years for women. The mean age at diagnosis was 7.6 years for girls and 60 years for women.

### Defining D-irAEs: consensus-based disease definitions for the diagnosis of dermatologic adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^1112D4Nk]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

ICI-vitiligo

Vitiligo or vitiligo-like depigmentation is a specific D-irAE that is typically seen in the setting of melanoma therapy, although can occur less commonly with other tumor types. The diagnosis most commonly presents as sharply demarcated white (depigmented) macules or patches, which may appear pink after sun exposure, while the surrounding skin is typically normal or shows evidence of sun damage. Depigmentation may also occur at sites of prior inflammatory dermatoses. If the affected area is hair-bearing, the hair may turn white. A Wood's lamp examination may be helpful to distinguish depigmentation from hypopigmentation as the latter is not as pronounced under illumination(online supplemental table S5).

Common diagnostic evaluation for ICI-vitiligo includes a FSE by a BCD or non-BCD and may include biopsies in cases without classic features or where there is morphologic overlap with other specific D-irAEs. If biopsies are obtained, although they are not required, they should be taken from the interface of pigmented and depigmented skin with notification of the pathologist to ensure the melanocytes are specifically confirmed to be absent. There are no labs that will rule in a diagnosis of ICI-vitiligo.

Consensus by expert panel adjudication was reached for the supportive examination findings (median: 9, range 6–9), labs/imaging (median: 8, range 3–9), diagnostic criteria accuracy (median: 9, range 5–9), and usability (median: 9, range 4–9) (online supplemental table S6).

### Genital vitiligo in children: factors associated with generalized, non-segmental vitiligo [^114XRsgy]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

It remains uncertain as to whether genital vitiligo of childhood is segmental or a forme fruste of non-segmental disease. This type of vitiligo is sometimes termed figure-of-eight disease due to female predominance and perineal and perianal hypopigmentation or depigmentation around two orifices, the anal and vaginal introitus. The objective of this series was to categorize the features of genital-limited vitiligo of childhood including comorbidities, family history, and long-term course.

Methods

IRB-approved retrospective chart review of vitiligo cases.

Results

Eight cases of vitiligo that began in childhood in the genital area were identified, including clinical course and comorbidities. Involvement of the contiguous skin, including inner thighs, buttocks, and scrotum, was noted in all males. In females, only 1 patient had other sites of vitiligo, which was a solitary lesion on the chest. Therapeutic response to topical corticosteroids for perianal skin was seen in five of six children and topical calcineurin inhibitors with or without calcipotriene in four out of four patients.

Conclusions

Segmental disease limited to the genitalia was more common in females than males, suggesting that perhaps intervention and work-up for comorbid autoimmune diseases may be required for males with genital-limited vitiligo at onset, but may be deferred in females and added if observation of spread is noted. Differentiation from lichen sclerosus et atrophicus may require biopsy.

### Enhancing awareness of vitiligoid vulvar lichen sclerosus: an underrecognized variant in patients with skin of color [^1163sMmv]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentations

Case 1

A 73-year-old Black woman presented to an outside dermatology clinic with depigmentation and pruritus of the vulva. She had initially been diagnosed with vitiligo and treated with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment. Without significant improvement over time, a 4-mm punch biopsy was performed showing papillary dermal sclerosis, perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate involving the reticular dermis leading to a diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. The diagnosis was revised from vitiligo to VVLS. She was initiated on clobetasol 0.05% ointment with improvement, but not resolution, of her pruritus. Her care was transitioned to our vulvar dermatology clinic, and she was noted to have depigmented patches and erythema involving the labia majora, clitoral hood, perineum, and anus with fissures at the clitoral hood in addition to some mild hyperkeratosis at the buttocks (Fig 1). Additionally, she was found to have partial agglutination of the labia and partial clitoral phimosis. She was initiated on halobetasol 0.05% ointment with resolution of the pruritus and improvement of pigmentary changes.

### Dermatologic therapy of chronic genital disease [^115Y2iEs]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

The adaptation of dermatology for the genital area requires several modifications of standard therapy. This unique area produces issues of both psychological sensitivity and unique environmental factors of constant moisture, warmth, and friction. These issues become far more important when symptoms are chronic. Recognition of normal variants, the multifactorial nature of many genital symptoms, and the avoidance of creating secondary iatrogenic disease are all important.

### Effectiveness of topical nigella sativa for vitiligo treatment [^112f6fEq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitiligo is a pigment disease characterized by the disruption of melanocyte structure and function. Its etiology is unknown; however, genetic predisposition, biochemical factors, and neural mechanisms are thought to be effective. Although many agents are being used for its treatment, generally there is no absolute cure. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of topical Nigella sativa seed oil on vitiligo patients. Thirty-three vitiligo patients were included in the study. Totally 47 areas were evaluated in all patients. Cream containing N sativa seed oil was topically applied to hands, face, and genital region two times a day for 6months. Statistically significant repigmentation was detected in hands, face, and genital region, the three treatment areas, and the p values are found .005, .001, and .004, respectively. N sativa can be used as an adjuvant therapy that can contribute to the treatment especially in sensitive skin areas like genital region.

### Genital lichen sclerosus Et atrophicus: a benign skin disorder with malignant aftermath [^112QsUAo]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Genital lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) is an uncommon genital dermatosis. Its resemblance to vitiligo, especially during the earlier stages, leads to delay in its diagnosis. Apart from the common complications such as meatal stenosis, balanoposthitis, phimosis, and painful erections, squamous cell carcinoma is a rare but ominous complication of genital LSA. Herein, we present a case of long-standing penile LSA complicated by squamous cell carcinoma, stressing upon the requirement of early diagnosis and management of LSA.

### Vitiligo as a systemic disease [^113t8v9Y]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired depigmentary skin disorder of unknown etiology. Vitiligo is not only a disease of melanocytes of the skin. Human melanocytes are derived from the neural crest and are located on various parts of the body. The involvement of skin melanocytes is the most visible one, but a systemic involvement of melanocytes can be observed. Some types of vitiligo (nonsegmental vitiligo) may also be associated with various diseases, mainly with autoimmune pathogenesis. Vitiligo represents a spectrum of many different disorders with different etiologies and pathogeneses, causing a common phenotype: the loss of melanocytes and/or their products. This phenotype is always consistent with a systemic involvement.

### Depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with vitiligo [^114z22GW]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Only a limited number of studies have studied the relationship between vitiligo and psychiatric morbidity and quality of life (QOL) in children and adolescents.

Aim

To determine levels of depression, anxiety and QOL in children and adolescents with vitiligo.

Methods

In total, 41 outpatients with vitiligo aged 8–18 years and a control group were assessed using the Child Depression Inventory (CDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventories for Children (STAI-C) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Parent and Child versions (PedsQL-P and PedsQL-C). Both study and control groups were divided into child (8–12 years old) and adolescent (13–18 years old) groups to exclude the effect of puberty on psychological condition.

Results

Children with vitiligo scored higher on the CDI compared with controls; no other significant differences were found between the groups. Vitiligo severity correlated negatively with psychosocial score on PedsQL-P in the adolescent group. Duration of the illness was positively related to physical health score on PedsQL-P in the child group. Involvement of the face, head or neck in boys and involvement of the genital area and legs in girls were related to impaired QOL.

Conclusions

Vitiligo relates to the severity of depression in children, but a similar effect was not observed in adolescents. We suggest that the location of the lesions is a significant factor that leads to QOL impairment, possibly because of its effects on identity development.

### Classification of vitiligo: a challenging endeavor [^114PpK3t]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The classification of vitiligo is mandatory for clinical and research purposes. Although the etiology and pathobiology of vitiligo remain unknown, a working classification of vitiligo is imperative for the scientific community to communicate. The authors delineate herein their efforts for vitiligo classification utilizing clinical, genetic, pathobiological, epidemiological, and molecular characteristics of vitiligo. These different classification approaches may aid clinicians to identify the most suitable treatment for each individual vitiligo subject.

### Vitiligo: a review of the published work [^114kqrLH]. The Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a common depigmenting skin disorder, characterized by acquired, idiopathic, progressive, circumscribed hypomelanosis of the skin and hair, with total absence of melanocytes microscopically. It occurs worldwide, with an incidence rate of between 0.1% and 2%. Vitiligo is an important skin disease having a major impact on the quality of life of the patient suffering from it. The causes of this condition are uncertain but seem to be dependent on the interaction of genetic, immunological and neurological factors. Vitiligo coexists with other autoimmune disorders, Sutton or halo nevus, and malignant melanoma. The substantial disfigurement associated with vitiligo can cause serious emotional stress for the patient, which necessitates treatment. Because its pathogenesis is still not understood, there is a plethora of different treatments. Among them, topical steroids and narrowband ultraviolet B monotherapy were the most common as current treatments for localized and generalized vitiligo, respectively. Cosmetic improvement can be achieved by camouflage products and self-tanning dyes. The course of vitiligo is unpredictable, but often progressive. Spontaneous repigmentation may occur in a few people (10–20%), mainly in children, but this tends to be only partial and on sun-exposed areas. In this article, we review vitiligo as a whole, including epidemiology, pathogenesis and etiology, histopathology, clinical manifestations, classification, clinical variants, diagnosis and differential diagnoses, specific investigation, treatment, prognosis, psychosocial view and its association with other disorders.

### Vitiligo following COVID-19: a case report and review of pathophysiology [^1128XuaP]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitiligo is a depigmentation disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population of the United States and Europe, with a peak age of onset earlier in females compared to males. It presents in females typically in the first decade of life, while males tend to present in the fifth decade of life. It is characterized by a patchy distribution of depigmented macules and is subclassified by location and distribution of affected skin. Vitiligo is hypothesized to be autoimmune in nature, provoked by an environmental or biologic trigger that results in destruction of melanocytes. Vitiligo is associated with other autoimmune disorders and has been reported to develop following the onset of viral illnesses, such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and cytomegalovirus.SARS-CoV-2 infection has been linked to a rise in autoimmunity, with many patients reporting novel postviral autoimmune conditions. In this report, we present a patient with no history of autoimmune disease, who developed vitiligo after contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Evaluation of the dermatological life quality index, sexual dysfunction and other psychiatric diseases in patients diagnosed with vitiligo with and without genital involvement [^117VFfAp]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Because skin lesions affect self-image, vitiligo affects an individual's emotional and psychological well-being, sexual life and relationships with other people. The literature contains a limited number of studies regarding the localization of vitiligo with respect to its effect on certain variables.

Aim

To investigate the effects of the presence or absence of genital involvement in vitiligo on sexual dysfunction, dermatological quality of life (QoL), and susceptibility to other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression.

Methods

In total, 90 patients who were admitted to the dermatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary university hospital; the patients included 30 patients with vitiligo with genital involvement, 30 patients with vitiligo without genital involvement and 30 controls (HCs). All groups were evaluated with the Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) and Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS).

Results

The HC groups exhibited lower total scores on the DLQI, HAD total score, ASEX and GRISS compared with the vitiligo groups (P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between the vitiligo group with genital involvement and the vitiligo group without genital involvement in terms of DLQI, and total scores for HAD, ASEX and GRISS (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

The presence or absence of genital involvement in vitiligo did not have dissimilar effects on the individual's QoL, or their sexual and psychological state.

### Risk factors for genital lichen sclerosus in men [^116XRaG5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory disease of the skin and mucous membranes. Its aetiology is still unknown.

Objectives

To determine risk factors for genital LS in men.

Methods

In a case-control study, 73 patients with LS, consecutively diagnosed at the City Dispensary for Skin and Venereal Diseases in Belgrade, were compared with 219 male patients visiting the same institution because of tinea cruris. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used for analysis of data collected.

Results

According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, risk factors for male LS were as follows: a personal history of genital injury [odds ratio (OR) 28.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2–150.8], vitiligo (OR 23.1, 95% CI 2.2–240.2), alopecia areata (OR 8.8, 95% CI 1.1–68.5) and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1–8.2), and a family history of alopecia areata (OR 24.3, 95% CI 2.1–280.7), diseases of the thyroid gland (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.3–36.2) and other autoimmune diseases (OR 8.6, 95% CI 1.3–58.6).

Conclusions

The results of the present study are in line with the hypothesis that trauma of the penis is a possible trigger of symptoms in genetically predisposed individuals and that personal and family histories of autoimmune disorders are risk factors for male LS.

### Prurigo nodularis in vitiligo patches: an unusual observation [^114w6kwg]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 82-year-old man with a history of alopecia totalis, vitiligo, and PN has been a patient at our department for the last 10 years. He has no other medical conditions or psychiatric history. Alopecia totalis developed in our patient when he was approximately 40 years of age.

At an unspecified interval after this development, generalized vitiligo affecting the face, abdomen, and extremities developed. Several years after the onset of vitiligo, pruritus developed. It was then that the patient presented to our department. PN diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Routine laboratory workup and radiologic examinations including a chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasound scan found no secondary cause of his pruritus.

The patient had severe pruritus. Throughout the course of the condition, he had received various treatments for PN, initially topical steroids, then tacrolimus and phototherapy, and finally oral methotrexate with varying doses. He was not interested in treating his vitiligo or alopecia. He is currently being treated with methotrexate, 15 mg weekly, with an unsatisfactory effect on his pruritus. Currently, he is not using any topical therapy, emollients, or sun protection.

It was not until the most recent clinic visit that it was noticed that all PN nodules occurred in vitiliginous patches (Fig 1). His vitiligo has followed a stable course throughout the years. He has no facial or genital PN but does have vitiligo at these sites. He has no pruritus or PN on nonvitiliginous skin.

### Vitiligo and melanoma-associated vitiligo: understanding their similarities and differences [^1179hNf4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been a significant increase in the number and efficacy of therapies for advanced melanoma. Immunotherapies, such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed cell death-1 inhibitors, have improved the prognosis for patients with advanced melanoma. While spontaneous melanoma-associated vitiligo is a known phenomenon, the occurrence of melanoma-associated vitiligo following melanoma therapy is now recognized to associate with favorable outcomes.

Objective

The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive literature review of melanoma-associated vitiligo and explore the insights these findings provide about the pathobiology of vitiligo and mechanisms underlying melanoma therapies.

Methods

PubMed and Science Direct databases were searched for studies pertaining to melanoma-associated vitiligo. The 36 studies reviewed included meta-analyses (n = 2), prospective cohort studies (n = 4), prospective observational studies (n = 3), retrospective studies (n = 12), case series (n = 2), and case reports (n = 13).

Results

The basic mechanisms underlying melanoma-associated vitiligo and vitiligo may be shared. Characterization of these mechanisms will identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for both melanoma and vitiligo.

Conclusions

Co-opting the immune system to target tumor antigens highlights the potential overlap between anti-tumor immunity and autoimmunity. The development of vitiligo-like depigmentation in association with immunotherapy for melanoma may provide insights into both the immune response against melanoma as well as the pathogenesis of vitiligo.

### Association between vitiligo extent and distribution and quality-of-life impairment [^113JS9L3]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the extent, distribution, and duration of vitiligo are associated with impairment of specific aspects of quality of life.

Design

A prospective questionnaire-based study of 1541 adults with vitiligo.

Setting

Online questionnaire.

Main Outcome Measures

Affected body surface area (BSA), distribution and duration of vitiligo, associated symptoms, and quality of life using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).

Results

Vitiligo had a negative effect on numerous aspects and the total score of the DLQI (mean [SD], 5.9 [5.5]). The DLQI scores in vitiligo were associated with an affected BSA of more than 25% (ordinal logistic regression; adjusted odds ratio, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.71–2.75; P < .001]) and number of body parts affected with vitiligo (P ≤ .009) but not laterality (P = 0.06) or duration of disease (P ≥ .54). Itching and/or burning skin occurred in a sizable percentage of vitiligo patients (35.1%) and were predicted by an affected BSA of more than 25% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.26–2.01; P < .001]). Sexual dysfunction occurred in 18% of patients and was predicted by an affected BSA of more than 25% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.44–2.61; P < .001]) and vitiligo lesions in the genital area (1.82 [1.30–2.53; P < .001]).

Conclusions

Vitiligo extent is associated with increased quality-of-life impairment, including itching and sexual dysfunction. Moreover, different distributions of vitiligo lesions are associated with impairment of different aspects of quality of life.

Discussion

Vitiligo has traditionally been given a relatively low priority in the dermatology research agenda, as shown by the number and quality of studies on vitiligo to date. The updated systematic reviewis helpful in identifying many important research gaps for clinical trials, but these have come largely from the research community, and may not reflect the questions that patients and clinicians have.

### Onset of vitiligo in a psoriasis patient on ixekizumab [^113RMVAP]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Vitiligo is an acquired skin disorder clinically characterized by hypopigmentated macules and patches, most frequently localized in periocular area, hands, knees, and genitals caused by the selective autoimmune destruction of melanocytes. The disorder can be psychologically devastating and stigmatizing, especially in dark skinned individuals. It could be associated with other autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, diabetes, or other.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythematous plaques covered with scales particularly over the extensor‐surfaces, scalp and lumbosacral region. Mild clinical manifestations may be controlled with topical agents such as corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogs, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors, and keratolytic agents. Systemic treatment are administered for more diffuse forms and include phototherapy (Nb‐UvB), acitretin, methotrexate, or cyclosporine. These treatments may be linked to adverse events or contraindicated in psoriasis patients, which usually reports higher cardio‐metabolic comorbidities respect to general population.

Recent major researches advancements have significantly expanded our understanding of psoriasis pathophysiology, resulting in the development of highly effective targeted therapies, such as anti‐TNFα, IL‐12/23‐inhibitors, IL‐17‐inhibitors, or IL‐23‐inhibitors. Particularly, ixekizumab, a humanized‐monoclonal immunoglobulin‐G 4 antibody, specifically binding IL‐17A, demonstrated strong efficacy in threating recalcitrant psoriasis. Nevertheless, paradoxical reactions due to IL‐17 inhibitors have been described, even for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa, but still today, pathophysiology of these events is not so completely understood.

Herein, we report the case of a 53‐year‐old Caucasian man who obtained complete skin clearance of psoriasis plaques after 16 weeks of ixekizumab treatment together with the appearance of vitiligo patches localized on the facial area.

### Enhancing awareness of vitiligoid vulvar lichen sclerosus: an underrecognized variant in patients with skin of color [^112UTefv]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Characterized by skin changes of depigmentation, vitiligoid vulvar lichen sclerosus (VVLS) often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as vitiligo in patients with skin of color. A clinical suspicion of vulvar vitiligo (VV) may not be worked up histopathologically, missing the diagnosis of vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) and thereby leading to architectural changes and risk of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, recognition of this variant in patients with skin of color is imperative to provide adequate long-term treatment to decrease these risks.

It can be difficult to distinguish VVLS from VV clinically as both conditions present with depigmentation. VLS may present with pruritus, burning, dyspareunia, and texture changes, whereas VV is asymptomatic.VLS is also differentiated by architectural changes present in some patients, which are not present in patients with VV. Additionally, it is important to acknowledge the coexistence of VLS and VV to prevent missing a diagnosis of concomitant VLS in a patient with vitiligo. Therefore, current recommendations in the literature support assessing for findings such as fissures, lichenification, atrophy, erosions, and petechiae in patients with VV as these findings may indicate concomitant VLS.

Understanding the distinction between VVLS and VV is vital because treatment of VLS is necessary to mitigate long-term sequelae. Although both conditions may be treated with high-potency topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors, there are distinctions in treatment timelines. VV is typically treated episodically whereas VLS is treated with an initial treatment plan followed by a life-long maintenance treatment as preventive use of topical steroids has shown to decrease the risk of developing vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and decrease further scarring of the vulva.

Our goal is to increase recognition of this variant of VLS in adult patients with skin of color and its similarity to VV. Here, we present 3 cases of biopsy-supported VVLS.

### Ocular manifestations of vitiligo: a systematic review [^112SjYRe]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is an acquired, autoimmune and chronic disorder that is characterized by skin and hair depigmentation secondary to epidermal melanocyte destruction. Importantly, melanocytes – neural-crest-derived, melanin-producing cells – are found in a variety of anatomic locations other than the skin, including mucosa, cardiac valves, the inner ear, and the uveal tract of the eye. These ocular melanocytes are responsible for eye pigmentation and function to protect against ultraviolet radiation and oxidative damage. Their presence in the uveal tract suggests that any process involving the destruction of melanocytes, such as vitiligo, may have ocular effects. Indeed, the relationship between ocular pathology and vitiligo is demonstrated in conditions such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada and Alezzandrini syndromes, which feature elements of ocular inflammation and vitiliginous skin. This relationship, though, may not be limited to specific syndromes.

The aim of this systematic review (SR) is to comprehensively describe the structural and functional changes identified in the eyes of patients with vitiligo and to provide an approach to management of ocular manifestations in vitiligo.

### Impact of childhood vitiligo on adult life [^115ZQsim]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The onset of vitiligo occurs before the age of 20 years in 50% of patients. Having a chronic disease in childhood can impede a child's health-related quality of life (HRQL).

Objectives

Firstly, to compare the social and psychosexual development and current HRQL of young adult patients with childhood vitiligo with those of a group of healthy controls. Secondly, to compare these outcomes in patients reporting negative childhood experiences with those of patients not reporting negative childhood experiences.

Methods

Eligible patients were mailed questionnaires on (i) sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, (ii) social and psychosexual development, (iii) generic and dermatology-specific HRQL, (iv) presence of negative childhood experiences related to vitiligo, (v) specification of these negative experiences and (vi) patients' recommendations for further care.

Results

A total of 232 patients with vitiligo completed the questionnaires. Social and psychosexual development and generic HRQL in young adult patients with childhood vitiligo were not different from those of healthy controls. However, patients reporting negative childhood experiences reported significantly more problems in social development than those not reporting negative experiences. Furthermore, negative childhood experiences were significantly associated with more HRQL impairment in early adulthood.

Conclusions

Reporting negative experiences from childhood vitiligo appears to be associated with HRQL impairment in young adults with vitiligo.

### Pediatric vitiligo [^115dX9H8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a disease of pigment loss. Most investigators currently consider vitiligo to be a disorder that occurs as a result of autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, supported by identification of antimelanocyte antibodies in many patients, and the presence of comorbid autoimmune disease in patients with and family members of individuals with vitiligo. One-half of vitiligo cases are of childhood onset. This article presents a current overview of pediatric vitiligo including comorbidities of general health, psychological factors, therapeutic options, and long-term health considerations.

### Vitiligo… [^117WrJW9]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Vitiligo can develop at any time, but usually appears before age 30 years. It affects men and women equally. Vitiligo occurs in people of all socioeconomic backgrounds, races, and ethnicities, but is more noticeable in people with skin of color. Vitiligo is not contagious or life threatening, but it can be life altering, leading to increased psychological stress or low self-esteem. Vitiligo occurs when the body's immune system attacks the skin cells that produce melanin, the body's natural pigment. It is unclear why this autoimmune condition occurs. Development of vitiligo may also be associated with family history or a trigger event, such as stress, trauma to the skin, chemical exposures, or use of certain medications. Vitiligo can affect the skin anywhere on the body. The areas that lose pigment have sharp borders and are surrounded by normal-appearing skin. Vitiligo may also affect the eyes, hair, and lips.

Some people may have a few areas of vitiligo on their body, while others have more widespread loss of pigment. Diagnosis is usually made by physical examination alone. A dermatologist may use a handheld device that emits ultraviolet light to get a better look at the skin. A skin biopsy is not usually necessary to make a diagnosis. Some autoimmune diseases are seen more frequently in patients with vitiligo, especially autoimmune thyroid disease. Your physician may want to run tests to screen for these conditions. Phototherapy may slow the disease progression and help repigment the skin in some patients. It can take many months to see results, and certain parts of the body, like the hands and feet, are especially difficult to treat. In recent years, grafting has emerged as a safe and effective treatment option, and is available at some special centers. Often, a combination of these treatments is used.

Camouflage techniques can be used along with or instead of treatment. Sun avoidance and proper sunscreen use are essential in patients with vitiligo. These practices protect depigmented skin from burning and minimize the contrast between pigmented and nonpigmented skin that may appear more noticeable after tanning.

### Vitiligoid variant of lichen sclerosus in young girls with darker skin types [^114Kqifm]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Vitiligo and lichen sclerosus are autoimmune disorders characterized by white discoloration, and both frequently affect the anogenital region. Vitiligoid lichen sclerosus refers to a superficial variant of lichen sclerosus in which the lesion appears clinically to be vitiligo based on the predominant presentation of depigmentation and minimal inflammation and sclerosis but histologically is consistent with lichen sclerosus. A limited number of reports have described vitiligoid lichen sclerosus, and from these reports, it appears to primarily affect darker-skinned people.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 7 girls with darker skin types seen in our pediatric dermatology clinic who presented with a clinical overlap of vitiligo and lichen sclerosus. All had primarily well-demarcated, depigmented patches characteristic of vitiligo, but the lesions were symptomatic (pruritus, pain, bleeding, constipation), a presentation more consistent with lichen sclerosus.

Results

The girls were all treated with high-potency topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or both. The associated symptoms improved or resolved, but most had minimal improvement of the depigmentation.

Conclusions

The girls presented in this series appear to have had vitiligoid lichen sclerosus, given the clinical overlap of lichen sclerosus and vitiligo affecting the anogenital region, particularly given that they did not have depigmented patches elsewhere on their body. Previous cases of vitiligoid lichen sclerosus have been reported in darker skin types, and our findings support this possible predisposition. It is important for clinicians to assess patients presenting with genital depigmentation for overlapping features of vitiligo and lichen sclerosus and determine appropriate management.

### Mental health and psychosocial quality-of-life burden among patients with vitiligo: findings from the global VALIANT study [^112ppGH2]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of vitiligo with patient-reported quality of life and psychosocial health globally?

Findings

In this population-based qualitative study, 3541 patients with vitiligo across 17 countries reported substantial burden on quality of life, emotional well-being, daily life, and psychosocial health, with greater burden noted among patients with more than 5% affected body surface area, Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI (ie, darker skin), facial involvement, or hand involvement vs their counterparts.

Meaning

Findings suggest that improvement in the psychosocial health of patients should be prioritized in the management and treatment of vitiligo.

Patients with vitiligo are predisposed to solar damage, often suffering from actinic keratoses (AK) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, never have these patients been noted to have an increased risk for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In fact, no case reports of these 2 diseases occurring together exist in the literature. Here, the authors report a case of basal cell carcinoma arising in a patient with vitiligo. This rare occurrence gives question to the nature of these tumors and their pathogenesis.

Vitiligo is often classified into three types, generalized, segmental, and localized, on the basis of their distribution pattern. It is also classified into type A (non-dermatomal or non-segmental) and type B (dermatomal or segmental) vitiligo on the basis of both the distribution pattern and physiological function. The natural courses of type A and type B vitiligo are characteristic and quite different from each other. Whereas type A vitiligo appears at any age and progresses throughout the patient's life span, type B vitiligo affects the young and stabilizes within a few years. Segmental type vitiligo corresponds to type B, and generalized type vitiligo is the late stage of type A. However, no one has observed the course and character of localized type vitiligo, and its nosological position in A/B classification is unclear. We followed 44 cases of localized type vitiligo for periods of 6 months to 8 years. In 3 of the 44 patients, new white patches developed within the same dermatome as their affected areas in the first 12 months and stabilized in a short period. Therefore, these patients were diagnosed as type B vitiligo. In 15 patients, vitiligo developed in other dermatomal areas; the earliest case at 9 months, and others later on. The new white patches continue to develop for a long period, so these patients were diagnosed with type A vitiligo. In 26 of the 44 patients, the vitiligo remained localized within the period of observation. It is concluded that most localized type vitiligo is the early stage of type A, but a small number of cases belong to the early stage of type B.

### New discoveries in the pathogenesis and classification of vitiligo [^112DsKqP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a common autoimmune disease that progressively destroys melanocytes in the skin, resulting in the appearance of patchy depigmentation. This disfiguring condition frequently affects the face and other visible areas of the body, which can be psychologically devastating. The onset of vitiligo often occurs in younger individuals and progresses for life, resulting in a heavy burden of disease and decreased quality of life. Presentation patterns of vitiligo vary, and recognition of these patterns provides both diagnostic and prognostic clues. Recent insights into disease pathogenesis offer a better understanding of the natural history of the disease, its associations, and potential for future treatments. The first article in this continuing medical education series outlines typical and atypical presentations of vitiligo, how they reflect disease activity, prognosis, and response to treatment. Finally, we discuss disease associations, risk factors, and our current understanding of disease pathogenesis.

### Innate lymphocyte-induced CXCR3B-mediated melanocyte apoptosis is a potential initiator of T-cell autoreactivity in vitiligo [^114rkSAU]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Together these data suggest that NK cells and innate immune system may play an important role in the early stages of vitiligo which may begin in normal-appearing, NL skin of the patient. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that melanocytes from vitiligo patients have intrinsic defects. Moreover, there have been some clues in the literature from work published over 20 years ago showing that melanocytes themselves can present antigens. Clinical and histological data showing a restrained immunity against melanocytes in halo nevior in localized depigmentation of genital melanosisstrongly suggest the key role of melanocytes in initiating the anti-melanocytic immunity. However, the exact role of melanocytes in trigerring the initial steps of auto-immunity in vitiligo is far from being fully understood.

We hypothesized that vitiligo is initiated by dysregulation in innate immunity and melanocytes, and that innate immune cells are the initial source of IFNγ production in the skin. Due to their potent IFNγ producing capacity, we chose to focus on NK/ILC1 in this study. Our objective was to assess the role of the innate immunity and melanocytes in the initial steps of vitiligo by using melanocytes and blood extracted from vitiligo patients compared to healthy volunteers. Here we show data suggesting that vitiligo is likely to be initiated in the normal-appearing skin of vitiligo subjects through activation of local innate lymphocyte-induced melanocyte apoptosis and subsequent activation of adaptive and memory immune responses. This apoptosis is mediated by melanocytic CXCR3B, identifying this isoform of CXCR3 chemokine receptor to be critical in melanocyte destruction and initiation of the disease.

### Acquired disorders with depigmentation: a systematic approach to vitiliginoid conditions [^113QeMKp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acquired disorders with depigmentation are commonly encountered by dermatologists and present with a wide differential diagnosis. Vitiligo, the most common disorder of acquired depigmentation, is characterized by well-defined depigmented macules and patches. Other conditions, such as chemical leukoderma, can present with similar findings, and are often easily mistaken for vitiligo. Key clinical features can help differentiate between acquired disorders of depigmentation. The first article in this continuing medical education series focuses on conditions with a vitiligo-like phenotype. Early recognition and adequate treatment of these conditions is critical in providing appropriate prognostication and treatment.

Vitiligo, an acquired disease of depigmentation, affects millions worldwide. The psychosocial and health-related quality of life (HRQL) impact of the disease varies based on several parameters, including country of origin, skin type, gender, age, marital status, and involved body site. Many instruments, both dermatology specific and dermatology nonspecific, have been used to measure HRQL. Assessing HRQL in vitiligo is an important part of disease management.

Discussion

LSA is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, although hereditary, endocrine, infectious, and autoimmune factors are suggested to be involved. Antibodies to extracellular matrix protein-1 have been suggested to be involved in the mechanism of LS.LSA has been associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, systemic lupus, vitiligo, alopecia areata, and Graves' disease, among others. LS can occur in both men and women but is more prevalent in women. Although the anal and genital regions are predominantly affected, EGLS comprises of 15% to 20% of all LS cases. Genital LS has a bimodal distribution, with 1 peak at puberty and another at menopause, whereas EGLS usually occurs in middle-aged adults. The most common symptoms are intractable pruritus and pain. The average age of patients with EGLS in this series is 75 years, which is significantly higher than that reported previously. All cases have Fitzpatrick skin type IV to V which has not been reported previously.

EGLS presents as asymptomatic white opalescent papules, patches, plaques, and erosions favoring the upper portion of the back, neck, and shoulders, and may become atrophic with time and appear parchment-like. The primary lesion begins as asymptomatic to mildly pruritic polygonal white papules that coalesce into well-demarcated erythematous plaques that become atrophic. Patients can frequently present with purpura. In patients with skin of color, EGLS can have various degrees of hypo- or hyperpigmentation.

Diagnosis of EGLS can be made clinically and confirmed histopathologically. Dermatoscopy shows multiple patchy yellow-white structures, scales, keratotic plugs, pseudo-pigment-like pattern, and chrysalis structures.EGLS characteristics vary histologically based on the duration of the disease. Early disease is characterized by interface dermatitis with vacuolar/lichenoid changes. Progressive changes include follicular plugging, upper dermal sclerosis with a band of hyalinization, and inflammatory infiltrate. Late-stage disease is characterized by epidermal atrophy, loss of rete ridges, upper dermal sclerosis, and scanty inflammatory cellular infiltrates.

### Vitiligo. pathogenesis and treatment [^1128zQL3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired skin disorder caused by the disappearance of pigment cells from the epidermis that gives rise to well defined white patches which are often symmetrically distributed. The lack of melanin pigment makes the lesional skin more sensitive to sunburn. Vitiligo can be cosmetically disfiguring and it is a stigmatizing condition, leading to serious psychologic problems in daily life. It occurs worldwide in about 0.5% of the population and it occurs as frequently in males as it does in females. The cause is unknown, but might involve genetic factors, autoimmunity, neurologic factors, toxic metabolites, and lack of melanocyte growth factors. Since a causative (gene) treatment is not (yet) available, current modalities are directed towards stopping progression and to achieving repigmentation in order to repair the morphology and functional deficiencies of the depigmented skin areas. Many treatments have been used for some time; however; there are some new developments: narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B (311 nm) therapy, the combination of corticosteroid cream + UVA therapy, and the transplantation of autologous pigment cells in various modalities. In widespread vitiligo, residual pigment can be removed by depigmentation agents. Sunscreens, camouflage products, and good guidance may help the patient cope better with the disease.

### Localized vitiligo occurring in an old biopsy scar: a case report [^1121nGoj]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current evidence suggests vitiligo is an autoimmune disease with a genetic predisposition that can be triggered by nongenetic environmental risk factors. Increased prevalence among immediate relatives has been established. In addition, risk factors including ultraviolet radiation and harmful chemicals have been found to increase the production of harmful ROS, when combined with decreased catalase in susceptible melanocytes, and have been found in patients with vitiligo. A study on vitiligo by Deo et alfound that many patients first notice their vitiligo following severe sunburns. This finding supports the belief that the vitiligo could be caused by decreased catalase and severe sunburns. A severe sunburn can cause local trauma to the skin, and the development of vitiligo could be explained by the Koebner phenomenon. However, in contrast, an old biopsy from 25 years prior to the incidence of vitiligo has not been reported, to our knowledge, as a possible triggering environmental event. Furthermore, a family history of autoimmune disease was not established in this patient.

Although a genetic predisposition of autoimmune disease or catalase levels could not be established because of a history of excessive sunburns in the area and excessive scar tissue resulting from the biopsy scar, a local autoimmune attack on melanocytes could have occurred from a combination of these factors.

### Possible mechanisms in the induction of vitiligo-like hypopigmentation by topical imiquimod [^116r7GsC]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of vitiligo was examined for clues to the pigmentary changes that may occur after treatment with topical imiquimod. The literature varies on the pigmentary changes induced by topical use of imiquimod. The US Food and Drugs Administration lists 68 reports of pigmentary changes out of a total of 1257 reports related to imiquimod lodged from 1997 to 2003. Some studies describe vitiligo-like hypopigmentation associated with imiquimod treatment of genital warts (as with the patient described in this report), molluscum contagiosum, basal cell carcinoma, extramammary Paget's disease and murine melanoma. Other studies report hyperpigmentation associated with imiquimod. The possible mechanisms of hypopigmentation associated with imiquimod treatment are discussed, including antibodies found in sera of patients with vitiligo to nonpigment cell antigens, cytoplasmic pigment cell antigens and pigment cell-surface antigens; stimulation by imiquimod of both the innate immune response and cell-mediated adaptive immunity; and increased sensitivity of melanocytes to oxidative stress. The vitiligo-like hypopigmentation following topical imiquimod treatment is in line with the mode of action of this drug.

### Systematic evidence grading evaluates multisystemic associations and risks of vitiligo [^112q6WzP]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune skin disease characterized by refractory depigmentation affecting approximately 1.3% of the adult population. The typical clinical manifestation of vitiligo is white, non-scaly patches which significantly affect patients' emotional well-being, daily life, and psychosocial health. Emerging research increasingly recognizes that the effect of vitiligo in the body extends beyond its cutaneous manifestations, as it may be accompanied by elevated biomarkers, organ-specific diseases, and even systemic conditions, such as thyroid disorders and metabolic syndrome. Observational studies have identified numerous potential associations between vitiligo and diseases, biomarkers, and risk or protective factors. Categorizing and assessing the credibility of these associations is crucial for advancing the understanding of and improving existing management strategies.

However, evidence supporting these associations varies greatly. This lack of clarity hinders the development of comprehensive and evidence-based management strategies for patients with vitiligo. These observational studies may be subject to biases such as residual confounding, excess significance bias, and selective reporting, which could potentially overestimate the observed effect sizes. Even meta-analyses that aim to synthesize existing evidence, may yield conflicting conclusions. As an observational method, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies provide unbiased effect estimates and minimize the influence of reverse causation and confounding factors commonly encountered in epidemiological settings by leveraging genetic variations as proxies for exposure. However, for the same association in MR studies on vitiligo, two different results can be obtained owing to variations in data sources and the selection criteria for instrumental variables. Therefore, both approaches lack rigorous evidence with respect to validity and strength.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive umbrella review to establish an evidence hierarchy and systematically evaluate observational associations and causal relationships reported in meta-analyses and MR studies. This dual-direction evaluation encompassed: (1) exposures as risk/protective factors for vitiligo, and (2) vitiligo itself as a risk/protective factor for other conditions. By integrating and comparing findings from meta-analyses and MR analyses, we aimed to provide more robust evidence and deepen the understanding of vitiligo as a complex and multifaceted disease.

### Hypochromic vitiligo: delineation of a new entity [^116Nn6K3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypochromic vitiligo is a rare entity that has been reported only twice under the term 'vitiligo minor', with an absence of clear delineation.

Objectives

To delineate hypochromic vitiligo through a case series of patients with typical bilateral hypopigmented lesions affecting the face and trunk.

Methods

This is a retrospective multicentric evaluation study conducted in eight departments of dermatology in France, Belgium, Senegal and Saudi Arabia.

Results

Twenty-four cases of hypochromic vitiligo were identified. Fourteen were men and 10 women. The mean age at diagnosis was 35.4 years (range 8–66). Strikingly, all patients were dark skinned, with skin types V and VI. The pattern of distribution was highly similar in most of the patients (18 of 24), with involvement of the face and neck area predominating on seborrhoeic areas associated with multiple isolated hypopigmented macules involving predominantly the scalp. The retrospective nature of this study is its main limitation.

Conclusions

Hypochromic vitiligo is not yet part of a conventional classification. The disease seems to be limited to individuals with dark skin types. Hypopigmented seborrhoeic face and neck involvement associated with hypopigmented macules of the trunk and scalp is the hallmark of the disease.

Results

Stages 2 and 3: Consultation and collation

Of the 2303 surveys circulated, 461 (20%) were returned. This resulted in 1427 questions about vitiligo. Non-treatment questions (n = 767), about the natural history of vitiligo, its aetiology and prevention, were excluded.

The response rate for members of the Vitiligo Society was 24% (307/1268) and for BAD/UK DCTN members was 14% (119/835). Sixty-six per cent of responses (302/461) were from patients, 31% (142/461) were from healthcare professionals, and 3% were from other sources. More women responded than men (53% women, 30% men, 17% did not specify), and most were aged 30–60 years (8% < 30 years, 50% 30–60 years, 25% > 60 years, 17% did not specify).

Overall, 660 uncertainties that specifically related to the treatment of vitiligo were gathered during the consultation stage. Thirty-one per cent were from healthcare professionals (206/660), 48.5% were from patients (320/660) and 20.5% were unknown (134/660). An additional 58 treatment uncertainties were identified from the BAD guideline and the updated Cochrane systematic review. The resulting 718 uncertainties were refined into a 'long-list' of 93 treatment uncertainties, which were used for the ranking exercise.

### VITILIGO… [^112gvifk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

REYNOLDS HJ. VITILIGO. A Clinical Lecture Delivered at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago. JAMA. 1886; VII: 701–702. doi: 10.1001/jama.1886.04250120085001 This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. In the class of skin diseases known as "atrophies" we have a subdivision in which the atrophy or disease is entirely confined to the pigment or coloring matter of the skin. We meet with this condition at times as a congenital affection, when it is called albinismus. When it is acquired during the life of the individual it is called vitiligo. The congenital condition, or albinismus, is generally universal, of which the socalled albino is an example. The acquired form, or vitiligo, is always only partial.

While neither of these conditions is of great interest, therapeutically considered, as they are not, as a rule, very amenable to treatment, they are nevertheless, on account of their comparative rarity and the very striking deformity they produce, not only matters of great importance to those so afflicted, but of considerable interest to physicians. I therefore take great pleasure in Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Vitiligo: a comprehensive overview part I. introduction, epidemiology, quality of life, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, associations, histopathology, etiology, and work-up [^113Acv1E]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder of unknown etiology that is clinically characterized by the development of white macules related to the selective loss of melanocytes. The prevalence of the disease is around 1% in the United States and in Europe, but ranges from less than 0.1% to greater than 8% worldwide. A recorded predominance of women may reflect their greater willingness to express concern about cosmetically relevant issues. Half of all patients develop the disease before 20 years of age. Onset at an advanced age occurs but is unusual, and should raise concerns about associated diseases, such as thyroid dysfunction, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and alopecia areata. Generalized vitiligo is the most common clinical presentation and often involves the face and acral regions. The course of the disease is unpredictable and the response to treatment varies. Depigmentation may be the source of severe psychological distress, diminished quality of life, and increased risk of psychiatric morbidity. Part I of this two-part series describes the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and various hypotheses for the pathogenesis of vitiligo based on past and current research.

### Reticulate genital pigmentation associated with localized vitiligo… [^115T9acx]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Reticulate hyperpigmentation of the skin can be seen in a variety of disorders, sometimes with significant clinical overlap. 1 Genital lentiginosis can be seen as dark macules. We report 2 cases of reticulate pigmentation that cannot be classified in any of the conditions known to us to have been described. A 21-year-old man with palmar psoriasis had asymptomatic reticulate pigmentation of the genitalia since birth; in the last months before we saw him, achromic macules inside the pigmented areas appeared and remained stable. He had no similar lesions in other sites and no affected relatives. The lesions were very well demarcated, dark, reticulate pigmentation affecting the scrotum and the penis shaft, without infiltration or epidermal changes. Two biopsy specimens showed basal layer hyperpigmentation without an increased number of melanocytes and with scarce melanophages in the papillary dermis.

The epidermis was normal, without melanic globules or melanocytes, as confirmed by melan-A testing. Localized vitiligo was diagnosed.

### A Romanian population isolate with high frequency of vitiligo and associated autoimmune diseases… [^115jirou]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To analyze the heritability of age of vitiligo onset, we used computer software 15 to partition the total variance into additive genetic and environmental components. The geographically isolated study community consists of 2 adjacent villages located in a mountainous region of northern Romania. One was founded in 1566 by 2 families and the other in 1603 by 1 family. for the occurrence of vitiligo in the study community. We performed formal analysis of the heritability of age of vitiligo onset in patients, partitioning the total variance into additive genetic and environmental components. We found no evidence that genetic factors contribute to the variance of age of vitiligo onset;. in which genetic and environmental heterogeneity may be much greater. Typically, family aggregation of vitiligo cases occurs in a nonmendelian pattern suggestive of polygenic multifactorial inheritance.

4, 9, 10, 24–31 Genetic segregation analyses indicate that vitiligo typically involves multiple major loci contributing to disease risk in a complex interactive manner. 28–31 In contrast, genetic segregation analysis of the present study community supports a single major recessive locus with incomplete penetrance, consistent with reduced causal genetic heterogeneity in this isolated and relatively inbred population, although this analysis does not exclude more complex causation. The estimated penetrance of 0. 30 suggests that additional genetic and/or nongenetic factors influence occurrence of vitiligo even in this population. Indeed, heritability analysis indicated that age of vitiligo onset in the study community is determined almost completely by nongenetic environmental factors. Thus, whereas a major gene or genes seems to govern susceptibility to vitiligo, actual onset of disease seems to depend on exposure of genetically susceptible individuals to environmental triggers.

This Romanian community may present a facile opportunity to map and ultimately identify a recessive gene that confers high risk of vitiligo and associated autoimmune diseases. Even 4 centuries after the community's founding, there would still be almost complete linkage disequilibrium surrounding a causal founder genetic variant to a distance of at least 100 kilobase, facilitating identification of the causal gene by methods that assume identity by descent from the common founder ancestor. While this gene variant is of particular importance in this isolated special population, it likely is also involved in disease susceptibility in the broader white population and, thus, is of broader importance.

### Cutaneous vitiligo following management of uveal melanoma in 6 patients [^1135bqoa]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

The relationship of vitiligo to cutaneous melanoma is believed to be due to an immune response generated to melanoma antigens that cross-react with normal skin. There is little in the literature on the relationship between cutaneous vitiligo and uveal melanoma.

Objective

To describe the clinical profile, treatment, and outcome in patients with uveal melanoma who subsequently developed cutaneous vitiligo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective case series of 6 patients with uveal melanoma who had developed cutaneous vitiligo and were examined at a tertiary eye care institution.

Main Outcome and Measure

Development of cutaneous vitiligo.

Results

The mean age at presentation was 62 years (range, 39–85 years). No patient had a personal history of cutaneous melanoma, autoimmune disease, or cutaneous vitiligo. The mean tumor basal diameter was 12.9 mm (median, 12.7 mm; range, 7–19 mm), with a mean thickness of 9.5 mm (median, 8.4 mm; range, 3–19 mm). Treatment included plaque radiotherapy in 4 patients and enucleation in 1 patient; 1 patient refused therapy. No patient had local tumor recurrence at the 71-month mean follow-up, but of the 3 patients who developed metastases at the 52-month mean follow-up, 2 were treated with a melanoma vaccine. The mean interval from initial presentation to onset of vitiligo was 77 months (range, 5–168 months). The vitiligo developed bilaterally with multiple well-defined lesions, affecting 5% to 40% of the cutaneous surface, generally in the upper body. During the 71-month mean follow-up (range, 4–205 months), there was 1 death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with uveal melanoma can develop vitiligo spontaneously or following vaccine therapy. Involvement is multiple and bilateral, predominantly affecting the upper body.

### Group A streptococcal vulvitis in adult women: clinical features and association with psoriasis [^113D21Fx]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Group A streptococcus (GAS) vulvitis is rare, mainly reported in association with vaginitis. We examined the clinical features of GAS vulvitis in adults, the presence of other infected sites, and its association with dermatological conditions.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the medical files and photographs of adult patients with bacteriologically confirmed GAS vulvitis seen at 3 private clinics. Coexisting infected sites, associated dermatological conditions, and bacteriological results for the husbands of 3 patients were examined.

Results

Nineteen patients (mean age = 52.2 [range = 23–83] years) with vulvar GAS infections were identified. The vulvar symptoms consisted of pain (11 cases), pruritus (9), burning (4), and discharge (10). The predominant physical feature was bilateral erythema, mainly located on the labia minora and the inner aspect of the labia majora. This erythema was associated with oozing (3), edema (6), or fissures (6). Seventeen patients had an associated vaginal infection, which was asymptomatic in 7 cases; anal infections were present in 9 cases. The following 10 patients had associated dermatological conditions: psoriasis (6), lichen sclerosus (2), Paget disease (1), or vitiligo (1). Two (one each from the throat and penis) of the 3 bacteriological specimens taken from the 3 husbands were GAS positive.

Conclusions

In most adult women, GAS vulvitis is associated with a vaginal infection that may be asymptomatic. A bilateral, oozing, and edematous or fissured erythema involving the vulvar or anovulvar area is suggestive of GAS vulvitis. The association with psoriasis and the benefits of screening household members and sexual partners deserves further attention.

### Psychosocial effects of vitiligo: a systematic literature review [^112FdLda]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Factors that were most commonly associated with significantly higher psychosocial burden included female sex, visible or genital lesions, age < 30 years (particularly adolescents), and extensive body area involvement, among others. The implementation of facial vitiligo as a primary outcome measure in recent clinical studies is supported by the gravity of the association between facial lesions and a higher psychosocial burden reported here. Some of the factors significantly associated with a higher psychosocial burden have been associated with a greater willingness to pay, although the association between willingness to pay and lesion location was not assessed.

In many cases, studies reported findings using broad QoL instruments that are not specific to vitiligo. Generic QoL instruments may not reflect the true burden of vitiligo, in part because of instrument design. For example, the DLQI includes an item for physical symptoms (i.e. itch, soreness, pain, or stinging), which tend to be more pronounced in patients with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, possibly leading to an underestimation of burden in vitiligo vs other dermatologic diseases. In addition, the heterogeneity of studies included in this review may further complicate direct comparisons of general QoL in vitiligo with other dermatologic diseases. Interestingly, a recent study in South Korea showed that willingness to pay was highest in vitiligo compared with other dermatologic diseases including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, despite lower median DLQI scores in patients with vitiligo. The application of widely used generic QoL instruments in vitiligo may therefore be better suited for comparison across demographic or clinical characteristics. In our analysis, there were regional trends in DLQI scores, with a lower QoL burden among European and North American populations and a higher QoL burden noted among Middle Eastern and Asian populations, consistent with findings from another review. Future studies should assess QoL instruments for cultural sensitivity/influence. Psychosocial morbidity should also be examined to further elucidate the effect of culture on vitiligo burden, which is an important consideration for dermatologists caring for diverse patients. During the past decade, the VitiQoL was developed specifically for measuring QoL in patients with vitiligo, although it does not differentiate between skin types (i.e. fair and dark skin), and its use has not been widespread. Our search criteria identified only eight studies that reported aspects of psychosocial comorbidity using the VitiQoL instrument, two of which were clinical trials published in the past year. Further research using vitiligo-specific QoL instruments is warranted.

### Diffuse vulvar papules in a patient with Crohn's disease [^113xvog3]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following appears to be a risk factor for this condition?
A. Autoimmune disease
B. Male sex
C. Malignancy
D. Tobacco use
E. Unprotected sex

Answers:
A. Autoimmune disease – Correct. Eruptive syringomas have been associated with autoimmune disorders including vitiligo and alopecia areata. Additionally, the clear cell variant of syringomas is associated with diabetes mellitus. Eruptive vulvar syringomas associated with severe pruritus have been reported in one previous patient with CD. While the pathophysiology of eruptive syringomas is not completely understood, immunohistochemical staining of syringoma tissue has shown an infiltrate of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells surrounding the sweat ducts. This suggests that the reactive hyperplasia of cutaneous eccrine ducts may result from autoimmune destruction of their surface components.
B. Male sex – Incorrect. There is an increased incidence of syringomas in females. Onset and/or worsening during puberty, pregnancy, and menstrual cycles suggests that female hormones play a role in their pathophysiology.
C. Malignancy – Incorrect. Syringomas are benign and have not been linked to underlying malignancies. However, they may resemble cutaneous metastases and thus require biopsy for histologic reassurance.
D. Tobacco use – Incorrect. While tobacco use may worsen CD, it is not a reported risk factor for the development of syringomas.
E. Unprotected sex – Incorrect. Syringomas are not sexually transmitted. However, when present on the genitalia, they may resemble condyloma acuminatum or molluscum contagiosum.

### Vitiligo [^112ZuGKQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Vitiligo is an acquired depigmenting disorder that affects 0.5% to 2% of the world population. Three different forms are classified according to the distribution of lesions; namely non-segmental, segmental and mixed vitiligo. Vitiligo is associated with polymorphisms in genes involved in the immune response and in melanogenesis. However, environmental factors are required for the development of manifest disease. In general, the diagnosis is clinical and no laboratory tests or biopsies are required. Metabolic alterations are central to current concepts in pathophysiology. They induce an increased generation of reactive oxygen species and susceptibility to mild exogenous stimuli in the epidermis. This produces a senescent phenotype of skin cells, leads to the release of innate immune molecules, which trigger autoimmunity, and ultimately causes dysfunction and death of melanocytes. Clinical management aims to halt depigmentation, and to either repigment or depigment the skin, depending on the extent of disease. New therapeutic approaches include stimulation of melanocyte differentiation and proliferation through α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogues and through epidermal stem cell engineering. Several questions remain unsolved, including the connection between melanocyte depletion and stem cell exhaustion, the underlying degenerative mechanisms and the biological mediators of cell death. Overall, vitiligo is an excellent model for studying degenerative and autoimmune processes and for testing novel approaches in regenerative medicine.

development. Overview of Vitiligo Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition that causes the loss of skin color when the body attacks its own melanocytes — the cells that give skin, hair, and other areas of the body color leading to depigmentation. Some people also experience intense itching at the sites of. depigmentation when vitiligo is in an active stage. Some people with vitiligo also have patches of pigment loss affecting the hair on their scalp or body. It is unclear what specific circumstances trigger the immune system to attack melanocytes in the skin, but research suggests roles for genetic and environmental factors. Vitiligo sometimes runs in families, but the inheritance pattern is complex since. many causative factors are involved. Individuals living with vitiligo may be more likely to develop other autoimmune conditions, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, pernicious anemia, and alopecia areata.

Vitiligo is a common condition, affecting between 0. 5 and 1 percent of the population worldwide. The. average age of onset of vitiligo is in the mid-twenties, but it can appear at any age. 1 There is no cure for vitiligo, and there are no FDA-approved treatments for repigmentation of vitiligo lesions. Treatments to attempt repigmentation include topical corticosteroids and psoralen and. years of living with vitiligo, "I don't want to go outside. I don't want to see my face in the mirror. " Many participants also shared concerns about family members inheriting vitiligo and. which caused emotional distress. One participant said, "I often feel like I'm losing the very thing that identifies me as a Black woman. Unfortunately, many may say it's just skin, but for me, it goes much deeper than just skin color. " One detailed their transformation with vitiligo universalis over four years, "I've lost my genetic properties. I was proud of my Indonesian. on colored people.

" Another shared, "As I have a darker skin tone, my noticeable vitiligo draws the most attention from others with unwanted stares, disgusted looks, and unspoken questions. " However, participants with lighter skin tones still experienced similar impacts. One participant reported, "Although my son is not dark in skin color, it is still noticeable.

### Enhancing awareness of vitiligoid vulvar lichen sclerosus: an underrecognized variant in patients with skin of color [^116AwXj8]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Table I
Clinical findings

Although VVLS may present with architectural changes, it is important to note that in case 3, there were no architectural changes noted at the initial presentation. This case underscores the need to acknowledge symptoms in the absence of architectural changes and pursue biopsy with uncertainty regarding diagnosis. Our work highlights the need to raise awareness to avoid misdiagnosis in patients with skin of color because currently there is a gap in the literature regarding this variant of VLS in the adult population as it has primarily been reported in the pediatric population.

Our cases demonstrate the need for physician recognition of vulvar symptoms and signs to delineate VLS versus VV when patients with skin of color present with depigmented patches on the vulva, perineum, and perianal area. Enhancing awareness of the variant, VVLS, can significantly contribute to improving the accuracy of the diagnosis. This is especially important because patients who are compliant with long-term topical corticosteroid therapy for VLS have significant differences in architecture changes and incidence of vulvar carcinoma. The cases we presented in this series demonstrate the similarity in appearance of VV and VVLS that may result in diagnostic and treatment delay.

### Pigmentary complications after non-medical male circumcision [^116YavuJ]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diffuse hyperpigmentation resulting from chronic inflammation or postinflammatory conditions may present as multiple macules that give a 'spotty' appearance to the skin of the genitalia. A remarkable pigmentary loss in vitiligo occurs mainly in patients with dark complexions, and it may be overlooked in people with fair skin. Characteristically, it may appear as white patches on the glans penis, but spontaneous repigmentation has been known to occur. Hypopigmentation associated with postinflammatory conditions may be seen after any form of dermatophyte infection, genital ulcer, intertrigo, or chronic dermatitis. In this series of patients, vitiligo was diagnosed in only 3 cases (Fig. 6).

Divided or kissing nevi, mostly located in the genitalia, are very rare and can only be seen on parts of the body where separation occurs during embryogenesis. Commonly, these nevi are believed to be benign pigmented tumors. Divided naevus has been reported with one component located on the dorsal or dorsolateral side of the glans and the other on the distal penile shaft or inner face of the prepuce and separated by uninvolved skin across the coronal sulcus. It has been hypothesized that melanoblasts migrate to the lesion before embryological separation of the epithelial preputial placode. It is difficult to incriminate circumcision as an etiology of such a type of nevus, and our finding of 2 cases of divided nevus may be a coincidental diagnosis. Penile melanosis had a particular clinical and microscopic appearance characterized by pigmented macules plus basal layer hyperpigmentation. It may be associated with or without melanocytic hyperplasia. Some patients with penile melanosis have local irritation, and injuries occur with circumcision or diabetes mellitus. Post MC pigmentary complications can be differentiated from cases of fixed drug eruption, which may occur 1–2 weeks after initial exposure to oral medication. These lesions are mainly solitary, violaceous inflammatory plaques located on the penile shaft or glans. Furthermore, lesions may be associated with pain or pruritus and heal with time but may leave hyperpigmented patches. The circumcision procedure inherently limits the superficial vascular supply either through the mechanism of local vasospasm induced by the preputial excision itself or, alternatively, the pressure or tumescence of the homeostatic dressing wrapped around the penile shaft following MC, which may hinder the blood supply to some degree.

### Behçet's disease and vitiligo in two brothers: coincidence or association? [^111WZjea]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease (BD) and vitiligo are disorders with unknown aetiology. We report on two brothers with ocular Behcet's disease who had advanced unilateral ophthalmic symptoms associated with vitiligo. The two brothers had recurrent oral and genital ulceration, uveitis and white patches on their skin. The most probable hypothesis for the aetiology of BD is that of an autoimmune reaction in genetically predisposed individuals, with vasculitis as the main pathological hallmark. Despite many years of research, the specific causes of vitiligo remain obscure, and the most advanced aetiological hypothesis remains that of autoimmunity. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case within the literature of BD associated with vitiligo. The existence of the two different disorders is noteworthy as they were observed in two brothers during the same period in their lives, with very similar clinical observations.

Vitiligo is a chronic common skin disease. The asymptomatic hypopigmented cutaneous lesions are considered by many health care professionals as a cosmetic problem only; however, vitiligo can have a major psychosocial impact on patients' lives. We review some of the factors responsible for this impact, such as the general public's wrong perception of the disease, feelings and emotional responses from patients, how stressful events can act as triggers of the disease, stigmatization experiences suffered by the patients, the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity, the effects on relationships and sex life, how quality of life in adults and children is impaired, and how treatment can improve it.

### CD49a expression defines tissue-resident CD8T cells poised for cytotoxic function in human skin [^115exMUf]. Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The human skin forms a barrier to the external environment that is constantly exposed to colonizing microbiota, invasive pathogens, and allergens. These encounters drive differentiation and colonization of tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells, originally characterized in barrier tissues such as skin, gut, lung, and the female genital tract. Of the 20 billion T cells contained in human skin, 50%–70% express the Trm cell markers CD103 (α-subunit of the α E β 7 integrin receptor) and CD69, both implicated in lodging Trm cells in peripheral tissues. CD103 binds E-cadherin, which is highly expressed on epithelia, whereas CD69 antagonizes sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1)-mediated egress from tissues.

Following in situ activation, Trm cells provide strong defense against recurrent infections. While such local immune responses contribute to immunity, aberrant activation might cause disease. In the skin, the patchy appearance of several T cell-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis and vitiligo, suggests that tissue-resident rather than circulating cells drive immunopathology. Demarcated, inflamed and hyperproliferative plaques are maintained by interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-17 in psoriasis, whereas vitiligo presents with persistent depigmentations attributed to local interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production and T cell-mediated killing of melanocytes. Thus, if Trm cells drive these diseases, then vitiligo and psoriasis would be expected to involve the contribution of functionally different subsets.

### Global clinicoepidemiological pattern of childhood vitiligo: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117XGwT2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the most common clinical presentation of vitiligo in children was a school-aged girl with vitiligo vulgaris initiated from the head and neck with a positive family history in about 17% of cases, and the possibility of association with anaemia, thyroid disorders and halo nevus.

According to the findings of this meta-analysis, women predominated over men (female-to-male: 1.3: 1). However, Cho et al reported a near-equal incidence in both sexes, and another study reported the opposite ratio. The higher incidence of childhood vitiligo in women can be attributed to the higher prevalence of autoimmune conditions in the female gender, which is indirectly related to the increased stigma of the cosmetic appearance in vitiligo among the parents of the girl child. As vitiligo is generally regarded as a cosmetic condition, medical attention may be sought earlier.

In addition, the meta-regression analysis revealed a significant association between the female predominance of childhood vitiligo and geographical area, with a lower ratio in Asia and Europe than in Africa. In addition to differences in ethnicity, a greater awareness of childhood vitiligo in more developed countries than in Africa may be a contributing factor.

Approximately, 50% of initial lesions occur in the head and neck, according to the results of the systematic analysis. However, the exact interpretation of the data is challenging, but more frequent sun exposure during sports increases the risk of vitiligo in genetically susceptible individuals. Additionally, this site focuses more on vision and evaluation. Extensive sun exposure generates high levels of oxygen free radicals, which are detrimental to genetically susceptible melanocytes in vitiligo. Involvement in the genital region was less common among children. This may be due to less active melanocytes in children under hormonal stimulation, less vulnerability to attack and less friction and loss of melanocytes associated with sexual activity in older children.

### Current and emerging treatments for vitiligo [^111SKe9k]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians should be aware that vitiligo is not merely a cosmetic disease and that there are safe and effective treatments available for vitiligo. It is important to recognize common and uncommon presentations and those with active disease, as well as their implications for clinical management; these were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series. Existing treatments include topical and systemic immunosuppressants, phototherapy, and surgical techniques, which together may serve to halt disease progression, stabilize depigmented lesions, and encourage repigmentation. We discuss how to optimize the currently available treatments and highlight emerging treatments that may improve treatment efficacy in the future.

### Estimating the burden of vitiligo: a systematic review and modelling study [^114tJvAf]. The Lancet: Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by depigmented skin patches, which can pose substantial psychosocial challenges particularly in individuals with dark skin tones. Despite its impact on quality of life, there is an absence of standardised global epidemiological data. We sought to address this gap with the present study.

Methods

In this study we did a systematic review and modelling analysis to estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence and incidence of vitiligo. We did a comprehensive search of nine digital libraries (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scientific Electronic Library Online, KCI Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index, Western Pacific Region Index Medicus, Informit, and Health Research and Development Information Network) from inception up to May 25, 2023. We included cross-sectional or cohort studies reporting the incidence rate or prevalence of vitiligo, or data from which incidence rate or prevalence could be calculated, in the general population of a country or area of a country. Summary estimate data were extracted. A main outcome was to estimate the worldwide, regional, and country-specific lifetime prevalence of vitiligo diagnosed by physicians or dermatologists among the general population and in adults and children (as per age groups defined in included studies). We used a Bayesian hierarchical linear mixed model to estimate prevalence, and calculated number of affected individuals using the UN population structure in 2022. In estimating lifetime prevalence, studies reporting point or period prevalence were excluded. Our other main outcome was to estimate incidence rates of vitiligo, but due to a small number of studies, the data on incidence were presented in a descriptive summary. This study was registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023390433.

Findings

Our search identified 22192 records, of which 90 studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, six focused on the incidence of vitiligo, 79 reported on the prevalence of vitiligo, and five provided data on both incidence and prevalence. 71 studies reported on lifetime prevalence. In the most recent years studied, incidence rates in the general population ranged from 24.7 cases (95% CI 24.3–25.2) per 100000 person-years in South Korea in 2019, to 61.0 cases (60.6–61.4) in the USA in 2017. In individual studies, incidence rates showed an increasing trend over the periods studied. The global lifetime prevalence of vitiligo diagnosed by a physician or dermatologist was estimated at 0.36% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.24–0.54) in the general population (28.5 million people [95% CrI 18.9–42.6]), 0.67% (0.43–1.07) in the adult population (37.1 million adults [23.9–58.9]), and 0.24% (0.16–0.37) in the child population (5.8 million children [3.8–8.9]). Vitiligo prevalence was higher in adults than in children across all regions. Central Europe and south Asia reported the highest prevalence (0.52% [0.28–1.07] and 0.52% [0.33–0.82], respectively, in the general population).

Interpretation

This study highlights the need for standardised epidemiological data collection globally to inform public health policies and improve vitiligo diagnosis and management. Emphasis on the impact on individuals with darker skin tones is crucial to reducing stigma and improving quality of life. Furthermore, our study highlights the need to conduct more research in regions and populations that have been historically under-represented, to effectively address the worldwide burden of vitiligo.

### Enhancing awareness of vitiligoid vulvar lichen sclerosus: an underrecognized variant in patients with skin of color [^111Dr6er]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

VLS is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis commonly presenting with pruritus and atrophic pale plaques that may result in sequalae of scarring, architectural changes, dyspareunia, and increased risk of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. In skin of color, VLS may present with depigmentation rather than hypopigmentation or pallor thus mimicking vitiligo.VLS does not currently have a definitive pathogenesis but has supporting autoimmune etiology with a bimodal incidence in prepubescent girls and menopausal women. A diagnosis of VLS may be achieved based on clinical history however with diagnostic uncertainty or atypical features, histopathology should be performed for confirmation. Histologically confirmed VLS may include findings of epidermal hyperkeratosis, dermal sclerosis, and a band-like inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate within the dermis. Because of the risk of scarring and squamous cell carcinoma associated with VLS, it is imperative for physicians to recognize this variant to ensure effective long-term management.

In this case series, all 3 patients were presumed to have a diagnosis of VV and were started on treatment that resulted in refractory symptoms of pruritus of the vulva (Table I). All patients subsequently received a histopathologic confirmed and revised diagnosis of VVLS. Specifically, in the third case, a SOX10 stain was performed revealing a reduction of melanocytes supporting a clinicopathologic diagnosis of VVLS. VLS resembling vitiligo has previously been reported in the literature in patients with vitiligoid lesions with histologically proven lichen sclerosus. The coexistence of lichen sclerosus and vitiligo in some patients may be explained by both conditions being driven by autoimmune etiology. Further, it has been suspected that lichenoid inflammation may prompt an autoimmune response against melanocytes. In a review of 266 patients with lichen sclerosus and VV, 15 patients were found to have VVLS, 3 of which occurred in the genital area. Although not found to be the case in the patients presented above, the coexistence of VLS and VV may also be observed and should be considered should symptoms develop such as pruritus, sensitivity, and dyspareunia in a patient with a known diagnosis of vitiligo.

### Localized vitiligo occurring in an old biopsy scar: a case report [^114djova]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitiligo is a depigmentation disorder of the skin, hair, or mucosa, which reveals white macules or patches caused by destruction of pigment-producing melanocytes. A complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and self-destructive factors generates this form of response. An initiating environmental event such as severe sunburns is thought to cause substantial stress in an already susceptible melanocyte, which elicits an autoimmune response in genetically predisposed individuals.

Vitiligo's increased prevalence in immediate relatives has been established. Vitiligo affects 1% of the general population, whereas the risk of an affected patient's sibling and monozygotic twin for developing the disease is 6.1% and 23%, respectively. There is an increased risk of developing other autoimmune diseases as well, such as type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, and Addison disease. These frequencies suggest a nongenetic component plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease, in addition to a genetic predisposition.

Oxidative stress is an environmental risk factor that could play a role in causing vitiligo. Stress can result from overproduction of pro-oxidant species or creation of antioxidant chemicals via a reduction reaction. Melanocytes are constantly being exposed to stressors, including ultraviolet radiation and harmful chemicals and pathologic conditions such as inflammation and cancer, which increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Healthy melanocytes are capable of lessening these stressors, whereas melanocytes from patients with vitiligo are more vulnerable. Decreased catalase, a key enzyme that degrades hydrogen peroxide and catalyzes the creation of other antioxidant agents, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, protects melanocytes from self-destructive ROS. Decreased levels of catalase have been found in melanocytes of patients with vitiligo. This finding proposes a present oxidation-reduction defect involved in the disease. Studies found patients with vitiligo experience forms of stress, triggering the immune system to attack the body's own melanocytes.

The pathogenesis of role of the Koebner phenomenon in the development vitiligo is still unknown, but its presence has been established. It has been suggested that trauma to the skin may cause hydrogen peroxide to accumulate. This accumulation may cause proteins such as heat shock protein, that are designated to protect the cell from damage, to then become immunogenic, therefore eliciting an autoimmune response. Many people report first noticing their vitiligo after traumatic events, periods of stress, or severe sunburns. We report the case of localized vitiligo occurring in an old biopsy scar from 25 years prior.

### A rare case of extramammary paget disease in a young HIV-positive man [^113zE5No]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case report highlights a rare presentation of primary EMPD in a young, HIV-positive man. Paget disease does not demonstrate greater incidence in patients with HIV; however, severe immunodeficiency, as can be seen with AIDS, can be associated with unfavorable prognosis. To our knowledge, there has been 1 case report of EMPD in a 62-year-old, HIV-positive man in the literature. Similarly, the patient's HIV infection was well-controlled and immunosuppression was not considered to be a contributing factor.EMPD has been reported in a 23-year-old man with immunosuppression secondary to adalimumab for hidradenitis suppurativa. No clear association between viral infections and EMPD has been established, and EMPD has been infrequently reported in the setting of concomitant condyloma acuminata and HIV.

The diagnosis of EMPD is challenging owing to its rarity and clinical findings that may overlap with other entities such as eczema or intertrigo. Other differential diagnoses include leukoplakia, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, amelanotic superficial spreading melanoma, lichen sclerosus, inverse psoriasis, and vitiligo, especially for hypopigmented lesions. A high degree of suspicion is required when evaluating genital disease.

Treatment with wide local excision or MMS is often effective as subclinical disease and ill-defined borders are often present. One study reported a recurrence rate of 37.0% for wide local excision alone. However, recurrence rates ranging from 22% to 60% have also been reported for standard surgical treatments. Intraoperative IHC for CK7 during MMS has been shown to achieve the lowest local recurrence rates to date at 3.3% vs 25.9% for MMS without IHC. The patient described herein underwent MMS with IHC analysis for CK7 with complete resection and is being closely monitored. Although EMPD has rarely been reported in immunosuppressed and virally infected patients, whether these factors potentiate EMPD development has not yet been elucidated.

### Psychosocial effects of vitiligo: a systematic literature review [^114THhiS]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with vitiligo experience reduced quality of life.

Objective

To comprehensively describe the available evidence for psychosocial burden in vitiligo.

Methods

A systematic review of observational studies and clinical trials identified using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane databases was performed through 1 March, 2021, to assess psychosocial comorbidities in vitiligo. Two independent reviewers performed an assessment of articles and extracted data for qualitative synthesis.

Results

Included studies (N = 168) were published between 1979 and 1 March, 2021; 72.6% were published since 2010. Disorders including or related to depression (41 studies, 0.1–62.3%) and anxiety (20 studies, 1.9–67.9%) were the most commonly reported. The most prevalent psychosocial comorbidities were feelings of stigmatization (eight studies, 17.3–100%), adjustment disorders (12 studies, 4–93.9%), sleep disturbance (seven studies, 4.6–89.0%), relationship difficulties including sexual dysfunction (ten studies, 2.0–81.8%), and avoidance or restriction behavior (12.5–76%). The prevalence of most psychosocial comorbidities was significantly higher vs healthy individuals. Factors associated with a significantly higher burden included female sex, visible or genital lesions, age < 30 years (particularly adolescents), and greater body surface area involvement, among others. The most commonly reported patient coping strategy was lesion concealment.

Limitations

Available studies were heterogeneous and often had limited details; additionally, publication bias is possible.

Conclusions

The results of this systematic review show that vitiligo greatly affects psychosocial well-being. The extent of psychosocial comorbidities supports the use of multidisciplinary treatment strategies and education to address the vitiligo-associated burden of disease.
