## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating a 65-year-old woman with heart failure who presents with syncope, including differential diagnosis, risk stratification, workup, treatment, and disposition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true syncope and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation elements and what has already been done. Next, I will risk stratify using validated tools and guideline criteria. After that, I will build a prioritized differential and map it to the initial findings. Then, I should outline additional testing based on pretest probability and event frequency. Finally, I will determine management and disposition, including when to admit, when to use ambulatory monitoring, and how to counsel and follow up safely.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of syncope and exclude mimics. I need to ensure the event was transient loss of consciousness with rapid onset, short duration, spontaneous complete recovery, and loss of postural tone, while considering seizures, hypoglycemia, intoxication, and psychogenic events if the story does not fit classic syncope features, because misclassification can derail the entire workup and disposition plan [^112w51bx].

> Wait, let me verify the adequacy of the initial evaluation. Guidelines require a detailed history, physical examination including orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, and a 12-lead ECG for all patients with syncope, and I should confirm whether orthostatics were actually performed and whether the ECG was truly normal or just reportedly normal, since subtle conduction disease or ischemia can be missed and changes management [^114Ejmza] [^1135ZgVf] [^115nuxxu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk. I should double-check risk stratification because heart failure is a major short- and long-term risk factor even when vitals and initial labs are normal, and several validated rules flag heart failure, older age, and abnormal ECG as high-risk predictors of 7–30 day serious outcomes, so I need to apply SFSR, OESIL, or Martin/Multivariate scores carefully and document the risk category before deciding on disposition [^115KtJAU] [^116LgAPi] [^113onFZF].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis through the lens of heart failure and the initial data. Cardiac arrhythmias are the leading concern given HF, including bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, and conduction system disease, followed by structural HF progression with low output or dynamic obstruction, orthostatic hypotension from volume status or autonomic dysfunction, and pulmonary embolism which is not rare in older adults with first syncope, while vasovagal syncope remains possible but is less likely without a prodrome or clear trigger in this age group [^1114p5Hj] [^115KK1Qj] [^111zyEgp].

> Let me think about the immediate next steps. I should confirm orthostatic vitals if not done, repeat and overread the ECG for bundle branch block, PR interval, QT, and ischemia, and obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram because HF plus syncope warrants assessment of LV function, valves, and wall motion, even if the initial ECG is normal, since structural disease modifies arrhythmic risk and downstream testing choices [^112w51bx] [^114ouFJ2] [^111DkPHR].

> Next, I should review cardiac monitoring strategy based on event frequency. If events are frequent, a Holter or patch monitor can capture them, but if infrequent, an implantable loop recorder provides the highest diagnostic yield and has been shown to outperform conventional strategies in unexplained syncope, so I need to align the modality with symptom periodicity and pretest probability of arrhythmia [^1164KVes] [^112YUVoK] [^114JuJLc].

> But wait, what if I suspect pulmonary embolism? I should consider D-dimer and CT pulmonary angiography when risk factors or clinical features raise suspicion, because PE can present with syncope in older adults and is easy to miss if I do not maintain a high index of suspicion in the right context [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I am not over-ordering low-yield tests. Routine broad laboratory panels rarely change management in syncope, so I should avoid shotgun labs and instead target testing to suspected etiologies, and I should avoid routine cardiac imaging unless structural disease is suspected, which in this case it is due to HF, so echocardiography is appropriate while CT/MRI remain reserved for specific indications [^112c841Q] [^116utYHs] [^111CEZAT].

> Now, regarding disposition, I should confirm whether any high-risk features are present. Given HF and age ≥ 65, she meets short-term risk criteria, and even with normal vitals today, the safest course is admission for telemetry and expedited cardiac evaluation, because continuous ECG monitoring is indicated when cardiac etiology is suspected and inpatient workup can be coordinated efficiently [^115KtJAU] [^116RVmRH] [^112gaZh1].

> If, after careful reconsideration, there are truly no high-risk features, no red flags, a completely normal ECG, preserved LV function, and reliable follow-up, then discharge with close outpatient follow-up and ambulatory monitoring could be reasonable, but I should document shared decision-making and ensure timely access to cardiology within 1–2 weeks given her HF and age [^114JuJLc] [^113D41Xb].

> For inpatient management, I should initiate guideline-directed HF therapy optimization, review and adjust hypotensive medications that could worsen orthostasis or bradycardia, and treat reversible contributors such as volume status, electrolytes, and ischemia if present, while arranging echocardiography, ambulatory or implantable monitoring as indicated, and considering electrophysiology referral if conduction disease or sustained arrhythmias are suspected [^1144ZL4k] [^115wxatG] [^1158ZyYu].

> If vasovagal syncope ultimately emerges after excluding cardiac causes, I should confirm the diagnosis with tilt-table testing when the history is suggestive but not definitive, educate the patient on triggers and prognosis, teach physical counter-pressure maneuvers for prodromal symptoms, and consider midodrine or beta-blockers selectively based on age, comorbidities, and recurrence pattern, while avoiding agents that worsen HF or hypertension [^115yVG5W] [^114UbwVc] [^11792nHs] [^113uCbo4] [^1125tn33].

> I should double-check that the follow-up plan addresses recurrence risk. Patients with prior syncope have higher annual recurrence rates, so I will arrange cardiology follow-up within 1–2 weeks, consider a heart failure clinic referral, and if discharged, ensure ambulatory ECG monitoring is in place and that the patient has clear return precautions for chest pain, palpitations, exertional symptoms, or recurrent syncope [^11549Fyv] [^114JuJLc].

> In summary, I need to ensure we do not under-triage this 65-year-old with HF. Despite reassuring vitals and initial tests, she carries short-term risk for arrhythmic events, so admission for telemetry, echocardiography, and targeted ambulatory or implantable monitoring is the most defensible course, with management tailored to identified etiologies and disposition ultimately grounded in guideline-based risk stratification and shared decision-making [^115KtJAU] [^116RVmRH] [^111CEZAT] [^114JuJLc].

This 65-year-old woman with CHF and syncope has a **high-risk profile** despite normal initial tests, given her age and heart failure history [^115KtJAU]. The most likely causes are **arrhythmia or low cardiac output**, but vasovagal, orthostatic hypotension, pulmonary embolism, and neurologic causes remain possible [^114tk66j] [^1144SqAR] [^115KK1Qj] [^112w51bx]. She should be admitted for telemetry, echocardiography, and targeted labs; routine imaging or EPS is not indicated unless suggested by findings [^116RVmRH] [^114ouFJ2] [^113Z6TAD] [^1133TsdY]. Management is cause-specific: treat arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability, address orthostatic or vasovagal triggers, and consider anticoagulation if PE is suspected. Discharge is appropriate only if a low-risk cause is confirmed and reliable follow-up is ensured; otherwise, **admit for monitoring and specialist input**.

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Cardiac causes (high priority)

- **Arrhythmias**: Bradyarrhythmias (sinus node dysfunction, AV block) or tachyarrhythmias (AF, VT) are common in CHF and can cause syncope [^1144ZL4k].
- **Low cardiac output**: Progression of HF with reduced EF or acute decompensation can cause syncope.
- **Valvular disease**: Aortic stenosis or other structural disease can cause exertional syncope.
- **Pulmonary embolism**: Consider in CHF, especially with unexplained hypoxia or RV strain [^115KK1Qj].

---

### Non-cardiac causes

- **Vasovagal syncope**: Common but less likely without prodrome; still possible.
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Medications, volume status, or autonomic dysfunction.
- **Neurologic causes**: Seizure or TIA, though less likely without focal deficits.
- **Metabolic causes**: Hypoglycemia, electrolyte disturbances (less likely with normal BMP).

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Initial evaluation (completed)

Initial evaluation included a **history and physical examination** [^1135ZgVf] and a **12-lead ECG** [^115nuxxu]; CBC, BMP, and troponin were normal.

---

### Additional evaluation (indicated)

- **Telemetry monitoring**: Continuous ECG monitoring to detect arrhythmias [^116RVmRH].
- **Echocardiography**: Assess LV function, valves, and structural disease [^114ouFJ2].
- **Orthostatic vitals**: Measure BP/HR after 3 minutes supine, then after 1 and 3 minutes standing [^notfound].
- **Targeted labs**: BNP/NT-proBNP, TSH, and coagulation profile if PE suspected.
- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Holter or event monitor if arrhythmia suspected but not captured [^1164KVes].
- **Tilt-table testing**: If vasovagal or orthostatic hypotension suspected [^115yVG5W].

---

### Tests not routinely indicated

Avoid routine imaging (CT/MRI) unless cardiac etiology is suspected [^113Z6TAD] [^111CEZAT], and avoid **electrophysiology study** unless there is conduction disease or suspected arrhythmia [^1133TsdY].

---

## Management

### General principles

General principles include **admission for monitoring** given high-risk features (age > 60, CHF) [^115KtJAU] and **cause-specific therapy** directed by the identified etiology [^1144ZL4k].

---

### Specific interventions

| **Suspected etiology** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Arrhythmia | - Antiarrhythmic drugs <br/> - Pacemaker/ICD if indicated <br/> - Treat underlying CHF [^113SSWmZ] |
| Low cardiac output | - Optimize HF therapy <br/> - Consider inotropes if severe [^notfound] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | - Medication adjustment <br/> - Salt/fluid expansion <br/> - Compression stockings [^115wxatG] |
| Vasovagal syncope | - Education <br/> - Avoid triggers <br/> - Physical counter-maneuvers [^11792nHs] |
| Pulmonary embolism | - Anticoagulation <br/> - CT pulmonary angiography if indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Disposition

Admission is indicated for high-risk features (age > 60, CHF) or when an **unexplained etiology** requires monitoring and further workup [^115KtJAU]. Discharge is appropriate only for confirmed low-risk causes (e.g. vasovagal) with reliable follow-up and no red flags.

---

## Follow-up

Follow-up should include **cardiology follow-up** within 1–2 weeks and **patient education** on triggers, warning signs, and when to seek care [^114UbwVc].

---

This patient requires **admission for telemetry, echocardiography, and targeted labs** to clarify the cause of syncope, with management tailored to the identified etiology. Discharge is appropriate only if a low-risk cause is confirmed and reliable follow-up is ensured.

Syncope — management of specific conditions highlights that VVS is the most common cause of syncope in the general population and that treatment remains challenging in patients who have recurrences despite conservative therapy. Studies are needed to differentiate "arrhythmic syncope" versus "nonarrhythmic syncope" versus "aborted SCD" in patients with inheritable arrhythmic conditions, prospectively designed multicenter or national registries are needed to gather clinical information from patients with reflex syncope to better our understanding on other associated conditions, plausible mechanisms, effectiveness of therapeutic interventions, and natural history of these uncommon conditions, and RCTs are needed to continue the identification of effective treatment approaches to patients with recurrent reflex syncope.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^116AtuNe]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis and approach to the pregnant patient with syncope — recommendations emphasize initial core testing and targeted escalation. In pregnant patients presenting with syncope, a detailed history, physical examination (including orthostatic vitals), resting 12-lead ECG, and targeted blood testing should be performed at initial evaluation. Pregnant patients with new onset of unexplained syncope, especially if it occurs in the first trimester or recurs during pregnancy, are at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and should receive enhanced evaluation, including echocardiogram, followed by close periodic monitoring. Pregnant patients with syncope suspected to be of cardiac origin and/or due to suspected cardiovascular abnormalities after initial evaluation should undergo additional cardiac testing, including imaging, as clinically indicated in consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist with expertise in cardiovascular diseases in pregnancy. In pregnant patients with recurrent syncope unexplained after comprehensive noninvasive evaluation, including external monitor, insertion of an ICM is recommended. In pregnant patients presenting with clinical characteristics typical for reflex-mediated vasovagal syncope, a normal physical examination, and a normal resting 12-lead ECG at initial evaluation, further testing is not beneficial. In pregnant patients with unexplained syncope but without evidence of cardiac disease or conduction system disease, diagnostic electrophysiological study is not indicated.

Management of specific conditions in syncope states that although potential causes of syncope are multiple, a treatment decision is usually fairly straightforward for cardiac or orthostatic causes, and that vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most common cause in the general population. Treatment remains challenging in patients who have recurrences despite conservative therapy, and studies are needed to differentiate "arrhythmic syncope" versus "nonarrhythmic syncope" versus "aborted SCD" in patients with inheritable arrhythmic conditions. Prospectively designed multicenter or national registries are needed to gather clinical information from patients with reflex syncope, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to continue the identification of effective treatment approaches to patients with recurrent reflex syncope.

Electrocardiographic monitoring in syncope — position in the work-up: The role of ECG monitoring cannot be defined in isolation and physicians will be guided by the results of initial evaluation. When the clinical evidence strongly suggests reflex syncope and syncope occurs occasionally, ECG monitoring may be deemed unnecessary, whereas in those with frequent symptoms or suspected arrhythmic syncope who are not at high risk, an ILR can be useful. In a randomized comparison of 60 patients with unexplained syncope, a strategy of implantation of an ILR initially in the work-up was more likely to provide a diagnosis than the conventional strategy (52 vs. 20%), and patients at high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias as well as those with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35% were excluded.

Syncope evaluation with ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) — several guidelines, scores, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope have been published in the last decade. Most provide recommendations on the need for hospital admission and the nature of further diagnostic workup to identify or exclude high-risk causes of syncope, and a role for outpatient use of AECG can be offered as an alternative for low-risk patients who are often unnecessarily admitted. Symptom/rhythm correlation remains the cornerstone of the diagnostic efforts in syncope to confirm the involvement of the cardiac electrical system, and the choice of monitoring modality depends on the frequency of events.

Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and risk stratification — syncope: The initial evaluation of a patient presenting with T-LOC consists of "careful history, physical examination, including orthostatic BP measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG)". Based on these findings, additional examinations "may be performed", including "CSM in patients > 40 years", echocardiogram "when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause", "Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope", and "Orthostatic challenge (lying-to-standing orthostatic test and/or head-up tilt testing) when syncope is related to the standing position or there is a suspicion of a reflex mechanism"; "Other less specific tests such as neurological evaluation or blood tests are only indicated when there is suspicion of non-syncopal T-LOC". The initial evaluation "should answer three key questions" about whether the event is a syncopal episode, whether "the aetiological diagnosis" is determined, and whether "there are data suggestive of a high risk of cardiovascular events or death". For diagnosis of syncope, the following "should be answered": "Was LOC complete? Was LOC transient with rapid onset and short duration? Did the patient recover spontaneously, completely and without sequelae? Did the patient lose postural tone?" If all are positive there is a "high likelihood of being syncope"; if any are negative, "exclude other forms of LOC before proceeding with syncope evaluation". Initial evaluation "is able to define the cause of syncope in 23–50% of patients".

Blood testing in syncope — targeted blood tests are reasonable in the evaluation of selected patients with syncope identified on the basis of clinical assessment from history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Complete blood count and electrolyte panel are frequently obtained during syncope evaluation, the diagnostic yield is low when these are used routinely, and when conducted in patients with a suspected related diagnosis test results can be diagnostic and useful for guiding therapy. Specific testing should stem from the assessment by history and physical examination when the syncope presentation or comorbidities suggest a diagnostic or prognostic role, and results have not been linked to clinical decision making or outcomes.

Biomarker testing in suspected cardiac syncope — the usefulness of brain natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin measurement is uncertain in patients for whom a cardiac cause of syncope is suspected. Available data suggest natriuretic peptide is elevated when the subsequent cause for syncope is determined to be cardiac, contemporary troponin measurement has little value unless acute myocardial infarction is suspected, predictive value of high-sensitivity troponin and natriuretic peptides for major adverse cardiovascular events is modest, and the ability of these measurements to influence clinical decision making or patient outcome is unknown.

Secondary prevention algorithm — ischemic heart disease (IHD): Patients enter via "SCA survivor or sustained spontaneous monomorphic VT" and are evaluated for "Ischemia warranting revascularization?"; if present, proceed to "Revascularize & reassess Risk (Class I)"; if absent, management is implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). A syncope branch ("†History consistent with an arrhythmic etiology for syncope".) assesses "LVEF ≤ 35%" and "ICD candidate‡?"; ICD candidates receive ICD, whereas noncandidates receive guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT). An electrophysiology (EP) pathway ("EP indicates electrophysiological";) proceeds to an EP study; if "Inducible VA" leads to ICD, and if not, "Extended monitoring" is used.

Clinical implementation — Guideline-recommended management is effective only when followed by healthcare providers and patients, and adherence can be enhanced by shared decision making with patient engagement in selecting interventions based on individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities; guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment.

Syncope — structural cardiovascular disease mechanisms — Structural cardiovascular diseases can cause syncope when circulatory demands exceed the heart's ability to increase output, and syncope is of great concern when fixed or dynamic obstruction to left ventricular outflow is present. The faint may result from inadequate blood flow due to mechanical obstruction, but in several cases is not solely due to restricted cardiac output and may involve an inappropriate reflex, orthostatic hypotension, or arrhythmia (particularly atrial fibrillation), making mechanisms multifactorial. Recognizing the heart as the cause is justified to allow correction of the underlying structural disease when possible.

Cardiovascular testing in syncope — cardiovascular causes of syncope are common, the presence of significant cardiovascular diseases portends a poor prognosis, and cardiovascular testing can be a critical element in the evaluation and management of selected patients. Abnormalities found during cardiovascular testing may not have a causal relationship to syncope itself, and determining their significance, causality, and whether treatment is merited requires clinical judgment and appropriate selection of cardiovascular testing.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

Top 10 key takeaway points — presentations and biomarkers: Clinicians need to be aware of the 3 classic presentations of myocarditis: chest pain, heart failure (HF)/shock, and/or symptoms related to arrhythmia (eg, presyncope or syncope), and in a young person, the history of an antecedent viral infection, or other risk factors that define stage A at-risk for myocarditis, followed by any of these cardiovascular symptoms should raise the suspicion of this diagnosis. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) is a common diagnostic test in patients with suspected myocarditis; however, some patients with myocarditis will not have an elevated hs-cTn.
