## Question

How often to repeat DEXA scan in patients with osteoporosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often to repeat DEXA scans in patients with osteoporosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the clinical context and whether the patient is newly diagnosed or already on therapy. Then, I should verify baseline testing principles and measurement sites. Next, I will determine the initial monitoring interval after starting therapy and the rationale for that interval. After that, I should consider adjustments once BMD stabilizes and the concept of bisphosphonate holidays. Then, I need to review how therapy type and clinical risk factors modify the interval. I should confirm the least significant change (LSC) and quality-assurance requirements for valid comparisons. I will also examine special populations, and finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and summarize a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the timing of repeat DEXA hinges on whether this is an initial assessment for a new osteoporosis diagnosis or monitoring during treatment. For untreated postmenopausal women at low risk, repeat testing is not useful until at least 5 years unless rapid bone loss is anticipated, whereas patients on pharmacotherapy are generally monitored more frequently to ensure response and adherence [^112yHZ4U] [^117TWn8f].

> I need to check baseline testing principles next. Baseline DEXA should measure the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, and consider the 1/3 radius if spine/hip are not evaluable or in specific contexts like primary hyperparathyroidism or androgen deprivation therapy, and critically, all follow-up should ideally occur on the same instrument with the same protocol to minimize serial variability [^111PBdE6] [^112RyXE5] [^116ngQh9].

> Now, the initial monitoring interval after starting therapy: most high-credibility guidelines converge on repeating DEXA in 1 to 2 years, because changes in spine BMD can be detectable by 12 months and waiting longer risks missing nonresponse or nonadherence. I should double-check that AACE/ACE and NAMS align with Endocrine Society and ACOG, and yes, they consistently recommend 1–2 year intervals until stability is established [^1173qMNv] [^112SXJKg] [^113q6QQt].

> Hold on, I should verify why the 1–2 year interval makes physiologic sense. Age-related bone loss is roughly 0.5–1% per year off therapy, whereas anabolic and antiresorptive agents produce spine BMD gains on the order of several percent in the first 1–2 years, and with antiresorptives, changes at the total hip are often smaller and slower to emerge, supporting the choice of 1–2 years to capture clinically meaningful change without premature testing that could be confounded by measurement error [^1158cJwa] [^115YdXGM].

> Next, I should review adjustments once stability is achieved. If BMD is stable or increasing and there are no new fractures, guidelines allow extending the interval, with some recommending every 2–3 years or even up to 5 years in select cases, and for patients on bisphosphonates, reassessment at 5 years is often used to consider a drug holiday if risk is acceptable and BMD is stable, while maintaining vigilance for fractures and secondary causes [^113q6QQt] [^116ngQh9].

> But wait, what if therapy type or risk profile changes the cadence? I need to ensure I incorporate modifiers: anabolic therapy tends to show faster, larger spine gains, so monitoring at 1 year is reasonable to document response, while high-risk states such as ongoing glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, or androgen deprivation therapy justify shorter 1–2 year intervals or even annual checks, and incident fractures or new risk factors warrant earlier reassessment irrespective of the calendar schedule [^115YdXGM] [^113pSeNG] [^115ceMto].

> I should confirm the LSC and quality-assurance requirements, because interpretation of small changes is only valid if the facility has established its precision error and LSC. ISCD advises that meaningful change at the spine or hip should meet or exceed the center-specific LSC, typically around 5.3% for the lumbar spine and 5.0% for the total hip, and I need to ensure scans are performed on the same machine with the same acquisition and analysis parameters whenever possible to avoid calibration drift and false change [^113TdJGi] [^113FWFCD] [^116ngQh9].

> Let me consider special populations to avoid overgeneralization. Men follow similar principles with monitoring every 1–2 years initially and extending if stable, cancer patients on ADT generally merit annual DEXA while on therapy and a follow-up at 1 year after initiating antiresorptives, patients with inflammatory bowel disease on steroids warrant closer surveillance given rapid bone loss risk, and chronic kidney disease requires individualized decisions where BMD results will alter management and secondary hyperparathyroidism is common [^112Bk8M7] [^117MXcGs] [^111gbXD9] [^11493E5v].

> I should double-check screening-versus-monitoring distinctions to avoid conflating intervals. For untreated, low-risk postmenopausal women, repeat DEXA is typically not useful until at least 5 years, whereas once osteoporosis is diagnosed and treatment is started, monitoring every 1–2 years is appropriate until stability, and importantly, a subsequent T-score above −2.5 does not negate the original osteoporosis diagnosis, so monitoring remains necessary to track trajectory and safety [^112yHZ4U] [^114SEbR8] [^1173qMNv].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against the evidence: start with baseline axial DEXA at spine and hip, repeat at 1–2 years after initiating therapy, shorten to 1 year if anabolic therapy or high-risk conditions are present, extend to 2–3 years once BMD is stable for 2–3 cycles, consider a bisphosphonate holiday at 5 years if stable and risk is acceptable, and shorten any interval for new fractures, new glucocorticoids, or other major risk changes, always ensuring same-machine comparisons and LSC-aware interpretation [^1173qMNv] [^113q6QQt] [^115ceMto] [^113TdJGi].

> Final recommendation, keeping the nuances in mind: for patients with osteoporosis who are starting or changing therapy, repeat DEXA every 1–2 years until bone mineral density is stable, then extend to every 2–3 years if clinically stable, with shorter intervals for anabolic therapy, glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, incident fractures, or other accelerating risk factors, and always interpret changes in the context of the facility's least significant change and consistent measurement conditions [^1173qMNv] [^113q6QQt] [^115ceMto] [^113TdJGi].

---

Repeat DEXA scans every **1–2 years** [^1173qMNv] after initiating osteoporosis therapy until BMD is stable, then extend to **every 2–3 years** [^117EHujD] if risk remains low and therapy is unchanged. For high-risk patients (e.g. glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, ADT, anabolic therapy) [^115ceMto], **annual monitoring** is appropriate [^113pSeNG]. Always use the same DXA machine and interpret changes using the facility's least significant change (LSC) [^113FWFCD] to ensure accuracy [^113TdJGi]. Adjust intervals based on clinical changes, new fractures, or therapy modifications [^115ceMto].

---

## General recommendations for DEXA scan intervals

- **Initial monitoring**: After starting or changing osteoporosis therapy, repeat DEXA every 1–2 years [^1173qMNv] until BMD is stable [^112SXJKg].

- **Stable patients**: Once BMD is stable, extend intervals to every 2–3 years [^115YdXGM] if risk remains low and therapy is unchanged [^115ceMto].

- **High-risk patients**: For rapid bone loss or high-risk therapies (e.g. glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, ADT, anabolic therapy) [^115ceMto], annual DEXA is reasonable [^113pSeNG].

---

## Clinical scenarios influencing DEXA frequency

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dexa interval** |
|-|-|
| Initial osteoporosis therapy | Every 1–2 years until stable [^1173qMNv] |
| Stable BMD on therapy | Every 2–3 years [^notfound] |
| High-risk medications (glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, ADT) | Annually [^notfound] |
| Anabolic therapy (teriparatide, romosozumab) | Annually [^notfound] |
| Incident fracture or new risk factors | Repeat at 6–12 months [^notfound] |
| Bisphosphonate holiday | Repeat at 1–2 years after stopping [^notfound] |

---

## Technical considerations for accurate monitoring

- **Same facility and machine**: Use the same DXA system and technologist to minimize variability [^113FWFCD] [^1143zYuX].

- **Least significant change (LSC)**: Interpret changes using the facility's LSC [^113TdJGi]; only changes exceeding LSC are considered significant [^113TdJGi].

- **Quality assurance**: Ensure proper patient positioning, calibration, and adherence to ISCD best practices [^113FWFCD] [^112SXJKg].

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors

- **Age and comorbidities**: Older age, multiple comorbidities, or frequent falls may warrant closer monitoring [^115ceMto].

- **Medication adherence**: Poor adherence or intolerance may prompt earlier reassessment [^116bWiwC].

- **Secondary osteoporosis**: Identify and address secondary causes if BMD declines despite therapy [^116bWiwC].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial therapy**: Repeat DEXA every 1–2 years until BMD is stable [^1173qMNv].

- **Stable patients**: Extend to every 2–3 years if risk remains low [^115pmkTL].

- **High-risk patients**: Annual DEXA is appropriate [^117EHujD].

- **Clinical changes**: Adjust intervals based on new fractures, therapy changes, or new risk factors [^115ceMto].

---

DEXA intervals should be **individualized** based on risk, therapy, and clinical changes, with **1–2 years** typical after starting therapy and **2–3 years** once stable, using the same machine and LSC to guide interpretation [^113TdJGi].

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — monitoring of therapy: Obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and repeat DXA every 1 to 2 years until findings are stable, with continued follow-up DXA every 1 to 2 years or at a less frequent interval depending on clinical circumstances (Grade B; BEL 2).

### Disparities in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan utilization across race / ethnic groups before and after hip fractures [^111sEeZE]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a major health problem in the United States, with more than 11 million adults affected and 34 million at risk. This condition is characterized by microarchitectural bone resorption, decreased bone density, and bone fragility leading to susceptibility to fracture. Hip factures, in particular, are common fragility fractures that are associated with notable morbidity and mortality.

Detecting osteoporosis is crucial because the condition may be both preventable and treatable. The current standard diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis involve bone densitometry using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. As such, the US government has attempted to limit financial barriers to osteoporosis screening by declaring that Medicare will reimburse routine bone mineral density testing every 2 years.

Despite efforts to encourage assessing and managing bone density, osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed in the overall population, with disparities in screening rates between racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. The importance of identifying patients with osteoporosis before having a hip fragility fracture is crucial because hip fractures are associated with increased risk of mortality in the year after fracture. Furthermore, many efforts have been initiated to ensure bone density is assessed and managed after hip fracture to mitigate the risk of other osteoporotic-related fractures.

Although previous studies characterized disparities in overall DEXA scan utilization, no literature to our knowledge has specifically evaluated disparities in DEXA scan utilization before and after hip fragility fractures. Thus, using a large, national, administrative database, this study aimed to assess for potential race/ethnic disparities in DEXA scan utilization before and after hip fragility fractures.

Key points — postmenopausal osteoporosis assessment and monitoring state that bone mineral density (BMD) testing is indicated for all postmenopausal women with risk factors for low BMD or fracture, with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the preferred technique. For untreated postmenopausal women at low fracture risk, repeat DXA testing is not useful until at least 5 years have passed unless rapid bone loss is anticipated. Fracture risk is especially high in the first 2 years after an incident fracture, and the routine use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in the evaluation of patients with osteoporosis is not recommended.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115pmkTL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring in men — variability, least significant change, and intervals are described as follows: Stable or increasing BMD appears to indicate a good response, and in women with osteopenia the least significant change at the spine and hip is between 3 and 5% in the short term; in studies cited, spine BMD changes were greater than the least significant change in most men treated for 2 yr. Because whether change in BMD is a suitable surrogate for fracture risk reduction in men is unclear, it is noted that in women BMD response to treatment accounts for 4–41% of fracture risk reduction. When the expected rate of bone loss is slow (e.g. untreated men), it may be better to wait longer between measurements (e.g. 2–3 yr), and degenerative change in the spine in older men may falsely give the impression of a gain in BMD.

Repeat BMD and VFA measurements, clinical indications

Repeat BMD testing in combination with clinical assessment of fracture risk, bone turnover markers, if available, and other factors, including height loss and trabecular bone score, can be used to determine whether treatment should be initiated in untreated individuals. The BMD repeat testing interval depends on the overall clinical need as well as the baseline value. For example, a patient who is taking high dose glucocorticoids may lose bone much more rapidly, particularly in the setting of cancer and active rheumatoid arthritis. Those with low BMD and rapid loss are among those at greatest risk of fracture. On the other hand, less frequent assessment may be appropriate in older individulas. A US study of almost 5,000 postmenopausal women aged ≥ 67 years demonstrated that the average time to transition to a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) was 17 years for those with a T-score > -1.5, 5 years for women with T-score between − 1.50 and − 1.99, and 1 year for women with a T-score between − 2.0 and − 2.49) for 10% of the total population considered. These data provided some guidance on appropriate intervals for BMD testing in untreated individuals.

### No significant improvement in osteoporosis management of post-fragility fracture patients from 2010 to 2019: a national database study [^111TKS6Z]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

"Own the Bone" guidelines encourage physicians to prescribe bisphosphonates and order DEXA bone scans for all patients after first time fragility fractures. Yet, these data show that certain factors including age, sex, and comorbidities including tobacco use and obesity markedly influence how physicians devise their patient's treatment plan. Notably, these data found that women are 2 times likely to have DEXA bone scans ordered and about 2.5 times more likely to be prescribed bisphosphonates when compared with men. This puts men at a disadvantage in receiving proper screening and treatment for osteoporosis, putting them at added risk for future fragility fractures. In addition, these data revealed that older patients are less likely to obtain DEXA scans and diphosphonate prescriptions after first-time fragility fractures. This suggests that the older patient demographic that the AOA set out to serve with the "Own the Bone" program are at greater risk of not receiving proper osteoporosis screening.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115uHHNz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Bone health in prostate cancer — risk assessment and screening: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) increases the risk of bone loss, with risk exacerbated by more potent androgen suppression, longer duration of therapy or delayed testosterone recovery, and concurrent prednisone use. Fracture risk can be assessed using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), and when utilizing the FRAX algorithm select YES for secondary osteoporosis for individuals with hypogonadism; ADT should be considered "secondary osteoporosis". A previous major osteoporotic fracture is considered clinical osteoporosis and warrants bone antiresorptive drug therapy independent of bone mineral density. A baseline dual-energy x‑ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan should be obtained before starting ADT in patients at increased risk for fracture based on FRAX screening and being considered for antiresorptive therapy, whereas for low‑risk patients the baseline DEXA scan can be omitted. Because exact FRAX thresholds are not defined, one approach sets the threshold at 10‑year risk of a major osteoporotic fracture equal to that of a 65‑year old white women, defined as 8.4% in the United States.

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^1138p9fd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Screening for elevated osteoporotic fracture risk (Clinical question 2; Recommendations 2.1–2.2) — Patients with nonmetastatic cancer with one or more risk factors should be offered BMD testing with central/axial dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); where DXA is not available or technically feasible, other BMD testing such as quantitative ultrasound (QUS) or calcaneal DXA should be offered (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Patients who are prescribed a drug that causes bone loss or whose baseline or subsequent BMD is near the FRAX treatment threshold should be offered BMD testing every 2 years or more frequently if medically necessary based on BMD results and expected bone loss, and testing should generally not be conducted more than annually (Type: Expert Panel consensus; relative balance of benefits and harms; Evidence quality: insufficient).

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^113FWFCD]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Repeat BMD technical considerations

When possible, repeat BMD measurements should be conducted in the same facility with the same DXA system, same software, same scan mode, and same patient positioning and same hip and forearm to enable precise and accurate comparisons over time. Additionally, scans should be obtained at a facility with a skilled DXA technologist who has performed precision assessment. It is critical that both the initial and subsequent scans are of high quality and use the same protocol. Modern DXA systems include a 'copy' feature and other modifications to assist those performing and analyzing the scan to ensure that repeat scans are comparable to measurement parameters used in the previous scan. Quantitative BMD comparison with serial measurments is based on absolute BMD values in g/cm², and not T-scores or Z-scores. Each centre should calculate its own measurement (precision) error for each skeletal site using 30 duplicate or 15 triplicate scans from a representative group of patients in their practice. This value, known as the least significant change (LSC), is calculated with a 95% level of confidence as 2.77 × the precision error. The ISCD recommends evaluation of changes in BMD using absolute values, although reporting of changes is often expressed as percentages, which is easier for clinicians and patients to interpret [. When the precision error is 1%, the LSC is 2.8% and when the precision error is 2% the LSC is 5.6%.

### Bone mineral density – clinical use and application [^1154WP6y]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical application of bone densitometry has led to increased patient awareness of this increasingly prevalent disease. With bone densitometry, it is possible for clinicians to diagnose osteoporosis before the first fracture has occurred; predict risk for fracture in men, postmenopausal women, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids; and can be used as a surrogate marker to follow the efficacy of therapies and to examine those patients who might be osteoporosis-specific therapeutic non-responders.

### Incidence and predictors of repeat bone mineral densitometry: a longitudinal cohort study [^111HMxFu]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines for repeat screening and treatment monitoring intervals regarding the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are conflicting or lacking. The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends against repeating DXA scans within 2 years of initial screening. It is unclear how frequently physicians order repeat scans and what clinical factors contribute to their use.

Objective

To estimate cumulative incidence and predictors of repeat DXA for screening or treatment monitoring in a regional health system.

Design

Retrospective longitudinal cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5992 women aged 40–84 years who received initial DXA screening from 2006 to 2011 within a regional health system in Sacramento, CA.

Main Measures

Two- and five-year cumulative incidence and hazard rations (HR) of repeat DXA by initial screening result (classified into three groups: low or high risk of progression to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after initial DXA.

Key Results

Among women not treated after initial DXA, 2-year cumulative incidence for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women was 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after initial screening. For treated women, median time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups. Relative to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly predicted repeat screening for untreated women [adjusted HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.40–2.00)] but not within the treated group [HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91–1.30)].

Conclusions

Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of progression to osteoporosis, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. Conversely, only 60% of those at high-risk of progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years. Interventions are needed to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeat use of DXA scans.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and treatment: a review [^116tjUTF]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, defined as low bone mass leading to increased fracture risk, is a major health problem that affects approximately 10 million Americans. The aging U.S. population is predicted to contribute to as much as a 50% increase in prevalence by 2025. Although common, osteoporosis can be clinically silent, and without prevention and screening, the costs of osteoporotic fracture-related morbidity and mortality will burden the U.S. healthcare system. This is a particularly relevant concern in the context of diminishing health care resources. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most widely used, validated technique for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) and diagnosing osteoporosis. Cost-effectiveness analyses support early detection and treatment of high-risk patients with antiresorptive medications such as bisphosphonates. Moreover, optimization of bone health throughout life can help prevent osteoporosis. Current guidelines recommend screening women by age 65 years, but because no guidelines for screening intervals exist, decisions are made on the basis of clinical judgment alone. Although the recent literature provides some guidance, this review further explores current recommendations in light of newer evidence to provide more clarity on prevention, screening, and management strategies for patients with osteoporosis in the primary care setting.

### Association between screening for osteoporosis and the incidence of hip fracture [^112HqeWs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Because direct evidence for the effectiveness of screening is lacking, guidelines disagree on whether people should be screened for osteoporosis.

Objective

To determine whether population-based screening for osteoporosis in older adults is associated with fewer incident hip fractures than usual medical care.

Design

Nonconcurrent cohort study.

Setting

Population-based cohort enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) from 4 states (California, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and North Carolina).

Patients

3107 adults 65 years of age and older who attended their CHS study visits in 1994–1995.

Measurements

31 participant characteristics (including demographic characteristics, medical histories, medications, and physical examination findings) and incident hip fractures over 6 years of follow-up.

Intervention

Bone density scans (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] at the hip) for participants in California and Pennsylvania (n = 1422) and usual care for participants in Maryland and North Carolina (n = 1685).

Results

The incidence of hip fractures per 1000 person-years was 4.8 in the screened group and 8.2 in the usual care group. Screening was associated with a statistically significant lower hazard of hip fracture than usual care after adjustment for sex and propensity to be screened (Cox proportional hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.99]).

Limitations

The mechanism of the association was unclear. A small unmeasured confounder that decreased the hazard of hip fracture could diminish or erase the observed association.

Conclusions

Use of hip DEXA scans to screen for osteoporosis in older adults was associated with 36% fewer incident hip fractures over 6 years compared with usual medical care. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism of this association.

Bone mineral density measurement sites and techniques (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) — preferred and not recommended: DXA of the lumbar spine and proximal femur (hip) provides accurate and reproducible BMD measurements at important sites of osteoporosis-associated fracture, and optimally both hips should be initially measured; these axial sites are preferred over peripheral sites for both baseline and serial measurements, and the most reliable comparative results are obtained when the same instrument and, ideally, the same technologist are used for serial measurements at a high-quality DXA facility; diagnostic criteria, therapeutic studies, and cost-effectiveness data have been based primarily on DXA measurements of the total hip, femoral neck, and/or lumbar spine (L1 to L4) and are the preferred measurement sites, and the 1/3 radius can also be used as a diagnostic site particularly when other preferred sites are not available; use of other subregions within the proximal femur (i.e. Ward's triangle or trochanter) or of an individual vertebra has not been validated and is not recommended; several other techniques are available, and peripheral bone density measurements can identify patients at increased risk for fracture, but the diagnostic DXA criteria established by the WHO and recommended by AACE apply only to the axial measurements and distal 1/3 of the radius; thus, other technologies should not be used to diagnose osteoporosis but may be used to assess fracture risk.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115JDxFs]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to screening for osteoporosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor bone mineral density using DEXA in older patients with diabetes (aged ≥ 65 years) and younger patients with diabetes having several of the following risk factors every 2–3 years:

- frequent hypoglycemic events

- diabetes duration > 10 years

- diabetes medications, such as insulin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas

- hemoglibin A1C > 8%

- peripheral or autonomic neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy

- frequent falls

- corticosteroid use.

### Intervals between bone density testing [^111NvuRF]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

There is a wide range of practices regarding times between bone density (BMD) measurements in osteopenic women. If decisions to treat osteoporosis are to be based on absolute fracture risk, then projections of fracture risk are a logical basis for determining appropriate intervals for BMD testing. Fracture risk depends mainly on age and BMD, and bone loss in older women is relatively constant at ∼1% annually, so it is possible to project fracture risk into the future and estimate when an individual's risk will approach the threshold for intervention. Modeling scenarios for a range of osteopenic baseline BMDs in 65-year-old women shows a remarkable consistency in the doubling time for Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX)-assessed fracture risk: 5 to 6 years. This estimate is of immediate relevance to clinical practice in that it can be used to determine how long to wait before reassessing BMD and fracture risk in women whose other risk factors are stable.

### An audit on the assessment and management of osteoporosis in a Parkinson's and related diseases clinic in Australia [^114D9Hgo]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The current Australian guidelines do not specifically mention PD or how to incorporate the impact of the condition on screening for fracture risk. Despite their predisposition for osteoporosis and minimal trauma fractures in PD patients, previous audits have shown that around half of these patients do not have their bone health assessed following their specialist clinic appointment. Typically, such patients are reviewed by Neurologists and Geriatricians, suggesting that an interdisciplinary and integrated approach is required to improve osteoporosis and fracture risk management in these patients. Therefore, we conducted an audit to raise awareness of the fracture risk amongst patients in our clinic and as a scoping exercise to develop local PD specific guidelines.

Our study was impacted by the Australian guidelines changing during the period covered by this audit. Our standards were derived primarily from the 2024 RACGP osteoporosis guidelines with some influence from the 2017 guidelines. In the 2017 RACGP guidelines, the indications for a fracture risk assessment or DEXA scan varied by the strength of evidence to support their implementation, whereas the 2024 guidelines presented all recommendations equally. We chose to mainly adopt the 2024 practice guidelines and their associated grade of evidence. However, since the 2024 practice guidelines did not provide the strength of evidence for certain recommendations (for example, referring all patients over 70 years for a FRAX score), we made a judgement based on the level of evidence indicated in the 2017 guidelines. Regardless of this subtle change in emphasis of the revised RACGP guidelines, we believe that identifying current practice in the specialist clinic setting should help to improve future practice and highlight the need to refer patients with a high likelihood of fragility fracture for osteoporosis screening with their GP.

### GPs' perceptions of the role of DEXA scanning: an exploratory study [^1138psoc]. Family Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Current recommendation are that women with clinical indicators of low bone mineral density should be offered a DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometer) scan to help assess the need for treatment, but little is known about GPs' attitudes towards DEXA scans.

Objective

Our aim was to explore GPs' beliefs about diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, including the role that DEXA scanning can play.

Methods

Semi-structured interviews with five GPs in the North Staffordshire area were used to explore how GPs make decisions about diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, including the use of scans and the application of potential clinical risk factors to decisions about screening and treatment.

Results

The decision-making process about whether and who to scan is complex and was influenced by a range of factors including issues of diagnosis, treatment, patient pressure and 'external' factors such as practice protocol and the perceived local availability of scans.

Conclusions

GPs found it difficult to decide who and when to scan despite guidelines for primary care. Perceived local availability of DEXA scans is important and has implications for raising awareness.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^1158cJwa]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring: Serial BMD testing may be done to determine if or when to initiate treatment and to monitor the response; age-related bone loss occurs at an average rate of 0.5 to 1.0% per year, menopause-related bone loss begins 3 to 5 years before the last menstrual period and continues for 3 to 5 years after, occurring at 1 to 2% per year, and more rapid loss of 3 to 5% a year may occur in some women; one SD is about a 10% deviation from the young-adult mean, so a 10% bone loss will result in a decrease of about 1.0 T-score units, and serial monitoring is based on absolute BMD and not T-scores; for patients on treatment or near a fracture intervention threshold, BMD testing every 1 to 2 years is an option; in patients on treatment, stable or increasing BMD at the spine and hip indicates a satisfactory response, whereas if BMD decreases significantly, patients should be evaluated for noncompliance, secondary causes, or medications that might cause bone loss; facilities should determine their least significant change (LSC), with ISCD guidance of 30 patients in duplicate or 15 in triplicate, the LSC usually set at the 95% confidence limit for change, and if the difference exceeds the LSC the probability that it is real is greater than 95%.

### Reassessment intervals for transition from low to high fracture risk among adults older than 50 years [^114ZtR4K]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporosis is characterized by susceptibility to fracture, with substantial health consequences for the individual and society. Bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with fracture risk but has low sensitivity, with most fractures occurring above the threshold for osteoporosis diagnosis (≥ 2.5 SDs below peak bone mass; T-score, –2.5 or lower). Fracture risk prediction algorithms that incorporate clinical risk factors independent of BMD have been developed to target high-risk individuals for treatment. At present, the fracture risk assessment (FRAX) tool is the most widely used and has been incorporated into more than 100 clinical practice guidelines. The FRAX tool evaluates 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), defined as a composite of hip, clinical spine, distal forearm, and proximal humerus, and 10-year risk of hip fracture based on age, sex, body mass index, 7 additional clinical risk factors, and (optionally) femoral neck BMD. When used with BMD, the FRAX tool provides a higher sensitivity than BMD alone.

Repeated BMD testing is commonly performed, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeated tests within 2 years, a practice questioned by the Choosing Wisely campaign, speaking to the need for guidance to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeated BMD measurement. Studies examining BMD loss and transition to osteoporosis have provided insights into BMD testing intervals according to the level of baseline BMD. Subsequent analyses have evaluated time to reach clinically relevant fracture risk for those who fall below the treatment threshold at baselineand the doubling time in fracture risk, although these have not adequately considered baseline fracture risk relative to the treatment threshold, which would be expected to affect treatment eligibility. Specifically, one would expect a shorter interval for those just below the treatment threshold and a longer interval for those well below the treatment threshold. Change in clinical risk factors would also be expected to affect time to treatment qualification, with a shorter interval for those with new clinical risk factors and a longer interval for those with a reduction in clinical risk factors.

### How would you manage this patient with decreased bone density? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1118vKUh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal condition characterized by low bone mass and fragility resulting in an increased risk for fracture. It affects all bones, but fractures most often occur in the hip and spine. Osteoporosis is common in postmenopausal women, with estrogen deficiency thought to be a major contributing factor. Screening for osteoporosis with bone densitometry is recommended in all women 65 years of age or older and in postmenopausal women younger than 65 who are at increased risk. In 2023, the American College of Physicians published updated guidance on the pharmacologic treatment of osteoporosis. Among the recommendations was for clinicians to take an individualized approach regarding whether to start treatment with a bisphosphonate in women older than 65 years with osteopenia (a lesser degree of bone loss) to reduce the risk for fractures. Here, 2 bone endocrinologists debate how to manage a patient with both osteopenia and osteoporosis on bone densitometry. They discuss how to interpret and address these findings.

Objective

The purpose of this essay is a quick and comprehensive review of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the diagnosis of osteoporosis that shows how to achieve the best performance in three steps.

Conclusion

The three-step procedure for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry includes image acquisition emphasizing proper patient positioning and regions of interest; analysis, including areas to scan and detection of artifacts that should be excluded from the analysis and noted in the report because they can necessitate additional imaging; and interpretation of results.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^116ngQh9]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Statements based on IWG consensus:

DXA BMD measurement should be performed at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and, if indicated one-third radius.
Consider DXA in all women at the age ≥ 65 years, men age > 70 years, and women and men age ≥ 50 years with risk factors for osteoporosis (Table 4).
Evaluate for prevalent vertebral fractures with VFA or standard radiography in patients ≥ 50 years with specific risk factors, or with a T-score < -1.0 in older men and women, historical height loss > 4 cm, self-reported but undocumented vertebral fracture, or long-term glucocorticoid therapy (Table 5).
Consider DXA in younger adults (premenopausal women and men under 50 years) with specific diseases, and/or medical drugs and/or fracture.
Each DXA facility should determine its precision error and calculate the least significant change (LSC), to be repeated when a new DXA system is installed.
In accordance with the established WHO operational definition, osteoporosis is diagnosed based on a T-score of − 2.5 or lower in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or one-third radius. The lowest T-score at any of these measured sites should be used for diagnosis.
Some societies presumed a diagnosis of osteoporosis in the presence of low-trauma major fracture (hip, spine, forearm, humerus, pelvis).
The NHANES III reference database is recommended for T-score calculation and depending on the society based on 20–29 years aged White women or same sex-type.
Recommend follow-up DXA as indicated, depending on clinical circumstances.
Follow-up of patients should ideally be conducted in the same facility with the same DXA system, if the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to recommended standards.
The frequency of BMD testing in clinical practice may be influenced by the patient's clinical state, national clinical guidelines, cost and reimbursement. Suggested intervals between BMD testing are typically 1–5 years after starting or changing therapy.
Procedural certification and repeated audits are recommended.

Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring — postmenopausal osteoporosis: Ideally, BMD monitoring should occur at the same facility using the same dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine, the same technologist if possible, and the same regions of interest for spine and hip; the 1/3 radius site is acceptable when spine and hip sites are not evaluable, whereas other peripheral sites should not be used for monitoring. AACE recommends a repeat DXA 1 to 2 years after initiation of therapy until bone density is stable, with longer intervals between testing when there is continued BMD stability, and significant change is likely to occur earlier at the spine than at the hip. Skeletal status can also be examined by assessing asymptomatic vertebral fractures with repeat X-rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine or VFA.

### Addressing the needs of breast cancer survivors [^113g4qoJ]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Bone Mineral Density in Breast Cancer Survivors

Breast cancer treatments such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, chemotherapy, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) can contribute to bone loss and increase fracture risk. Clinical trials have shown that women taking anastrozole or exemestane experience greater bone mineral density (BMD) loss compared to those on tamoxifen. Meta-analyses of adjuvant trials further confirm that AIs significantly increase fracture risk relative to tamoxifen or placebo, with extended endocrine therapy duration correlating with higher risk. Given these risks, it is essential to assess BMD via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans at baseline and at regular intervals for women on long-term endocrine therapy [168]. While there are no formal guidelines on DEXA scan frequency, monitoring should be individualized to each patient based on baseline T-scores and additional osteoporosis risk factors. Bone targeted therapies can be instituted in women with BMD T-score ≤ −2.5 or between −1.0 and −2.5 with additional risk factors for fracture, or history of fragility fractures. Bone-targeted therapies, such as IV or oral bisphosphonates, are typically first-line due to their cost-effectiveness and established safety profile. However, denosumab is a suitable alternative for patients who cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or have contraindications. Potential side effects of bisphosphonates include flu-like symptoms, renal impairment, atypical femur fractures, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Notably, denosumab carries a risk of rebound fractures after discontinuation. The optimal duration of bone-protective therapy remains uncertain but should be tailored based on BMD trends, treatment response, and ongoing fracture risk.

Consider reducing the frequency of measurements if bone mineral density appears to reach a plateau. Consider obtaining a bone turnover marker at 3–6 months after initiation of treatment using a bone resorption marker (such as serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen or serum or urine N-telopeptide of type I collagen) for antiresorptive therapy and a bone formation marker (such as serum procollagen I N-propeptide) for anabolic therapy.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115kAF5B]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — bone health during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) — ADT was associated with a 21% to 54% relative increase in fracture risk, and bone mineral density of the hip and spine decreases by approximately 2% to 3% per year during initial therapy; in a population-based cohort of 3295 patients, surgical castration had a lower fracture risk than medical castration using an LHRH agonist (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.94; p = 0.01). A baseline bone mineral density study should be considered for the patients on ADT; the National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines include calcium (1000–1200 mg daily) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily), and additional treatment for males aged greater than or equal to 50 years with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) at specified sites and a 10-year probability of hip fracture greater than or equal to 3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-related fracture greater than or equal to 20%; fracture risk can be assessed using FRAX®, and ADT should be considered "secondary osteoporosis" using the FRAX® algorithm. Evidence includes a phase 3 study that randomized 1468 patients in which, at 24 months, denosumab increased bone mineral density by 6.7% and reduced fractures (1.5% vs. 3.9%) compared to placebo. When drug therapy is warranted by absolute fracture risk, treatment with denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), or alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) is recommended; a baseline DEXA before start of therapy and a follow-up DEXA after one year is recommended by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry; use of biochemical markers of bone turnover is not recommended, and there are no existing guidelines on the optimal frequency of vitamin D testing, but vitamin D levels can be measured when DEXA scans are obtained.

### Do guidelines matter? Implementation of the ACG and AGA osteoporosis screening guidelines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients who meet the guidelines' criteria [^114rnqZS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) have both recently issued guidelines (the "Guidelines") regarding the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study was to determine the yield of implementing the Guidelines' recommendations in a prospective cohort of IBD patients and identify the prevalence of bone loss, risk factors, and potential influence on management.

Methods

One hundred consecutive IBD patients who fulfilled the Guidelines' criteria underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning (DEXA) scanning of the lumbar vertebrae and bilateral hips. Demographic data, risk factor information, and changes in therapy based on screening were collected and analyzed.

Results

Indications for screening were history of prolonged past or concurrent steroid use (92%), postmenopausal status (7%), and history of low trauma fracture (7%). Forty-four percent of patients had osteopenia of either the lumbar spine or the hips, 12% had osteoporosis of either the spine or hips, and 44% had normal bone density. In a univariate analysis, factors predicting a greater likelihood of osteoporosis (but not osteopenia) were a diagnosis of Crohn's disease (vs. ulcerative colitis), low body mass index in women, and postmenopausal status. Specific therapies based on DEXA findings were initiated in 69% of patients: oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation in 69% and an oral bisphoshphonate in 20%.

Conclusions

Implementation of the Guidelines led to the detection of osteopenia or osteoporosis and initiation of specific therapies in a majority of patients who met the Guidelines' criteria for DEXA screening.

### Fracture prevention in COPD patients; a clinical 5-step approach [^113C5tfH]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations and future research directions

In COPD patients, there are no guidelines available on the necessity or frequency of serial DXA scanning and vertebral fracture assessments. Graat-Verboom and collegues studied the incidence of osteoporosis during 3 years follow-up. The prevalence of osteoporosis increased from 47% to 61% in 3 years. The increase in osteoporosis was mostly due to newly diagnosed vertebral fractures. In addition, osteopenia at the hip seemed to be a predictor of osteoporosis. Based on their data, Graat-Verboom and colleagues advised to perform vertebral fracture assessments in all COPD patients every year and to perform DXA scanning in patients with osteopenia at the hip every 3 years. Since this is the only longitudinal evaluation of osteoporosis in COPD patients, additional research is necessary to provide guidelines on the necessity and frequency of serial DXA scanning and vertebral fracture assessments.

Although the 5-step clinical approach for fracture prevention has been based on the current literature on osteoporosis in COPD, it has not been validated yet. Therefore, future research should be focussed on algorithms to identify COPD patients at high risk of fracture and beneficial effects of anti-fracture therapy in COPD patients.

### An audit on the assessment and management of osteoporosis in a Parkinson's and related diseases clinic in Australia [^114f3Cy1]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In March 2024, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) updated their practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing osteoporosis, revising their previous advice published in 2017. The 2024 guidelines first recommend that a general practitioner (GP) should assess fracture risk in all patients over the age of 50, identifying both non-modifiable and lifestyle risk factors using a tool such as FRAX. These risk factors include age over 70 years, history of multiple falls, poor balance, and immobility. The guidelines further suggest that patients over 50 years with a prior minimal trauma fracture, on certain medications (e.g. prolonged higher dose glucocorticoids, androgen deprivation therapy, aromatase inhibitors), or patients with certain diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, coeliac disease) should have a DEXA scan to objectively evaluate their BMD every 1–2 years. Patients who have already sustained a minimal trauma fracture of the hip or vertebra have a presumptive diagnosis of osteoporosis and can be started on medication without a DEXA scan. The degree of osteopenia is also an important factor that should encourage closer monitoring of fracture risk. The guidelines also make recommendations for general bone health. They state that all patients should be encouraged to exercise, ideally with resistance or weight bearing exercises. Frail or institutionalised individuals should have their vitamin D and calcium levels optimised, and their dietary intake and sun exposure should be monitored, with supplements provided if insufficient. There is insufficient evidence to recommend supplements to otherwise healthy individuals.

### Use of a peripheral dexa measurement for osteoporosis screening [^111i3DeS]. Family Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Osteoporosis is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. While screening for this disease is important, few studies have evaluated the role of an osteoporosis screening device in afamily practice setting. This study evaluated the influence of a peripheral-dexa (p-dexa) heel bone mineral density (BMD) measurement and a patient education program on changes in pharmacologic treatment for suspected osteopenia or osteoporosis by primary care physicians over a 1-year follow-up.

Methods

Using a computerized database (ages 50 to 75 years), 1,927 women were identified. An invitation was mailed to register for a screening to have a p-dexa heel BMD scan done and to attend an osteoporosis prevention presentation. Medication history, age, height, weight, and risk factors for osteoporosis were collected. A follow-up chart review was carried out on women who werefound to have heel BMD T-scores of < -.6 (suggested by the World Health Organization). Date of menopause onset, pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis, calcium, vitamin D, and physician intervention were assessed.

Results

There were 292 women (15.2%) who self registered, obtained BMD testing, and attended an educational program. Of these women, 87 (30%) had at least one risk factor for osteoporosis, in addition to menopause. Mean BMD was .489 ± .113 gm/cm² (normal > .42 gm/cm²). A post-screening chart review was completed in 102 women (36.6%) at greatest risk for osteoporosis based on a T-score < -.6. Following the intervention, 26 women were started on antiresorptive therapy (primarily estrogen), and three additional women had a second antiresorptive agent added to estrogen.

Conclusions

### Reproducibility of bone mineral density measurement in daily practice [^111U41Sd]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements are frequently performed repeatedly for each patient. Subsequent BMD measurements allow reproducibility to be assessed.

Objective

To examine the reproducibility of BMD by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) and to investigate the practical value of different measures of reproducibility in a group of postmenopausal women.

Methods

Ninety five women, mean age 59.9 years, underwent two subsequent BMD measurements of spine and hip. Reproducibility was expressed as smallest detectable difference (SDD), coefficient of variation (CV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Sources of variation were investigated by multilevel analysis.

Results

The median interval between measurements was 0 days (range 0–45). The mean difference (SD) between the measurements (g/cm²) was -0.001 (0.02) and -0.0004 (0.02) at L1–4 and the total hip, respectively. At L1–4 and the total hip, SDD (g/cm²) was ± 0.05 and ± 0.04 and CV (%) was 1.92 and 1.59, respectively. The ICC at spine and hip was 0.99.

Conclusions

Reproducibility in the postmenopausal women studied was good. In a repeated DXA scan a BMD change exceeding 2√2 × CV (%), the least significant change (LSC), or the SDD should be regarded as significant. Use of the SDD is preferable to use of the CV and LSC (%) because of its independence from BMD and its expression in absolute units. Expressed as SDD, a BMD change of at least ± 0.05 g/cm² at L1–4 and ± 0.04 g/cm² at the total hip should be considered significant.

Bone mineral density measurements — potential uses in postmenopausal women include screening for osteoporosis, establishing the severity of osteoporosis or bone loss in patients with suspected osteoporosis, determining fracture risk especially when combined with other risk factors for fractures, and identifying candidates for pharmacologic intervention; additional uses include assessing changes in bone density over time in treated and untreated patients, enhancing acceptance of and perhaps adherence with treatment, and assessing skeletal consequences of diseases, conditions, or medications known to cause bone loss.

### Bone densitometry and the diagnosis of osteoporosis [^1135NFgC]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, bone density scanning has come to be seen as an essential part of the evaluation of patients at risk of osteoporosis. Although dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the technique most associated with the recent growth in bone densitometry, several innovative devices for performing measurements at sites in the peripheral skeleton are also available. This article examines the question of whether there is any one method or measurement site that performs better than all the others at identifying patients at risk of fracture. Given that it is essential to make greater use of the small, low-cost peripheral devices if the many millions of women most at risk are to be identified and treated, what approaches to the interpretation of bone density scans can be adopted to ensure the greatest degree of consistency among different methods? Finally, does it matter if the imperfect correlation among different types of measurement results in different patients being selected for treatment on the basis of different techniques?

Follow-up

The aim of follow-up in patients with osteoporosis risk factors is to identify those candidates who need to start or maintain specific treatments. For such patients and those with an established osteoporosis diagnosis, follow-up should be continued as long as risk factors persist or while treatment is maintained with calcium and/or vitamin D 3, BPs or other medications for osteoporosis.

Clinical, radiological and analytical parameters should be monitored. Assessing the number of fragility fractures and pain episodes is important. In terms of densitometry, variations in Z-scores are relevant. The optimal frequency for DXA performance is insufficiently defined. Our recommendation is to repeat DXA after one year, and then every 1–2 year thereafter according to the patient's trajectory, with a minimum interval between checks of 6–12 months.

It is also crucial to perform a radiological assessment of VF, since they are frequently asymptomatic and can appear even in patients with Z-scores higher than -2. Moreover, their evolution can lead to changes in treatment. There are no studies that have definitively determined how often VF should be monitored, although some authors propose lateral spine x-rays on an annual or biannual basis. We propose their frequency be individualized according to the patient's risk factors, with a minimum period of 6 months and a maximum period of 2 years.

In addition, no studies or guidelines have established the optimal periodicity for assessing phosphocalcic metabolism. Our recommendation is to make an analytical determination on an annual basis.

In regard to patients receiving calcium and vitamin D supplementation, since the optimal intake for children and adolescents suffering from chronic diseases is unknown, doses should be modified according to calciuria and plasmatic levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 and iPTH. The optimal frequency for monitoring these parameters is unknown, although some authors advocate that determinations should be made every 3–12 months. Our working group recommends that levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 should be determined every 6–12 months, or after 3–6 months after a dose change. Furthermore, an annual determination of calciuria is recommended. A renal ultrasound should be conducted to rule out nephrocalcinosis in the event of calciuria increase, or when urine collection is not possible.

Regarding children being treated with BPs, there are no studies that have determined an optimal frequency for analytical checks. Our group recommends monitorization prior to each infusion for patients receiving intravenous BPs, and every 6 months for patients taking BPs orally.

Vertebral fracture assessment and lateral spine imaging — indications and thresholds: Vertebral fracture is the most common osteoporotic fracture and indicates a high risk for future fractures, and Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can often be done at the same time with DXA; lateral spine imaging with standard radiography or VFA with DXA is indicated when T-score is less than −1.0 and one or more of the following is present: women aged ≥ 70 years or men aged ≥ 80 years, historical height loss > 4 cm (> 1.5 in), self-reported but undocumented prior vertebral fracture, or glucocorticoid therapy equivalent to ≥ 5 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day for ≥ 3 months. In patients with unexplained height loss or back pain, thoracic and lumbar spine radiography or VFA by DXA is indicated if prevalent vertebral fractures would alter clinical management; although these thresholds for height loss have > 90% specificity, the sensitivity and reliability of standard radiography are poor, and if fracture is diagnosed by VFA, then additional imaging should be done to confirm the impression of fracture.

Oral PrEP bone health — trial findings and monitoring guidance indicate that decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed in HIV-infected persons treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, but it is unclear whether this 3%-4% decline would be seen in HIV-uninfected persons on PrEP; in trials evaluating F/TDF or TDF, a small (~1%) BMD decline during the first few months of PrEP either stabilized or returned to normal, with no increase in fragility fractures over the 1–2 years of observation; in the DISCOVER DEXA substudy, men randomized to F/TAF showed slight mean percentage increases in BMD at the hip and spine through 96 weeks while men randomized to F/TDF showed mild decreases, and there was no difference in fracture frequency with 91% of fractures related to trauma; therefore, DEXA scans or other assessments of bone health are not recommended before PrEP initiation or for monitoring while taking PrEP, and persons with a history of pathologic or fragility fractures or significant risk factors for osteoporosis should be referred for appropriate consultation and management.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine β-synthase deficiency [^116HPVhz]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, especially of the spine, is the most consistent skeletal abnormality. In the largest review, 70% of untreated pyridoxine-unresponsive patients developed spinal osteoporosis by 16 years of age (Mudd et al). This may, however, be an overestimate as osteoporosis was not defined according to current criteria (ISCD, 2013). Spinal osteoporosis also occurs in many pyridoxine responsive cases, usually at a later age (Mudd et al). Early diagnosis and effective treatment reduce the risk of osteoporosis (Yap and Naughten; Lim and Lee).

Osteoporosis may lead to vertebral collapse (Schimke et al; Brenton) and scoliosis, though the latter has also been reported in the absence of osteoporosis. DEXA scanning should routinely be performed every 3–5 years from adolescence unless there is a clinical indication to do this earlier (such as recurrent fractures). Due to the sensitivity of the test, there is little point in repeating this more frequently than every 2 years. In patients with reduced bone mineral density, it is particularly important to check vitamin D status and dietary calcium intake and to encourage weight-bearing exercise.

Cardiovascular complications and interventions (statement #32: grade of recommendation C-D)

Venous thromboembolic complications are common in untreated or poorly controlled CBS deficiency. In untreated pyridoxine unresponsive patients, the risk may be as high as 50% by 30 years of age. The frequency in pyridoxine responders is unknown. It may be the first and only sign of CBS deficiency. Early diagnosis and lifelong treatment with good biochemical control can prevent this complication. Prevention of dehydration is important. Patients who are poorly controlled or have had a vascular event may warrant additional treatment with anti-platelet drugs or anticoagulants, according to local guidelines.

Vascular complications are common in untreated or poorly controlled CBS deficiency and include venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis. Venous thrombosis is the more common. In the largest published series of untreated patients, 50% of the vascular complications were deep venous thrombosis (a quarter of which were associated with pulmonary embolism); stroke (including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) comprised 32% of the vascular complications, peripheral arterial disease 11% and myocardial infarction only 4% (Mudd et al).

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — monitoring and follow-up: Bone mineral density (BMD) testing should be repeated 1 to 2 years after beginning osteoporosis therapy, with patients on bisphosphonates reassessed again at 5 years to determine whether a bisphosphonate holiday would be considered; routine use of bone turnover markers is not recommended and follow-up contact by an office nurse may be the most effective means to enhance adherence; depending on treatment, an appropriate interval for repeat BMD testing is 1 to 2 years after beginning treatment or when a change in therapy is considered, and initial dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and follow-up scans should ideally be performed on the same instrument using the same procedure, with careful attention to DXA quality control; if progressive loss of BMD or fractures occur on therapy, evaluate for reasons for suboptimal response, even when treatment increases T-score values above −2.5 ongoing management is required, and referral to bone specialists is recommended for women with very low T-scores, inadequate treatment response, or additional factors requiring special management.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^115YdXGM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up VFA or radiographic lateral spine imaging should be used in patients with continued high risk [e.g. historical height loss > 4 cm (> 1.5 inches)], self-reported but undocumented vertebral fracture, or glucocorticoid therapy equivalent to ≥ 5 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day for greater than or equal to three months).

When used to monitor the effects of treatment, the frequency of BMD measurements should be guided by a number of factors, including the therapy used, availability of resources, national guidelines and reimbursement policies, and the clinical site being measured. Changes are generally greater at the lumbar spine than total hip and greater for osteoanabolic therapy than antiresorptive therapy. These data suggest the most likely result will be 'no change' for non-anabolic treatments if a DXA scan is repeated within 2–3 years from the beginning of anti-resorptive therapy. In addition, an incident fragility fracture while on treatment is generally regarded as an indication for bone densitometry. Based on the ISCD minimum acceptable LSC of 5% for the total hip and 5.3% for the lumbar spine, significant changes in BMD are unlikely to be seen before 3 years in individuals treated with most anti-resorptive drugs but may be evident in the LS after one year with anabolic therapies.

### Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in clinical practice: new guidelines and concerns [^111YkDtu]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent policy and guideline updates that have significant consequences for the clinical use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and, thus, the prevention of fractures and associated morbidity and mortality.

Recent Findings

Recent policy trends have sought to reverse reimbursement declines for DXA services, whereas updated guidelines have attempted to restrict the candidates for bone density testing. Recent literature reflects the ongoing controversy of repeat DXA testing.

Summary

Patient access to DXA scans has been threatened by declining reimbursement and, therefore, access to diagnosis and fracture prevention. There have been successful efforts to reverse this trend, but the future remains uncertain. The complexities and omissions of updated guidelines for obtaining DXA testing may serve again to restrict initial access, and the recent controversy of repeat DXA testing may make monitoring results of therapy more difficult.

### Perioperative bone mineral density assessment in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^1147sqsj]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Despite American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines that recommend bone mineral density (BMD) assessment via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for PHPT patients, adherence to these guidelines remains suboptimal.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of preoperative and postoperative DEXA scan practices among PHPT patients at a single academic medical center between 2000 and 2018. Patient data, including demographics and history of bone pathology, was analyzed to identify factors influencing adherence to BMD assessment guidelines.

Results

Of the 3384 PHPT patients evaluated for surgery, only 45.4% (n = 1535) underwent preoperative DEXA scan. Women were significantly more likely to undergo preoperative DEXA than men (49.9% versus 29.0%, P < 0.001). Female sex, age ≥ 65 y, and a history of bone pain or fractures were significant positive predictors of preoperative DEXA scan. Of patients with 2-y follow-up who did not receive a preoperative DEXA (n = 145), only 13.8% (n = 20) received a postoperative DEXA.

Conclusions

This study highlights gaps in the adherence to national guidelines for DEXA screening among PHPT patients. This underscreening may contribute to increased morbidity due to unidentified osteoporosis. Efforts must be made to improve clinical practice and bring it into line with best practice as recommended by national guidelines.

### Osteoporosis: what are the implications of DEXA scanning' high risk' women in primary care? [^113TgD4m]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Current recommended practice for the use of dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans in screening for osteoporosis is to concentrate on women at 'high risk'.

Objective

We have applied such a screening strategy, in a general practice setting, to estimate the number of women requiring scans.

Methods

A two-phase survey was carried out: (i). postal screen of clinical indicators for low bone mineral density (BMD) to define women at 'high risk'; and (ii). DEXA scanning of the sample at 'high risk' set in two general practices in North Staffordshire. Computerized general practice records were used to define a purposive sample of 1001 women, to receive the screening tool, consisting of three equal size groups (i). those with an early hysterectomy; (ii). those receiving oral corticosteroids on repeat prescription; and (iii). those on the practice cervical smear register. A random sample of women defined at 'high risk' by the screening tool were invited to have a DEXA scan. The main outcome of interest was the presence of low BMD as measured by a DEXA scanner.

Results

Sixty-five out of 95 women invited (68%) agreed to undergo a DEXA scan: median age = 52 years (interquartile range 44–64 years). Twenty-nine of these 65 women (45%) were classified with low BMD (WHO criteria): 90% had densities below their age-matched mean. Extrapolating from the observed findings to the main study practice (n = 9000 total population), we estimate that 162 women would be defined at 'high risk', and, if all were offered a scan, 105 would comply and 56 would be defined with low BMD.

Conclusions

Using this approach, we estimate the unmet need, in women, for DEXA scans to be 180 per 10000 total practice population. Allowing for scan uptake, this would define approximately 60 women per 10000 total practice population with low BMD. The application of this screening strategy has identified a group of women who might benefit from treatment or prophylaxis for osteoporosis.

3.4.5 Bone health

Patients with MMA and PA are at risk of low bone density and osteoporosis, 128, 202, 203 which may be aggravated by kidney dysfunction in MMA. Risk factors for low bone density and osteoporosis in MMA and PA patients can include chronic acidosis (causing osteoclast activation and osteoblast inhibition), impaired kidney function and inadequate dietary intake of calcium, phosphate and vitamin D. Further it has been hypothesised, that the application of amino acid supplements can decrease bone mineralisation, as it increases the load of extracted acids, leading to buffering of protons in the bone tissue and increased bone resorption. 122 Optimisation of calcium and phosphate intake and vitamin D supplementation might be beneficial for bone health.

The time and frequency of assessment of bone health in MMA and PA should be guided by the risk of the individual patient. If bone density measurements (dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scans) are applied in growing children and adolescents, they should be combined with assessment of bone age (and pubertal status) for adequate interpretation of the results. Osteoporosis can only be diagnosed in the presence of clinically significant fracture history, which has only been scarcely observed in MMA and PA. 204 In patients with renal failure, the diagnosis of osteoporosis should only be made in the absence of renal osteodystrophy.

For osteopenia or osteoporosis, treatment decisions need to be individualised, integrating parameters of bone metabolism, including secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic renal failure. Once the diagnosis of osteoporosis is established, treatment should follow common recommendations. Antiresorptive drugs (eg, bisphosphonates) may be indicated in patients at increased risk for fractures with relevant bone loss documented in serial DEXA measurements despite optimisation of nutritional support. The role of antiresorptive drugs for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis has not been systematically studied in MMA and PA patients.

### Monitoring treatment for osteoporosis by using bone densitometry [^115NuNMt]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

In recent years, the range of treatments available for patients with osteoporosis has greatly increased. A decade ago, the only proven therapy was estrogen, but today the choices include bisphosphonates, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone. Clinical trials involving bone mineral density (BMD) scans of the spine and femur have had an important role in the evaluation of these new therapies. In particular, the efficacy of treatments has now been verified in large studies powered to show reductions in fracture risk. In contrast with the use of BMD scans in research studies, their value for monitoring response to treatment in individual patients is less certain. In many cases, the increases in BMD are too small to reliably distinguish between true changes and measurement error. However, experience with estrogen and bisphosphonates suggests that these treatments have a beneficial effect on bone in most patients. Follow-up scans for patients taking these agents are therefore of limited value, apart from offering reassurance to the patient and the doctor. However, when new therapies are first introduced, follow-up scans have a useful role in building up the physician's experience and confidence.

Therapy response and compliance — nonresponder considerations in osteoporosis: The definition of a "nonresponder" to therapy is complex and varies by therapy, and it is reasonable that a patient with significant bone loss or one or more new fragility fractures be evaluated for compliance, secondary causes of bone loss, and new medications or diseases that can cause bone loss. The change in BMD accounts for < 20% of the fracture risk reduction following antiresorptive therapy, and although BMD monitoring might improve patient compliance, adherence to therapy usually occurs early (after 6 to 7 months), before the second BMD would be performed.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to regard stable or increasing bone mineral density with no evidence of new fractures or vertebral fracture progression as a response to therapy for osteoporosis. (Grade A; BEL 1) Consider obtaining bone turnover markers for the assessment of patient compliance and efficacy of therapy. Consider targeting bone turnover markers at or below the median value for premenopausal females for response to therapy in patients receiving antiresorptive therapy, recognizing that significant reductions in bone turnover markers are seen with antiresorptive therapy and have been associated with fracture reduction. Regard significant increases in bone formation markers as a pharmacologic response to anabolic therapy. Consider initiating alternative therapy or reassessing for causes of secondary osteoporosis in patients having recurrent fractures or significant bone loss while on therapy. Recognize that a single fracture while on therapy is not necessarily evidence of treatment failure. Regard ≥ 2 fragility fractures as evidence of treatment failure. (Grade B; BEL 1).

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^115ceMto]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The latest ISCD 2023 update adds the following:
Follow-up BMD testing can aid in monitoring response to therapy.
Follow-up BMD testing should be undertaken with clearly defined objectives and when the results are likely to influence patient management.
Follow-up BMD testing should be performed if a fracture has occurred or new risk factors have developed, but should not delay treatment for secondary fracture prevention.
Repeat BMD testing should be used to monitor individuals prior to a temporary cessation of bisphosphonate therapy and during the period of planned interruption of treatment.
Repeat BMD testing intervals must be individualized considering an individual's age, baseline BMD, the type of pharmacological treatment, and the presence of clinical factors which are associated with bone loss.
Shorter intervals between BMD testing may be indicated in the presence of factors associated with rapid change in bone mineral density. Examples include the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, and osteoanabolic therapies, medical disorders such as malabsorption and severe systemic inflammatory diseases, and other conditions such as prolonged immobilization, bariatric surgery, and surgical menopause.
If changes in BMD are outside the expected range for an individual patient and adequate scan quality has been confirmed, this should prompt consideration for a re-evaluation of the patient and plan of care.
A DXA report (baseline and follow-up) should state that a follow-up exam is recommended as long as a valid comparison is available, and the precise timing depends particular clinical circumstances.
If the DXA interpreter has adequate clinical information, a precise timing for the next BMD should be recommended; otherwise, a general recommendation about repeat testing should still be part of the report.

### Long-term and sequential treatment for osteoporosis [^1146SmKU]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder that causes impairment of bone structure and strength, leading to a progressively increased risk of fragility fractures. The global prevalence of osteoporosis is increasing in the ageing population. Owing to the chronic character of osteoporosis, years or even decades of preventive measures or therapy are required. The long-term use of bone-specific pharmacological treatment options, including antiresorptive and/or osteoanabolic approaches, has raised concerns around adverse effects or potential rebound phenomena after treatment discontinuation. Imaging options, risk scores and the assessment of bone turnover during initiation and monitoring of such therapies could help to inform individualized treatment strategies. Combination therapies are currently used less often than 'sequential' treatments. However, all patients with osteoporosis, including those with secondary and rare causes of osteoporosis, as well as specific patient populations (for example, young adults, men and pregnant women) require new approaches for long-term therapy and disease monitoring. New pathophysiological aspects of bone metabolism might therefore help to inform and revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis.

Bone mineral density (BMD) testing — indications and role note that testing of BMD is useful for screening and monitoring therapy in people at high risk for osteoporosis if evidence of bone loss would result in modification of therapy, with examples including postmenopausal women, patients with hyperparathyroidism or other bone disorders, and those being treated with medications associated with bone loss (e.g., glucocorticoids). A list of indications for BMD testing is shown in Table 10. Testing of BMD is the gold standard in diagnosing osteoporosis; however, not everyone has access to BMD.

Reported transition times vary by baseline BMD and age, ranging from almost 17 years for 10% of women with normal baseline BMD to about 5 years for women with a baseline T score in the −1.50 to −1.99 range.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^113TdJGi]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

When using DXA to monitor BMD over time at the lumbar spine and total hip, only changes which meet or exceed the LSC should be considered significant and noted as such. The ISCD recommends that the maximal acceptable LSC for a technologist is 5.0% for the total hip and 5.3% for the lumbar spine. In clinical practice, the absolute change in BMD in gm/cm² is preferred over % change for LSC. Given variability in machines and systems from one imaging center to the next, the LSC from the manufacturer should not be used without confirmation. Similarly, a change in BMD between instruments that are not cross-calibrated cannot be reliably reported since it is not possible to know if BMD has actually changed, or if the change is solely due to measurement error in the absence of knowledge of the LSC. Finally, if a patient has a known diagnosis of osteoporosis based on prior imaging, a follow-up scan does not change the original diagnosis. Rather, the repeated imaging is used to monitor changes in BMD over time. Even if T-scores improve to > -2.5, the diagnosis of osteoporosis is durable. Preferable patients should return to the same DXA machine that was used to perform their most recent prior study, provided that the facility in vivo precision and LSC values are known and do not exceed established maximum values.

Alternatively, a DXA machine of one manufacturer enables comparison by using conversion factor for different machine. See also part IV, Clinical Indications.

- frequent hypoglycemic events

- diabetes duration > 10 years

- diabetes medications, such as insulin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas

### Can hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons help address the osteoporosis epidemic? [^116hWZeb]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a known, modifiable risk factor for lower extremity periprosthetic fractures. Unfortunately, a high percentage of patients at risk of osteoporosis who undergo THA or TKA do not receive routine screening and treatment for osteoporosis, but there is insufficient information determining the proportion of patients undergoing THA and TKA who should be screened and their implant-related complications.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What proportion of patients in a large database who underwent THA or TKA met the criteria for osteoporosis screening? (2) What proportion of these patients received a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) study before arthroplasty? (3) What was the 5-year cumulative incidence of fragility fracture or periprosthetic fracture after arthroplasty of those at high risk compared with those at low risk of osteoporosis?

Methods

Between January 2010 and October 2021, 710,097 and 1,353,218 patients who underwent THA and TKA, respectively, were captured in the Mariner dataset of the PearlDiver database. We used this dataset because it longitudinally tracks patients across a variety of insurance providers throughout the United States to provide generalizable data. Patients at least 50 years old with at least 2 years of follow-up were included, and patients with a diagnosis of malignancy and fracture-indicated total joint arthroplasty were excluded. Based on this initial criterion, 60% (425,005) of THAs and 66% (897,664) of TKAs were eligible. A further 11% (44,739) of THAs and 11% (102,463) of TKAs were excluded because of a prior diagnosis of or treatment for osteoporosis, leaving 54% (380,266) of THAs and 59% (795,201) of TKAs for analysis. Patients at high risk of osteoporosis were filtered using demographic and comorbidity information provided by the database and defined by national guidelines. The proportion of patients at high risk of osteoporosis who underwent osteoporosis screening via DEXA scan within 3 years was observed, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of periprosthetic fractures and fragility fracture was compared between the high-risk and low-risk cohorts.

Results

In total, 53% (201,450) and 55% (439,982) of patients who underwent THA and TKA, respectively, were considered at high risk of osteoporosis. Of these patients, 12% (24,898 of 201,450) and 13% (57,022 of 439,982) of patients who underwent THA and TKA, respectively, received a preoperative DEXA scan. Within 5 years, patients at high risk of osteoporosis undergoing THA and TKA had a higher cumulative incidence of fragility fractures (THA: HR 2.1 [95% CI 1.9 to 2.2]; TKA: HR 1.8 [95% CI 1.7 to 1.9]) and periprosthetic fractures (THA: HR 1.7 [95% CI 1.5 to 1.8]; TKA: HR 1.6 [95% CI 1.4 to 1.7]) than those at low risk (p < 0.001 for all).

Conclusion

We attribute the higher rates of fragility and periprosthetic fractures in those at high risk compared with those at low risk to an occult diagnosis of osteoporosis. Hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons can help reduce the incidence and burden of these osteoporosis-related complications by initiating screening and subsequently referring patients to bone health specialists for treatment. Future studies might investigate the proportion of osteoporosis in patients at high risk of having the condition, develop and evaluate practical bone health screening and treatment algorithms for hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons, and observe the cost-effectiveness of implementing these algorithms.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^116PgqMj]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

The UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG), advocates a more proactive approach(summarised in figure 3) than previous AIH guidelines to preserving bone health. Prior to starting steroids, they recommend calculating the 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture or 'FRAX' score, available online. The score is an algorithm incorporating parameters associated with fracture risk: age, gender, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, personal or parental fracture history, comorbidities such as rheumatoid arthritis and corticosteroid use.

Figure 3
Summary of suggested bone health strategy for patients on steroids.

The score has very high, high, intermediate and low-risk categories, all age-dependent. In very high- or high-risk patients, NOGG recommend starting bisphosphonates along with corticosteroids, rather than awaiting the DEXA scan result. Patients at intermediate risk should have a DEXA scan soon after starting corticosteroids. The scan result is then integrated to give a modified FRAX score. If there is delay (> 6 months) in performing a DEXA scan, proactive bisphosphonate should be considered. If the FRAX score is in the low-risk category, neither DEXA nor bisphosphonates are needed.

An alternative approach to bone health is detailed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Network, which uses QF fracture, another online fracture risk estimator.

It remains unclear how this proactive approach to bone protection can be incorporated into management of patients with AIH. Capacity will be centre-specific and additional resources/infrastructure might be required.

Before starting bisphosphonates, patients need advice about potential adverse effects. Intravenous preparations are preferred in patients with oesophageal varices and in those developing AEs with oral bisphosphonates.

Rare but serious AEs of bisphosphonates include osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ, 1 event per 10 000–100 000 patient-year, when given for osteoporosis)and atypical femoral fractures (AFF; 1.7-fold increase, one event per 30 000 patient-years). Over the first few years of bisphosphonate use, ONJ and AFF numbers are 10–100-fold lower than estimated number of fractures per year saved in high-risk patients. Thereafter, the relative advantages of bisphosphonates might diminish, underlying the importance of steroid withdrawal, when possible, with the potential for also stopping bisphosphonates.

### How would you manage this patient with osteoporosis? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113Dhr5S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength that increases the risk for fracture. Approximately 10 million men and women in the United States have osteoporosis, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually. In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists issued the "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", and in 2017, the American College of Physicians issued the guideline "Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fracture in Men and Women". Both guidelines agree that patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated with an antiresorptive agent, such as alendronate, that has been shown to reduce hip and vertebral fractures. However, there is no consensus on how long patients with osteoporosis should be treated and whether bone density should be monitored during and after the treatment period. In this Beyond the Guidelines, 2 experts discuss management of osteoporosis in general and for a specific patient, the role of bone density monitoring during and after a 5-year course of alendronate, and treatment recommendations for a patient whose bone density decreases during or after a 5-year course of alendronate.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring bone mineral density by DEXA at the spine and hip every 1–3 years to assess the response to treatment in postmenopausal patients with a low bone mineral density and at high risk of fractures being treated for osteoporosis.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^115Tut4n]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

The kyphoplasty cohort was queried to identify patients who had documentation of a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan or had been prescribed osteoporosis medications within 2 years and 1 day before the kyphoplasty procedure. This subgroup comprised patients who had received osteoporosis intervention prior to kyphoplasty.

The patients in the kyphoplasty cohort who were not screened or treated for osteoporosis in the 2 years prior to the procedure were categorized as the treatment-naïve cohort. This cutoff was chosen as bisphosphonates, the osteoporosis medication with the longest acting residual benefit, has been demonstrated to reduce fracture risk for up to two years after being stopped. Furthermore, regarding DEXA screening, it is generally recommended that individuals diagnosed with osteoporosis or at high risk for fractures undergo repeat scans every 1–2 years, as outlined by current guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology Physicians. An additional query was conducted within the treatment-naïve cohort to identify patients who had a DEXA scan or had been prescribed osteoporosis medications within 1 year after their kyphoplasty procedure. The patients that met this criterion formed the follow-up osteoporosis intervention cohort. The treatment-naïve patients who did not receive osteoporosis intervention after their kyphoplasty procedure were classified as the no osteoporosis intervention cohort. (Figure 1) Patient counts and demographics were recorded for each cohort. Additionally, the treatment and treatment naive cohorts were queried a second time to identify any patients who underwent additional kyphoplasty procedures or had subsequent non-vertebral fractures more than 3 months after their initial kyphoplasty.

All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel version 16.77.1 (2023). Chi-square testing was used for categorical variables, with statistical significance defined as P < .05. Confidence intervals were set at 95% for odds ratio calculations assessing non-vertebral fracture incidence across patient cohorts with varying levels of osteoporosis evaluation and/or treatment.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that if the initial diagnosis of osteoporosis is made according to a T-score ≤ 2.5, the diagnosis persists even when a subsequent DEXA measurement shows a T-score > -2.5. (Grade B; BEL 4) Consider diagnosing osteoporosis in patients with a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 and increased fracture risk using FRAX country-specific thresholds.

Components of the final DXA report

The final DXA and VFA reports should follow a standard template and may include recommendations on additional diagnostic work-up (e.g. radiograph of the spine, evaluation of secondary causes of osteoporosis) and indications for treatment. See Tables 2 and 3 and the ISCD website.

Table 2
Components of DXA report

Table 3
Components of VFA report

Overall, inadequate awareness and knowledge of potential pitfalls and nonadherence to the ISCD Official Positions in DXA interpretation may lead to inaccuracies in BMD readings. Aiming to reduce reporting errors, a DXA interpretation template based on ISCD recommendations has been developed. Implementing a DXA reporting template may reduce major errors, shorten reporting time and improve report quality.

DXA Reporting:

The acquisition of non-dominant/left hip or is appropriate to generate data for reporting T-scores (or Z-scores).
When both hips have been scanned, the lowest T-score (or Z-score) of the right or left femoral neck or total hip should be used for diagnostic classification, but not the mean T-score (or Z-score).
When both hips have been scanned on repeat tests, mean bilateral total hip BMD should be used for monitoring.
Preferred terminology is to use "hip" when describing the site instead of " femur" or "total proximal femur". Use "bilateral hips" when referring to both hips.

### Bone mineral density: clinical relevance and quantitative assessment [^115XJKUb]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is an internationally accepted standard-of-care screening tool used to assess fragility-fracture risk. Society guidelines have recommended which populations may benefit from DXA screening and the use of the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) to guide decisions regarding pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis. According to the U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, postmenopausal women and men at least 50 y old with osteopenic BMD warrant pharmacologic treatment if they have a FRAX-calculated 10-y probability of at least 3% for hip fracture or at least 20% for major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with osteoporosis defined by a clinical event, namely a fragility fracture, or with an osteoporotic BMD should also be treated. Patients who are treated for osteoporosis should be monitored regularly to track expected gains in BMD by serial DXA scans. With some drug therapies, BMD targets can be reached whereby further improvements in BMD are not associated with further reductions in fracture risk. Although reaching this target might suggest a stopping point for therapy, the reversibility of most treatments for osteoporosis, except for the bisphosphonates, has dampened enthusiasm for this approach. In the case of denosumab, it is now apparent that stopping therapy at any point can lead to an increase in multiple-fracture risk. For patients who do not respond to antiosteoporosis pharmacologic therapy with an improvement in BMD, or who have an incident fragility fracture on therapy, secondary causes of osteoporosis or non-compliance with medical therapy should be considered.
