## Question

Chest pain need ECG

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when an ECG is needed in the evaluation of chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about differentiating acute versus stable presentations and the implications for ECG timing. Then, I should verify the "ECG within 10 minutes" rule for acute chest pain. Next, I will assess how to handle atypical presentations without chest pain. After that, I need to outline initial ECG interpretation and when to treat as STEMI, including a self-check on the "new LBBB" issue. Then, I will consider the limited sensitivity of a single ECG and when to order serial ECGs and posterior leads. I also need to integrate troponin testing and risk scores, verify outpatient/stable strategies when ECG access is limited, and remember special populations and alternative life-threatening diagnoses before concluding with a pragmatic summary algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the clinical setting because urgency hinges on whether chest pain is acute (ED/urgent care/prehospital) versus stable (outpatient), and the terminology should avoid "atypical" in favor of cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac descriptors to reduce misclassification risk [^1138NxxB] [^111o6SQd].

> Now, I should verify the 10‑minute rule for acute presentations: obtain and review a 12‑lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival for all patients with acute chest pain, and this applies even if the pain has abated by the time of evaluation because early ECG drives time‑critical reperfusion decisions [^1153HSRz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if there is no chest pain at triage. I need to check for high‑risk equivalents such as dyspnea, syncope, palpitations, nausea/diaphoresis in older adults and women because 20–30% of STEMI patients do not report chest pain, and they still warrant an immediate ECG to avoid missed reperfusion opportunities [^113XrEK6] [^1153HSRz].

> For the initial ECG interpretation, I will now examine whether it is diagnostic for STEMI and would normally say "ST‑elevation or new LBBB equals activation", but wait, let me verify that nuance because "new LBBB" alone is no longer considered a STEMI equivalent by itself in contemporary guidance and requires careful assessment rather than automatic cath activation, whereas clear STEMI patterns should trigger immediate reperfusion pathways and guideline‑directed management for suspected ACS [^1138NxxB] [^115vaFyJ].

> If the first ECG is nondiagnostic, I should confirm that this does not exclude ACS because single‑time ECG sensitivity is modest, and I need to consider serial ECGs and supplemental posterior leads V7–V9 if posterior MI is suspected to improve detection of evolving ischemia [^112nk8UR] [^1138NxxB] [^112oLt2d].

> Hmm, wait a minute, a normal ECG still does not rule out ACS, so I need to ensure integration with troponin testing and risk stratification, recognizing that patients with prior CAD can have substantial event rates despite normal initial ECG and troponin, which means downstream testing and observation may still be indicated based on overall risk [^113KSMuF] [^1138NxxB].

> Next, I should review when to repeat ECGs: order serial ECGs when the initial is nondiagnostic and clinical suspicion remains high, symptoms are ongoing or recurrent, hemodynamics worsen, or troponin becomes abnormal, with early repeating at roughly 15–30 minute intervals initially and with any clinical change to catch dynamic ischemic evolution [^1138NxxB].

> For stable chest pain in the outpatient setting, let me first confirm that a resting 12‑lead ECG should be obtained unless a clearly noncardiac cause is evident, and if an ECG cannot be performed promptly in clinic, the safer course is referral to the ED for ECG rather than deferring, since a normal ECG still does not rule out ischemia and subsequent testing depends on risk [^111BXFna] [^114MSTvt].

> I should double‑check the troponin strategy integrated with ECG. High‑sensitivity cardiac troponin is preferred and should be obtained as soon as possible, with serial testing at 1–3 hours when indicated, and in selected patients with symptoms ≥ 3 hours and a normal ECG, a single very low hs‑cTn below the assay's limit of detection may exclude MI safely, while a nonischemic ECG plus hs‑cTn < 5 ng/L provides an approximately 99.7% NPV for 30‑day MI or cardiac death, facilitating safe discharge in appropriate contexts [^1114sRZk] [^116HMycA] [^115Tpq6A] [^114r7B1D] [^1152jeop].

> I need to ensure risk stratification is not done in isolation. Incorporating ECG findings and hs‑cTn into validated tools such as the HEART pathway supports disposition decisions, improves communication through decision aids, and may require age‑aware caution in older adults who present atypically yet benefit from structured pathways [^114G1CRn] [^1119ytAY] [^111ps5CD].

> But wait, what if the patient is post‑CABG or otherwise complex. I should confirm that any chest pain in post‑CABG patients warrants an ECG and careful comparison to prior tracings, with a lower threshold for additional testing given baseline abnormalities and guideline pathways for subsequent imaging or angiography if ischemia is suspected despite nondiagnostic ECGs [^113PKYqe] [^111AEqhz].

> I will now examine alternative life‑threatening diagnoses because an ECG is essential but not sufficient. If PE or acute aortic syndrome is on the table, pretest probability should guide CTA for PE or advanced imaging for aortic pathology, and chest radiography can rapidly evaluate other thoracic causes in the undifferentiated acute chest pain presentation alongside the ECG [^111zogSw] [^112V1nFT] [^113qZiMH].

> Summarizing my decision flow, I need to ensure the following: in any acute chest pain or equivalent, get an ECG within 10 minutes, activate reperfusion for diagnostic STEMI patterns while remembering that "new LBBB" alone is not automatically STEMI, do serial ECGs when suspicion persists despite a nondiagnostic tracing, integrate hs‑cTn pathways and risk scores to determine observation versus safe discharge, and in stable chest pain obtain an ECG or refer for prompt ECG if unavailable, all while considering alternative critical diagnoses based on the clinical picture [^1153HSRz] [^1138NxxB] [^1114sRZk] [^1152jeop] [^111BXFna] [^111zogSw].

All patients with chest pain should have a **12-lead ECG within 10 minutes** of arrival [^1153HSRz] to rapidly identify STEMI [^1153HSRz] and guide urgent management [^1138NxxB]. If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic but suspicion for ACS remains, **repeat ECGs every 15–30 minutes** or with symptom changes [^1138NxxB]. For stable chest pain in the office, obtain an ECG unless a clear non-cardiac cause is evident; if ECG is unavailable, refer to the ED [^111BXFna]. Early ECG is essential for timely diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of ACS [^1138NxxB].

## Indications for ECG in chest pain

### Acute chest pain

- **Immediate ECG**: Obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival for all acute chest pain to detect STEMI and guide urgent care [^1153HSRz] [^111qDY1T].

- **Serial ECGs**: If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic but suspicion for ACS remains, repeat ECGs every 15–30 minutes or with symptom changes [^1138NxxB].

- **Posterior MI**: Use supplemental leads V7–V9 when posterior MI is suspected and the initial ECG is nondiagnostic [^112oLt2d].

---

### Stable chest pain

For stable chest pain, obtain an **office ECG** unless a clear non-cardiac cause is identified [^111BXFna] [^114MSTvt]. If an ECG is unavailable, **ED referral** is recommended [^111BXFna].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring immediate ECG

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Acute chest pain | Rapid STEMI detection and urgent management [^1153HSRz] [^111qDY1T] |
| Persistent or recurrent chest pain | Detect dynamic ischemic changes [^1138NxxB] [^112Ne7Kf] |
| High suspicion of ACS with nondiagnostic initial ECG | Identify evolving ischemia [^1138NxxB] [^112Zsapb] |
| Suspected posterior MI | Detect posterior ischemia [^112oLt2d] |
| Stable chest pain without clear non-cardiac cause | Identify underlying cardiac pathology [^111BXFna] [^114MSTvt] |

---

## Role of ECG in risk stratification and management

In this context, **risk stratification** uses ECG findings to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk for ACS and to guide subsequent testing and care [^112Zsapb]. Management decisions are directed by **ECG results**, including reperfusion for STEMI and further evaluation for NSTEMI/unstable angina [^115vaFyJ] [^1152jeop].

---

ECG in chest pain evaluation has important limitations, including **false negatives** when early or transient ischemia does not appear on the initial tracing, particularly when ECGs are recorded during pain-free intervals [^112Ne7Kf]. False positives can occur because non-ischemic conditions such as pericarditis and electrolyte abnormalities may mimic ischemia [^115yRM7o]. Accurate interpretation is operator dependent and requires clinical experience and appropriate clinical context [^113w7PPN].

---

## Additional diagnostic tests and clinical assessments

- **High-sensitivity troponin**: Preferred biomarker for rapid detection or exclusion of myocardial injury [^1152jeop] [^1114sRZk].

- **Serial troponin measurements**: Identify rising or falling patterns indicative of acute myocardial injury [^114gKMeQ] [^115Tpq6A].

- **Clinical risk scores**: Use HEART or CAD Consortium 2 to guide further testing [^114G1CRn] [^111ps5CD].

- **Imaging**: Consider stress testing, coronary CTA, or echocardiography based on risk and clinical context [^1177vooc] [^111ZNHfZ] [^111teFcj].

---

Not performing an ECG in chest pain patients can delay diagnosis, including missed STEMI or NSTEMI, which leads to worse outcomes. Delays increase **morbidity and mortality** by postponing appropriate treatment [^113rCJkh]. Failure to obtain an ECG may also result in medicolegal consequences [^114EVwNi].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines include the **AHA/ACC 2021 guidelines**, advising ECG within 10 minutes for acute chest pain and serial ECGs when indicated [^1153HSRz] [^1138NxxB], and the **ESC 2024 guidelines**, recommending a resting ECG for all chest pain unless a clear non-cardiac cause is identified [^114MSTvt].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Immediate ECG**: Obtain within 10 minutes for acute chest pain [^1153HSRz].

- **Serial ECGs**: Repeat when initial ECG is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains [^1138NxxB].

- **Stable chest pain**: Obtain ECG unless a clear non-cardiac cause is identified [^111BXFna] [^114MSTvt].

- **Additional testing**: Use troponin, risk scores, and imaging as indicated [^1114sRZk] [^114G1CRn] [^1177vooc].

---

ECG is essential in chest pain evaluation for **rapid diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of ACS**. Early ECG improves outcomes and reduces adverse events.

### Emergency department chest pain patients with or without ongoing pain: Characteristics, outcome, and diagnostic value of the electrocardiogram [^112nk8UR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In emergency department (ED) chest pain patients, it is believed that the diagnostic accuracy of the electrocardiogram (ECG) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is higher during ongoing than abated chest pain.

- **Objectives**: We compared patient characteristics and the diagnostic performance of the ECG in ED patients presenting with ongoing vs. abated chest pain.

- **Methods**: In total, 1132 unselected ED chest pain patients were analyzed. The patient characteristics and diagnostic accuracy for index visit ACS of the emergency physicians' interpretation of the ECG were compared in patients with and without ongoing chest pain. Logistic regression analysis was performed to control for possible confounders.

- **Results**: Patients with abated chest pain (n = 508) were older, had more comorbidities, and had double the risk of index visit ACS (15%) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days (15.6%) compared with patients with ongoing pain (n = 631; ACS 7.3%, 30-day MACE 7.4%). The sensitivity of the ECG for ACS was 24% in patients with ongoing pain and 35% in those without pain; specificity was 97% in both groups. Negative predictive value was 94% and 89%, respectively, and positive likelihood ratio was 10.6 and 7.8, respectively. When the diagnostic performance was controlled for confounders, there was no significant difference between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: Our results indicate that ED chest pain patients with ongoing pain at arrival are younger, healthier, and have less ACS and 30-day MACE than patients with abated pain, but that there is no difference in the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG between the two groups.

### Role of imaging for acute chest pain syndromes [^113VVfHK]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain suggestive of ischemic cardiac origin, with a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram and negative initial cardiac markers for myocardial necrosis, represents a significant diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. Multiple imaging modalities play a pivotal role in the early diagnosis and safe discharge of these patients. In this review, we compare the imaging modalities available for these patients, including their diagnostic accuracy, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. Acute rest myocardial perfusion imaging significantly improves the clinical outcome in these patients and reduces the overall cost when incorporated into the decision-making pathway. The choice of imaging modality recommended should be based on local institutional expertise and the overall clinical presentation. The imaging modality with high diagnostic accuracy and negative predictive value will provide for precise risk stratification, which is important to clinical decision-making, including determining which patients require admission to the hospital and which can be safely discharged.

### Do all heart scores beat the same: Evaluating the interoperator reliability of the HEART Score [^1178hGKt]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin (HEART) Score has become a popular chest pain risk stratification tool in the emergency medicine community. It offers a simple, structured, and practical approach to chest pain risk stratification. With its five parameters, the HEART Score enables emergency physicians to assess the 30-day risk of developing a major adverse cardiac event. This scoring system was developed and validated in an emergency medicine population, which sets it apart from other commonly used chest pain risk tools, such as the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction and Global Registry of Acute Cardiac Events scores, derived from a less representative cohort of patients with established acute coronary syndrome.

The diagnostic accuracy of the HEART Score for identifying adverse events has been validated in several studies and most recently by a comprehensive and well-designed step wedge trial conducted by Poldevaart et al. Of all the studies at the time of writing, only one study by Plewa et al. has focused primarily on the interoperator reliability of the HEART Score. This study was retrospective and relied on information extrapolated from chart reviews. A recent study by Oliver et al. analyzed the interoperator variability of the HEART Score as a secondary outcome, but it was also based on retrospective chart reviews. One prospective and one retrospective study by Mahler et al. analyzed the HEART Score.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically concerning the evaluation for ACS (intermediate risk), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining invasive coronary angiography in intermediate-risk patients. This is particularly applicable to those with acute chest pain, moderate to severe ischemia identified on stress testing conducted within the past year, and no known coronary artery disease established by prior anatomic testing.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to the evaluation for non-ischemic cardiac causes like myopericarditis, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a cardiac MRI with gadolinium contrast. This helps distinguish myopericarditis from other causes, including myocardial infarction and nonobstructive coronary arteries, in patients with acute chest pain and myocardial injury who show nonobstructive coronary arteries on anatomic testing.

### Does this patient with chest pain have acute coronary syndrome? The Rational Clinical Examination systematic review [^112Zsapb]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

About 10% of patients with acute chest pain are ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Early and accurate estimation of the probability of ACS in these patients using the clinical examination could prevent many hospital admissions among low-risk patients and ensure that high-risk patients are promptly treated.

To systematically review the accuracy of the initial history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and risk scores incorporating these elements with the first cardiac-specific troponin, a comprehensive study was conducted. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched (January 1, 1995-July 31, 2015), along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify prospective studies of diagnostic test accuracy among patients admitted to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting ACS.

Through data extraction and synthesis, 2992 unique articles were identified; 58 met the inclusion criteria. The main outcomes and measures included sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) of findings for the diagnosis of ACS. The reference standard for ACS was either a final hospital diagnosis of ACS or occurrence of a cardiovascular event within 6 weeks.

The results highlighted that the clinical findings and risk factors most suggestive of ACS were a prior abnormal stress test (specificity, 96%; LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.0–4.7]), peripheral arterial disease (specificity, 97%; LR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.5–4.8]), and pain radiation to both arms (specificity, 96%; LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8–3.7]). The most useful electrocardiogram findings were ST-segment depression (specificity, 95%; LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–8.6]).

### Diagnosing the cause of chest pain [^117TdBEW]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain presents a diagnostic challenge in outpatient family medicine. Noncardiac causes are common, but it is important not to overlook serious conditions such as an acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia. In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, most patients should have a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram. Patients with chest pain that is predictably exertional, with electrocardiogram abnormalities, or with cardiac risk factors should be evaluated further with measurement of troponin levels and cardiac stress testing.

- **Pulmonary embolism risk**: The risk can be determined with a simple prediction rule, and a D-dimer assay can help decide whether further evaluation with helical computed tomography or venous ultrasound is needed.
- **Pneumonia indicators**: Fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion suggest pneumonia, which can be confirmed with a chest radiograph. Although some patients with chest pain have heart failure, this is unlikely in the absence of dyspnea; a brain natriuretic peptide level measurement can clarify the diagnosis.
- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Pain reproducible by palpation is more likely to be musculoskeletal than ischemic.
- **Panic disorder association**: Chest pain may also be associated with panic disorder, for which patients can be screened with a two-item questionnaire. Clinical prediction rules can help clarify many of these diagnoses.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to the evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in intermediate-risk patients, the 2021 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), American Heart Association (AHA), American Society of Echocardiography (ASE), Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT), and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) recommend considering various testing modalities. These include exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), stress echocardiography, stress PET/SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging, or stress cardiac MRI for diagnosing myocardial ischemia in intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and no known coronary artery disease who are eligible for cardiac testing.

### 2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114r7B1D]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically concerning the evaluation for ACS, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering the exclusion of myocardial injury in patients with acute chest pain. This is especially relevant when the patient presents with a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least three hours before arriving at the emergency department. In such cases, a single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentration below the limit of detection on the initial measurement (time zero) should be considered.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to troponin levels, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining high-sensitivity cardiac troponin as the preferred biomarker. This recommendation is due to its ability to enable more rapid detection or exclusion of myocardial injury and its role in increasing diagnostic accuracy in patients presenting with acute chest pain.

### A new score for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in acute chest pain with non-diagnostic ECG and normal troponin [^1178KJBV]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents a difficult diagnostic challenge in patients with undifferentiated chest pain. There is a need for a valid clinical score to improve diagnostic accuracy.

- **Objectives**: To compare the performance of a model combining the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score and a score describing chest pain (ACS diagnostic score: ACSD score) with that of both scores alone in the diagnosis of ACS in ED patients with chest pain associated with a non-diagnostic ECG and normal troponin.

- **Methods**: In this observational cohort study, we enrolled 809 patients admitted to a chest pain unit with normal ECG and normal troponin. They were prospectively evaluated in order to calculate the TIMI score, chest pain characteristics score, and ACSD score. Diagnosis of ACS was the primary outcome and defined on the basis of two cardiologists' assessments after reviewing the patient medical records and follow-up data. Mortality and major cardiovascular events were followed for one month for patients discharged directly from the ED. The discriminative power of scores was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve.

- **Results**: ACS was confirmed in 90 patients (11.1%). The area under the ROC curve for the ACSD score was 0.85 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.90), compared with 0.74 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.81) for the TIMI score and 0.79 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.84) for the chest pain characteristics score. A threshold value of 9 appeared to optimize sensitivity (92%) and negative predictive value (99%) without excessively compromising specificity (62%) and positive predictive value (23%).

- **Conclusions**: The ACSD score showed a good ability to:

### How useful are clinical features in the diagnosis of acute, undifferentiated chest pain [^116PjsYJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To measure the predictive value and diagnostic performance of clinical features used to diagnose coronary syndromes in patients presenting with acute, undifferentiated chest pain, the study employed the following methods.

The clinical features of patients presenting to the authors' chest pain unit with acute, undifferentiated chest pain were prospectively recorded on a standard form. Admitted patients were followed up by case note review, while discharged patients were followed up as outpatients three days later. Evidence of adverse events was searched for through hospital databases, case notes, and consultation with the patient's primary care physician six months post-emergency department visit.

- **Methods**: The authors tested the predictive power of each feature for: 1) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by World Health Organization criteria, and 2) Any acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as evidenced by cardiac testing, AMI, arrhythmia, death, or revascularization procedures within six months.

- **Results**: Eight hundred ninety-three patients were assessed, with 34 (3.8%) diagnosed with AMI and 81 (9.1%) with ACS. Features useful in diagnosing AMI included exertional pain [likelihood ratio (LR) = 2.35], pain radiating to the shoulder or both arms (LR = 4.07), and chest wall tenderness (LR = 0.3). Features useful in diagnosing ACS included exertional pain (LR = 2.06) and pain radiating to the shoulder, the left arm, or both arms (LR = 1.62). The nature or site of pain and the presence of nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis were not predictive of AMI or ACS.

- **Conclusions**: Important differences exist when clinical features are specifically investigated. The study highlights key diagnostic features that can aid in distinguishing AMI and ACS in patients with acute chest pain.

### Integrating heart rate variability, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and troponin to triage chest pain patients in the ED [^115hJ87S]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Triage methods for chest pain patients typically utilize symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital sign data, requiring interpretation by dedicated triage clinicians. In contrast, we aimed to create a quickly obtainable model integrating the objective parameters of heart rate variability (HRV), troponin, ECG, and vital signs to improve the accuracy and efficiency of triage for chest pain patients in the emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: Adult patients presenting to the ED with chest pain from September 2010 to July 2015 were conveniently recruited. The primary outcome was a composite of revascularization, death, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, or lethal arrhythmia within 72 hours of presentation to the ED. To create the chest pain triage (CPT) model, logistic regression was done. Potential covariates comprised vital signs, ECG parameters, troponin, and HRV measures. Triage methods at our institution and the modified early warning score (MEWS) were used as comparators.

- **Results**: A total of 797 patients were included for final analysis, of which 146 patients (18.3%) met the primary outcome. Patients were an average age of 60 years old, 68% male, and 56% triaged to the most acute category. The model consisted of five parameters: pain score, ST-elevation, ST-depression, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) α1, and troponin. CPT model > 0.09, CPT model > 0.15, triage methods, and MEWS ≥ 2 had sensitivities of 86%, 74%, 75%, and 23%, respectively, and specificities of 45%, 71%, 48%, and 78%, respectively.

The CPT model may improve the accuracy and efficiency of triage for chest pain patients in the ED.

### Do all heart scores beat the same: Evaluating the interoperator reliability of the HEART Score [^113w7PPN]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with chest pain represent a significant proportion of attendances to the ED. The History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin (HEART) Score is validated for the risk stratification of suspected ischaemic chest pain within the ED. The goal of this research was to establish the interoperator reliability of the HEART Score as performed in the ED by different grades of doctor and nurse.

- **Methodology**: Patients with suspected ischaemic chest pain presenting to the ED of an inner city, London hospital, were recruited prospectively between January and May 2016. Patients that had been enrolled in the study were interviewed by clinicians from four different categories: senior doctor, junior doctor, senior nurse, and junior nurse. Clinicians, blinded to other raters' results, calculated the HEART Scores for each patient with the assistance of a pocket-sized HEART Score card. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated as the primary measure of reliability. A total of 120 patients were required to achieve a desired power of 80%.

- **Results**: 88 complete comparisons were obtained. There were no significant differences between the distributions of HEART Scores for each clinician group (p = 0.95). The ICC for the overall HEART Score was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.93). The ICC for troponin and age were '1', for 'history' 0.41 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.52), 'ECG' 0.64 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.73), and 'risk factors' 0.84 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.89).

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates very strong overall interoperator reliability between the four groups of clinicians studied.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically in the evaluation of stable chest pain at intermediate to high risk, the 2021 ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR guidelines recommend considering stress imaging. Techniques such as stress echocardiography, PET/SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac MRI should be used for diagnosing myocardial ischemia and for estimating the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in intermediate-to-high-risk patients with stable chest pain and no known coronary artery disease.

### Beyond chest pain: Incremental value of other variables to identify patients for an early ECG [^113XrEK6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Chest pain (CP) is the hallmark symptom for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but is not reported in 20–30% of patients, especially women, elderly, and non-white patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

- **Methods**: We used a retrospective 5-year adult ED sample of 279,132 patients to explore using CP alone to predict ACS. We incrementally added other ACS chief complaints, age, and sex in a series of multivariable logistic regression models. We evaluated each model's identification of ACS and STEMI.

- **Results**: Using CP alone would recommend ECGs for 8% of patients (sensitivity, 61%; specificity, 92%) but missed 28.4% of STEMIs. The model with all variables identified ECGs for 22% of patients (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 78%) but missed 14.7% of STEMIs. The model with CP and other ACS chief complaints had the highest sensitivity (93%) and specificity (55%), identified 45.1% of patients for ECG, and only missed 4.4% of STEMIs.

- **Conclusion**: CP alone had the highest specificity but lacked sensitivity. Adding other ACS chief complaints increased sensitivity but identified 2.2-fold more patients for ECGs. Achieving an ECG in 10 minutes for patients with ACS to identify all STEMIs will be challenging without introducing more complex risk calculation into clinical care.

### Biomarkers and acute coronary syndromes: An update [^1161CdFN]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Biomarkers complement clinical assessment and the 12-lead ECG in diagnosing, risk stratifying, triaging, and managing patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). There is broad consensus that cardiac troponin (cTn) I or T is the preferred biomarker in clinical practice. However, important uncertainties remain regarding the value of high-sensitivity cTn assays, their best clinical use, including the most appropriate timing of serial measurements, and the added value of other biomarkers reflecting and quantifying other pathophysiological signals, including copeptin and natriuretic peptides.

This review addresses these aspects with a focus on the diagnostic application of biomarkers as they are associated with immediate therapeutic consequences. Additionally, it briefly highlights that the increased diagnostic accuracy offered by high-sensitivity cTn assays has contributed to an improved understanding of the incidence, pathophysiology, and mortality of the two distinct components currently summarized under the term ACS: acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, and specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend not describing chest pain as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac, as these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis.

### Initial presenting electrocardiogram as determinant for hospital admission in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain: a pilot investigation [^117TL5Bx]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Evaluation of chest pain accounts for millions of costly Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospital admissions annually, with approximately 10–20% being myocardial infarctions (MI).

- **Hypothesis**: Patients with chest pain whose initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal do not require hospital admission for evaluation and management of a possible myocardial infarction.

- **Methods**: The medical records of a consecutive cohort of 250 patients who presented to the ED with chest pain and were admitted by the ED physician to a cardiology inpatient service of an academic tertiary care medical center were reviewed. Reasons for admission to the hospital were to rule out an acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction. The initial ECG of each patient was evaluated for abnormalities and compared with the final diagnosis.

- **Results**: Of the 75 patients presenting with normal ECGs (normal, upright T waves and isoelectric ST segments), 1 (1.3%) was subsequently diagnosed with a myocardial infarction by Troponin I elevation alone. Of the 55 patients presenting with abnormal ECGs but no clear evidence of ischemia, such as left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left anterior hemiblock (LAH), 2 (3.6%) were diagnosed with MI. Among the 48 patients presenting with abnormal ECGs questionable for ischemia, showing nonspecific ST and T wave changes that were not clearly ST segment elevation or depression, 7 (14.6%) were diagnosed with an MI. Of the 72 patients who presented with abnormal ECGs showing ischemia (acute ST segment elevation and/or depression), 3 were diagnosed with an MI.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and clinical risk scores in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^1152jeop]. Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Chest pain is a common presenting symptom in the emergency department, and although many patients require investigation for acute coronary syndrome, the majority have alternative diagnoses. Earlier identification of patients without myocardial infarction may improve patient experience and healthcare efficiency by reducing hospitalization for unnecessary investigation, but such strategies can only be implemented if safety is not compromised.

Several pathways permit the early rule-out of myocardial infarction. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 3-hour pathway uses the 99th percentile upper reference limit of a cardiac troponin assay to rule in and rule out myocardial infarction. However, recent observations have questioned whether this pathway provides adequate diagnostic performance in the era of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing. The precision of high-sensitivity assays at low concentrations has been exploited in the development of novel pathways that rule out myocardial infarction using thresholds below the 99th percentile.

In an individual patient-level data meta-analysis of 22,457 patients, a cardiac troponin I threshold of less than 5 ng/L and a nonischemic ECG gave a negative predictive value (NPV) and sensitivity of 99.7% and 99.0%, respectively, for myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The same threshold has also been validated for the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T assay in a recent pooled analysis. When this rule-out threshold was applied in a pathway that includes serial testing at 0 and 3 hours, five-fold fewer patients were misclassified.

### Short- and long-term cardiac events in patients with chest pain with or without known existing coronary disease presenting normal electrocardiogram [^113KSMuF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of adverse cardiac events in patients with chest pain, with or without known existing coronary disease, presenting normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and initial troponin.

- **Methods**: This prospective, non-randomized study enrolled low-risk patients with normal ECG and troponin on admission. These patients underwent observation and/or stress testing based on unstandardized clinical judgment. Patients who experienced re-angina, positive ECGs, or positive troponins during observation, as well as those with positive stress testing, were admitted. Otherwise, they were discharged.

- **End point**: The end points are cardiac events at short- and long-term follow-up, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and revascularization.

- **Results**: Of 5,656 patients considered, 1,732 with ischemic ECG were initially admitted and, therefore, excluded from the analysis. 2,860 patients with pleuritic chest pain and normal ECG were discharged, while 1,064 with visceral chest pain and normal ECG were enrolled. Patients with known coronary disease (45%) were older and likely presented known vascular disease. These patients, in addition to having older age, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and lower chest pain scores, were more likely to be managed with observation. In comparison to patients without known coronary disease, those with it experienced overall cardiac events in 35% versus 14% of cases, respectively (P < .001): in-hospital, 23% versus 10% (P < .001); at 1 month, 4% versus 2% (P = 0.133); and at 9.9 ± 4.9 months, 8% versus 2%, respectively (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: One-third of patients with a history of coronary disease continue to be at risk for cardiac events despite normal presenting ECG and initial troponin results.

Patients who present to the ED with chest pain (or its equivalent) but have no electrocardiographic changes or elevation in cardiac biomarkers after an appropriate interval can be considered low risk for acute coronary syndrome. Combined with a low demographic risk for coronary artery disease (e.g. using Framingham criteria), such patients can be said to be "low risk" for a subsequent coronary event. Whether there is a role for further risk stratification with provocative testing and/or coronary imaging before discharge remains open to debate.

### Detection of chest pain of non-cardiac origin at the emergency room by a new non-invasive device avoiding unnecessary admission to hospital [^114haYiL]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes have raised awareness that prompt presentation for chest pain may be life-saving. Most patients presenting with chest discomfort have a non-ischaemic ECG at presentation but are routinely admitted to the hospital because of diagnostic uncertainty for occult MI or ischaemia. We tested a new non-invasive device that measures central aortic pressure changes (dP/dtejc); an accepted index of myocardial performance that could be added to the diagnostic triage of ischaemia in the ER, avoiding unnecessary admissions.

We followed 85 patients presenting at the ER with acute chest pain. In 72 patients, negative ECG and myocardial enzyme dynamics ruled out the coronary origin during the first 24 hours after admission. In 8 of these 72 patients, coronary catheterisation found normal coronary arteries. In this group, the average dP/dtejc was 163 (range 92–232). In 35 patients in whom the new non-invasive cardiac performance index dP/dtejc was above a threshold of > 150, acute MI was ruled out. In 13 patients, acute chest pain had a coronary origin confirmed by ECG and/or positive enzymes. The average dP/dtejc in this group was 117 (range 61–149). The dP/dtejc values were found to be significantly higher in patients without acute MI (p < 0.001).

Preliminary findings suggest that nearly 40% of patients presenting with acute chest pain could be spared the risks and costs of unnecessary hospital admission and more invasive cardiac testing by simply adding an easy-to-use, immediately obtained test to the diagnostic protocol and using a threshold of dP/dte.

### Evaluation of a clinical decision rule for young adult patients with chest pain [^1176B3CC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The authors sought to validate a clinical decision rule that identifies young adults (younger than 40 years) with chest pain as being at low risk (< 1%) for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and 30-day adverse cardiovascular (CV) events. This applies to patients without known cardiac disease who have either no cardiac risk factors and/or a normal electrocardiogram (ECG).

A prospective cohort study included patients aged 24–39 who received an ECG for chest pain from July 1999 to March 2002. Cocaine users were excluded from the study. Data collection was structured at presentation, with hospital course followed daily and 30-day follow-up obtained by telephone. The primary outcome was 30-day adverse CV events, which included death, acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft.

Of 4,492 visits for chest pain, 1,023 met the study criteria. Most patients were female (61%) and African American (73%). Ninety-eight percent were available for 30-day follow-up. The overall risks of ACS and 30-day adverse CV events were 5.4% and 2.2%, respectively, across the entire cohort. For patients with no cardiac history and no cardiac risk factors, the risk of ACS and 30-day adverse CV events was 1.8%. In patients with no cardiac history and a normal ECG, the risk was 1.3%. Patients with no cardiac history, no cardiac risk factors, and a normal ECG had a risk of 1.0%.

A modified clinical decision rule demonstrated that, in young adult patients without known cardiac history, either lacking classic cardiac risk factors or having a normal ECG was associated with initially normal cardiac outcomes.

### Application of the American College of Cardiology's clinical decision pathway for patients with acute chest pain using a real-world cohort [^111Z1Tj3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Measurement of cardiac troponin has become a crucial tool for ruling in and ruling out acute myocardial infarction (MI). Recently, the American College of Cardiology published an expert consensus clinical decision pathway (CDP) for patients with acute chest pain in the emergency department. This CDP allows for classification of patients with chest pain with nonischemic ECG findings according to high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) measurements in low, intermediate, and high risk of MI.

Furthermore, to discriminate the intermediate‐risk patients, a re‐evaluation including the incorporation of an additional troponin measurement after 3 to 6 hours is proposed. No or minimal increase in hs‐cTn with recent normal testing, chronic elevation, or low modified "History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk factors and Troponin" (HEART) Score (≤ 3) or "Emergency Department Detection of Chest Pain Score" (EDACS) (< 16) should be reclassified as lower risk, whereas a significant increase in hs‐cTn, ongoing or recurrent chest pain, or new ECG findings consistent with ischemia should lead to a reclassification as high risk. For those not meeting the criteria described above, noninvasive testing should be considered before discharge.

While there are extensive data supporting the concept of MI risk categories, there is no evidence supporting the proposed approach of re‐evaluation in intermediate‐risk patients. Improved diagnosis and treatment of MI among patients classified as intermediate‐risk are needed. A recent registry study demonstrated efficacy and safety of the proposed American College pathway.

### Clinical effectiveness of cardiac noninvasive diagnostic testing in patients discharged from the emergency department for chest pain [^111teFcj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Chest pain is one of the most common clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease, resulting in more than 4 million cardiac noninvasive diagnostic tests annually in the United States, with accelerating utilization rates in recent years. However, despite widespread use, questions remain regarding the effectiveness of noninvasive tests in improving downstream clinical outcomes.

The PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) and SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the HEART Trial) reported low rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients undergoing different types of noninvasive tests. Given the low event rates in contemporary cohorts being worked up for chest pain, it is unclear whether noninvasive testing (NIT) can lead to incremental downstream improvements in outcomes when compared with no testing. Unfortunately, neither the PROMISE nor the SCOT-HEART trial included no-testing arms to compare outcomes between strategies of any NIT versus no testing in order to help shed light on this question.

In order to further explore the utility of NIT in patients evaluated for chest pain, we sought to evaluate whether any such testing is associated with lower rates of MACE when compared with no testing. To address this objective, we used a well-defined cohort of patients who were recently discharged from the emergency department (ED) after assessment for chest pain, in which a potential cardiac etiology was considered and an acute coronary syndrome was a possible concern.

### In search of an optimal subset of ECG features to augment the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome at the emergency department [^111ya3P4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

This study was a prospective observational cohort study conducted on consecutive patients with chest pain who were transported by emergency medical services to one of three tertiary care hospitals in the United States between 2013 and 2015. The methods of this study have been previously described in detail. In brief, we collected prehospital 12‐lead ECGs obtained by paramedics in the field and stored them for offline analysis. Patients were followed up to determine study outcomes, with clinical data obtained from medical charts by independent reviewers. A waiver of informed consent was obtained, and the study received approval from the institutional review board of the University of Pittsburgh. The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

The primary outcome of the study was the presence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina, during the primary indexed admission. This was defined according to the fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction consensus statement as the occurrence of ischemic symptoms (e.g. diffuse discomfort in the chest, upper extremity, jaw, or epigastric area for more than 20 minutes) along with biomarker, nuclear, or angiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia and/or loss of viable myocardium. Study outcomes were adjudicated by two independent physician reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Patients discharged from the emergency department were classified as negative for ACS if they experienced no adverse events within 30 days.

### Emergency department evaluation of the chest pain patient [^113BtLhw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician must have a high degree of suspicion for myocardial ischemia in patients presenting with no obvious cause for their chest pain. The role of the emergency physician is to determine a relative risk for each patient and to order the appropriate studies to minimize the risk of missed myocardial infarction. Additionally, they must recognize acute ischemia or infarction and manage it aggressively. It is not possible to rule out myocardial ischemia or infarction subjectively. The authors opine that some form of further testing should be performed on patients in all categories, except those determined to be at very low risk.

Chest pain accounts for 10% of emergency department (ED) visits annually, and many of these patients are admitted because of potentially life-threatening conditions. A substantial percentage of patients with chest pain are at low risk for a major cardiac adverse event (MACE).

We investigated controversies in the evaluation of patients with low-risk chest pain, including clinical scores, decision pathways, and shared decision-making.

- **Discussion**: ED patients with chest pain who have negative biomarker results and nonischemic electrocardiograms are at low risk for MACE. With the large number of chest pain patients evaluated in the ED, several risk scores and pathways are in use based on history, electrocardiographic results, and biomarker results. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events scores are older rules with validation; however, they do not have adequate sensitivity or are not easy to use in the ED. The Vancouver chest pain and North American chest pain rules may be used for patients with undifferentiated chest pain in the ED. The Manchester Acute Coronary Syndromes rule uses eight factors, several of which are not available in the United States. The history, electrocardiography, age, risk factors, and troponin (HEART) score and pathway are easy to use, have high sensitivity and negative predictive values, and have better discriminatory capability for categorization. The use of pathways with shared decision-making involves the patient in management, shortens the duration of stay, and decreases risk.

### Best clinical practice: Current controversies in evaluation of low-risk chest pain-part 1 [^111KYRzP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common presentation to the emergency department (ED), though the majority of patients are not diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Many patients are admitted to the hospital due to fear of ACS.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to investigate controversies in low-risk chest pain evaluation, including the risk of missed ACS, stress test, and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).

- **Discussion**: Chest pain accounts for 10 million ED visits in the United States annually. Many patients are at low risk for a major cardiac adverse event (MACE). With negative troponin and nonischemic electrocardiogram (ECG), the risk of MACE and myocardial infarction (MI) is < 1%. The American Heart Association recommends further evaluation in low- to intermediate-risk patients within 72 hours. These modalities add little to further risk stratification. These evaluations do not appropriately risk stratify patients who are already at low risk, nor do they diagnose acute MI. CCTA is an anatomic evaluation of the coronary vasculature with literature support to decrease ED length of stay, though it is associated with downstream testing. Literature is controversial concerning further risk stratification in already low-risk patients.

- **Conclusions**: With nonischemic ECG and negative cardiac biomarker, the risk of ACS approaches < 1%. Use of stress test and CCTA for risk stratification of low-risk chest pain patients is controversial. These tests may allow prognostication but do not predict ACS risk beyond ECG and troponin. CCTA may be useful for intermediate-risk patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically the evaluation for ACS, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend the following time intervals after the initial troponin sample collection (time zero) for repeat measurements. This is for the evaluation of patients presenting with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, if serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury:

- **1–3 hours**: For high-sensitivity troponin.
- **3–6 hours**: For conventional troponin assays.

### Use of prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography and treatment times among ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients with atypical symptoms [^113rCJkh]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines advise that a prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for any patients with chest pain, yet up to 20% of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) do not present with chest pain. The objective was to determine the association of atypical presentations in the prehospital setting on the likelihood of receiving a prehospital ECG and subsequent time to reperfusion therapy.

This study used a data set that linked prehospital medical information from a statewide EMS data system with a clinical registry of treatment and outcomes data for patients with STEMI. Among 2,639 STEMI patients from 2008 to 2010, the association between non-chest pain presentations, prehospital ECG use, and reperfusion times among patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was examined. Inverse probability weights were used to account for observed baseline confounders.

Overall, 318 of 2,639 patients (12.1%) presented without chest pain. A prehospital ECG was obtained in 2,021 of 2,321 patients (87.1%) with chest pain compared with only 230 of 318 (72.3%) without chest pain (odds ratio [OR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69 to 2.98). Among patients without chest pain, those who received a prehospital ECG had significantly shorter first medical contact (FMC) to device times (30.9% ≤ 90 minutes, adjusted OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.29 to 6.11, p < 0.01).

Over one-quarter of STEMI patients presenting without chest pain did not receive prehospital ECGs and had significantly longer times from first medical contact to device deployment.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: A companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^113SsAv4]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 hours prior to admission, and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is hemodynamically stable, and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying, "It is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed". Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia/bronchitis should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 hours that increases in intensity during…

### Age differences in the safety and effectiveness of the HEART pathway accelerated diagnostic protocol for acute chest pain [^111ps5CD]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). High credibility.

Each year, 8–10 million patients visit an emergency department (ED) in the United States due to acute chest pain and are evaluated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Although ACS occurs in less than 10% of ED patients with acute chest pain, nearly $10–13 billion is spent annually on comprehensive cardiovascular evaluations, which often include hospital admission, serial biomarkers, and objective cardiac testing. Evaluating and risk stratifying patients for ACS is a high-stakes and challenging process, particularly among older adults, because they are less likely to have classic ACS presentations. To assist with risk stratification, accelerated diagnostic protocols (ADPs), such as the History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin Pathway (HEART Pathway), were developed.

The safety and effectiveness of the HEART Pathway, which is widely used across the United States, are well demonstrated. In prior studies, the HEART Pathway safely decreased the rate of hospitalizations, reduced hospital length of stay, and lowered costs among ED patients with acute chest pain. Furthermore, the HEART Pathway has been shown to perform well among key subgroups, such as women and patients of non-White race. However, there is a lack of data evaluating whether the performance of the HEART Pathway differs by age group. Prior studies demonstrate that older adults are more likely to be hospitalized for chest pain, are at higher risk for developing ACS, and, if they have ACS, tend to suffer worse outcomes. This suggests that differences in HEART Pathway performance may occur with increasing age.

### Frequency of acute coronary syndrome in patients with normal electrocardiogram performed during presence or absence of chest pain [^112Ne7Kf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The authors hypothesized that patients experiencing active chest pain at the time of a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) have a lower frequency of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared to patients being evaluated for chest pain but without active chest pain during the ECG. The study aimed to describe the association between chest pain in patients with a normal ECG and the diagnosis of ACS.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included emergency department (ED) patients presenting with chest pain and an initial normal ECG. These patients were admitted for chest pain evaluation over one year. Two groups were identified: patients experiencing chest pain during the ECG and those not experiencing chest pain during the ECG. Normal ECG criteria included: 1) normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 55–105 beats/min, 2) normal QRS interval and ST segment, and 3) normal T-wave morphology or T-wave flattening. "Normal" excluded pathologic Q waves, left ventricular hypertrophy, nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities, any ST depression, and discrepancies in the axis between the T wave and the QRS. Initial ED ECGs were interpreted by two emergency physicians (EPs), with differences resolved by a cardiologist. ACS was defined as: 1) elevation and characteristic evolution of troponin I level, 2) coronary angiography showing > 70% stenosis in a major coronary artery, or 3) positive noninvasive cardiac stress test. Chi-square analysis was performed and odds ratios (ORs) are presented.

### Testing of low-risk patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114EVwNi]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

The management of low-risk patients presenting to emergency departments is a common and challenging clinical problem, entailing 8 million emergency department visits annually. Although a majority of these patients do not have a life-threatening condition, the clinician must distinguish between those who require urgent treatment for a serious problem and those with more benign entities who do not require admission. Inadvertent discharge of patients with acute coronary syndrome from the emergency department is associated with increased mortality and liability, whereas inappropriate admission of patients without serious disease is neither indicated nor cost-effective.

Clinical judgment and basic clinical tools (history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram) remain primary in meeting this challenge and affording early identification of low-risk patients with chest pain. Additionally, established and newer diagnostic methods have extended clinicians' diagnostic capacity in this setting. Low-risk patients presenting with chest pain are increasingly managed in chest pain units, where accelerated diagnostic protocols are performed. These protocols comprise serial electrocardiograms and cardiac injury markers to exclude acute coronary syndrome. Patients with negative findings usually complete the accelerated diagnostic protocol with a confirmatory test to exclude ischemia. This is typically an exercise treadmill test or a cardiac imaging study if the exercise treadmill test is not applicable. Rest myocardial perfusion imaging has assumed an important role in this setting.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically concerning the evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at intermediate risk, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to exclude the presence of atherosclerotic plaque and obstructive coronary artery disease. This is particularly applicable to intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain who have no known coronary artery disease and an inconclusive prior stress test.

### A practical approach for the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays in the evaluation of patients with chest pain [^1124MvLb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common clinical presentation, especially in the emergency department. Rapid identification of patients with myocardial infarction, as well as those with non-cardiac chest pain, is important to start therapy in the former and avoid unnecessary investigations and delays in discharge in the latter. Besides the electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers are a key element in decision-making. Conventional creatinine kinase and troponin assays are not sensitive enough and must be repeated at least 6 to 12 hours after the initial evaluation. New high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) tests are currently available and, if used appropriately, can substantially improve management. Due to their high sensitivity and accuracy, these tests allow measurement of very low serum troponin levels, such as those present in healthy individuals, and can detect small changes in troponin concentration within a short time frame. These tests are thus very useful for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction but can also be elevated in several other conditions that result in myocardial injury. A good understanding of the analytical characteristics of these assays is of utmost importance for their appropriate use in clinical practice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation for ACS (general principles), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend ensuring shared decision-making between the clinician and patient. This involves decisions regarding the need for admission, observation, discharge, or further evaluation in an outpatient setting. Such shared decision-making aims to improve patient understanding and reduce low-value testing in patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS deemed intermediate risk by a clinical decision pathway.

### Triage of patients for a rapid (5-minute) electrocardiogram: A rule based on presenting chief complaints [^111qDY1T]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

A rule based on presenting chief complaints can identify patients for a rapid (5-minute) ECG and decrease delays in treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI).

- **Methods**: The presenting chief complaint was electronically collected on all patients treated in a community teaching hospital emergency department. A rule for ordering ECG on patient presentation to the ED was developed from a model set of patients presenting from July through December 1994 (22,717 patients) and then tested on a validation set of patients from January through May 1995 (18,759 patients). Outcome measures (delay in performance of ECG and delay in administration of thrombolytic agents) were prospectively collected on written data sheets before (April 1993-May 1995, n = 67) and after (June 1995-March 1997, n = 128) implementation of the rule at the study hospital.

- **Results**: On the model set, 193 patients had the final diagnosis of MI, with 5 chief complaints having the best performance in identifying patients with acute MI and comprising the rapid ECG rule: older than 30 years with chest pain (130 [67.4%] patients); older than 50 years with syncope (5 [1%] patients); weakness (12 [6.2%] patients); rapid heartbeat (2 [1%] patients); and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (20 [10.4%] patients). On the validation set, 142 patients had the final diagnosis of MI, with the rule performing better than chest pain in identifying patients for a "stat" ECG (sensitivity 93.7% versus 67.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference, 15.6% to 33.8%]).

### Yield of routine provocative cardiac testing among patients in an emergency department-based chest pain unit [^1163E6pB]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association recommends routine provocative cardiac testing in accelerated diagnostic protocols for coronary ischemia. However, the diagnostic and therapeutic yield of this approach remains unknown. This study aims to assess the yield of routine provocative cardiac testing in an emergency department-based chest pain unit.

A prospectively collected database was examined involving patients evaluated for possible acute coronary syndrome between March 4, 2004, and May 15, 2010, at an urban academic tertiary care center. Patients enrolled had signs or symptoms indicating a possible acute coronary syndrome, though none had an ischemic electrocardiography result or positive biomarker.

All participants underwent evaluation through exercise stress testing or myocardial perfusion imaging. Key demographic and clinical features were documented, along with results from routine provocative cardiac testing and angiography. Therapeutic interventions were also recorded. To ascertain diagnostic yield, the true-positive rate was calculated. The potential therapeutic yield of invasive therapy was evaluated via blinded, structured medical record reviews, employing American Heart Association designations (class I, IIa, IIb, or lower) for potential benefit from percutaneous intervention.

In total, 4181 patients participated in this study. Of these, 93.5% initially reported chest pain, and 73.2% were identified as being at intermediate risk for coronary artery disease. Males constituted 37.6% of the study population.

The 2021 guidelines from the ACC, ACCP, AHA, ASE, SAEM, SCCT, and SCMR recommend obtaining invasive coronary angiography for guiding therapeutic decision-making in patients with a history of CABG surgery presenting with stable chest pain. This is advised if noninvasive stress test results show moderate-to-severe ischemia or there is a suspicion of myocardial ischemia with indeterminate or nondiagnostic stress tests.
