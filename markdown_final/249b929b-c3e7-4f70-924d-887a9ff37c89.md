## Question

Glucose testing in infant of a diabetic mother

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about glucose testing in infants of diabetic mothers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which infants qualify as high risk and should be screened. Then, I should verify the optimal timing for the first glucose check. Next, I will review the testing cadence and how long to continue screening. After that, I need to check what constitutes actionable hypoglycemia thresholds and when to escalate care. Then, I should consider how maternal insulin therapy and peripartum glucose influence neonatal risk. Finally, I will examine how to minimize harm to breastfeeding while maintaining safety and synthesize a practical, time-efficient protocol.

> Let me first confirm who needs screening and why, because I should not overgeneralize beyond evidence-based risk groups. Infants of mothers with diabetes — type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes — are high risk for hyperinsulinemic neonatal hypoglycemia and are included in major guidance, along with other at-risk groups such as preterm infants, SGA/LGA, and infants with perinatal stress or poor feeding, with estimates suggesting about a quarter of all newborns meet screening criteria depending on the guideline used, so the IDM designation is sufficient to trigger screening without further justification [^111fEyVx] [^113tvAWX].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of the first glucose measurement because recommendations vary subtly. ABM advises beginning within 60 minutes after birth when significant hyperinsulinemia is suspected, and otherwise before the second feeding or at 2–4 hours of age; some quality improvement pathways have operationalized early checks at 0 and 1 hour, and the AAP acknowledges the physiologic nadir while emphasizing risk-based screening and feeding before testing, so starting at or before the second feeding, and certainly within the first few hours, aligns with best practice and physiology [^11278P1Q] [^112KVMV8] [^112NGtDM] [^1133Lh3T].

> I should double-check the screening cadence and duration, since overtesting causes pain and can disrupt breastfeeding. ABM recommends continuing preprandial checks until at least three satisfactory values are obtained. The AAP suggests screening before each feed for the first 24 hours in late preterm and SGA infants. Observational data suggest that nearly all infants who ultimately require IV dextrose are identified by the first or second check, so an efficient approach is frequent early checks with rapid de-escalation once stability is demonstrated [^11278P1Q] [^112d1b93] [^116TsqXj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what "counts" as hypoglycemia. I need to reconcile threshold definitions with guideline-based treatment triggers. ABM uses treatment thresholds of about 20–25 mg/dL (1.1–1.4 mmol/L) for immediate IV dextrose, while the AAP defines hypoglycemia as less than 40 mg/dL in the first 4 hours and less than 45 mg/dL after 4–24 hours, and a pragmatic quality pathway treated at 2.5 mmol/L (about 45 mg/dL) for all asymptomatic infants. Importantly, an RCT showed noninferiority of treating at 2.0 mmol/L vs 2.6 mmol/L for neurodevelopment at 18 months, so using guideline-aligned ranges with attention to age after birth and symptoms is reasonable while acknowledging evolving evidence and local protocol specifics [^112nwxPU] [^1133Lh3T] [^112NGtDM] [^116TsqXj].

> I will now examine how maternal therapy and peripartum glucose shape neonatal risk, because I need to ensure risk stratification reflects physiology. Maternal insulin therapy, especially in poorly controlled diabetes, is associated with higher neonatal hypoglycemia risk, and maternal glucose levels during labor correlate with the need for neonatal IV glucose, which argues for tight but safe intrapartum glycemic control and early postnatal surveillance in exposed infants; continuous maternal glucose monitoring in type 1 diabetes reduces large-for-gestational-age births and may reduce severe neonatal hypoglycemia, reinforcing the link between maternal glycemia and neonatal outcomes [^1152n7po] [^111K5TUa] [^113iy4jR].

> Next, I should review feeding-first strategies and how to protect breastfeeding while screening, because I need to balance neuroprotection with family-centered care. Early and frequent feeding within the first hour, skin-to-skin contact, and lactation support improve glycemic stability and preserve exclusive breastfeeding; some pathways have prioritized formula as a first-line enteral intervention for borderline values, but this can undermine breastfeeding and may be unnecessary if early colostrum and skilled breastfeeding support are provided, so individualized escalation with careful documentation and parental counseling is essential [^114uw7K5] [^1136QwNG] [^112NGtDM] [^116TsqXj].

> But wait, what if I'm missing a more efficient, evidence-aligned protocol? Let me reconsider a practical synthesis. A pragmatic approach is to identify all IDMs at birth, start glucose monitoring before the second feeding or at 2–4 hours of age (earlier if hyperinsulinemia is suspected), recheck every 2–3 hours before feeds until three consecutive preprandial values are above approximately 45 mg/dL, extend monitoring to 24 hours for late preterm or SGA infants per AAP logic, treat immediately with IV dextrose if severe thresholds are met or if the infant is symptomatic, and use a glucose-centric escalation only if enteral measures fail; nearly all infants requiring IV support declare themselves early, allowing safe de-escalation thereafter [^11278P1Q] [^1133Lh3T] [^112NGtDM] [^116TsqXj].

> I should confirm the testing modality and quality safeguards, because capillary values can mislead. Bedside capillary testing is acceptable for screening, but low results should be confirmed with laboratory plasma glucose when they will change management, given known inaccuracy of some POC methods; quality pathways often verify with plasma when values are at or near treatment thresholds, which is a prudent compromise between timeliness and accuracy [^11278P1Q] [^112NGtDM].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency before concluding. IDMs are unequivocally at risk and warrant screening; start within the first few hours aligned with ABM/AAP, use a preprandial cadence with rapid de-escalation once stable, apply guideline-based thresholds with readiness to escalate to IV dextrose for severe or persistent hypoglycemia, incorporate maternal insulin status and peripartum glycemia into anticipatory planning, and prioritize early breastfeeding and lactation support to minimize pain, separation, and formula exposure; this approach is evidence-concordant and operationally efficient while maintaining safety [^111fEyVx] [^11278P1Q] [^1133Lh3T] [^114uw7K5].

Infants of diabetic mothers require **early and frequent glucose monitoring** because of their high risk of neonatal hypoglycemia from fetal hyperinsulinemia [^114HHi1A]. Begin screening within 30–60 minutes after birth, before the second feeding, or 2–4 hours postpartum, and continue until three consecutive pre-feed glucose values are ≥ 2.5 mmol/L (≥ 45 mg/dL) [^11278P1Q] [^1133Lh3T]. Use heel-stick capillary glucose or a validated point-of-care method, and confirm low results with laboratory plasma glucose [^11278P1Q]. Treat any glucose < 2.6 mmol/L (< 47 mg/dL) with feeding or intravenous dextrose, and escalate to IV glucose if glucose remains low or the infant is symptomatic [^114NtyrU]. Maintain normothermia, initiate early feeding, and monitor closely for hypoglycemia symptoms; discontinue monitoring once stable glucose is documented for 12–24 hours and feeding is established [^114uw7K5] [^114NtyrU].

---

## Pathophysiology of neonatal hypoglycemia in infants of diabetic mothers

Fetal hyperglycemia from maternal diabetes drives **fetal hyperinsulinemia**, which persists after birth, causing transient neonatal hypoglycemia when maternal glucose supply ceases [^115CVRmg]. The risk and severity correlate with maternal glycemic control, especially in the third trimester and during labor [^111K5TUa] [^114uw7K5].

---

## Timing and frequency of glucose screening

Early screening is essential: begin within **30–60 minutes after birth**, before the second feeding, or 2–4 hours postpartum [^112KVMV8] [^11278P1Q]. Continue monitoring until three consecutive pre-feed glucose values are ≥ 2.5 mmol/L (≥ 45 mg/dL) [^11278P1Q] [^1133Lh3T]. For infants with persistent or severe hypoglycemia, extend monitoring to 12–24 hours after stabilization.

---

## Recommended glucose screening methods

- **Capillary blood glucose testing**: Heel-stick samples using validated point-of-care devices; rapid and practical for serial monitoring [^11278P1Q].

- **Laboratory plasma glucose testing**: Confirm low capillary results with plasma glucose when values are borderline or management decisions hinge on accuracy [^11278P1Q].

- **Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)**: Not routine; consider in select cases of persistent or refractory hypoglycemia.

---

## Glucose thresholds for diagnosis and management

| **Age (hours)** | **Hypoglycemia threshold (mmol/l)** | **Hypoglycemia threshold (mg/dl)** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 0–4 | < 2.6 | < 47 | - Immediate feeding (breastfeeding or formula) <br/> - If glucose remains low or infant is symptomatic, initiate IV dextrose [^112nwxPU] |
| 4–24 | < 2.8 | < 50 | - Feedings every 2–3 hours <br/> - IV dextrose if glucose remains low or infant is symptomatic [^112nwxPU] |
| > 24 | < 3.3 | < 60 | - Continue feeding <br/> - IV dextrose if glucose remains low or infant is symptomatic [^114NtyrU] |

---

## Clinical signs of neonatal hypoglycemia

Neonatal hypoglycemia may be **asymptomatic**; when present, signs include:

- Jitteriness or tremors
- Irritability
- Lethargy or poor feeding
- Hypotonia
- Seizures
- Cyanosis or apnea

Prompt recognition and treatment of symptomatic hypoglycemia are critical to prevent neurologic injury [^1133Lh3T] [^111hyhgE].

---

## Management of neonatal hypoglycemia

- **Initial management**: Immediate feeding (breastfeeding or formula) within the first hour of life; repeat glucose before each feeding until stable [^114uw7K5] [^11278P1Q].

- **Intravenous dextrose therapy**: Indicated for glucose < 2.6 mmol/L (< 47 mg/dL), symptomatic hypoglycemia, or if feeding is ineffective. Start with 10% dextrose bolus (2 mL/kg) followed by continuous infusion at 5–8 mg/kg/min, titrating to maintain glucose ≥ 2.5 mmol/L (≥ 45 mg/dL) [^112nwxPU] [^114NtyrU].

- **Glucagon therapy**: Consider for refractory hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism (200 µg/kg IV/IM).

- **Monitoring and documentation**: Track glucose, clinical status, and response to interventions; adjust therapy accordingly [^11278P1Q].

---

## Factors influencing glucose screening and management

- **Maternal glycemic control**: Poor control increases risk and severity of neonatal hypoglycemia [^111K5TUa] [^1126fdv7].

- **Gestational age at birth**: Preterm infants have higher risk due to limited glycogen stores and immature hepatic glucose production [^114HHi1A].

- **Birth weight**: LGA infants are at increased risk due to hyperinsulinemia; SGA infants are at risk due to limited glycogen stores [^114HHi1A] [^1133Lh3T].

- **Mode of delivery**: Cesarean delivery may increase risk due to delayed feeding and stress [^112d1b93].

---

## Long-term implications of neonatal hypoglycemia

Persistent or severe neonatal hypoglycemia is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including **cognitive impairment, developmental delay, and increased risk of autism spectrum disorder** [^1176132x] [^113tvAWX]. Early detection and appropriate management are essential to mitigate these risks [^111hyhgE].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **early identification, frequent monitoring, and prompt management** of neonatal hypoglycemia in infants of diabetic mothers. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend early feeding, regular glucose monitoring, and escalation to IV dextrose if glucose remains low or the infant is symptomatic [^11278P1Q] [^1133Lh3T].

---

## Conclusion

Infants of diabetic mothers require **early and frequent glucose monitoring** due to their high risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Early feeding, regular monitoring, and prompt management are essential to prevent adverse outcomes. Current guidelines provide clear recommendations for screening and management, but individualized care based on maternal and infant factors is crucial [^114HHi1A].

### Management of infants of diabetic mothers… [^113X78Yb]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Classification, diagnosis, treatment, and care of pregnant women with diabetes mellitus in our institution is based on specific recommendations. 23 Fetal assessment for insulin-dependent women consists of twice-weekly nonstress testing beginning at 32 weeks, unless other risk factors are present. 24 Women with diet-controlled GDM undergo nonstress testing for specific risk factors or when they reach 40 weeks. Women with insulin-requiring GDM are managed similar to women who have preexisting diabetes without vascular disease. Blood glucose screening was performed with chromogen reagent strips read by a reflectance meter, and true serum glucose was measured by the standard glucose oxidase method.

Glucose was administered orally or intravenously 21 to all infants with or without symptoms provided that serum glucose concentration decreased to less than 2. 2 mmol/L. Hypoglycemia Heelstick glucose determination was performed in all 530 infants and true blood glucose levels were determined in 514. One or more hypoglycemic episodes were documented in 137 of the 514 infants. One third of these episodes were mild, one third were moderate, and one third were severe. Two hundred forty-four infants of the entire group of infants were assigned to routine care and enteral feedings. Of these, 32 experienced hypoglycemia. Sixteen of the 32 cases were mild and were successfully treated with early breast- or formula-feeding.

Of the remaining 16 cases, 6 were moderately glycemic and 10 were severely glycemic and all 16 were treated with intravenous glucose supplementation for correction. In spite of the progress made in antepartum management, infants of mothers with preexisting diabetes mellitus, premature infants, and LGA and SGA infants remain at greater risk for hypoglycemia. Single, mild, and short-lasting hypoglycemic episodes occur, even among infants for whom intravenous dextrose administration has been initiated. That 37% of all infants in our study were partially or exclusively breast-fed is a satisfactory measure of the success of our maternal glucose control and lactation programs.

### Postnatal glucose homeostasis in late-preterm and term infants [^114Ejyen]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

This report provides a practical guide and algorithm for the screening and subsequent management of neonatal hypoglycemia. Current evidence does not support a specific concentration of glucose that can discriminate normal from abnormal or can potentially result in acute or chronic irreversible neurologic damage. Early identification of the at-risk infant and institution of prophylactic measures to prevent neonatal hypoglycemia are recommended as a pragmatic approach despite the absence of a consistent definition of hypoglycemia in the literature.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: risks and management during and after pregnancy [^1156M3jR]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) carries a small but potentially important risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and a long-term risk of obesity and glucose intolerance in offspring. Mothers with GDM have an excess of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and a high risk of developing diabetes mellitus thereafter. Diagnosing and treating GDM can reduce perinatal complications, but only a small fraction of pregnancies benefit. Nutritional management is the cornerstone of treatment; insulin, glyburide and metformin can be used to intensify treatment. Fetal measurements complement maternal glucose monitoring in the identification of pregnancies that require such intensification. Glucose testing shortly after delivery can stratify the short-term diabetes risk in mothers. Thereafter, annual glucose and HbA(1c) testing can detect deteriorating glycaemic control, a harbinger of future diabetes mellitus, usually type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interventions that mitigate obesity or its metabolic effects are most potent in preventing or delaying diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle modification is the primary approach; use of medications for diabetes prevention after GDM remains controversial. Family planning enables optimization of health in subsequent pregnancies. Breastfeeding may reduce obesity in children and is recommended. Families should be encouraged to help children adopt lifestyles that reduce the risk of obesity.

8.2. Gestational diabetes

- Discontinue insulin therapy immediately after the birth in women who were diagnosed with GD; test their blood glucose to exclude persisting hyperglycemia before transfer to community care, and remind them of the symptoms of hyperglycemia.

- Offer lifestyle advice (on weight control, diet, and exercise) and an OGTT performed with 75 g glucose load six weeks after delivery, adopting WHO's criteria for diabetes out of pregnancy, that is a fasting glycemia = 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) and/or glycemia = 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) two hours after the glucose load. Patients who present a fasting glycemia between 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/l) and 125 mg/dl (6.94 mmol/l) are classified as having an impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and those who present a glycemia between 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) and 199 mg/dl (11.06 mmol/l) two hours after glucose load, are considered as having an impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). If the test is normal consider performing at least a fasting plasma glucose measurement annually thereafter (B). Levels of HbA 1c higher than 6.5% should be considered as diagnostic of diabetes. Provide information about the risk of GD in future pregnancies, offer screening for diabetes when planning future pregnancies, and indicate early OGTT in future pregnancies and also self monitoring blood glucose.

8.3. Treatment of co-morbidities after delivery

- **Lipid Therapy**: Statins and fibrates should not be used during breastfeeding because they pass through breast milk and due to the potential for adverse effects to the infant (manufacturers' reports). When triglycerides levels are above 1000 mg/dl (55.55 mmol/l) in the presence of an appropriate diet, due to the high risk of pancreatitis, niacin, fish oil (free of mercury) or quitting breastfeeding should be considered.

- **Antihypertensive Therapy**: Use of ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, low dose thiazides and Methyldopa during breastfeeding, even being transferred to the milk in small amounts, are safe. Atenolol has been associated with bradycardia and hypotension in infants. Propranolol and metoprolol could be indicated but infants should be monitored for manifestations of beta-blockade (C).

### International association of diabetes and pregnancy study groups recommendations on the diagnosis and classification of hyperglycemia in pregnancy [^113k8xAV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Immediate implications

These recommendations have widespread implications. The strategy outlined in Table 2 will finally lead to using a 75-g glucose dose for an OGTT in all clinical settings in or outside of pregnancy. In some regions and/or countries, this represents a substantial change in long-established practices. Glucose testing early in pregnancy to detect overt diabetes and again with a 75-g OGTT at 24–28 weeks' of gestation in all pregnancies not already diagnosed with overt diabetes or GDM by early testing represents fundamental changes in strategies for detection and diagnosis of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. In most areas, using the outcome-linked diagnostic criteria in Table 1 and the detection strategy in Table 2 will substantially increase the frequency of hyperglycemic disorders in pregnancy. However, this is consistent with the high prevalence of obesity and disorders of glucose metabolism in the general population of young adults and with recent reports of a rising prevalence of GDM and preexisting overt diabetes in pregnant women.

Future considerations

In future clinical practice, simpler and more cost-effective strategies that do not require performing an OGTT on most pregnant women may be developed. In the HAPO study, risks of some adverse outcomes were low when FPG was ≤ 4.4 mmol/l (80 mg/dl). However, it was thought that using FPG to potentially identify pregnancies at very low risk for GDM and for adverse outcomes requires further evaluation. Similarly, further evaluation of A1C results from the HAPO study, results from other populations, or new integrated tests of glycemia with a shorter timeframe than A1C might serve this purpose.

The HAPO study was a basic epidemiological investigation that for the first time conclusively identified strong continuous associations of maternal glucose levels below those diagnostic of diabetes with several perinatal outcomes. It was not a clinical trial, but two randomized controlled trials of treatment of mild GDM have been carried out successfully in participants with glucose values that overlap with the thresholds recommended in this report. However, it is likely that additional well-designed randomized controlled trials and other clinical studies will be needed to determine 1) cost-effective therapeutic strategies for treatment of GDM diagnosed by the IADPSG Consensus Panel–recommended criteria; 2) optimal glycemic treatment targets; 3) appropriate follow-up of mothers to determine risks for later development of diabetes, other metabolic disorders, or CVD risk factors; and 4) follow-up of children to assess potential associations of maternal glycemia with long-term risks of obesity, altered glucose metabolism, and CVD risk factors.

### Role of umbilical cord C-peptide levels in early prediction of hypoglycemia in infants of diabetic mothers [^115CVRmg]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite marked declines in neonatal mortality nowadays, diabetes mellitus (DM) with pregnancy either gestational (GDM), type 1, or 2 is still associated with a risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidities and mortalities. Moreover, its prevalence did not decline, as GDM was about 8.74% on one cohort. Infants of a diabetic mother (IDM) often have complications closely linked to fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, induced by maternal hyperglycemia.

In the first trimester, maternal hyperglycemia can cause spontaneous abortions or major birth defects such as truncus arteriosus or aortic coarctation. In the second and third trimesters, maternal hyperglycemia can cause fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which lead to post-natal neonatal hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, polycythemia, hyperbilirubinemia, septal myocardial hypertrophy, delayed lung maturation, and macrosomia.

Most IDMs develop asymptomatic hypoglycemia in the first postnatal hours, as after delivery, the transplacental supply of high glucose is stopped. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is a major risk factor for brain injury and subsequent neurodevelopmental impairments; therefore, rapid identification and prompt management of the newborn with hypoglycemia are essential to avoid brain damage. In this context, early detection of babies at high risk of hypoglycemia is important.

Human C-peptide is a 31-amino acid chain secreted from the beta cells of the pancreas in equimolar ratio with the insulin level. It was chosen over insulin to estimate neonatal hyperinsulinemia, as C-peptide has a long half-life and is unaffected by several blood processing conditions such as hemolysis.

Maternal control during pregnancy mainly depends on diet and insulin control. The degree of control can be increased by serial measurements of blood glucose (BG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C). However, HbA1C, now the current gold standard marker for glycemic control, reflects the BG level over the previous 2–3 months. It is a strong predictor of diabetic complications, and the cut-off used is 6.5% to diagnose diabetes.

Therefore, the main aim of this study is to evaluate the risk factors of hypoglycemia in IDM and its relation to maternal DM control in the last trimester. Furthermore, the relationship between UC C peptide and the risk of developing hypoglycemia was evaluated.

### Evidence for improved glucose metrics and perinatal outcomes with continuous glucose monitoring compared to self-monitoring in diabetes during pregnancy [^1165fNRn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Continuous glucose monitoring is recommended for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, due to associations with decreased hemoglobin A1c and large for gestational age. However, its benefit in type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes is not established. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared usage of continuous glucose monitoring to self-monitoring of blood glucose both across and within diabetes in pregnancy and determined which glucose metrics are associated with perinatal outcomes, to potentially inform treatment targets in diabetes in pregnancy.

Data Sources

We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Scopus, from January 2003 to August 2024.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies comparing continuous glucose monitoring with self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes in pregnancy were included.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were analyzed separately. Data were extracted on continuous glucose monitoring metrics, hemoglobin A1c, rates of cesarean delivery, large for gestational age, small for gestational age, neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal intensive care unit admission, summarized as mean differences or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and 95% prediction intervals. Prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken by diabetes in pregnancy subtype, including duration of continuous glucose monitoring use (continuous vs intermittent) for large for gestational age. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations framework.

Results

Across diabetes in pregnancy, continuous glucose monitoring (vs self-monitoring of blood glucose) decreased hemoglobin A1c (mean difference, -0.22% [95% confidence interval, -0.37, -0.08]) (7 randomized controlled trials, moderate-certainty evidence). Within diabetes in pregnancy, continuous glucose monitoring use (vs self-monitoring of blood glucose) showed similar but stronger benefits in both type 1 diabetes when used throughout pregnancy (hemoglobin A1c mean difference, -0.18% [95% confidence interval, -0.36, 0.00]; large for gestational age odds ratio, 0.51 [0.28, 0.90]) (1 randomized controlled trial, high-certainty evidence), and gestational diabetes when used intermittently (hemoglobin A1c mean difference, -0.18 [95% confidence interval, -0.33, -0.02]) (5 randomized controlled trials, moderate-certainty evidence) and large for gestational age (odds ratio, 0.46 [0.26, 0.81]) (1 quasi-experimental study, low-certainty evidence), with insufficient data for continuous glucose monitoring benefit in type 2 diabetes. Increased pregnancy %time-in-range (type 1 diabetes) and decreased mean sensor glucose (type 1 diabetes/gestational diabetes) were associated with decreased large for gestational age.

Conclusion

Usage of continuous glucose monitoring (vs self-monitoring of blood glucose) reduces hemoglobin A1c and possibly large for gestational age across diabetes in pregnancy. Greatest benefit was evidenced in type 1 diabetes, followed by gestational diabetes, although continuous glucose monitoring duration differed. Mean sensor glucose and pregnancy %time-in-range are important continuous glucose monitoring metrics for reducing large for gestational age.

### Proposed diagnostic thresholds for gestational diabetes mellitus according to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. maternal and perinatal outcomes in 3260 Danish women [^113pYPCy]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To study if established diagnostic threshold values for gestational diabetes based on a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test can be supported by maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Methods

Historical cohort study of 3260 pregnant women examined for gestational diabetes on the basis of risk indicators. Information on oral glucose tolerance test results and clinical outcomes were collected from medical records.

Results

There was an increased risk of delivering a macrosomic infant in women with 2-h capillary blood glucose of 7.8–8.9 mmol/l compared with women with 2-h glucose < 7.8 mmol/l. Despite treatment, 2-h glucose of 9.0–11.0 mmol/l and ≥ 11.1 mmol/l were both associated with increased rates of macrosomia, spontaneous preterm delivery, hypertensive complications, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Adverse outcomes tended to be more frequent in women with 2-h glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/l than in women with 2-h glucose of 9.0–11.0 mmol/l.

Conclusions

The risk for several maternal and perinatal complications increased with the diagnostic threshold for 2-h glucose. Large-scale blinded studies are needed to clarify the question of a clinically meaningful diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus. Until these results are available, a 2-h threshold level of 9.0 mmol/l after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test seems acceptable.

### Guideline no. 393-diabetes in pregnancy [^1161yXga]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2019). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, SOGC 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for diabetes in all pregnant individuals between 24–28 weeks of gestation, using a standardized non-fasting 50-g glucose challenge screening test with plasma glucose measured 1 hour later. Do not obtain further testing if the value is < 7.8 mmol/L. Obtain a 2-hour 75-g OGTT with fasting plasma glucose, 1-hour plasma glucose, and 2-hour plasma glucose if the value of the glucose challenge screening is 7.8–11.0.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^111c8V8H]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — management of neonatal hypoglycemia (gestational age ≥ 35 +0/7 weeks) outlines prevention and risk identification: For all infants, promote early feeding, including breastfeeding within the first hour and formula volumes if not breastfeeding, and for infants with signs of hypoglycemia, check plasma glucose immediately. Infants at risk include those admitted to NICU, with perinatal stress or hypothermia, preterm infants (< 37 weeks), those with respiratory distress, growth restriction/size concerns, or maternal diabetes that is poorly controlled.

### Continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring system in diabetic mothers during labour and postnatal glucose adaptation of their infants [^111K5TUa]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess a new technique for continuous monitoring of glucose concentration during labour in diabetic mothers. A second objective was to study maternal glucose levels in relation to postnatal glucose adaptation and the need for intravenous (IV) glucose treatment in the newborn infant.

Methods

Fifteen pregnant women with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus participated in this prospective pilot study. To measure their glucose control during labour we used the Continuous Subcutaneous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to calculate the mean glucose concentration and the area under the curve (AUC) in the last 120 min before delivery. All infants of these women were transferred to the neonatal care unit for early oral feeding and blood glucose measurements up to 14 h after delivery. Infants received IV glucose if blood glucose values were repeatedly < 2.2 mmol/l.

Results

All women coped well with the CGMS monitoring. AUC 0–120 min before delivery, mean glucose concentration 0–120 min before delivery and cord plasma insulin level were all significantly associated with the need for IV glucose in the newborn children.

Conclusions

In this study we found an association between maternal glucose concentrations during labour and postnatal glucose adaptation and need for IV glucose treatment in the infants. Online monitoring of glucose levels during delivery might help us to achieve maternal normoglycaemia and further reduce the risk of postnatal hypoglycaemia in the offspring.

### Screening and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycaemia in at-risk late preterm and term infants following AAP recommendations: a single centre retrospective study [^1133Lh3T]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Transitional hypoglycaemia within 48 hours after birth is common in healthy newborns as the body's metabolism adjusts postnatally. However, prolonged hypoglycaemia is associated with concerns for neurological morbidity. Controversy remains regarding the definition of hypoglycaemia and threshold for treatment in asymptomatic newborns. We published a survey in 2021 reporting notable variation among 84 participating US hospitals for the definition of hypoglycaemia, threshold for treatment and criteria for NICU admission. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published a clinical report in 2011 with guidelines for blood glucose screening and treatment. The AAP advocates screening babies with risk factors including small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age (LGA), infant of diabetic mothers (IDM), late preterm infants (LPI, gestational age < 37 weeks) and newborns with symptoms (including jitteriness, cyanosis, seizures, apnoea, tachypnoea, weak or high-pitched cry, floppiness, lethargy and poor feeding). Moreover, AAP defines diagnosis of hypoglycaemia as glucose < 40 mg/dL in the first 4 hours of life or < 45 mg/dL 4–24 hours of life and recommends hypoglycaemia treatment intervention at < 25 mg/dL in the first 4 hours of life or < 35 mg/dL between 4 and 24 hours of life. However, many published studies use higher definitional values for hypoglycaemia (< 47 mg/dL or < 50 mg/dL).

Repeated and potentially unnecessary blood glucose monitoring in asymptomatic newborns presents the risk of pain, risk for infection, interruption of breast feeding, increased parental anxiety and increased hospital costs. The definition of hypoglycaemia and threshold for treatment in asymptomatic newborns affects mother–infant separation (NICU admission) rates. The AAP guideline accounts for transient hypoglycaemia in newborns and includes a range of glucose levels at different times to specifically identify prolonged hypoglycaemia and recommends checking the first glucose value only after the first feed, taking into consideration the natural transient hypoglycaemia after birth, which supported by a published study measuring glucose values after feeds in IDM infants. However, there is limited evidence evaluating the implementation of the AAP guidelinesfor diagnosis and treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia protocols based on risk factors, with time sensitive thresholds for diagnosis and treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia, may decrease the number of infants being diagnosed with hypoglycaemia and requiring NICU admissions.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the characteristics associated with the screening and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycaemia in asymptomatic at-risk newborns, using the AAP recommended guidelines.

### Lower versus higher glycemic criteria for diagnosis of gestational diabetes [^116kwXKq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment of gestational diabetes improves maternal and infant health, although diagnostic criteria remain unclear.

Methods

We randomly assigned women at 24 to 32 weeks' gestation in a 1:1 ratio to be evaluated for gestational diabetes with the use of lower or higher glycemic criteria for diagnosis. The lower glycemic criterion was a fasting plasma glucose level of at least 92 mg per deciliter (≥ 5.1 mmol per liter), a 1-hour level of at least 180 mg per deciliter (≥ 10.0 mmol per liter), or a 2-hour level of at least 153 mg per deciliter (≥ 8.5 mmol per liter). The higher glycemic criterion was a fasting plasma glucose level of at least 99 mg per deciliter (≥ 5.5 mmol per liter) or a 2-hour level of at least 162 mg per deciliter (≥ 9.0 mmol per liter). The primary outcome was the birth of an infant who was large for gestational age (defined as a birth weight above the 90th percentile according to Fenton-World Health Organization standards). Secondary outcomes were maternal and infant health.

Results

A total of 4061 women underwent randomization. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed in 310 of 2022 women (15.3%) in the lower-glycemic-criteria group and in 124 of 2039 women (6.1%) in the higher-glycemic-criteria group. Among 2019 infants born to women in the lower-glycemic-criteria group, 178 (8.8%) were large for gestational age, and among 2031 infants born to women in the higher-glycemic-criteria group, 181 (8.9%) were large for gestational age (adjusted relative risk, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.80 to 1.19; P = 0.82). Induction of labor, use of health services, use of pharmacologic agents, and neonatal hypoglycemia were more common in the lower-glycemic-criteria group than in the higher-glycemic-criteria group. The results for the other secondary outcomes were similar in the two trial groups, and there were no substantial between-group differences in adverse events. Among the women in both groups who had glucose test results that fell between the lower and higher glycemic criteria, those who were treated for gestational diabetes (195 women), as compared with those who were not (178 women), had maternal and infant health benefits, including fewer large-for-gestational-age infants.

Conclusions

The use of lower glycemic criteria for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes did not result in a lower risk of a large-for-gestational-age infant than the use of higher glycemic criteria.

### Evaluation of risk factors and approach to screening for asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia [^1144gHce]. Neonatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Protocols to identify asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia (NH) rely on the presence of established risk factors (late preterm gestation, large or small for gestational age, and infant of a diabetic mother) for inclusion. We analyzed the performance of these risk factors in identifying hypoglycemia in modern practice, and additionally evaluated the optimal duration of screening blood glucose measurements.

Methods

We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 830 infants with 1 or more known risk factor(s) for NH admitted to the mother-baby unit of a single tertiary-care center from May 2017 to April 2018. Manual chart review was performed for data extraction and confirmation of risk factor(s). Infants were excluded if glucose measurements were obtained for any reason other than screening for asymptomatic NH.

Results

Of the 830 included infants, 31 (3.7%) ultimately received intravenous dextrose (IVD). Most screened infants (n = 510, 61.4%) did not develop hypoglycemia. None of the established risk factors showed strong association with hypoglycemia. Cesarean delivery was associated with hypoglycemia, although not strongly. All infants who received IVD for feeding-refractory hypoglycemia were identified by the first 2 measurements with nearly all (30/31, 97%) identified at the initial measurement.

Conclusions

Currently accepted risk factors are limited in their ability to identify infants who subsequently develop hypoglycemia, and as a result, most screened infants do not develop hypoglycemia. The majority of infants in our cohort who did develop hypoglycemia achieved normoglycemia with feeding-based interventions and did not require IVD. Those that received IVD were more likely to develop hypoglycemia early and to a more severe degree. Together, our data suggest further refinement of protocol duration and risk factors utilized for screening as potential areas of screening protocol optimization.

### Techniques of monitoring blood glucose during pregnancy for women with pre-existing diabetes [^1111vTXK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended as a key component of the management plan for diabetes therapy during pregnancy. No existing systematic reviews consider the benefits/effectiveness of various techniques of blood glucose monitoring on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. The effectiveness of the various monitoring techniques is unclear.

Objectives

To compare techniques of blood glucose monitoring and their impact on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2016), searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing techniques of blood glucose monitoring including SMBG, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or clinic monitoring among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2). Trials investigating timing and frequency of monitoring were also included. RCTs using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

This review update includes at total of 10 trials (538) women (468 women with type 1 diabetes and 70 women with type 2 diabetes). The trials took place in Europe and the USA. Five of the 10 included studies were at moderate risk of bias, four studies were at low to moderate risk of bias, and one study was at high risk of bias. The trials are too small to show differences in important outcomes such as macrosomia, preterm birth, miscarriage or death of baby. Almost all the reported GRADE outcomes were assessed as being very low-quality evidence. This was due to design limitations in the studies, wide confidence intervals, small sample sizes, and few events. In addition, there was high heterogeneity for some outcomes. Various methods of glucose monitoring were compared in the trials. Neither pooled analyses nor individual trial analyses showed any clear advantages of one monitoring technique over another for primary and secondary outcomes. Many important outcomes were not reported.1. Self-monitoring versus standard care (two studies, 43 women): there was no clear difference for caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.49; one study, 28 women) or glycaemic control (both very low-quality), and not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality and morbidity composite. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, neurosensory disability, and preterm birth were not reported in either study.2. Self-monitoring versus hospitalisation (one study, 100 women): there was no clear difference for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and hypertension) (RR 4.26, 95% CI 0.52 to 35.16; very low-quality: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.22; very low-quality). There was no clear difference in caesarean section or preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (both very low quality), and the sample size was too small to assess perinatal mortality (very low-quality). Large-for-gestational age, mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability and preterm birth less than 34 weeks were not reported.3. Pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring (one study, 61 women): there was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.28; very low-quality), large-for-gestational age (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.85; very low-quality) or glycaemic control (very low-quality). The results for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: pre-eclampsia and perinatal mortality are not meaningful because these outcomes were too rare to show differences in a small sample (all very low-quality). The study did not report the outcomes mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability or preterm birth.4. Automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system (three studies, 84 women): there was no clear difference for caesarean section (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48; one study, 32 women; very low-quality), and mortality or morbidity composite in the one study that reported these outcomes. There were no clear differences for glycaemic control (very low-quality). No studies reported hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal mortality), neurosensory disability or preterm birth.5.CGM versus intermittent monitoring (two studies, 225 women): there was no clear difference for pre-eclampsia (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.59; low-quality), caesarean section (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54; I² = 62%; very low-quality) and large-for-gestational age (average RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.92; I² = 82%; very low-quality). Glycaemic control indicated by mean maternal HbA1c was lower for women in the continuous monitoring group (mean difference (MD) -0.60%, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.29; one study, 71 women; moderate-quality). There was not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality and there were no clear differences for preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (low-quality). Mortality or morbidity composite, neurosensory disability and preterm birth less than 34 weeks were not reported.6. Constant CGM versus intermittent CGM (one study, 25 women): there was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.79; very low-quality), glycaemic control (mean blood glucose in the 3rd trimester) (MD -0.14 mmol/L, 95% CI -2.00 to 1.72; very low-quality) or preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.08 to 15.46; very low-quality). Other primary (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal mortality), mortality or morbidity composite, and neurosensory disability) or GRADE outcomes (preterm birth less than 34 weeks' gestation) were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no evidence that any glucose monitoring technique is superior to any other technique among pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The evidence base for the effectiveness of monitoring techniques is weak and additional evidence from large well-designed randomised trials is required to inform choices of glucose monitoring techniques.

### The TANGO-DM randomized controlled trial protocol: treatment outcomes for gestational diabetes diagnosed according to WHO 2013 or WHO 1999 thresholds [^1137kUSM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), or hyperglycemia first diagnosed in pregnancy, affects 7–10% of all pregnancies worldwide. Perinatal risk rises with increasing glycemia at oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The new (2013) WHO criteria recommend a lower fasting, and a higher post-load threshold for GDM diagnosis in comparison to the old (1999) WHO criteria. To date, however, outcomes of GDM treatment for those affected by the altered diagnostic criteria, has not been well investigated. We hypothesized that intensive GDM treatment according to the new (2013) GDM criteria would result in a reduction in infants with birth weight > 90th centile (large for gestational age, LGA), in comparison to treatment according to the old criteria (1999).

Methods

The TANGO-DM trial is an open label, multicenter randomized controlled trial. Participants are pregnant with a gestational age between 16 + 0 and 32 + 0 weeks, who underwent a 1-step venous 2- or 3-point 75-gram oral OGTT, were eligible if they had glucose concentrations discordant between the old (1999) and the new (2013) criteria. After informed consent, women are randomized to either intensive GDM treatment, consisting of dietary advice and glucose monitoring and, if euglycemia is not reached, antihyperglycemic agents, or normal obstetric care without GDM treatment. The primary outcome is large-for-gestational-age infants (birth weight > 90th percentile). Secondary outcome measures include maternal complications, obstetric complications, neonatal complications, obstetric interventions, quality of life, and healthcare and societal costs. Outcomes will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The study is powered to detect a reduction in LGA from 16% in the untreated to 10% in the treated group, which requires 1032 participants (516 per arm; alpha-error 5% for 80% power).

Discussion

The TANGO-DM trial will provide high-level evidence to support or refute the use of the new 2013 WHO diagnostic criteria in terms of their ability to lower the number of large for gestational age infants and/or improve maternal and perinatal outcomes and/or costs in women with gestational diabetes.

### Balancing weight and glucose in gestational diabetes mellitus [^1155EQMP]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of GDM remains controversial, and there is a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference to examine the issue in March. The new ADA criteria will diagnose between 9–25% of the pregnant population with a disease, have major implications for the mother in terms of glucose monitoring, may involve diabetes medications, will mean more obstetrical monitoring and interventions, and a medical label of high risk for the future that will influence the mother's insurance premiums in most U.S. states. All of this is based on an observational study — not an intervention study demonstrating benefit; meanwhile, reports are now showing that at these levels of glycemia that glucose is playing a minimal role in LGA. Glucose contributes to these adverse outcomes, but it is unlikely that we have to diagnose nearly 20% as the IADPSG criteria suggest in order to get the optimum benefits. Criteria that diagnose and capture a twofold increased risk of LGA with half the frequency of GDM might be a better balance. Before increasing the concerns of pregnant women for their infants more reasoned debate is needed: waiting for the Consensus Conference outcome would be a first good step for the U.S. For the rest of the world, the allure of consensus should not lead to medicalization of so many pregnancies for so little benefit to the mother and her child.

Finally, there is the reality that most LGA occurs independent of obesity and hyperglycemia. Many of us have cared for women with type 1 diabetes or GDM who, despite excellent glucose control and scrupulous attention to management, deliver macrosomic infants. Though one explanation may be the raised IGF-1 present in maternal and fetal circulations, I suspect things are more complex. Perhaps a metabolomic approach in women with LGA infants may be a lot more fruitful than endlessly debating criteria for GDM. There may be an unrecognized placental hormone with high levels in diabetic or obese women that causes LGA and may even have a role in obesity. Now that would be a good outcome of this debate!

### 25% dextrose infant [^1132SdnV]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when intravenous dextrose is given to pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and seal is intact. Discard unused portion.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in infants of diabetic mothers except as may be indicated in neonates who are hypoglycemic.

Care should be exercised to insure that the needle is well within the lumen of the vein and that extravasation does not occur. If thrombosis should occur during administration, the injection should be stopped and corrective measures instituted.

Concentrated dextrose solutions should not be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Studies with 25% dextrose solutions in polypropylene syringes have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility.

Pregnancy Category C.

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with dextrose. It is also not known whether dextrose can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Dextrose should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^115AYvZP]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening and diagnosis — All pregnant women should be screened for GDM at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation, and universal screening is recommended. GDM can be diagnosed with either the one-step or the two-step approach using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). For the one-step method, criteria for GDM are fasting glucose level ≥ 92 mg/dL, 1-hour postglucose challenge value ≥ 180 mg/dL, or 2-hour value ≥ 153 mg/dL. With the two-step sequential screening approach using a nonfasting 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge test between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation, screening cutoffs are 130 mg/dL (90% sensitivity) or 140 mg/dL (80% sensitivity); for a positive screen, GDM is diagnosed if 2 or more PG values meet or exceed fasting 95 mg/dL, 1-hour ≥ 180 mg/dL, 2-hour ≥ 155 mg/dL, or 3-hour ≥ 140 mg/dL on a 3-hour 100-g OGTT. In a randomized controlled trial, the diagnosis of GDM was twice as high with the one-step approach (16.5% vs 8.5%), there were no differences in neonatal or maternal outcomes, and screening adherence was 66% for one-step versus 92% for two-step.

### Early blood glucose screening in asymptomatic high-risk neonates [^111hyhgE]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Detecting and treating severe hypoglycemia promptly after birth is crucial due to its association with adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, limited data are available on the optimal timing of glucose screening in asymptomatic high-risk neonates prone to hypoglycemia. Risk factors associated with asymptomatic high-risk neonates include late prematurity ≥ 35 and < 37 weeks gestation (LPT), small-for-gestational-age (SGA), large-for-gestational-age (LGA), and infant-of-a-diabetic mother (IDM). This study aims to determine the incidence and the impact of individual risk factors on early hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose ≤ 25 mg/dL in the initial hour after birth) in asymptomatic high-risk neonates.

Methods

All asymptomatic high-risk neonates ≥ 35 weeks gestation underwent early blood glucose screening within the first hour after birth (n = 1,690). A 2-year retrospective analysis was conducted to assess the incidence of early neonatal hypoglycemia in this cohort and its association with hypoglycemia risk factors.

Results

Out of the 9,919 births, 1,690 neonates (17%) had risk factors for neonatal hypoglycemia, prompting screening within the first hour after birth. Incidence rates for blood glucose ≤ 25 mg/dL and ≤ 15 mg/dL were 3.1 and 0.89%, respectively. Of concern, approximately 0.5% of all asymptomatic at-risk neonates had a blood glucose value of ≤ 10 mg/dL. LPT and LGA were the risk factors significantly associated with early neonatal hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic high-risk neonates, particularly LPT and LGA neonates, may develop early severe neonatal hypoglycemia identified by blood glucose screening in the first hour of life. Additional investigation is necessary to establish protocols for screening and managing asymptomatic high-risk neonates.

### Neonatal hypoglycemia screening practices in infants born to mothers without glucose tolerance testing [^114vtBMF]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study describes neonatal hypoglycemia (NH) screening for infants born to mothers without adequate oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT).

Study Design

In this single-center, retrospective study, authors reviewed live births of term and late-preterm infants at a single military hospital from 2014 to 2021. All mothers without adequate OGTT were identified. Charts were evaluated to assess NH screening practices for infants.

Results

Out of 13,338 deliveries, 0.98% (131) of infants were born to mothers without adequate OGTT. One hundred and two of these infants had no other indication for NH screening. Sixty-eight percent (69/102) of these infants were screened with at least one point of care (POC) blood glucose measurement and 61.7% (63/102) were screened with at least three POC glucose measurements.

Conclusion

A small percentage of mothers in this population didn't receive adequate OGTT. Sixty-eight percent of the infants born to these mothers were screened for NH.

### A feed-centric hypoglycaemia pathway ensures appropriate care escalation in at-risk infants [^112NGtDM]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Glucose-centric pathways

In the GCP, hypoglycaemia was defined as capillary glucose ≤ 2.5 mmol/L. Figure 1 describes the GCP process, and table 1 shows the criteria of at-risk infants who received screening. At-risk infants were identified at birth and had capillary glucose monitored at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours of age. Subsequent care depended on the glucose levels at 0 and 1 hour. All infants were directly admitted to SCN if capillary glucose was ≤ 2.5 mmol/L at 0 and 1 hour of life. Plasma glucose was performed for verification if capillary glucose was suggestive of hypoglycaemia. For all asymptomatic infants who were unable to maintain capillary glucose > 2.5 mmol/L, formula feeds were offered as the first intervention. Term infants, large for gestational age and infants of diabetic mothers, were offered a supplementary feed and care was escalated to intravenous glucose if capillary glucose remained ≤ 2.5 mmol/L. All preterm infants were given intravenous glucose when capillary glucose was ≤ 2.5 mmol/L. In addition, parenteral glucagon was also offered to infants weighing > 2500 g if they remained hypoglycaemic. Intravenous glucose was indicated in any at-risk infant with glucose levels < 1 mmol/L, even when asymptomatic. Capillary glucose was tested within 60 min after any intervention, such as an increase in feed volume, commencement of intravenous fluids, change in glucose infusion rate, or administration of parenteral glucagon. All infants of diabetic mothers were admitted to SCN irrespective of glucose metre results.

### Management of diabetes in pregnancy: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113iy4jR]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancy — targets and device selection — notes that real-time CGM in pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes showed a mild improvement in A1C and significant improvements in maternal time in range (TIR) and time above range (TAR), without an increase in hypoglycemia, and reductions in large-for-gestational-age births, length of infant hospital stays, and severe neonatal hypoglycemia; there are insufficient data to support the use of CGM in all people with type 2 diabetes or GDM, and whether to use CGM should be individualized based on treatment, circumstances, preferences, and needs. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia measured by intermittently scanning CGM (isCGM) should therefore not necessarily lead to a reduction of insulin dose and/or increased carbohydrate intake at bedtime unless confirmed by blood glucose meter measurements, and selection of CGM device should be based on an individual's circumstances, preferences, and needs. Goals for sensor glucose ranges in pregnancy are sensor glucose range 63–140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L) with TIR, goal > 70%; TBR (< 63 mg/dL [< 3.5 mmol/L]): level 1 TBR, goal < 4%; TBR (< 54 mg/dL [< 3.0 mmol/L]): level 2 TBR, goal < 1%; and TAR (> 140 mg/dL [> 7.8 mmol/L]): TAR, goal < 25%; goals for time spent in each range are specific for pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113S4HDN]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gestational diabetes treatment — maternal and infant outcomes after 24 weeks are summarized as follows: Harms associated with the treatment were evaluated in 13 trials (11 RCTs and 2 nonrandomized clinical trials; n = 4235), and treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after was not associated with an increased risk for severe maternal hypoglycemia, low birth weight, or small for gestational age infants. Treatment of gestational diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of macrosomia (> 4000 g) (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68]) but no difference in the risk of total number of cesarean deliveries (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.08]), and there was no observed difference of small for gestational age infants based on race/ethnicity or glycemic status.

### Determinants of body fat in infants of women with gestational diabetes mellitus differ with fetal sex [^115Vyi4f]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A number of strengths add to the value of this study. We have used a robust method of assessing neonatal body composition that has been validated in a number of studies. Air displacement plethysmography is now considered a gold standard method for assessment of body composition in children. In addition, we have used mean maternal BGLs across the third trimester during treatment rather than the results of a single glucose tolerance test, providing a long-term picture of maternal metabolic conditions. There are also a number of limitations. The low sample size prevents some additional interesting analysis, such as whether lower targets would prevent excess body fat in either male or female infants and what these targets should be. We also were not able to perform separate analysis of non-white ethnicities or analysis of adiposity in infants of women not meeting targets. Additional information could have been obtained if paternal height and weight had been recorded.

Different factors predict adiposity in male and female infants born to women with GDM. The observation that female infant adiposity is more highly influenced by maternal BMI may be important in understanding the potential generational cycle of obesity. Control of maternal glucose levels does not appear to be an adequate approach to reducing female infant adiposity, and future research needs to examine this issue and whether GDM treatment should be altered according to the sex of the infant to normalize infant adiposity.

### Evaluation of the impact of universal testing for gestational diabetes mellitus on maternal and neonatal health outcomes: a retrospective analysis [^113iSWNX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Between 2004 and 2006 (selectively offered group), 17,160 women gave birth; 1162 (7%) were offered an OGTT following risk assessment by their clinician and 1151 completed the test (7% of all women and 99% of those offered the test). Between 2008 and 2010, (universally offered group) 18,514 women gave birth, 18,328 (99%) were offered an OGTT and 11,516 completed the test (62% of all women and 63% of those offered the test) (Table 1). For births occurring between 2004–2006, amongst those who completed the OGTT 58% were from an ethnic group with increased risk (the most common risk factor) compared with 55% after the policy change (risk ratio 0.95, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.03). Obesity was the second most common individual risk factor for women selectively offered an OGTT (Additional file 1: Table S1). A small proportion (1%) of the women in the universally offered group were not offered an OGTT, reasons were: pre-existing diabetes or late attendance for antenatal care. Of those attending for the OGTT (after group only), 3% did not complete the test either because they had been unable to fast overnight or were unable to drink the glucose solution due to nausea. These women were all offered a second appointment and over 99% completed the test at that second appointment.

### The TANGO-DM randomized controlled trial protocol: treatment outcomes for gestational diabetes diagnosed according to WHO 2013 or WHO 1999 thresholds [^117AfPBj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), or hyperglycemia first diagnosed in pregnancy, affects 7–10% of all pregnancies worldwide. Perinatal risk rises with increasing glycemia at oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The new (2013) WHO criteria recommend a lower fasting, and a higher post-load threshold for GDM diagnosis in comparison to the old (1999) WHO criteria. To date, however, outcomes of GDM treatment for those affected by the altered diagnostic criteria, has not been well investigated. We hypothesized that intensive GDM treatment according to the new (2013) GDM criteria would result in a reduction in infants with birth weight > 90th centile (large for gestational age, LGA), in comparison to treatment according to the old criteria (1999).

Methods

The TANGO-DM trial is an open label, multicenter randomized controlled trial. Participants are pregnant with a gestational age between 16+0 and 32+0 weeks, who underwent a 1-step venous 2- or 3-point 75-gram oral OGTT, were eligible if they had glucose concentrations discordant between the old (1999) and the new (2013) criteria. After informed consent, women are randomized to either intensive GDM treatment, consisting of dietary advice and glucose monitoring and, if euglycemia is not reached, antihyperglycemic agents, or normal obstetric care without GDM treatment. The primary outcome is large-for-gestational-age infants (birth weight > 90th percentile). Secondary outcome measures include maternal complications, obstetric complications, neonatal complications, obstetric interventions, quality of life, and healthcare and societal costs. Outcomes will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The study is powered to detect a reduction in LGA from 16% in the untreated to 10% in the treated group, which requires 1032 participants (516 per arm; alpha-error 5% for 80% power).

Discussion

The TANGO-DM trial will provide high-level evidence to support or refute the use of the new 2013 WHO diagnostic criteria in terms of their ability to lower the number of large for gestational age infants and/or improve maternal and perinatal outcomes and/or costs in women with gestational diabetes.

ABM Clinical Protocols — Newborn hypoglycemia treatment states that specific treatment for hypoglycemia will be determined by your baby's health care provider based on detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and initial lab testing; treatment for hypoglycemia depends on how low your baby's blood glucose is and how well your baby is feeding, where in some cases frequent feeding is enough to improve your baby's blood glucose level and in other cases your baby may be given extra expressed breastmilk, pasteurized donor human milk, or infant formula (with your permission), glucose gel rubbed into your baby's mouth, or intravenous glucose.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^11278P1Q]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — glucose screening and monitoring in at‑risk term and late preterm neonates states that glucose screening should be performed on all at‑risk infants and those with clinical signs compatible with hypoglycemia; monitoring should begin within 60 minutes after birth for infants with suspected significant hyperinsulinemia and should commence before the second feeding, or 2–4 hours after birth, in other at‑risk groups; monitoring should continue until acceptable preprandial levels are consistently obtained with at least three satisfactory measurements; for hypoglycemia persisting beyond 48 hours, or for severe hypoglycemia at any time, urgent investigation is recommended; for severe persistent hypoglycemia, the PES recommends a "safety" fast of 6–8 hours before discharge while maintaining preprandial blood glucose > 60 mg/dL; late preterm and small for gestational age infants should be monitored for 24 hours; bedside enzymatic glucose screening tests must be confirmed by formal laboratory testing, and POC enzymatic glucometers do not need confirmation.

### Treating hyperglycemia in early pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^114nBbKu]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating women with gestational diabetes mellitus in the third trimester improves perinatal outcomes. It is unknown whether treating women with mild glucose intolerance earlier in pregnancy would be beneficial in the reduction of maternal and neonatal morbidities.

Objective

In women with hyperglycemia (hemoglobin A1c ≥ 5.7% and/or fasting glucose ≥ 92 mg/dL) in early pregnancy, we sought to determine whether immediate treatment improved maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Study Design

This unblinded randomized controlled trial enrolled women with hyperglycemia at ≤ 15+0 weeks gestation between 2013 and 2015. Participants were assigned randomly to early pregnancy or third-trimester treatment of hyperglycemia that included nutrition counseling, glucose monitoring, and medications as needed. Participants underwent a blinded 2-hour glucose tolerance test at 24–28 weeks gestation. Exclusion criteria were pregestational diabetes mellitus and multiple gestations. The primary outcome was the proportion of infants with neonatal umbilical cord C-peptide > 1.77 nmoL (90th percentile). Secondary outcomes were neonatal fat mass, infant World Health Organization weight-for-length percentile at birth, maternal gestational weight gain, and diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus on glucose tolerance test. Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and Fisher's exact test were used, as appropriate.

Results

A total of 202 women were assigned randomly; 45 women dropped out before delivery, which left cases 157 for analysis (82 with early pregnancy and 75 with third-trimester treatment). The trial was terminated early because of low enrollment. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There was no difference in C-peptide > 90th percentile between groups (1 [1.5%] vs 4 [6.7%]; p = 0.19) in the early pregnancy and third-trimester groups, respectively). There was also no difference in fat mass (0.37 ± 0.16 vs 0.36 ± 0.17 kg; p = 0.91), weight-for-length percentile at birth (25% vs 25%; p = 0.46), or macrosomia (1.5 vs 5.0%; p = 0.84). Maternal gestational weight gain was 22.6 ± 12.9 lb and 23.9 ± 11.2 lb in the early pregnancy and third-trimester groups, respectively (P = 0.88). Gestational diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 19.0% of the cohort and did not differ between groups (14.2% vs 25.8%; p = 0.17).

Conclusion

In this population of women with hyperglycemia, treatment in early pregnancy did not appear to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes significantly. Given comparable results in both groups, caution should be used in the initiation of an intensive diabetes mellitus treatment protocol for women with the diagnosis of hyperglycemia in early gestation.

### Neonatal hypoglycaemia [^116Hcv3b]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Challenges in screening for hypoglycaemia

Neonatal hypoglycaemia is commonly asymptomatic, unless severe, and clinical assessment has poor sensitivity and specificity for detecting infants with low blood concentrations of glucose. Therefore, most guidelines recommend that infants with known risk factors (eg, maternal diabetes, small or large for gestation, or born preterm) are screened by regular testing for blood glucose concentrations, but there are several difficulties with this approach.

Firstly, screening for neonatal hypoglycaemia arguably does not meet the criteria for a valid screening programme (table 2). Screening programmes should look for a condition where the natural history of the disease is understood, a reliable diagnostic test for the condition of interest in those with a positive screen (in this case, neuroglycopenia) is available, a treatment that has been shown to improve outcomes for those at a presymptomatic stage compared with usual care is available, and the overall benefits of screening should outweigh the harm. The natural history of transitional neonatal hypoglycaemia and its effects on long term neurodevelopmental outcomes, however, are not well understood. No direct evidence exists from randomised trials that treatment of hypoglycaemia improves long term neurodevelopmental outcomesor that the benefits of screening outweigh harm. For some infants, screening might cause more harm than good. As well as the pain caused by heelprick blood tests, in retrospective observational studies of 10 533 and 10 965 infants, respectively, those who were screened for neonatal hypoglycaemia were more likely to be given formula and less likely to be exclusively breastfed, even if their blood glucose concentrations were normal. Infants with risk factors for neonatal hypoglycaemia, however, such as those whose mothers had diabetes and those born by caesarean section, had a higher risk of not being breastfed, independent of hypoglycaemia, so determining if this association is causal is difficult.

### Techniques of monitoring blood glucose during pregnancy for women with pre-existing diabetes [^1154tVXk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recommended as a key component of the management plan for diabetes therapy during pregnancy. No existing systematic reviews consider the benefits/effectiveness of various techniques of blood glucose monitoring on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. The effectiveness of the various monitoring techniques is unclear.

Objectives

To compare techniques of blood glucose monitoring and their impact on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (6 August 2013), searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing techniques of blood glucose monitoring including self blood glucose monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or clinic monitoring among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2). Trials investigating timing and frequency of monitoring were also included. Quasi-RCTs and RCTs using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

The search of the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register identified 21 trial reports. Following application of eligibility criteria, nine trials were included in this review. The included trials involved a total of 506 women (436 women with Type 1 diabetes and 70 women with Type 2 diabetes). All trials originated from European countries and the USA. None of the studies included women with gestational diabetes. Five of the nine included studies were at moderate risk of bias and four studies were at low to moderate risk of bias. Primary outcomes were maternal glycaemic control (fasting blood glucose and HbA1c) and infant birthweight or macrosomia. Various methods of glucose monitoring were compared in the trials. The following comparisons were included in the review: (1) self-monitoring versus standard care, (2) self-monitoring versus hospitalisation, (3) pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring, (4) automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system, (5) CGM versus intermittent monitoring and (6) constant CGM versus intermittent CGM. Neither pooled analyses nor individual trial analyses showed any significant advantages of one monitoring technique over another for primary outcomes (maternal glycaemic control and infant birthweight) and secondary outcomes such as gestational age at birth or preterm birth, frequency of neonatal hypoglycaemia, death of baby including stillbirth, and neonatal intensive care admission. Primary outcome data on macrosomia were reported by one trial but at a different cut-off value than that pre-specified for the review. Secondary outcomes such as shoulder dystocia, major and minor anomalies were not reported by any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no evidence that any glucose monitoring technique is superior to any other technique among pregnant women with pre-existing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The evidence base for the effectiveness of monitoring techniques is weak and additional evidence from large well-designed randomised trials is required to inform choices of glucose monitoring techniques.

### A pragmatic, randomized clinical trial of gestational diabetes screening [^111vGidm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus is common and is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Although experts recommend universal screening for gestational diabetes, consensus is lacking about which of two recommended screening approaches should be used.

Methods

We performed a pragmatic, randomized trial comparing one-step screening (i.e., a glucose-tolerance test in which the blood glucose level was obtained after the oral administration of a 75-g glucose load in the fasting state) with two-step screening (a glucose challenge test in which the blood glucose level was obtained after the oral administration of a 50-g glucose load in the nonfasting state, followed, if positive, by an oral glucose-tolerance test with a 100-g glucose load in the fasting state) in all pregnant women who received care in two health systems. Guidelines for the treatment of gestational diabetes were consistent with the two screening approaches. The primary outcomes were a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, large-for-gestational-age infants, a perinatal composite outcome (stillbirth, neonatal death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture, or any arm or hand nerve palsy related to birth injury), gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, and primary cesarean section.

Results

A total of 23,792 women underwent randomization; women with more than one pregnancy during the trial could have been assigned to more than one type of screening. A total of 66% of the women in the one-step group and 92% of those in the two-step group adhered to the assigned screening. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed in 16.5% of the women assigned to the one-step approach and in 8.5% of those assigned to the two-step approach (unadjusted relative risk, 1.94; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] 1.79 to 2.11). In intention-to-treat analyses, the respective incidences of the other primary outcomes were as follows: large-for-gestational-age infants, 8.9% and 9.2% (relative risk, 0.95; 97.5% CI, 0.87 to 1.05); perinatal composite outcome, 3.1% and 3.0% (relative risk, 1.04; 97.5% CI, 0.88 to 1.23); gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, 13.6% and 13.5% (relative risk, 1.00; 97.5% CI, 0.93 to 1.08); and primary cesarean section, 24.0% and 24.6% (relative risk, 0.98; 97.5% CI, 0.93 to 1.02). The results were materially unchanged in intention-to-treat analyses with inverse probability weighting to account for differential adherence to the screening approaches.

Conclusions

Despite more diagnoses of gestational diabetes with the one-step approach than with the two-step approach, there were no significant between-group differences in the risks of the primary outcomes relating to perinatal and maternal complications.

### Infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening: a systematic review [^113tvAWX]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Neonatal hypoglycemia is common, occurring in up to 50% of infants at risk for hypoglycemia (infant of diabetic mother [IDM], small for gestational age [SGA], large for gestational age [LGA], and preterm) and is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Guidelines recommend screening infants at risk of hypoglycemia. The proportion of infants who require screening for neonatal hypoglycemia is unknown.

Objective

To determine the proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening using criteria from the highest-scoring critically appraised clinical guideline.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify clinical practice guidelines for neonatal hypoglycemia and took place at a tertiary maternity hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible guidelines were critically appraised using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. Using screening criteria extracted from the highest-scoring guideline, the proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening was determined in a retrospective observational cohort study of infants born January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed by logistic regression. Infant participants were included if gestational age was 35 weeks or more, birth weight was 2000 g or more, and they were not admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit less than 1 hour after birth. The data were analyzed from November 2022 through February 2023. A total of 101 372 infants met the inclusion criteria.

Exposure

Risk factors for neonatal hypoglycemia.

Main Outcome

Proportion of infants eligible for neonatal hypoglycemia screening.

Results

The study team screened 2366 abstracts and 18 guidelines met inclusion criteria for appraisal. There was variability in the assessed quality of guidelines and a lack of consensus between screening criteria. The highest-scoring guideline defined screening criteria as: IDM, preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation), SGA (less than 10th percentile), birth weight of less than 2500 g or more than 4500 g, LGA (more than 90th percentile), or gestational age more than 42 weeks. A total of 101 372 infants met criteria for inclusion in the cohort study; median (IQR) gestational age was 39 (38–40) weeks and 51% were male. The overall proportion of infants eligible for screening was 26.3%. There was an increase in the proportion of eligible infants from 25.6% to 28.5% over 15 years, which was not statistically significant after adjustment for maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, and multiple pregnancy (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93–1.03; change in proportion per year).

Conclusion

A systematic review found that practice guidelines providing recommendations for clinical care of neonatal hypoglycemia were of variable quality with is a lack of consensus regarding definitions for infants at risk for hypoglycemia. In the cohort study, one-quarter of infants were eligible for hypoglycemia screening. Further research is required to identify which infants may benefit from neonatal hypoglycemia screening.

### ABM clinical protocol # 27: breastfeeding an infant or young child with insulin-dependent diabetes [^113TjiNP]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #27 — scope and background for breastfeeding infants or young children with insulin-dependent diabetes states that these protocols serve only as guidelines and that variations in treatment may be appropriate to individual needs; it aims to provide guidance on insulin dosing based on carbohydrate intake for breastfeeding infants, assessing carbohydrate in expressed breast milk, dosing for small-volume frequent feeds, goals and methods for glycemic control in breastfeeding infants and young children, and counseling/support to continue breastfeeding after diagnosis. Background notes that the incidence of type 1 diabetes has been rising overall, with about 4% of patients being diagnosed younger than the age of 2 years, that diabetes diagnosed in neonates and young infants is more likely to be of the monogenic form (usually diagnosed before 9 months of age), and that for diabetes requiring insulin the same principles are used for both types of diabetes in infants.

Table 1
Maternal and infant characteristics of all and screened infants

Figure 1
Study cohort flow diagram.

Sixteen per cent of at-risk screened infants were diagnosed with hypoglycaemia; 69% (95/138) of them were diagnosed with hypoglycaemia < 4 hours of age. All 138 infants with hypoglycaemia were identified within the first 3 glucose measurements, with 64% (88/138) identified on the first glucose check and 84% (116/138) identified within the first 2 glucose checks. Thirty-one per cent (36/117) of preterm infants, 15% (30/202) of LGA infants, 13% (26/197) of SGA infants and 15% (81/553) of IDM infants were hypoglycaemic. There was no difference in the per cent of infants with hypoglycaemia when stratifying prematurity to 35 weeks (30%) or 36 weeks (31%). Thirty per cent (166/554) of diabetic mothers were on insulin and 20% (33/166) of their infants had hypoglycaemia compared with 12% (48/388) of infants born to diabetic mothers not on insulin (p = 0.022). C-section births were associated with higher risk for hypoglycaemia, even after adjusting for gestational age. Prematurity and multiple hypoglycaemia risk factors were associated with higher risk of hypoglycaemia even after adjusting for C-section (table 2).

Table 2
Maternal and infant characteristics of hypoglycaemic infants

Seven per cent of infants without risk factors were diagnosed with hypoglycaemia after being tested for various reasons, including 64% due to symptoms (jitteriness, respiratory distress, hypothermia) (figure 1). A total of 6% (161/2873) of all infants were diagnosed with hypoglycaemia.

Five per cent of hypoglycaemic infants were admitted to the NICU for hypoglycaemia treatment. In this study, 0.8% of screened at-risk infants and 0.3% of all infants in MICC were admitted to the NICU for hypoglycaemia treatment (table 2). Of the seven screened at-risk infants who were admitted to the NICU for hypoglycaemia, six infants were identified as having hypoglycaemia within the first two glucose measurements.

### Metabolic screening and postnatal glucose homeostasis in the newborn [^113PQfDh]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Although individual metabolic diseases are relatively uncommon, inherited metabolic diseases collectively represent a more common cause of disease in the neonatal period than is generally appreciated. Newborn screening is among the most successful public health programs today. Every day, newborns considered to be at risk for hypoglycemia are screened. The definition of clinically significant hypoglycemia remains among the most confused and contentious issues in neonatology. There are 2 "competing" methods of defining hypoglycemia that suggest very different levels for management: one based on metabolic-endocrinologic hormones and another that uses outcome data to determine threshold levels of risk.

### Which growth standards should be used to identify large-and small-for-gestational age infants of mothers with type 1 diabetes? A pre-specified analysis of the CONCEPTT trial [^114rmb1d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Birth weight is an important indicator of neonatal well-being. Infants who are small- or large-for-gestational-age (SGA or LGA; birth weight < 10th or > 90th percentile) experience higher risks of morbidity and mortality. Recent population based data suggests that despite improvements in care, infants of women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remain at high risk of LGA (rates ~ 50%). LGA rates were also high in the CONCEPTT international randomized controlled trial of the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in comparison with capillary blood glucose monitoring in pregnant women with T1D. LGA rates were significantly reduced in infants of women who used CGM (53% vs 69% in home blood glucose monitoring group), likely due to improved glycaemic control.

Currently there is controversy internationally about which growth standards to use to compare LGA rates in different populations. Customised (Gestation Related Optimum Weight; GROW) centiles were used in CONCEPTT for the comparison of birthweight across international sites and diagnosis of LGA. GROW centiles are customised to maternal and neonatal factors including maternal ethnicity, height, weight, parity, neonatal sex and gestational age. GROW provides country-specific customised centiles, enabling international comparisons between populations. Advocates suggest that customised centiles reduce over-investigation of normal fetuses and can more accurately predict fetuses at increased risk of stillbirth and perinatal mortality.

Other growth standards based on data from the INTERGROWTH-21st study (20,486 infants across eight geographical areas) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study (8500 infants across six geographical areas) are used internationally. Both standards assume < 3.5% of the variability in growth is due to differences in ethnicity and population when circumstances are optimal (e.g. healthy, well-nourished mothers). INTERGROWTH-21st standards focus on fetal growth and neonatal size at birth, while the WHO charts assess weight-for-age at 0–60 months. In addition, some studies in diabetes pregnancy report standard deviation (SD) based birthweight categorisation.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114CRDcg]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment — screening tests, timing, and scope: A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 16 through March 15, 2021. The USPSTF found that several screening tests (OGCT, OGTT, fasting plasma glucose) and strategies (1- vs 2-step approach) can accurately detect gestational diabetes and does not recommend any single specific test, and based on newer evidence, the USPSTF found no difference between a 1-step and 2-step screening strategy for many maternal or infant outcomes. The USPSTF found limited data on risk-based screening and limited data on the benefits and harms of screening before 24 weeks of gestation, and clarifies that the recommendations do not preclude later screening. The USPSTF notes that detection and management of preexisting diabetes during pregnancy is beyond the scope of this recommendation, and clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.

### Screening and subsequent management for gestational diabetes for improving maternal and infant health [^111FVvyu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy. Although GDM usually resolves following birth, it is associated with significant morbidities for mother and baby both perinatally and in the long term. There is strong evidence to support treatment for GDM. However, there is little consensus on whether or not screening for GDM will improve maternal and infant health and if so, the most appropriate protocol to follow.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different methods of screening for gestational diabetes mellitus and maternal and infant outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of different methods of screening for gestational diabetes mellitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and quality assessment. We resolved disagreements through discussion or through a third author.

Main Results

We included four trials involving 3972 women were included in the review. One quasi-randomised trial compared risk factor screening with universal or routine screening by 50 g oral glucose challenge testing. Women in the universal screening group were more likely to be diagnosed with GDM (one trial, 3152 women, risk ratio (RR) 0.44 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.75). Infants of mothers in the risk factor screening group were born marginally earlier than infants of mothers in the routine screening group (one trial, 3152 women, mean difference -0.15 weeks, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.53). The remaining three trials evaluated different methods of administering a 50 g glucose load. Two small trials compared glucose monomer with glucose polymer testing, with one of these trials including a candy bar group. One trial compared a glucose solution with food. No differences in diagnosis of GDM were found between each comparison. Overall, women drinking the glucose monomer experienced fewer side effects from testing than women drinking the glucose polymer (two trials, 151 women, RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.13). However, we observed high heterogeneity between the trials for this result (I(2) = 61%).

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to determine if screening for gestational diabetes, or what types of screening, can improve maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Umbilical artery cord blood glucose predicted hypoglycemia in gestational diabetes mellitus and other at-risk newborns [^111NjZ3r]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

ROC analyses showed that there were no significant differences in the ability of UACBG predicting neonatal hypoglycemia within 2 h after delivery between GDM group and the other at-risk group, which may be ascribed to diet management on vaginal parturients, early post-delivery breast feeding and optimal maternal glucose management during the antepartum and intrapartum period. However, the umbilical cord blood glucose level is higher in GDM group and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia was different between these two groups, which can be explained by the differences in the pathophysiology of hypoglycemia.

The mechanisms of neonatal hypoglycemia in GDM pregnancies are complex. A fetal hyperinsulinemia environment, impaired ATP-sensitive potassium channel transition and low cerebro-placental ratio, and effort made to control maternal blood glucose during labor and delivery all may facilitate hypoglycemia. In terms of the other at-risk group, among premature newborns, hypoglycemia was related to reduced glycogen storage. In macrosomic infants, neonatal hypoglycemia may be ascribed to their excessive growth, improper response to hypoglycemia antenatally, and abnormal distribution of neonatal fat mass and weight. Infants born with low birth weight have low mobilized energy stores, absence of substrate source for gluconeogenesis, inappropriate secretion of insulin, increased insulin sensitivity, and decreased counter-regulatory hormones.

This study has two clinical implications. Firstly, it is recommended that during delivery, cord blood should be collected and blood glucose levels should be measured, which was a non-invasive method to predict the future risk of neonatal hypoglycemia for high-risk infants, including those with GDM, macrosomic, low birth weight, and preterm birth. Secondly, the results of this study suggest that cord blood glucose has a high NPV for predicting neonatal hypoglycemia. Therefore, stratified management should be implemented for newborns. When cord blood glucose is above the cutoff value, it indicates a lower risk of hypoglycemia in the infant. For individuals with cord blood glucose below the threshold, blood glucose monitoring and management should be implemented, including timely initiation of breastfeeding, mother-infant contact, and regular blood glucose monitoring, to prevent neonatal hypoglycemia. Cord blood testing and stratified management of newborns can reduce the pain and infection risks associated with repeated invasive blood glucose monitoring for low-risk infants. The reduction in clinical nursing workload makes it worthy of clinical promotion.

### ABM clinical protocol # 27: breastfeeding an infant or young child with insulin-dependent diabetes [^113ktqNY]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #27 — summary recommendations for breastfeeding in infants and young children with diabetes state that, when calculation of carbohydrate intake is utilized for insulin dosing, a carbohydrate concentration of 70 g/L can be used for breast milk (IA). The norms for 24-hour total volumes of breast milk can be used in determining the amount of breast milk consumed by the infant at a single feed (IIB, IV). For infants who have a small volume frequent style of food consumption, blood glucose levels should be measured every 3 hours and insulin doses given for correction of levels above the glycemic target (IV). When feasible, infant weights before and after a breastfeed can be used to determine the amount of milk usually consumed by the infant at each feed (IV). Support should be provided to the families of infants and young children diagnosed with diabetes along with tailoring the diabetes management plan to the patterns of breastfeeding and the needs of the mother–infant dyad (III/IV). Quality-of-evidence labels in parentheses follow levels used for the National Guidelines Clearing House.

### Screening for diabetes in pregnancy: a recommendation from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative [^114cgxrW]. WPSI (2023). High credibility.

Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) implementation considerations recommend screening pregnant women for GDM after 24 weeks of gestation with either the 50-g oral glucose challenge test (followed by a 3-hour 100-g oral glucose tolerance test if results on the initial oral glucose challenge test are abnormal) or a 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Risk factors that may identify women for screening before 24 weeks include overweight or obese body mass index (BMI), previous GDM, family history of first- or second-degree relatives with type 2 diabetes, maternal age of 35 years or older, previous delivery of an infant weighing 4,000 g or more, polycystic ovarian syndrome, or identifying with a racial or ethnic group with increased risk for type 2 diabetes (American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian American [at lower BMI], Black, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander). The optimal test for screening before 24 weeks of gestation is not known; however, acceptable modalities may include a 50-g oral glucose challenge test, a 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, a hemoglobin A1C test, or a fasting plasma glucose test, and if early screening is normal, screening with an oral glucose challenge test should be conducted at 24–28 weeks of gestation.

Recommendations for future research — breastfeeding and diabetes technology note that there is a need for a prospective longitudinal database to track breastfeeding rates and monitor outcomes of infants with diabetes, and that studies evaluating the feasibility and benefit of current technologies (insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS)) in infants and young children with diabetes are needed. In the United States and European Union, CGMS are only approved for use in children older than 2 years of age.

### Evaluation of the impact of universal testing for gestational diabetes mellitus on maternal and neonatal health outcomes: a retrospective analysis [^1145Hvy7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also recommends a two-step approach. Women are screened for GDM at 24 to 26 weeks, either by patient history, risk factors or 50 g one hour glucose challenge test and if screen positive offered a 100 g OGTT. GDM diagnosis is made using criteria from Carpenter and Coustan or the National Diabetes Data Group. By contrast the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group (indorsed by the American Diabetes Association) recommend all women not previously identified as having type 2 diabetes (irrespective of risk factors) are offered a diagnostic 75 g OGTT at 24–28 weeks. GDM is diagnosed if any one of plasma glucose levels are > 5.0 mmol/l, one hour > 9.9 mmol/l or two hour > 8.4 mmol/l is found.

Current screening recommendations are based on evidence from observational studies with no evidence that diagnosis using any of the above strategies improves perinatal or long term adverse outcomes or is cost-effective. Consequently the US Preventative Services Taskforce recommends clinicians discuss screening for GDM with each woman and case by case decisions made based on risk status. Selectively offering women an OGTT based on risk factor assessment and universally offering an OGTT to some extent represent the extremes of possible approaches for identifying women at risk. Theoretically the former approach may have a high false negative rate and miss the opportunity to prevent adverse perinatal outcomes in women at risk, whereas the latter approach may over-diagnose, cause unnecessary anxiety and may not be cost-effective in improving perinatal outcomes. Recent policy changes from a clinician led risk factor screening approach to universal offering a diagnostic 75 g OGTT in Bradford provided us with the opportunity to compare these two approaches.

Setting

Bradford is a city in the North of England with high levels of deprivation. Approximately half of births are to women of South Asian origin and a fifth of White British pregnant women are obese (unpublished routine study hospital data from 2012). In response to the Bradford District Mortality Commission, which was undertaken in 2006 and highlighted rising infant mortality and the poor health of pregnant women in the city, a number of changes to clinical practice were implemented, including offering a diagnostic OGTT to all pregnant women at 26–28 weeks gestation. Prior to 2007 women were offered an OGTT at 26–28 weeks gestation following individual assessment of risk status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the policy change from case by case risk factor based assessment and selective testing to universal testing (offering a diagnostic OGTT to all women) to identify gestational diabetes.

A central goal of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is the development of clinical protocols for managing common medical conditions that may impact breastfeeding success. These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — preventive care for neonatal hypoglycemia emphasizes early, frequent feeding and close contact: To reduce the risk of your baby becoming hypoglycemic it is important to maintain the blood glucose of mothers with diabetes in tight control to lower fetal insulin secretion, keep the baby warm particularly immediately after birth, hold the baby skin-to-skin as soon as possible after birth as conditions permit, feed shortly after birth within 30–60 minutes, keep mother and baby together to encourage frequent feeding, and offer feeds at least every 3 hours or more frequently to babies who are at increased risk of hypoglycemia.

### Techniques of monitoring blood glucose during pregnancy for women with pre-existing diabetes [^116kpfGp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There are a number of ways of monitoring blood glucose in women with diabetes during pregnancy, with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) recommended as a key component of the management plan. No existing systematic reviews consider the benefits/effectiveness of different techniques of blood glucose monitoring on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. The effectiveness of the various monitoring techniques is unclear. This review is an update of a review that was first published in 2014 and subsequently updated in 2017.

Objectives

To compare techniques of blood glucose monitoring and their impact on maternal and infant outcomes among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 November 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing techniques of blood glucose monitoring including SMBG, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), automated telemedicine monitoring or clinic monitoring among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2). Trials investigating timing and frequency of monitoring were also eligible for inclusion. RCTs using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

This review update includes a total of 12 trials (863) women (792 women with type 1 diabetes and 152 women with type 2 diabetes). The trials took place in Europe, the USA and Canada. Three of the 12 included studies are at low risk of bias, eight studies are at moderate risk of bias, and one study is at high risk of bias. Four trials reported that they were provided with the continuous glucose monitors free of charge or at a reduced cost by the manufacturer. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) versus intermittent glucose monitoring, (four studies, 609 women)CGM may reduce hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension) (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.85; 2 studies, 384 women; low-quality evidence), although it should be noted that only two of the four relevant studies reported data for this composite outcome. Conversely, this did not translate into a clear reduction for pre-eclampsia (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.08; 4 studies, 609 women, moderate-quality evidence). There was also no clear reduction in caesarean section (average RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.18; 3 studies, 427 women; I² = 41%; moderate-quality evidence) or large-for-gestational age (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.26; 3 studies, 421 women; I² = 70%; low-quality evidence) with CGM. There was not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.05 to 12.61, 71 infants, 1 study; low-quality evidence), or mortality or morbidity composite (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.06; 1 study, 200 women) as the evidence was based on single studies of low quality. CGM appears to reduce neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93; 3 studies, 428 infants). Neurosensory disability was not reported. Other methods of glucose monitoringFor the following five comparisons, self-monitoring versus a different type of self-monitoring (two studies, 43 women); self-monitoring at home versus hospitalisation (one study, 100 women), pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring (one study, 61 women), automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system (three studies, 84 women), and constant CGM versus intermittent CGM (one study, 25 women), it is uncertain whether any of the interventions has any impact on any of our GRADE outcomes (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, caesarean section, large-for-gestational age) because the quality of the evidence was found to be very low. This was due to evidence largely being derived from single trials, with design limitations and limitations with imprecision (wide CIs, small sample sizes, and few events). There was not enough evidence to assess perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality and morbidity composite. Other important outcomes, such as neurosensory disability, were not reported in any of these comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Two new studies (406 women) have been incorporated to one of the comparisons for this update. Although the evidence suggests that CGM in comparison to intermittent glucose monitoring may reduce hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, this did not translate into a clear reduction for pre-eclampsia, and so this result should be viewed with caution. No differences were observed for other primary outcomes for this comparison. The evidence base for the effectiveness of other monitoring techniques analysed in the other five comparisons is weak and based on mainly single studies with very low-quality evidence. Additional evidence from large well-designed randomised trials is required to inform choices of other glucose monitoring techniques and to confirm the effectiveness of CGM.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115j1tpp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

2.3a–c. Evidence

Plasma glucose acts as a continuous variable in exerting its effects on the fetus. Even mild hyperglycemia alters the normal metabolic adaptation to pregnancy, and correction of maternal hyperglycemia reduces or prevents adverse outcomes.

Lifestyle therapy for gestational diabetes results in a lower incidence of reduced birth weight, large-for-gestational-age births, and preeclampsia. Both aerobic exercise and non–weight-bearing exercise have been shown to lower blood glucose levels in women with gestational diabetes.

Blood glucose-lowering pharmacological therapy is effective at improving outcomes in women with gestational diabetes whose hyperglycemia does not respond sufficiently to lifestyle therapy (,–). See Section 5.0 for a discussion on blood glucose-lowering pharmacological therapy during pregnancy.

Postpartum care

2.4a. We recommend that postpartum care for women who have had gestational diabetes should include measurement of fasting plasma glucose or fasting self-monitored blood glucose for 24 to 72 hours after delivery to rule out ongoing hyperglycemia. (1|⊕○○○)

2.4b. We recommend that a 2-hour, 75-g OGTT should be undertaken 6 to 12 weeks after delivery in women with gestational diabetes to rule out prediabetes or diabetes. (1|⊕⊕⊕○) If results are normal, we recommend this or other diagnostic tests for diabetes should be repeated periodically as well as before future pregnancies. (1|⊕⊕○○)

2.4c. We suggest the child's birth weight and whether or not the child was born to a mother with gestational diabetes become part of the child's permanent medical record. (Ungraded recommendation)

2.4d. We recommend that all women who have had gestational diabetes receive counseling on lifestyle measures to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, the need for future pregnancies to be planned, and the need for regular diabetes screening, especially before any future pregnancies. (1|⊕○○○)

2.4e. We suggest blood glucose-lowering medication should be discontinued immediately after delivery for women with gestational diabetes unless overt diabetes is suspected in which case the decision to continue such medication should be made on a case-by-case basis. (2|⊕⊕○○)

2.4a–e. Evidence

Women who have had gestational diabetes are at high risk for the later development of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, overt diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome (,–). Infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of the later development of obesity or type 2 diabetes.

### Risk of neonatal hypoglycemia in infants of mothers with gestational glucose intolerance [^1126fdv7]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the relationship between gestational glucose intolerance (GGI) and neonatal hypoglycemia.

Research Design and Methods

This was a secondary analysis of 8,262 mother-infant dyads, with delivery at two hospitals between 2014 and 2023. We categorized maternal glycemic status as normal glucose tolerance (NGT), GGI, or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We defined NGT according to a normal glucose load test result, GGI according to an abnormal glucose load test result with zero (GGI-0) or one (GGI-1) abnormal value on the 100-g oral glucose tolerance test, and GDM according to an abnormal glucose load test result with two or more abnormal values on the glucose tolerance test. Neonatal hypoglycemia was defined according to blood glucose < 45 mg/dL or ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia. We used logistic regression analysis to determine associations between maternal glucose tolerance category and neonatal hypoglycemia and conducted a sensitivity analysis using Δ-adjusted multiple imputation, assuming for unscreened infants a rate of neonatal hypoglycemia as high as 33%.

Results

Of infants, 12% had neonatal hypoglycemia. In adjusted models, infants born to mothers with GGI-0 had 1.28 (95% 1.12, 1.65), GGI-1 1.58 (95% CI 1.11, 2.25), and GDM 4.90 (95% CI 3.81, 6.29) times higher odds of neonatal hypoglycemia in comparison with infants born to mothers with NGT. Associations in sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.

Conclusions

GGI is associated with increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Future research should include examination of these associations in a cohort with more complete neonatal blood glucose ascertainment and determination of the clinical significance of these findings on long-term child health.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (gestational diabetes mellitus), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for abnormal glucose metabolism before 15 weeks of gestation to identify individuals at higher risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, more likely to need insulin, and at high risk of a later gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis.

### Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus based on different risk profiles and settings for improving maternal and infant health [^117WTezy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy. Although GDM usually resolves following birth, it is associated with significant morbidities for mothers and their infants in the short and long term. There is strong evidence to support treatment for GDM. However, there is uncertainty as to whether or not screening all pregnant women for GDM will improve maternal and infant health and if so, the most appropriate setting for screening. This review updates a Cochrane Review, first published in 2010, and subsequently updated in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of screening for gestational diabetes mellitus based on different risk profiles and settings on maternal and infant outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (31 January 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (14 June 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of different protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening for GDM based on different risk profiles and settings, compared with the absence of screening, or compared with other protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening. We planned to include trials published as abstracts only and cluster-randomised trials, but we did not identify any. Cross-over trials are not eligible for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion or through consulting a third reviewer.

Main Results

We included two trials that randomised 4523 women and their infants. Both trials were conducted in Ireland. One trial (which quasi-randomised 3742 women, and analysed 3152 women) compared universal screening versus risk factor-based screening, and one trial (which randomised 781 women, and analysed 690 women) compared primary care screening versus secondary care screening. We were not able to perform meta-analyses due to the different interventions and comparisons assessed. Overall, there was moderate to high risk of bias due to one trial being quasi-randomised, inadequate blinding, and incomplete outcome data in both trials. We used GRADEpro GDT software to assess the quality of the evidence for selected outcomes for the mother and her child. Evidence was downgraded for study design limitations and imprecision of effect estimates. Universal screening versus risk-factor screening (one trial) MotherMore women were diagnosed with GDM in the universal screening group than in the risk-factor screening group (risk ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 3.04; participants = 3152; low-quality evidence). There were no data reported under this comparison for other maternal outcomes including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, caesarean birth, perineal trauma, gestational weight gain, postnatal depression, and type 2 diabetes. ChildNeonatal outcomes: large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite, hypoglycaemia; and childhood/adulthood outcomes: adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and neurosensory disability, were not reported under this comparison. Primary care screening versus secondary care screening (one trial) MotherThere was no clear difference between the primary care and secondary care screening groups for GDM (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.66; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), hypertension (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.59; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), pre-eclampsia (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.78; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), or caesarean section birth (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.27; participants = 690; low-quality evidence). There were no data reported for perineal trauma, gestational weight gain, postnatal depression, or type 2 diabetes. ChildThere was no clear difference between the primary care and secondary care screening groups for large-for-gestational age (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.96; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), neonatal complications: composite outcome, including: hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress, need for phototherapy, birth trauma, shoulder dystocia, five minute Apgar less than seven at one or five minutes, prematurity (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.71; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), or neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.28 to 4.38; participants = 690; very low-quality evidence). There was one perinatal death in the primary care screening group and two in the secondary care screening group (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.10 to 12.12; participants = 690; very low-quality evidence). There were no data for neurosensory disability, or childhood/adulthood adiposity or type 2 diabetes.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient randomised controlled trial data evaluating the effects of screening for GDM based on different risk profiles and settings on maternal and infant outcomes. Low-quality evidence suggests universal screening compared with risk factor-based screening leads to more women being diagnosed with GDM. Low to very low-quality evidence suggests no clear differences between primary care and secondary care screening, for outcomes: GDM, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, caesarean birth, large-for-gestational age, neonatal complications composite, and hypoglycaemia. Further, high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the value of screening for GDM, which may compare different protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening (based on different risk profiles and settings), with the absence of screening, or with other protocols, guidelines or programmes. There is a need for future trials to be sufficiently powered to detect important differences in short- and long-term maternal and infant outcomes, such as those important outcomes pre-specified in this review. As only a proportion of women will be diagnosed with GDM in these trials, large sample sizes may be required.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^1169xmDg]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recommendations for future research — neonatal glucose and breastfeeding: Well-controlled studies are needed that look at plasma glucose, alternative brain fuel concentrations, clinical symptoms, and long-term sequelae to determine minimum safe ranges; blood glucose over time in exclusively breastfed babies in hospitals with baby-friendly policies should be compared with nonbaby-friendly designated hospitals; development of more reliable bedside testing methods is needed and noninvasive glucose monitoring is needed; the role of other glucose-sparing fuels and methods to measure them in a clinically meaningful way deserves further study; research is needed into how much enteral glucose, and in what form, is necessary when blood glucose is important for clinical management, considering variation by weight, gestation, time after birth, and comorbidities; measures of brain function in relation to a comprehensive profile of neural fuels and related factors are needed; and the mechanism of the ability of breast milk to enhance ketogenesis needs elucidation.

### Rate and risk factors of hypoglycemia in large-for-gestational-age newborn infants of nondiabetic mothers [^111iFT1B]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the rate of hypoglycemia in large-for-gestational-age infants of nondiabetic mothers in relation to maternal or neonatal risk factors.

Study Design

Hospital charts of all term large-for-gestational-age infants born between 1994 and 1998 (n = 1136) were analyzed for the rate of neonatal hypoglycemia (capillary glucose level, ≤ 30 mg/dL) during the first 24 hours of life. Infants of women with preexisting or gestational diabetes mellitus were excluded (n = 180). Neonatal glucose testing was performed at 1 or 2 hours of life, with subsequent measurements every 4 to 6 hours. Maternal and neonatal parameters were compared between neonates with and without hypoglycemia, including recent oral glucose tolerance test values in those women who were tested (n = 358).

Results

Of 956 infants, 69 infants (7.2%) were not tested for hypoglycemia. In the remaining 887 infants, hypoglycemia occurred in 142 infants (16%) within the first 24 hours of life. The incidence of hypoglycemia decreased sharply during the first few hours of life, from 9.2% within the first hour of life, to 3.5% between 2 to 5 hours (cumulative) of life, and 2.4% between 6 and 24 hours of life. Gestational age at delivery was the only neonatal parameter that differed significantly between infants with and without hypoglycemia (39.5 vs 39.3 weeks, P = 0.01). The antenatal 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test value was the only predictive maternal parameter (141.5 vs 163.0 mg/dL, P < .006). There was an incremental risk of hypoglycemia with increasing 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test values, with hypoglycemia rates of 2.5%, 9.3%, 22.0%, and 50.0% that were associated with maternal 1-hour glucose values of < 120, 120–179, 180–239, and ≥ 240 mg/dL, respectively (P < .05, for all comparisons).

Conclusion

Routine glucose testing is indicated in large-for-gestational-age newborn infants of nondiabetic mothers. The 1-hour glucose value of the maternal oral glucose tolerance test is a fairly good predictor of subsequent neonatal hypoglycemia. A single elevated 1-hour value of ≥ 180 mg/dL markedly increases the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia.

### Screening and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycaemia in at-risk late preterm and term infants following AAP recommendations: a single centre retrospective study [^112d1b93]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

We identified that screened infants were more likely to be born via C-section compared with those not screened for hypoglycaemia. C-section has been noted as risk factor for decreased exclusive breast feeding likely due to decreased skin-to-skin and increased mother–infant separation immediately after birth. In our centre, even after adjusting for C-section, IDM and GA, the exclusive breastfeeding rate was significantly lower in those screened, findings similar to a previous report. Hypoglycaemia screening may introduce stressors of focusing on feeding volumes to maintain blood glucose levels, suggesting that breast feeding is inadequate and resulting in formula supplementation.

Different risk factor groups have different first glucose values and rates of hypoglycaemia. Prematurity, C-section births and multiple risk factors were associated with hypoglycaemia. Our study shows that infants born preterm or via C-section had a significant lower first glucose value, highlighting their risk for hypoglycaemia. Interestingly, LGA or IDM infants had similar first glucose levels to the non-LGA or non-IDM infants, yet SGA infants had a higher glucose value than non-SGA infants. Infants of diabetic mothers not on insulin had a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than those infants with mothers on insulin. This is likely due to initiating insulin in diabetic mothers who are poorly controlled; therefore, being on insulin was a risk factor for hypoglycaemia in those infants. Overall, the median first glucose values were in the normoglycaemic range suggesting that following the AAP guidelines of feeding early before the first glucose check along with frequent feedings will decrease the incidence of hypoglycaemia.

The duration of screening is variable in practice. AAP recommends continuing glucose screens before each feed for the first 24 hours in LPI and SGA infant. Recent evidence supports that two blood glucose checks may be sufficient in identifying hypoglycaemia requiring intravenous dextrose. In their study, Cummings et al showed 97% of infants requiring IV dextrose for feeding-refractory hypoglycaemia were determined with the initial glucose measurement and all were identified within the first two glucose checks. Our protocol states to stop checking blood glucose levels after achieving three normal values. All infants in our cohort who were diagnosed with hypoglycaemia were found to be hypoglycaemic within the first three glucose checks. We found 18% of at-risk infants were screened more than 3 times in 24 hours, only 4% of whom were admitted to the NICU for treatment for hypoglycaemia. This highlights that our current protocol could lead to possibly unnecessary additional testing.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring vs Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose in Individuals With Preexisting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Background

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is now higher than type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in many obstetric populations, continues to rise rapidly, and has more than tripled in the last 10 years in some populations. Some adverse pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirths, cesarean deliveries, Infants large for gestational age (LGA), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, are higher in individuals with T2DM than in those with T1DM due to greater prevalence of comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, renal disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. As a result, improving pregnancy outcomes in T2DM may require optimizing numerous factors in addition to improving the degree of glycemia and may require different targets for glycemia compared with T1DM.

Frequent glucose monitoring is critical in T2DM in pregnancy to appropriately modify treatment regimens with the increasing insulin resistance of pregnancy. Although continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use in T1DM is considered standard of care, the current standard in T2DM is self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (fasting and either 1 or 2 hours postprandial). Ease of use and increasing access to CGM technology means that more individuals with T2DM are interested in using CGM during pregnancy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that CGM in pregnancy should be combined with SMBG to achieve optimal pre- and postprandial targets. If CGM is not used, the standard of care is to continue SMBG 4 times daily.

Question 6. Should a continuous glucose monitor vs no continuous glucose monitor (self-monitoring blood glucose as standard of care) be used in pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus?

Recommendation 6

In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we suggest either continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remarks
Both CGM and SMBG are considered reasonable alternatives for monitoring glucose during pregnancy, however, in individuals with T2DM, there is limited direct evidence of superiority of CGM use. CGM may offer a potential advantage over SMBG in certain subgroups of individuals with preexisting T2DM.
Ideal glycemic ranges, CGM metrics, and % time in range (TIR) for individuals for T2DM may be different compared to those which have demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in T1DM.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — ongoing neonatal hypoglycemia duration and causes are described as follows: Hypoglycemia with treatment usually only lasts from a few hours to a few days, but hypoglycemia that continues beyond 3 days may be caused by conditions that lower the amount of glucose in the blood stream (as in too much insulin production by the baby's pancreas), prevent or reduce the storage of glucose, use up glucose stored in the liver (glycogen stores), or stop or delay the use of glucose by the body; these conditions are rare, and if hypoglycemia continues and continued treatment is needed, your health care provider will discuss further investigations and treatment options, and specialist consultation and more extensive testing may be needed to determine the exact cause.

### Different strategies for diagnosing gestational diabetes to improve maternal and infant health [^111ekgcN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycaemia with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. If untreated, perinatal morbidity and mortality may be increased. Accurate diagnosis allows appropriate treatment. Use of different tests and different criteria will influence which women are diagnosed with GDM.

Objectives

To evaluate and compare different testing strategies for diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus to improve maternal and infant health while assessing their impact on healthcare service costs.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials if they evaluated tests carried out to diagnose GDM. We excluded studies that used a quasi-random model.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We identified six small trials, including 694 women. These trials were assessed as having varying risk of bias, with few outcomes reported. We prespecified six outcomes to be assessed for quality using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach; data for only one outcome (diagnosis of gestational diabetes) were available for assessment. One trial compared three different methods of delivering glucose: a candy bar (39 women), a 50-gram glucose polymer drink (40 women) and a 50-gram glucose monomer drink (43 women). We have reported results reported by this trial as separate comparisons. 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) versus 100-gram OGTT (one trial, 248 women): Women given the 75-gram OGTT had a higher relative risk of being diagnosed with GDM (risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 6.75). This difference was borderline in terms of statistical significance, and evidence was considered to be of very low quality when assessed by GRADE. No data were reported for the following additional outcomes prespecified for assessment in GRADE: caesarean section, macrosomia > 4.5 kg or however defined in the trial, long-term type 2 diabetes maternal, long-term type 2 diabetes infant and economic costs. Candy bar versus 50-gram glucose monomer drink (one trial, 60 women): More women receiving the candy bar, rather than glucose monomer, preferred the taste of the candy bar (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.86). Infant outcomes were not reported. 50-gram glucose polymer drink versus 50-gram glucose monomer drink (three trials, 239 women): Mean difference (MD) in gestation at birth was -0.80 weeks (one trial, 100 women; 95% CI -1.69 to 0.09). Total side effects were less common with the glucose polymer drink (one trial, 63 women; RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.59), and no clear difference in taste acceptability was reported (one trial, 63 women; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.29). Significantly fewer women reported nausea following the 50-gram glucose polymer drink compared with the 50-gram glucose monomer drink (one trial, 66 women; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.78). No other measures of maternal morbidity or outcomes for the infant were reported. 50-gram glucose food versus 50-gram glucose drink (one trial, 30 women): Women receiving glucose in their food, rather than as a drink, reported fewer side effects (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.56). No clear difference was noted in the number of women requiring further testing (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.55). No other measures of maternal morbidity or outcome were reported for the infant. 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) World Health Organization (WHO) criteria versus 75-gram OGTT American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (one trial, 116 women): No clear differences in included outcomes were observed between women who received the 75-gram OGTT and were diagnosed using criteria based on WHO (1999) recommendations and women who received the 75-gram OGTT and were diagnosed using criteria recommended by the ADA (1979). Outcomes measured included diagnosis of gestational diabetes (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.25), caesarean birth (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35), macrosomia defined as > 90th percentile by ultrasound or birthweight equal to or exceeding 4000 g (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.79), stillbirth (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.02 to 11.68) and instrumental birth (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.94).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is insufficient to permit assessment of which strategy is best for diagnosing GDM.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus, defined as "carbohydrate intolerance of varying degrees of severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy", is associated with an increased risk of complications for mother and child during pregnancy and birth. Among those complications are shoulder dystocia and birth injuries, neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress syndrome, caesarean section, and pre-eclampsia. Fetal macrosomia is associated with gestational diabetesand is a surrogate for many of the complications. Epidemiological research suggests that women who have gestational diabetes have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes later in life.

Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is commonly based on the results of oral glucose tolerance tests. Depending on cut-off values, ethnicity, and other factors, the prevalence in the US is estimated to be 7%and is thought to be increasing.

Specific treatment, consisting of treatment to lower glucose concentrations and special obstetric management, is recommended to reduce the risk to mothers and infants during pregnancy and later in life. But it remains controversial which outcomes can be influenced. Also, it is still unclear which affected women, and their offspring, with what degree of maternal carbohydrate intolerance, will benefit from treatment. This uncertainty is reflected in the fact that various screening strategies and diagnostic criteria are used to identify women with gestational diabetes mellitus.

The main options for diagnosis are a one step oral glucose tolerance test (either taking measurements at fasting, one and/or two hours after 75 g glucose, or at fasting, one, two, and three hours after 100 g) or a two step strategy. This entails screening with either a list of risk factors or a one hour 50 g glucose challenge test and then an oral glucose tolerance test only in those women with positive results. Women's preferences have not been systematically studied.

We conducted a systematic review to determine what possible beneficial effects can be achieved by specific treatment of gestational diabetes and which women and their offspring will benefit from such treatment. We included treatments aimed at lowering blood glucose concentration with or without specific obstetric interventions, such as routine induction of labour. We gave special consideration to the selection strategies used to recruit women for the intervention trials.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^114HHi1A]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocols — Newborn hypoglycemia prevalence and risk factors reports that approximately two out of 1,000 babies have hypoglycemia, and babies are more likely to become hypoglycemic if their birth weight is less than 2,500 grams (5.5 lbs) or birth weight is greater than 4,500 grams (10 lbs), if the mother has diabetes (Type 1, 2, or gestational) or suffers from obesity, or if the body is under stress such as requiring resuscitation at birth or being cold (low body temperature); stress causes a baby's body to use more glucose. Additional risk factors listed are not feeding well, born premature (before 37 weeks), too small for their gestational age, sick or unwell (e.g. babies with an infection), or born with a health problem known to cause low blood glucose (e.g. liver disease, birth defects, congenital metabolic diseases).

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^115Cf3V2]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — risk factors and monitoring guidance note that neonates at increased risk for developing neonatal hypoglycemia should be routinely monitored for blood glucose beginning within the window of feeding, and at-risk neonates fall into two categories: excessive utilization of glucose (hyperinsulinemic states) and inadequate production or substrate delivery. Large for gestational age infants born to screened nondiabetic mothers appear not at risk of hypoglycemia nor at increased risk of poor psychomotor development at 4 years of age. Umbilical cord blood glucose does not seem to predict early hypoglycemia. Infants appropriate for gestational age by weight but with low body fat percentage are at risk for hypoglycemia, whereas constitutionally small babies with adequate fat stores are not. Early feeding improves breastfeeding, but results are contradictory as to whether it improves blood glucose, and confounding may contribute because a baby with borderline low blood glucose may not feed well.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus [^114fXNH9]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Hyperglycaemia that develops during pregnancy and resolves after birth has been recognized for over 50 years, but uniform worldwide consensus is lacking about threshold hyperglycaemic levels that merit a diagnosis of 'gestational diabetes mellitus' (GDM) and thus treatment during pregnancy. GDM is currently the most common medical complication of pregnancy, and prevalence of undiagnosed hyperglycaemia and even overt diabetes in young women is increasing. Maternal overweight and obesity, later age at childbearing, previous history of GDM, family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and ethnicity are major GDM risk factors. Diagnosis is usually performed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), although a non-fasting, glucose challenge test (GCT) is used in some parts of the world to screen women for those requiring a full OGTT. Dietary modification and increased physical activity are the primary treatments for GDM, but pharmacotherapy, usually insulin, is used when normoglycaemia is not achieved. Oral hypoglycaemic agents, principally metformin and glibenclamide (glyburide), are also used in some countries. Treatment improves immediate pregnancy outcomes, reducing excess fetal growth and adiposity and pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders. GDM increases the risk of long-term complications, including obesity, impaired glucose metabolism and cardiovascular disease, in both the mother and infant. Optimal management of mother and infant during long-term follow-up remains challenging, with very limited implementation of preventive strategies in most parts of the world.

Table 2
Assessment of screening for neonatal hypoglycaemia against the criteria for an effective screening programme

Secondly, operational thresholds to define neonatal hypoglycaemia in asymptomatic infants vary because of the uncertain relation between blood concentrations of glucose and neuroglycopenia, with different guidelines ranging from blood glucose thresholds of < 2.0 mol/Lto < 2.8 mmol/L(table 3). In a large, randomised controlled trial, 689 infants with mild hypoglycaemia were randomised to a lower threshold (treatment given at a glucose concentration of < 2.0 mmol/L) or a traditional threshold (treatment given at a glucose concentration of < 2.6 mmol/L). The lower threshold was non-inferior to the traditional threshold for neurodevelopmental outcome at age 18 months. Assessing neurodevelopment is more accurate when children are older, however, and age 18 months might be too young to detect important, higher cognitive functions that emerge at later stages of development, especially executive function and advanced visual-motor integration. Furthermore, screening is often done with inaccurate cotside tests, although more accurate and likely cost saving methods are now available.

Table 3
Examples of guidance for management of asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycaemia

Thirdly, although about 50% of 514 infants with traditional risk factors (infant of a mother with diabetes, large or small birth weight, and born preterm) developed hypoglycaemia, in a recent prospective observational study, the frequency of low blood concentrations of glucose was similar in 67 healthy term infants with no risk factors. Also, in retrospective observational studies, either none of the risk factors used for screening were associated with hypoglycaemiaor only insulin treatment for maternal gestational diabetes was predictive. Although the frequency of hypoglycaemia in infants with risk factors might not be greatly increased, these infants could be more sensitive to the effects of hypoglycaemia on neurodevelopment than infants with no risk factors (see section on long term consequences below).

Fourthly, consensus is lacking on the appropriate length and frequency of testing for blood glucose in infants at risk of hypoglycaemia (table 3). Most guidelines recommend screening for 8–24 hours after birth, although most infants with risk factors who then require intravenous dextrose are identified from the first or second blood glucose test. Further research is needed to determine how long and how often infants at risk of hypoglycaemia should be monitored with intermittent testing of blood glucose to detect infants with hypoglycaemia whose long term outcomes can be improved with treatment.

### Association between isolated abnormal 1-hour glucose challenge test and adverse pregnancy outcomes: a retrospective review from an urban tertiary care center in the United States [^113vo8ev]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for GDM is lifestyle interventions which includes a combination of diet, exercise, and glucose monitoring. Medication use is reserved for those with persistent elevations in glucose testing. For patients with GDM, lifestyle interventions alone have been associated with reductions in risk of LGA infants and neonatal fat mass; however, data remains inconclusive on reductions in composite neonatal outcomes, hypoglycemia, or perinatal death associated solely with diet and exercise interventions. Lifestyle interventions have also been examined as a possible prevention strategy for GDM among low risk patients with conflicting results. While diet and exercise alone may not reduce incidence of GDM or significantly reduce perinatal outcomes alone for patients with GDM, perhaps there remains a role for such interventions for risk reduction in those with mild hyperglycemia.

In a Cochrane review of treatment for patients with abnormal GDM screening, dietary counseling and glucose monitoring were found to reduce the rate of LGA infants without changing rates of cesarean or operative vaginal delivery. Gestational weight gain is another contributor to macrosomia. Thus, it is possible that lifestyle changes to help prevent excessive gestational weight gain alone may help to reduce the risk of macrosomia. Further research is needed on whether interventions with diet, exercise, or glucose monitoring may be beneficial in reducing neonatal risks for these patients. Interestingly, an Australian cost analysis comparing interventions for treatment of mild gestational diabetes compared to routine prenatal care found that, for high-income countries, the possible reduction in perinatal morbidity and mortality would justify healthcare system costs of interventions.

### Different intensities of glycaemic control for women with gestational diabetes mellitus [^113eCHWN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has major short- and long-term implications for both the mother and her baby. GDM is defined as a carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycaemia or any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy from 24 weeks' gestation onwards and which resolves following the birth of the baby. Rates for GDM can be as high as 25% depending on the population and diagnostic criteria used and rates are increasing globally. Risk factors associated with GDM include advanced maternal age, obesity, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and a previous history of GDM, macrosomia or unexplained stillbirth. There is wide variation internationally in glycaemic treatment target recommendations for women with GDM that are based on consensus rather than high-quality trials.

Objectives

To assess the effect of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with GDM on maternal and infant health outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 February 2016) and reference lists of the retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included one randomised controlled trial. Cluster-randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for carrying out data collection, assessing study quality and analysing results. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility for inclusion, evaluated methodological quality and extracted data for the one included study. We sought additional information from one trial author but had no response. We assessed the quality of evidence for selected outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included one Canadian trial of 180 women, recruited between 20 to 32 weeks' gestation, who had been diagnosed with GDM. Data from 171 of the 180 women were published as a conference abstract and no full report has been identified. The overall risk of bias of the single included study was judged to be unclear. The included trial did not report on any of this review's primary outcomes. For the mother, these were hypertension disorders of pregnancy or subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. For the infant, our primary outcomes were (perinatal (fetal and neonatal) mortality; large-for-gestational age; composite of death or severe morbidity or later childhood neurosensory disability). The trial did report data relating to some of this review's secondary outcomes. There was no clear difference in caesarean section rates for women assigned to using strict glycaemic targets (pre-prandial 5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/L) and at one-hour postprandial 6.7 mmol/L (120 mg/dL)) (28/85, 33%) when compared with women assigned to using liberal glycaemic targets (pre-prandial 5.8 mmol/L (103 mg/dL) and at one-hour postprandial 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL)) (21/86, 24%) (risk ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 2.18, one trial, 171 women; very low quality). Using the GRADE approach, we found the quality of the evidence to bevery low for caesarean section due to poor reporting of risk of bias, imprecision and publication bias. Strict glycaemic targets were associated with an increase in the use of pharmacological therapy (identified as the use of insulin in this study) (33/85; 39%) compared with liberal glycaemic targets (18/86; 21%) (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.03; one trial, 171 women). CIs are wide suggesting imprecision and caution is required when interpreting the data. No other secondary maternal outcome data relevant to this review were reported. For the infant, there were no clear differences between the groups of women receiving strict and liberal glycaemic targets for macrosomia (birthweight greater than 4000 g) (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.31 to 5.85, one trial, 171 babies); small-for-gestational age (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.63, one trial, 171 babies); birthweight (mean difference (MD) -92.00 g, 95% CI -241.97 to 57.97, one trial, 171 babies) or gestational age (MD -0.30 weeks, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.13, one trial, 171 babies). Adverse effects data were not reported. No other secondary neonatal outcomes relevant to this review were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

This review is based on a single study (involving 180 women) with an unclear risk of bias. The trial (which was only reported in a conference abstract) did not provide data for any of this review's primary outcomes but did provide data for a limited number of our secondary outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice for targets for glycaemic control for women with GDM to minimise adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Glycaemic target recommendations from international professional organisations for maternal glycaemic control vary widely and are reliant on consensus given the lack of high-quality evidence. Further high-quality trials are needed, and these should compare different glycaemic targets for guiding treatment of women with GDM, assess both short-term and long-term health outcomes for women and their babies, include women's experiences and assess health services costs. Four studies are ongoing.

Table 3
First glucose age and value

The first median glucose value in those screened was 55 mg/dL (table 3). The first glucose value was similar between IDM and non-IDM infants and LGA and non-LGA infants but significantly lower in preterm infants and infants born via C-section. There was no significant difference in the first glucose values between IDM infants born to mothers on insulin and mothers not on insulin (54 vs 54 mg/dL). The first glucose value was higher in SGA infants (59 vs 54 mg/dL), although not clinically significant. The first glucose value in hypoglycaemic infants and non-hypoglycaemic infants was 38 vs 57 mg/dL.

We collected 2856 glucose values from the charts of at-risk screened infants in the first 24 hours. The scatter plots of the glucose values are presented in figure 2. Of all the values collected, 8.6% were below threshold for hypoglycaemia (11% in SGA, 15% in preterm, 8.6% in LGA, 8.1% in IDM and 11% in C-section infants). Only five glucose values were below threshold after 12 hours of age originating from four infants (one IDM, two SGA, one LPI). All four infants except one SGA infant had a previous hypoglycaemic episode < 4 hours of age. The one SGA infant who did not have a previous hypoglycaemic episode had two hypoglycaemic episodes at 22 and 23.9 hours of age (no screen done between 1.5 and 22 hours of age).

### The obstetric and neonatal implications of a low value on the 50-g glucose screening test [^116pw9n1]. American Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationship between a low 50-g 1-hour glucose loading test (GLT) and maternal and neonatal outcomes in women without diabetes.

Study Design

This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter observational cohort from a randomized trial of treatment for mild gestational diabetes. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between women with GLT values < 90 mg/dL and those with results 90 to 119 mg/dL.

Results

Of 436 enrolled women, 297 (68.1%) had a GLT result of 90 to 119 mg/dL and 139 (31.9%) had a result of < 90 mg/dL. There was a lower incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia in those with a GLT < 90 mg/dL (5.7% versus 16.5%, p = 0.006). Other outcomes were not associated with test results.

Conclusion

A GLT result < 90 mg/dL compared with 90 to 119 mg/dL is associated with a lower risk of neonatal hypoglycemia, but no other significant findings.

### MAGIC (maternal glucose in pregnancy) understanding the glycemic profile of pregnancy, intensive CGM glucose profiling and its relationship to fetal growth: an observational study protocol [^113dnCpH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The UK has one of the highest rates of stillbirth and neonatal death in Europe. The MBRRACE-UK report identified that half of mothers with a perinatal death had an abnormality of fetal growth. Furthermore, infants who are born large or small for gestational age (LGA or SGA respectively) are predisposed to developing obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) perpetuating an intergenerational cycle of cardiometabolic disease.

Amongst the many factors that influence fetal growth, maternal glycemic control plays a key role and is a modifiable risk factor. Maternal hyperglycaemic excursions stimulate fetal insulin secretion leading to increased fetal adiposity and growth. This increases the risk of preterm and instrumental delivery, neonatal hypoglycaemia requiring neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, caesarean section, stillbirth. Difficulties at delivery can lead to brain damage, shoulder dystocia and permanent disability. Observational studies demonstrate that varying degrees of dysglycemia during pregnancy, including pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes (GDM) are associated with LGA related adverse perinatal outcomes.

To mitigate against hyperglycemia related fetal growth and associated adverse pregnancy outcome, clinical guidelines currently recommend testing for pregnancy related dysglycemia at 24–28 weeks gestation by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). NICE recommends diagnosis of GDM on the basis of a raised fasting or 2 h glucose. This late pregnancy diagnosis of GDM is an increasing cause for concern; we have shown that excess fetal growth assessed by ultrasound scan is detectable from 20 weeks' gestation, pre-dating biochemical diagnosis of GDM. Whilst we now know that testing at 24–28 weeks gestation is too late to prevent abnormal fetal growth, there is no validated test for earlier diagnosis and the optimal time of screening and treatment for dysglycemia remains unknown. Indeed, despite OGTT testing, the majority of LGA babies are born to mothers without a diagnosis of GDM. This concurs with the recognition that the OGTT is insufficiently sensitive and that many women who could benefit from treatment will not be correctly identified, contributing to the failure to improve outcomes. The OGTT, recognised to be an outdated test for diabetes diagnosis, is now used only in pregnancy. It is known to be poorly reproducible: 40% of pregnant women who had a 2nd OGTT immediately after an abnormal OGTT had normal results and vice-versa.

### Historical facts of screening and diagnosing diabetes in pregnancy [^111GZdwP]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The blood glucose levels should be monitored, and if dietary management does not consistently maintain fasting plasma glucose < 105 mg/dl and/or a 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose < 120 mg/dl on two or more occasions within a two week interval, insulin should be initiated, accompanied by self-monitoring of blood glucose; breastfeeding should be encouraged. Finally, it was reinforced that more than half of women with GDM will develop permanent diabetes. In order to detect diabetes early, an evaluation with a 2-hour, 75 g OGTT should be performed at the first postpartum visit. Regular physical activity should be encouraged to these patients.

The Third International Workshop on GDM happened in November 1990. The previous definition of GDM was confirmed. Screening and diagnostic criteria were also confirmed but with some modifications: Plasma glucose levels ≥ 200 mg/dl outside of formal OGTT, or fasting glucose ≥ 140 mg/dl suggests a diabetic state, warranting further investigation. A proportion of patients who meet recommended criteria for GDM have screening levels < 140 mg/dl and consequently the detection of GDM requires a substantial increase in the number of full OGTT performed. Also for diagnostic purposes, it is to mention that adjustments for conversion of whole blood glucose concentrations to equivalent plasma glucose values may overcorrect glucose levels; for this reason it is inadvisable to introduce minor corrective modifications. One single abnormal OGTT value may merit further evaluation since it may be associated with increased morbidity. Fixed diagnostic criteria were suggested for all populations. Macrosomia could be clinically estimated by fetal size and asymmetric growth identified by ultrasonography, and an earlier intervention could improve this outcome. In terms of long-range implications, it was emphasized that babies born to mothers with GDM present an increased risk of overt diabetes later in life and an increased likelihood of obesity, glucose intolerance and neurobehavioral and developmental abnormalities at birth and during childhood.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113qubDY]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gestational diabetes screening tests — approaches, timing, and glucose loads are described: Screening for gestational diabetes in asymptomatic persons involves either a 2-step (screening test followed by a diagnostic test) or 1-step (diagnostic test used for all patients) approach, and in the US, the 2-step approach is commonly used; a 50-g oral glucose challenge test (OGCT) is performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state, and if the screening threshold is met or exceeded, patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during which a fasting glucose level is obtained, followed by administration of a 75-g or 100-g glucose load, then evaluation of glucose levels after 1, 2, and often 3 hours.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to monitoring of glycemic control, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer continuous glucose monitoring to pregnant patients with T1DM. Consider obtaining real-time continuous glucose monitoring to reduce the risk for large-for-gestational-age infants and neonatal hypoglycemia in pregnancy complicated by T1DM, in conjunction with aims to achieve traditional pre- and postprandial glycemic goals.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancy — type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) randomized evidence indicates sparse, older technology and null neonatal effects. The systematic review found 5 randomized controlled trials, but the current real-time CGM (rtCGM) used continually "was not used in any of the 3 RCTs". Direct evidence specific to T2DM is limited to 2 RCTs (Copenhagen and GlucoMOMS), with a small total T2DM sample size n = 109 (56 on CGM and 53 on standard therapy); in GlucoMOMS, T2DM participants wore blinded CGM "for 2 to 4 weeks every 6 weeks". A meta-analysis of the T2DM participants (n = 109) "demonstrated no difference in LGA", and when all diabetes types in the 3 RCTs were analyzed together there was "no significant difference in the outcomes of interest, LGA, SGA, neonatal hypoglycemia, or NICU admissions". The certainty for CGM use in T2DM pregnancy "was considered very low", and available randomized results from only 56 T2DM individuals suggest imprecision.

ASD and neonatal hypoglycemia

The mechanisms by which refractory neonatal hypoglycemia (defined as sustained blood glucose < 40 mg/dl despite glucose infusion) and severe neonatal hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 25 mg/dl) increase the risk of ASD involve energy deprivation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We suspect that undetected hypoglycemia has an important role in ASD pathophysiology for two reasons. One, because many neonates with hypoglycemia are asymptomatic. Two, because it was shown that neonatal hypoglycemia increases threefold the risk of ASD in children born at term, but does not increase the risk in prematures. Preterm neonates are routinely screened for hypoglycemia, but term neonates are not, so it is possible that hypoglycemia in term neonates, going undetected, could harm the brain.

Our group assumed that high-carbohydrate, low-protein diets, and/or physical inactivity would contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia, which would stimulate insulin production in the fetus. Close to delivery, hyperinsulinemia would cause neonatal hypoglycemia. To test the hypothesis that hypoglycemic episodes in the neonatal period may go undetected by current screening programs, we selected neonates born to mothers reporting a high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet (including diabetic mothers requiring > 50 g of oral or intravenous glucose to treat iatrogenic hypoglycemia) or physical inactivity within 24 h before delivery. Of the 158 neonates screened for hypoglycemia at 1, 2, and 4 h after birth, 48 had hypoglycemia. All neonates identified by current strategies were identified with the new screening. The reverse was not true: five of the 48 babies diagnosed with hypoglycemia with the new screening were term appropriate-for-gestational-age infants, born to non-diabetic, slim mothers. None of the five was selected to be screened by current strategies.

The hypothesis that undetected neonatal hypoglycemia could increase the risk of ASD is difficult to prove, because once hypoglycemia is identified, strategies to normalize glucose levels are implemented. In the other hand, screening neonates for hypoglycemia based on maternal risk factors — namely physical inactivity and high-carbohydrate intake — could reduce the chances of brain damage related to protracted hypoglycemia.
