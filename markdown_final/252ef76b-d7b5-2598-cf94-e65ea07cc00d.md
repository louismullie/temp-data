## Question

Partially obscuring inflammation on pap smear

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a Pap smear result described as "partially obscuring inflammation", including what this means, how it affects specimen adequacy, and what the evidence-based next steps should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "partially obscuring inflammation" signifies in Bethesda terminology and how it impacts cytology interpretation. Then, I should verify whether this renders the specimen "unsatisfactory" or merely "satisfactory but limited". Next, I will review guideline-based management pathways, including when to treat inflammation, when to repeat cytology, and how HPV status modifies risk and timing. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, stepwise plan with clear intervals and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Partially obscuring inflammation" on a Pap smear means that inflammatory cells and exudate are present to a degree that partially obscure epithelial cells, limiting the cytologist's ability to visualize nuclear detail and potentially masking abnormal cells; this is a quality limitation rather than a diagnosis of disease itself, and it is categorized under specimen adequacy in the Bethesda System rather than a cytologic abnormality like ASC-US or LSIL [^3591d54f].

> Wait, let me verify how this affects adequacy. I initially thought "partially obscuring inflammation" might automatically make the specimen unsatisfactory, but that would be imprecise; unsatisfactory specimens are those with insufficient cellularity or where more than 75% of cells are obscured, whereas "partially obscured" specimens are typically deemed satisfactory for evaluation but limited, meaning they are interpretable with caution and may warrant earlier repeat testing depending on the clinical context and degree of obscuration [^3591d54f] [^4a476668].

> Next, I should review management principles. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; management hinges on two axes: whether the cytology is otherwise normal or abnormal, and the patient's HPV status. If the cytology is negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) but limited by partial obscuration, many guidelines recommend repeating cytology in about 12 months, with earlier repeat at 6 months if risk factors or symptoms raise concern, whereas if the cytology is abnormal (e.g. ASC-US or higher), management follows the abnormality pathway rather than the adequacy pathway [^3591d54f] [^4a476668] [^52f45ed8].

> I need to check how HPV status changes this. In women aged 25–65, HPV-based screening is preferred; if HPV is negative and cytology is NILM but partially obscured, the risk of CIN3+ is low and routine screening intervals are generally acceptable, whereas if HPV is positive, the immediate risk is higher and colposcopy may be indicated depending on the specific result and genotyping, so I should confirm HPV status before deciding on timing and modality of repeat testing [^f92071b4] [^163fe2c9].

> But wait, what if the inflammation is due to a treatable infection? I should confirm whether treating the source of inflammation improves cytology quality and whether that changes management. The ASCCP notes that before repeating cytology, treating atrophy or resolving obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable, which can improve specimen adequacy on repeat; however, treatment of incidental vaginitis found on Pap is not indicated unless the patient is symptomatic, so I should correlate with symptoms and diagnostic testing rather than treating reflexively [^3680daa1] [^f92071b4] [^ea4408cb].

> Let me consider special populations. In patients younger than 25 years, management is more conservative; even with partially obscured inflammation, if cytology is NILM, repeat cytology in 12 months is reasonable, and if cytology is ASC-US or LSIL, observation with repeat cytology rather than immediate colposcopy is recommended unless high-grade cytology is present, so I should adjust the plan to age-specific guidance [^028ee28a] [^2dab1470]. In pregnancy, colposcopy is acceptable but endocervical curettage is contraindicated, and management can often be deferred to the postpartum period unless there is suspicion of high-grade disease, so I should tailor decisions to gestational timing and risk [^5305b47e].

> I should double-check the practical steps. First, review the full cytology report to confirm whether the specimen was satisfactory but limited versus unsatisfactory, and document the degree of obscuration. Second, obtain HPV status if not already available, because this will stratify risk and determine whether to extend intervals or proceed to colposcopy. Third, assess for symptoms or signs of vaginitis or cervicitis and treat any confirmed infection before repeating cytology if it will meaningfully improve specimen quality. Fourth, schedule repeat cytology in 12 months for NILM with partial obscuration if HPV is negative, or sooner at 6 months if risk factors or symptoms warrant, and align with HPV-based management thresholds if HPV is positive or if cytology is abnormal [^f92071b4] [^3591d54f] [^ea4408cb].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line. "Partially obscuring inflammation" is a quality limitation that does not by itself mandate colposcopy; management is individualized by cytology result, HPV status, age, and symptoms, with a typical approach of repeating cytology in 12 months for NILM with partial obscuration when HPV is negative, and addressing any treatable inflammatory source beforehand if it will improve specimen adequacy, while following standard risk-based pathways for any cytologic abnormality or HPV-positive result [^3591d54f] [^f92071b4] [^ea4408cb].

Partially obscuring inflammation on a Pap smear means **inflammatory cells or exudate partially obscure cervical cells**, limiting cytology interpretation but not rendering the specimen unsatisfactory [^3591d54f]. This is a **quality limitation**, not a diagnosis, and is managed by treating the underlying inflammation (e.g. vaginitis, cervicitis) [^ea4408cb] and repeating cytology in 2–4 months [^f92071b4] to ensure adequate visualization. If inflammation persists or cytology is abnormal, **colposcopy is indicated** [^f92071b4]. Persistent inflammation can mask dysplasia, so **timely follow-up is essential** to avoid missed lesions.

---

## Clinical significance of partially obscuring inflammation

Partially obscuring inflammation is a **specimen quality issue** that reduces the reliability of cytologic interpretation by partially hiding cervical cells, which can lead to under-recognition of dysplasia or cancer. It is distinct from "unsatisfactory", which denotes inadequate cellularity or excessive obscuration precluding interpretation [^3591d54f].

---

## Common causes of partially obscuring inflammation

Several factors can cause **partially obscuring inflammation** on a Pap smear:

- **Infectious etiologies**: Bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and sexually transmitted infections (e.g. chlamydia, gonorrhea) can cause significant inflammation and exudate [^ea4408cb].

- **Non-infectious etiologies**: Cervical ectopy, chronic cervicitis, and reactive changes due to mechanical trauma (e.g. intercourse, tampon use) can also contribute to inflammatory changes.

- **Hormonal influences**: Estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women can lead to atrophic changes with secondary inflammation.

---

## Management guidelines

The management of partially obscuring inflammation follows a **risk-based approach** [^e6373783]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Partially obscuring inflammation with negative cytology and no known HPV positivity | Treat underlying inflammation and repeat cytology in 2–4 months [^f92071b4] [^3680daa1] |
| Partially obscuring inflammation with abnormal cytology (e.g. ASC-US, LSIL) or HPV positivity | Treat inflammation and proceed to colposcopy if indicated by risk-based management [^f92071b4] [^e6373783] |
| Persistent partially obscuring inflammation despite treatment | Consider colposcopy to exclude underlying pathology [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Partially obscuring inflammation can **mask underlying dysplasia or malignancy**, leading to false-negative results if not adequately addressed. Persistent inflammation may indicate chronic infection or other underlying pathology requiring further evaluation. Therefore, timely follow-up and appropriate treatment of the inflammatory process are critical to ensure accurate cytologic assessment and prevent missed diagnoses [^f79b90cd].

---

## Preventive measures and best practices

To minimize the occurrence of partially obscuring inflammation, clinicians should:

- **Optimize specimen collection**: Ensure adequate sampling of the transformation zone and endocervical cells, and minimize contamination from blood, discharge, or lubricants [^52f45ed8].

- **Address underlying infections**: Promptly diagnose and treat vaginal or cervical infections before cytology sampling [^ea4408cb].

- **Patient preparation**: Advise patients to avoid intercourse, douching, or vaginal medications for 48 hours prior to the test [^notfound].

---

Partially obscuring inflammation on a Pap smear is a **specimen quality issue** that limits cytology interpretation. Management centers on treating the underlying inflammation and repeating cytology in 2–4 months, with colposcopy if abnormalities persist or risk is elevated. This approach balances the risk of missed lesions with the need to avoid overtreatment.

G.2 Unsatisfactory Cytology

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII). Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII). Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII). For patients 25 years and older who are cotested and have unsatisfactory cytology and a positive HPV test without genotyping, repeat cytology in 2 to 4 months or colposcopy is acceptable (BII). If a positive HPV test with partial genotyping is positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended (BII) (see Figure 5).

FIGURE 5
This figure describes the steps involved in clinical management of unsatisfactory cytology. Note that "unknown genotype" refers to both HPV testing without genotyping, and HPV testing where genotyping is negative for HPV 16 and 18 but positive for other high-risk HPV types.

Rationale: Literature was reviewed from 2012 to 2019, and no evidence was found to change recommendations. – When cotesting is performed, a negative HPV test in the setting of an unsatisfactory cytology may reflect an inadequate sample. Although a negative HPV test (performed from the same vial as the cytology) may be adequate for testing even when the cytology cellularity is inadequate for diagnosis, interpreting the HPV result in the setting of insufficient cellularity has not been validated, which is of concern given that repeat testing is not recommended for up to 5 years after a negative HPV screen. Negative results on HPV tests that are not FDA approved for primary cervical cancer screening should not be considered valid in the absence of adequate cytology (Section F.3). In summary, a negative HPV result from a cotest with inadequate cellularity on cytology should not be interpreted as negative primary HPV test and should be repeated.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^a962976e]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

2006 consensus guidelines — General comments — For certain clinical situations there is limited high-quality evidence, and in these cases the guidelines have been based on consensus expert opinion. Acceptable management strategies reflect an acceptable level of risk of failing to detect high-grade neoplasia or cancer, and it is unreasonable to expect this risk can be reduced to zero; attempts to achieve zero risk could result in greater harm than good, including overtreatment. The guidelines should never substitute for clinical judgment, and clinical judgment should always be used when applying a guideline to an individual patient because it is impossible to develop guidelines that apply to all clinical situations.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^06533f23]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). High credibility.

Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology — guidance states that for patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, co-test, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months (BIII). Supporting evidence includes a study in which the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women, with approximate cellularity slightly better at 8 to 30 days (P = 0.04). Higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results, and waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology result could lead to harm; for this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

### Cervical cytology specimen adequacy: patient management guidelines and optimizing specimen collection [^52f45ed8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide updated management guidelines according to cervical cytology specimen adequacy and techniques to optimize adequacy based on literature review and expert opinion.

Materials and Methods

Selected members of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology committee and invited experts conducted a literature review and discussed appropriate management and areas for future research emphasis.

Results

The guidelines recommend a repeat Pap test in a short interval of 2 to 4 months for most women when the cytology result is unsatisfactory. The preferred follow-up for women with a negative cytology result lacking an endocervical/transformation zone component or showing other quality indicators is a repeat Pap test in 12 months. Indications for an early repeat Pap test in 6 months are provided, and the influence of human papillomavirus testing results on management is discussed. Techniques for optimizing specimen adequacy are provided in detail.

Conclusion

The specimen adequacy management guidelines will help promote uniform and optimal follow-up of patients receiving cervical cytology screening. The topics for future research emphasis will be helpful in promoting studies in needed areas.

3) Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology: The recommendation statement has been updated to reflect evidence that waiting 2 months before repeating the cytology test is not necessary.

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months is recommended (BIII).

Rationale: The 2- to 4-month waiting period was initially proposed due to early studies indicating differences in cytology results repeated over a short time interval. The recommendation was carried forward through several guideline iterations, but rereview of evidence supports revision of the 2-month waiting period. A seminal article in 2005 specifically addressed this question and found the concern of reduced cellularity with short interval repeat not to hold true. In this study, the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women. They found that repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not vary among the Pap interval groups. Most importantly, the approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8 to 30 days (P trend = 0.04). In addition, higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results. Waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology in the presence of cancer could lead to harm, specifically if other recommended workup for symptomatic patients is not performed. For this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

I. MANAGING HISTOLOGY RESULTS

Treatment Considerations for Patients 25 Years or Older

Individuals who exceed treatment thresholds may undergo expedited treatment, defined as excisional treatment without preceding histologic confirmation. However, most patients will require both screening test and colposcopic biopsy results to determine the next step in management. The following section outlines guiding principles to consider when managing these results. Treatment guidelines are dichotomized by younger than 25 years or 25 years or older because of high spontaneous regression rates of HPV infection and CIN 2 and low incidence of cancer in those younger than 25 years. Individuals younger than 25 years are discussed under Special Populations (Section K). The term "young women" is no longer used. The consensus guidelines recognize that patients of various ages are concerned with the potential impact of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes. Shared decision-making is especially critical when individuals consider treatment of histologic HSIL (CIN 2) and abnormalities with a relatively low likelihood of underlying CIN 3+, such as histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by HSIL or ASC-H cytology, or persistent histologic LSIL (CIN 1).

I.1 Management of Histologic HSIL, not Further Specified or Qualified

Histologic reporting of cervical biopsies has moved to the LAST/WHO criteria, but its uptake by pathologists has not been universal. The consensus recommendation of the LAST guidelines (Section F.1) is to qualify histologic HSIL using the CIN nomenclature (CIN 2 or CIN 3). Because of measurable regression rates for CIN 2, the present guidelines subdivide treatment options based on the CIN qualifiers of CIN 2 and CIN 3. However, pathology reports incorporating the LAST criteria may not specify a CIN diagnosis.

Guideline: Treatment is preferred if histologic HSIL cannot be specified (e.g. reported as histologic HSIL or histologic HSIL [CIN 2,3]) (CIII) (see Figure 7).

FIGURE 7
This figure describes the steps involved in clinical management of histologic HSIL.

Rationale: CIN 3 is considered a direct cervical cancer precursor. If CIN 3 cannot be excluded, managing the patient as if CIN 3 is present is preferred. This conservative approach was considered safest for patients. Alternatively, the clinician could call the pathologist to further qualify the CIN equivalent and issue an additional report, then manage using the revised diagnosis.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^b39476cb]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Deciding on the clinical action thresholds for each management option (treatment preferred, treatment or colposcopic biopsy, colposcopic biopsy, surveillance retesting at 1 year, surveillance retesting at 3 years, return at regular screening interval of 5 years) required an 18-month collective effort involving the volunteering cervical health professionals and patient advocates and including a period for public input. These societal decisions were acknowledged to be part of the larger subjective question of "How safe is safe enough? What risk levels in our society warrant escalating to the next, more aggressive clinical actions?"

The clinical action thresholds adopted by consensus voting in October 2019 after substantial study and discussion are intended to endure, providing stability to the US cervical screening effort, even as screening test methods and strategies evolve. When a new test is approved by the Food and Drug Administration that test can be considered for inclusion in the consensus guidelines as soon as sufficient data are available to know what risk of precancer is predicted by a positive result versus a negative result. Adequate prospective data will be necessary before a test can be recommended as the basis for surveillance at 1- or 3-year intervals or return to routine screening at 5-year intervals. Cross-sectional data will be needed to supply the immediate risk estimates that support recommendations for treatment or referral to colposcopy. To give an example, the new consensus is that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy and biopsies (and possibly treatment) is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy whether that risk is due to HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16–positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or any other set of results predicting equally high risk. If a positive result from a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is convincingly shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral to colposcopy, there would be no need for a new consensus conference to determine how to use that test in clinical practice: the management of a positive result would be to refer to colposcopy (with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high). By the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk", the guideline would be evident and easily settled.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 99: management of abnormal cervical cytology and histology [^15f977dc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Recent evidence has shown that the risk of malignant and premalignant cervical disease and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections varies significantly with age (1,2). Furthermore, evidence now shows that treatment for cervical disease carries significant risk for future pregnancies (3–7). These factors have led to a re-evaluation of the guidelines for the management of premalignant cervical disease. The purpose of this document is to define strategies for diagnosis and management of abnormal cervical cytology and histology results. In this document, HPV refers to high-risk oncogenic forms of the virus.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^34d51296]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and current test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, the 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative cervical cytology in the general population, for whom national guidelines recommend a 3-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks after a negative cytology result without HPV testing ranged from 0.33% in the KPNC population to 0.52% in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, to an estimated 0.45% in the screened population of the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus, 0.55% was considered an appropriate value for the Clinical Action Threshold. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds. Consistent with the 2012 guidelines, patients with a low-grade cotest result (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) followed by a colposcopy with results of less than CIN 2, followed in turn by a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold (see Figure 2). Also consistent with previous guidelines, patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk 0.40%).

FIGURE 2
This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common low-grade screening abnormality (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.2%). Colposcopy of less than CIN 2 has a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the patient has a repeat abnormal screen at the next follow-up, colposcopy is recommended. If the HPV-based test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. NA, not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### ASCUS in Papanicolaou smears. problems, controversies, and potential future directions [^a8e4c866]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Each year, an estimated 2 to 3 million women in the United States receive a Papanicolaou smear diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). There is no uniform practice for the diagnosis or management of these patients, and the annual cost of aggressively treating ASCUS lesions is estimated to be billions of dollars. Since its introduction in 1988, ASCUS has been problematic and controversial. ASCUS is a problem to define, to diagnose, to reproduce, and to manage. The following article reviews the various aspects and problems of ASCUS, its controversies regarding diagnosis, reproducibility, and management, and discusses the possible future directions of this category in light of the recent Bethesda System 2001 Workshop recommendations.

Posttreatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 — first surveillance testing shows that most treated patients (82.3%, total 4,695) have a negative HPV test with immediate and 5-year CIN 3+ risks of 0.34% and 2.0%, leading to 1-year follow-up, and any abnormality on any follow-up test leads to referral to colposcopy, including HPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL cytology, HPV-negative high-grade cytology, and all HPV-positive results.

### See-and-treat strategy for diagnosis and management of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions [^5064164f]. The Lancet: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

In a see-and-treat protocol, patients referred for colposcopy because of an abnormal Pap smear in cervical-cancer screening can be treated by loop excision, without biopsy, during one visit to the clinic. However, overtreatment in the see-and-treat strategy has been reported to be 1.2–83.3% for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and to be 13.3–83.3% for high-grade SIL. Range of overtreatment narrowed to 4.0–23.5% for those with normal pathology and to 18.0–29.4% for those with normal or low-grade pathology when calculation of overtreatment was restricted to patients diagnosed with high-grade SIL on colposcopy and referral Pap smear. Most common treatment complications are bleeding and infection. Nonetheless, the strategy has become accepted internationally: low costs, decreased patient anxiety, and increased compliance make it appealing, especially in settings with limited health resources, and for patients at risk of not being treated in a timely manner or of not returning for a second appointment. Mathematical modelling may give information about the appropriateness and usefulness of this treatment while the results of long-term clinical trials are awaited.

MINOR 2019 GUIDELINE UPDATES TO CORRECT TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OR CLARIFY WORDING

1) Correction to Figure 7 clarifying that a total of 3 negative HPV-based tests are needed after treatment to return to a 3-year testing interval: The original Figure 7 of the 2019 Guidelines was updated. The revised Figure 7 in this report replaces the original Figure 7 and should be used for clinical management. The revised Figure 7 matches the information included in Table 5b of Egemen et aland the text of the guidelines article, which reads: "In patients treated for histologic or cytologic HSIL, after the initial HPV-based test at 6 months, annual HPV or cotesting is preferred until 3 consecutive negative tests have been obtained (AII)". Risk estimates for the 2019 Guidelines indicate that, following excisional treatment for histologic HSIL/CIN2–3, three consecutive negative HPV tests or cotests are needed at 1-year intervals to identify a group of patients at sufficiently low risk that they can safely return to 3-year testing interval. The 2019 Guidelines recommend that the first test occur 6 months after the excisional procedure. Figure 7 erroneously recommended an HPV test or cotest at 6 months followed by 3 consecutive annual HPV or cotests (a total of 4 consecutive negative tests). This has been corrected to recommend the first HPV test or cotest at 6 months followed by additional HPV or cotests at 18 months and 30 months. The figure has also been modified to clarify that follow-up should continue at 3-year intervals for a minimum of 25 years and through at least age 65 years and may continue for as long as the patient is in good health.
2) Prior Correction to Figure 2 Legend Published October 2020: The legend for Figure 2 of the original 2019 Guidelines articlewas updated to clarify the algorithm for management after a minimally abnormal screening test result followed by a colposcopy at which high-grade histology was not found. The figure legend is repeated here for clarity: "This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e. less severe than ASC-H). If the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results".

### How are women with high grade pap smear abnormalities managed? A population based study [^9578d888]. Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This population based study investigates the patterns of care women with high grade cervical dysplasia receive.

Methods

The study population includes women with a first time diagnosis of a high grade dysplasia (ASC-H, AGUS, HSIL, malignancy, carcinoma) from 2000 to 2005 as identified in a centralized cervical smear database. Record linkages were then carried out to other databases of health care services to characterize management.

Results

Women (43,712) with a high grade dysplasia had a mean age of 37.6. HSIL and AGC accounted for 55% and 33% of abnormalities, respectively. The mean time to referral to colposcopy services ranged from 6 to 24 weeks. Women (1195) were diagnosed with an underlying cervical cancer with a mean time to diagnosis of 26, 26, 17, 6, and 3 weeks for the cytologic abnormality of ASC-H, AGUS, HSIL, malignancy, and carcinoma, respectively. Women (559) were diagnosed with endometrial cancer. The mean time to diagnosis from index Pap was 16, 5.3 and 1.5 weeks for AGC, malignancy, and carcinoma on Pap test, respectively. The percentage of patients with a high grade Pap smear who had no follow-up all up to a 2-year window from index Pap was 5.4, 74, 19, 1.22, and 0.18% for ASC-H, AGUS, HSIL, malignancy and carcinoma on Pap, respectively.

Conclusions

The mean time to referral to colposcopy and rates of loss to follow-up for high grade smears are influenced by cytologic nomenclature. Explicit language is recommended for national guidelines to reduce the prolonged time in the workup of patients who may have serious premalignant and malignant lesion of the reproductive tract.

HPV-positive ASC-US management after colposcopy with less than CIN 2 — The corrected Figure 2 legend states that a patient with this minimally abnormal screening result "would be managed based on risk estimates". "The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.5%)". If colposcopy shows "less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return)", and at the 1-year return a second HPV-positive ASC-US "has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return)". For the second postcolposcopy surveillance test, "if the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended". If results are "either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended", and "Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results". Similar management "would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H)".

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^ea4408cb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients — management of incidental Pap test findings: Pap tests are not reliable for the diagnosis of vaginitis, and diagnostic confirmation is recommended for incidental findings of vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis on a Papanicolaou (Pap) test. For vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal Candida species are present in 20–30% of asymptomatic patients, treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis on a Pap test is not indicated, and symptomatic patients with Pap results showing Candida should be evaluated with confirmatory diagnostic testing. For bacterial vaginosis, the Pap test is an unreliable tool with a sensitivity of 49% and specificity of 93%; in symptomatic patients with suggestive Pap results confirmatory diagnostic testing should be performed, whereas asymptomatic patients with suggestive findings do not need evaluation or treatment. For trichomoniasis, the Pap test has a low sensitivity (55–60%); if Pap suggests trichomonads, confirmatory diagnostic testing should be performed, and patients with confirmed trichomoniasis should be treated with a recommended therapy.

KPNC and NCI-KPNC Persistence and Progression (PaP) study — HPV genotyping sampling is detailed: Genotyping for residual aliquots was available for almost 19,000 patients, with the PaP study conducted from 2006 to 2013 using a 2-phase stratified sampling design. In the first phase, the PaP enrollment window (2006–2011) guided storage of residual specimens that included approximately 45,000 HPV-positive specimens representing > 3/4 of all HPV positivity and a random sample of approximately 100,000 HPV-negative specimens. Typing focused primarily on HPV positive patients and included all unselected patients with cancer or AIS, 500 unselected with CIN 3, and 500 unselected with CIN 2; retesting of HPV-negative results was restricted to a random group of 5000 plus patients with rare outcomes suggesting elevated cancer risks.

### The pap test and bethesda 2014: "The reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. (after a quotation from mark twain) " [^f0ae9825]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The Bethesda System for gynecologic cytopathology has standardized reporting terminology over the past quarter of a century. In doing so, it has allowed for improved communication among practitioners around the world, facilitated large research projects and clinical trials, and has provided the basis from which uniformly accepted risk-based management strategies have been developed. Over time, changes in terminology and the underlying science require revisions, and the third edition of the Bethesda "Atlas" is the result of a yearlong effort to provide such an update. New material was developed and proposed via an Internet bulletin board, allowing for wide commentary that was compiled and incorporated. New images were collected, which comprised many new examples of equivocal presentations and mimics. New background material on the scientific basis supporting the terminology categories, the most current management algorithms, and comprehensive references were included. The effort completely refurbishes this standard reference that forms an inexpensive and, therefore, widely available resource for the world's cytology community.

ASCCP meeting key provider responses — among respondents, for women 30 y and older the screening test used was cytology (Pap test)/HPV co-testing in 124 (91.85%), cytology (Pap test) alone in 5 (3.70%), HPV testing alone in 3 (2.22%), and N/A in 3 (2.22). For HPV testing, provision of partial genotyping results was yes in 101 (79.53%). HPV-based screening started 0–5 y ago in 28 (22.40%), 5–10 y ago in 64 (51.20%), and > 10 y ago in 33 (26.40%). Following the current (2012) ASCCP consensus guidelines was always/almost always in 126 (93.33%), sometimes in 5 (3.70%), and N/A in 4 (2.96%). Use of the current ASCCP app was yes in 98 (72.59%). Among those who do not use the app, willingness to use it if incorporated into the electronic medical record was yes in 25 (75.76%), and if incorporated as a risk score and/or recommendation attached to the patient's laboratory result was yes in 29 (85.29%). When managing a current abnormal result, reviewing past cytology/HPV/colposcopy results was yes in 131 (98.50%), and believing that incorporating patients' history into the current management recommendation will be an improvement was yes in 119 (88.15%).

Risk-based management scenarios and eligibility after a prior HPV-negative screen are outlined as follows: Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results; Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result, and to qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g., a normal screening interval); Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopy referral, including management of current cotest results after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM; Scenario 3 describes management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results; Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found, with Table 4a for low-grade index tests and Table 4b for high-grade index tests; Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3; and notably, HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL preceded by a negative HPV test are now recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than immediately referred to colposcopy.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^7b3a4615]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

HPV-based prior results and high-quality colposcopy modify near-term management — after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, a new abnormal screening result has substantially reduced estimated risk of CIN 3+, often leading to surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy; in contrast, a previous negative cytology result alone does not similarly reduce risk. A colposcopic examination confirming low-grade or normal histology reduces estimated risk in the next 2 years and allows patients with HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL at their 1-year follow-up to return for repeat HPV or cotesting in 1 more year rather than immediately return to colposcopy.

Risk by cytology/HPV category and initial management — severe cytologic abnormalities carry a predicted 5-year risk of about 85% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or a more severe lesion, whereas a normal cytologic test result with a positive human papillomavirus (HPV) test result carries a predicted 5-year risk of about 10%. With the use of current management algorithms, immediate colposcopy is recommended to about 4% of screened women after 1 round of screening, and among those undergoing colposcopy with biopsy, about 28% report moderate or more severe pain and 22% report postprocedure bleeding of at least moderate severity.

ASCCP risk-based management — risk-stratified actions for cervical screening abnormalities are outlined as follows: at the highest risk, expedited treatment can be performed without need for colposcopic biopsy; at somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopy is recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment; at lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed and surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent with 1 and 3 years maintained as 2 levels of concern/attention; and women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

HPV-based testing: this term is used in this document to describe the use of either cotesting or primary HPV screening for surveillance after abnormalities. It does not apply to reflex HPV testing for triage of ASC-US cytology in this document. The HPV testing and positive HPV results discussed throughout this document refer to high-risk HPV types only.

Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST): this term refers to 2-tiered pathology criteria for evaluating histologic specimens obtained via colposcopic biopsy

Primary HPV testing: testing with HPV testing alone as a screening or surveillance test.

Reflex testing: this means that laboratories should perform a specific additional triage test in the setting of a positive screening test to inform the next steps in management. For example, an ASC-US cytology should trigger a reflex HPV test. New for these guidelines, a positive a positive primary HPV screening test should trigger both a reflex genotyping test (to determine the presence/absence of HPV 16/18 if that information is not included in the initial primary test result) and also a reflex cytology test to determine whether the patient would be a candidate for expedited management.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^fa7b6a97]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TAKEN TO CREATE THE NEW GUIDELINES

The ASCCP and NCI cooperatively planned and supported the consensus process, with administrative support provided by the ASCCP. The convening of the consensus group is described in the main guidelines article. Once convened, the major task of the participating representatives was to decide on durable clinical action thresholds, striving to represent US consensus as to what clinical actions are recommended for increasing severity of cervical screening abnormalities. The following axiomatic principles were followed: the main purpose of cervical screening in the United States is to find precancerous lesions ("precancer") that can be treated easily to prevent invasive cervical cancer. Putting aside temporarily whether precancer is best defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/CIN 3/AIS, or CIN 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/AIS, there are a limited number of clinical actions available to clinicians and patients when faced with a cervical screening abnormality. Logically, a patient known to be at very high risk of having precancer has the greatest need of preventive treatment; at the highest risk, expedited treatment might be preferred without need for colposcopic biopsy. At somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopic biopsies are recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment. At lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed, but surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent (1 and 3 years were maintained as the 2 levels of concern/attention) to reduce the risk of "interval cancers" occurring before the next testing visit. Women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

### Is it clinically useful to repeat a pap smear at colposcopy? [^02906046]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the role of repeating a Pap smear at the time of colposcopy performed within 6 months of a referent Pap smear.

Materials and Methods

A clinical database was queried to identify colposcopies performed within 6 months of a referent abnormal squamous Pap smear at which time a repeat Pap smear was obtained. All Pap smears and cervical biopsy specimens were interpreted at an affiliated hospital laboratory. Referent Pap smears, repeat Pap smears, colposcopic cervical biopsy results, patient age and ethnicity, and the interval since the referent Pap smear were tabulated. A hierarchy of Pap smear results was defined a priori to characterize the relative differences between the referent and repeat Pap smears. Results of repeat smears and cervical biopsies were contrasted with the referent Pap smears. An assessment was made of the clinical usefulness of the repeat Pap smear.

Results

Four hundred ninety-eight patients contributed 536 colposcopies with repeat Pap smears within 6 months of the referent smear. Pap smears obtained at colposcopy predominantly were either of lower severity (52.2%) or unchanged (42%). Management of 8 of 498 patients (1.6%) was influenced by the results of the repeat Pap smear. The outcomes for six recommendations for a loop electrosurgical excision procedure included three cases of diagnoses of potentially reversible conditions.

Conclusions

The evidence for the clinical usefulness of repeating a Pap smear at colposcopy for a squamous cytologic abnormality under the defined study parameters is noncompelling. Continued surveillance is a critical component of management.

### A study of partial human papillomavirus genotyping in support of the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^7415dbf1]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer screening strategies are shifting from cytology to human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. HPV testing is more sensitive and, when negative, offers greater reassurance against cancer. However, most infections are typically benign, clearing within 2 years of acquisition, and in most cases do not require invasive diagnostic procedures or treatment.

Secondary "triage" testing of HPV-positive women is an important step in clinical management. Cytology is currently recommended as a triage strategy, with most nonnormal cytologic results among HPV-positive women leading to immediate colposcopy. Among HPV-positive women, HPV genotyping can be used in addition to cytology to effectively stratify the risk of precancer. In the 2012 guidelines and 2015 clinical guidance, partial genotyping was incorporated into management; women with HPV-positive, cytology of Negative for Intraepithelial Lesions or Malignancy (NILM) were referred to colposcopy if the highest-risk HPV types (HPV 16 or HPV 18) were detected.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved several HPV tests that provide genotyping information. Commercially available clinical tests vary in the degree to which they can identify specific HPV types, from no individual typing to extended genotyping. Regardless of typing capability, the number of types actually reported by screening assays in the United States is currently restricted (as of the beginning of 2020) to the highest-risk types: HPV 16, HPV 18, and sometimes HPV 45.

The large National Cancer Institute/ Kaiser Permanente Northern California Persistence and Progression (PaP) study was initiated in 2006 partially to help guide the use of typing as a triage after positive HPV testing. This analysis uses data from the PaP study to fit risk estimates for partial HPV genotyping into the clinical action thresholds for the new 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1503ac56]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

§ Negative HPV test or cotest (HPV plus Pap test) results only reduce risk sufficiently to defer colposcopy if performed for screening purposes within the last 5 years. Colposcopy is still warranted if negative HPV test or cotest results occurred in the context of surveillance for a previous abnormal result.

¶ Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years. Colposcopy with biopsy is an acceptable option if desired by patient after shared decision-making.

The following are highlights of the new management guidelines:

Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk. º If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e. negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV positive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or cotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results would not similarly reduce risk). º Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients. º If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result (i.e. HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º If a patient who has not been screened in more than 5 years (i.e. rarely screened) has an HSIL cytology result and a positive HPV test (regardless of type), then treatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important. Considerations include age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.
When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management. º Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone. º HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal. º HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, and colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the cytology test is normal. Because of the association of HPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling is acceptable at the time of colposcopy. º If the HPV type is not HPV 16 or 18, and the cytology test is normal, return in 1 year is recommended in most cases.
HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing alone for follow-up after an abnormal test result. º Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss disease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, cytology testing is recommended more often than HPV testing or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. Specifically, cytology testing is recommended annually when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at 3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually.
After treatment for a high-grade precancer (moderate or severe dysplasia), surveillance should continue for at least 25 years. º Initial testing includes an HPV test or cotest at 6, 18, and 30 months. If cytology alone is used, testing should occur at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. º After completing initial testing, long-term surveillance includes testing at 3-year intervals if using HPV testing or cotesting, or annual testing if using cytology testing alone. º Surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after the initial treatment, even if this extends beyond age 65 years. If a woman undergoes hysterectomy during the surveillance period, vaginal screening should continue.

### The 2001 bethesda system terminology… [^352796b6]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

It has been shown that the presence of endocervical cells as a quality indicator of adequate sampling increases the detection of cervical abnormalities 5; however, other studies 6, 7 have not demonstrated that a lack of transformation zone components in otherwise negative specimens indicates a higher risk of subsequent detection of histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Lack of endocervical cells has not been shown to be associated with an excess of disease in longitudinal studies in which histologic disease, rather than cytologic prediction of disease, is the end point.
8. 11 The unsatisfactory category includes specimens that do not contain sufficient cells for reliable interpretation. However, any specimen with abnormal cells will be described as satisfactory for evaluation regardless of the number of cells present. 3 This does not mean that an unsatisfactory specimen reflects the absence of a neoplastic process.

Although an unsatisfactory specimen can represent a benign condition, a considerable number of women with unsatisfactory specimens have a subsequent histologic diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesion or cancer.
12. 16 of 4, 143 diagnoses of ASCUS with subsequent histology reported that in 63 percent of the women, SIL or malignancy was detected on further follow-up. In a study 17 correlating cervical cytology and subsequent histology in 560 women with ASCUS, 17 percent of the follow-up biopsies demonstrated HSIL, and 19 percent showed a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. ASC-US excludes cytology suggestive of HSIL. ASC-H is interpreted as cytologic changes that are suggestive of HSIL but lack criteria for definitive interpretation. 3 ASC-H is the less common qualifier, accounting for 5 to 10 percent of all ASC cases, but the risk of an underlying high-grade lesion is higher in this category than in ASC-US.

26 indicates that the term AGUS is a misnomer — rather than being a vague cytologic category, it actually represents a marker for significant glandular or squamous pathology. As many as 44 percent of women diagnosed with AGUS actually may be found on follow-up to have a squamous lesion. 27 In the previous study, 26 women in the category AGUS with a coexisting squamous abnormality were 9. 7 times more likely to have histologic CIN 3 than women in the category AGUS, favor reactive.

### Delivering guideline-concordant care for patients with high-risk HPV and normal cytologic findings [^0160ab81]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Guidelines are intended to increase delivery of the best care to the most people. Achieving this goal requires both well-founded guidelines and feasible implementation. The 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines for managing abnormal cervical cancer screening results are designed to "ensure equal management for equal risks" and balance screening benefits with the harms of overtesting and treatment. (p103) A diverse set of stakeholders, including clinical specialty organizations and patient advocacy groups, was involved in the consensus process during guideline development. While these guidelines were based on the best available evidence and have an admirable goal, the feasibility of implementation in routine care is unclear. Uneven implementation could have adverse outcomes and perpetuate cervical cancer disparities.

To apply risk-based guidelines correctly, 2 elements are essential: (1) data on screening history and current risk factors, and (2) continued engagement with health care systems to deliver surveillance testing, diagnostic evaluation, and excisional treatment (if needed). Retrospective data are challenging to obtain and are most likely available when patients have had an ongoing relationship with the system for several years. According to Tiro, many patients are missing screening history data; therefore, management recommendations are made under conditions of uncertainty when clinicians, at the time of an abnormal result, may not have access to the information needed to assess risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 or worse (CIN3+).

2019 ASCCP risk-based management erratum — Figure 2 legend for minimally abnormal HPV-positive ASC-US specifies corrected risk estimates and recommendations. This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV-based test performed for the second post-colposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second post-colposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASCUS or LSIL results. Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H). The erratum clarifies that the prior legend instead reported immediate risk 4.2% and a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return).

4) Patient Scenarios Not Initially Addressed in the 2019 Guidelines:

Additional guidance was developed to address scenarios for which the 2019 Guidelines did not initially provide management recommendations. This guidance was voted on in July 2021 and previously published. To summarize, this guidance (1) outlined management guidelines for cytology results without HPV testing among individuals aged 25 years and older and (2) clarified management when previous guidelines had not been followed:

(a) Guideline for individuals aged 25 and older screened with cytology alone: For individuals aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 guidelines should be followed. In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation.
(b) Guideline for cases in which colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed: In cases in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed, the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]. If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — patients younger than 25 years, initial management after an abnormal screening test result: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL], atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude HSIL [ASC-H], atypical glandular cells [AGC], adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e., histologic low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL; CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g., repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher).

Data Presentation: Clinical Scenarios

Risk-based management tables are organized under the 5 clinical scenarios. It is important to emphasize that for a given patient over time, a clinician is likely to consult various tables as the management scenarios are encountered, from initial abnormality to resolution. Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results. Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result. To qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g. a normal screening interval).

Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Abnormal Screening Results, When There Are No Known Prior HPV Test Results

TABLE 1B
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ After a Prior HPV-Negative Screen Documented in the Medical Record

Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopic referral. Management of current cotest results is described after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US (see Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C).

TABLE 2A

Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Results Obtained in Follow-up of HPV-Negative LSIL

Table 2C
Immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for results obtained in follow-up of HPV-positive NILM

Scenario 3, management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results, describes subsequent management based on the colposcopy/biopsy diagnosis (see Table 3). Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found (i.e. colposcopy/biopsy results were CIN 1 or normal). Table 4A describes CIN 3+ risks when the index cotest was low grade (i.e. LSIL, ASC-US, or HPV-positive NILM). Table 4B describes CIN 3+ risks when the index cotest was high grade (i.e. ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+). Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, either short term (see Table 5A) or longer term (see Table 5B).

Human papillomavirus genotyping conducted on residual aliquots was available for almost 19,000 patients at KPNC who were also at NCI-KPNC Persistence and Progression (PaP) study conducted from 2006 to 2013. Selection occurred through a 2-phase stratified sampling design. In the first phase of sampling, patients at KPNC with a cotest within the PaP enrollment window (2006–2011) were selected for storage of residual HPV testing specimens; the collection included approximately 45,000 HPV-positive patients (representing > 3/4 of all HPV positive patients in that period) and a random group of approximately 10,000 HPV-negative patients. Approximately 8% of patients opted out, leaving 44,340 patients enrolled in the study. In the second phase of sampling, residual aliquots of patients in the PaP cohort were selected for genotyping using a complex stratified sampling design based on HPV results and histopathology outcomes (as of 2014) to maximize information yield. Typing focused primarily on HPV-positive patients, which included a random draw plus all unselected patients who were diagnosed with cancer or AIS, 500 unselected patients with CIN 3, and 500 unselected patients with CIN 2. Retesting by research typing assays of HPV-negative patients was restricted to a random group of 500 plus all unselected patients with rare outcomes suggesting elevated cancer risks (i.e. CIN 2+ histopathology or high-grade cytology). Both the KPNC and NCI-KPNC PaP studies have been reapproved yearly by both KPNC and NCI institutional review board committees.

Screening Tests and Clinical Management in the KPNC

Since 2001, patients at the KPNC have been tested with HPV to triage cytology results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). Beginning in 2003, patients 30 years or older underwent screening with concurrent HPV and cytology cotests. In 2013, cotesting was extended to ages 25–29 years.

The clinical HPV testing was conducted using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to manufacturer's instructions. It reports HPV status as negative versus positive for infection with any of the 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and also inadvertently detects through cross-reaction a percentage of closely related low-risk HPV types (e.g. 53, 66, 67, 70, 82, and 82).

"Recent series have reported that 9% to 38% of women with AGC have significant neoplasia (CIN 2,3, AIS, or cancer) and 3% to 17% have invasive cancer". Additionally, "CIN lesions have been found in 8% to 83% of women with AGC, of which 40% to 68% are CIN 2, 3".

Approaches to managing women with HSIL — triage and diagnostic considerations: Intermediate triage using HPV testing or cytology is generally not useful, the ability of colposcopy to recognize the full spectrum of CIN is operator-dependent and its sensitivity for detecting CIN 2,3 is more limited than previously appreciated, and failure to detect CIN 2,3 at colposcopy does not necessarily mean a lesion is not present although occult carcinoma is unlikely. As a result, most women with HSIL eventually undergo a diagnostic excisional procedure, and many have advocated "see-and-treat" approaches with a loop electrosurgical excision.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^d34eca65]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management — one-year surveillance thresholds and indications are as follows: When the estimated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risk is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with human papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing is recommended (AII). Follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities — HPV-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) or HPV-negative/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.9% respectively) — and after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], or repeated HPV-positive NILM). Because risk is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within approximately 5 years or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds; patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk of 0.40%), and patients with a low-grade cotest result followed by colposcopy less than CIN 2 and a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold. A previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — revised Figure 2 legend for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) outlines risk-based actions. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk = 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV test or cotest performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion results. Note similar management would be recommended for any minimally abnormal test result less severe than atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. NA indicates not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### Updated guidelines for management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities [^45835ad7]. ACOG (2020). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening abnormalities — prior HPV results and triage: CIN 3+ risk was considered alongside individual risk factors, and the guidelines emphasize the importance of previous human papillomavirus (HPV) test results; new abnormal results after a negative HPV test within the previous 5 years indicate new infection, and such patients have approximately half the CIN 3+ risk of those with unknown previous results and can now be safely triaged to surveillance rather than receiving immediate colposcopy.

TABLE 1
Participating Organizations

Box 1. Essential Changes From Prior Management Guidelines

1) Recommendations are based on risk, not results.

Recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance will be based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by a combination of current results and history (including unknown history). The same current test results may yield different management recommendations depending on the history of recent past test results. 2) Colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients.
Repeat HPV testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (e.g. low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest).
At the 1-year follow-up test, referral to colposcopy is recommended if results remain abnormal. 3) Guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (i.e. treatment without colposcopic biopsy).
Expedited treatment was an option for patients with HSIL cytology in the 2012 guidelines; this guidance is now better defined.
For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥ 60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%. Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology) and never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL regardless of HPV genotype.
Shared decision-making should be used when considering expedited treatment, especially for patients with concerns about the potential impact of treatment on pregnancy outcomes. 4) Excisional treatment is preferred to ablative treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) in the United States. Excision is recommended for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). 5) Observation is preferred to treatment for CIN 1.
Treatment remains acceptable for patients with repeat diagnoses of CIN 1 persisting 2 years or more. 6) Histopathology reports based on Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST)/World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for reporting histologic HSIL should include CIN 2 or CIN 3 qualifiers, i.e. HSIL(CIN 2) and HSIL (CIN 3). 7) All positive HPV tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen (e.g. reflex cytology).
Additional testing from the same laboratory specimen is recommended because the findings may inform colposcopy practice. For example, those with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 qualify for expedited treatment.
HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer, so additional evaluation (e.g. colposcopy with biopsy) is necessary even when cytology results are negative.
If HPV 16 and 18 testing is positive, and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy. 8) Continued surveillance with HPV testing or cotesting at 3-year intervals for at least 25 years is recommended after treatment of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3, or AIS. Continued surveillance at 3-year intervals beyond 25 years is acceptable for as long as the patient's life expectancy and ability to be screened are not significantly compromised by serious health issues.
The 2012 guidelines recommended return to 5-year screening intervals and did not specify when screening should cease. New evidence indicates that risk remains elevated for at least 25 years, with no evidence that treated patients ever return to risk levels compatible with 5-year intervals.
Surveillance with cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible. Cytology is less sensitive than HPV testing for detection of precancer and is therefore recommended more often. Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually. Cytology is recommended annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting. 9) Human papilloma virus assays that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for screening should be used for management according to their regulatory approval in the United States. (Note: all HPV testing in this document refers to testing for high-risk HPV types only).
For all management indications, HPV mRNA and HPV DNA tests without FDA approval for primary screening alone should only be used as a cotest with cytology, unless sufficient, exceptionally rigorous data are available to support primary HPV testing in management.

4.000000000000000e+00 Colposcopy practice must follow guidance detailed in the ASCCP Colposcopy Standards. Colposcopy with targeted biopsy remains the primary method of detecting precancers requiring treatment. Because patients are managed less aggressively after a colposcopic examination where CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+) is not found, maximizing detection of CIN 2+ at each colposcopy visit is paramount. Evidence-based practice recommends that biopsies be taken of all discrete acetowhite areas, usually 2 to 4 biopsies at each colposcopic examination. For those at lowest risk, defined as less than HSIL cytology, no evidence of HPV 16/18 infection, and a completely normal colposcopic impression (i.e. no acetowhitening, metaplasia, or other visible abnormality, and a fully visualized squamocolumnar junction), untargeted (random) biopsies are not recommended and patients with a completely normal colposcopic impression can be observed without biopsy. To ensure that CIN 2+ is not missed, the ASCCP Colposcopy Standards emphasize the need for biopsies even when the colposcopic impression is normal but any degree of acetowhitening, metaplasia, or other abnormality is present.

2012 Principles Carried Forward

5.000000000000000e+00 The primary goal of screening and management is cancer prevention through detection and treatment of cervical precancer. Numerous population-level studies indicate that incidence and mortality from cervical cancer decrease as detection and treatment of high-grade histologic cervical abnormalities (generally defined as CIN 2+) increases. Timely detection and treatment of the highest grade of precancers (CIN 3/AIS) have been the benchmark used for previous guidelinesand remain the primary goal of the 2019 management guideline; a secondary goal (because of the relative rarity of this finding in the United States) is early diagnosis of cervical cancer to reduce related morbidity and mortality. A patient's risk of having or developing CIN 3+ is estimated based on current and previous results, as well as history of previous precancer treatment. Management recommendations are guided by risk thresholds. Recommendations of routine screening, 1- or 3-year surveillance, colposcopy, or treatment each correspond to a risk stratum. These risk strata (ranges of risk for CIN 3+) are defined by Clinical Action Thresholds that were determined through the consensus process (Section E).

Atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude high-grade (ASC-H) management — The recommended management of women with ASC-H is referral for colposcopic evaluation (AII). In women in whom cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2,3) is not identified, follow-up with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing at 12 months or cytological testing at 6 months and 12 months is acceptable (CIII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for HPV DNA or who are found to have ASC-US or greater on their repeat cytological tests (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy", return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AI). If CIN 2,3 is identified, manage per ASCCP Guideline.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^eb0e6753]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with an estimated immediate risk of CIN 3+ 25% or greater and less than 60% based on history and current results, treatment using an excisional procedure without previous biopsy confirmation or histologic evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy are both acceptable (AII).

Rationale: The 2012 guidelines allow treatment without biopsy-proven histologic confirmation include patients who have HSIL cytology independent of HPV status. In the KPNC data set, the 25% to 59% risks strata includes patients with the following results and immediate CIN 2+/CIN 3+ risks, respectively: (a) HPV-negative HSIL cytology: 47%/25%; (b) HPV-positive ASC-H cytology: 50%/26%; (c) HPV-positive AGC (all categories): 40%/26%; and (d) HPV-positive HSIL cytology: 77%/49%. Using this threshold, 2.8 patients will undergo excisional procedures for every CIN 3+ treated.

### European guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening. second edition – summary document [^2f82694d]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

guidelines for management of screen-positive women

A woman with a high-grade cytological lesion, a repeated low-grade lesion or an equivocal cytology result and a positive HPV test should be referred for colposcopy. The role of colposcopy is to identify the location of the abnormal cells, to target taking of biopsies and to decide whether any treatment is required. Colposcopy should only be carried out by adequately trained health professionals.
Guidelines are provided for the management of ASC-US and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Guidelines for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) are difficult to delineate because current evidence does not indicate that any method of management is optimal. Repeat cytology or colposcopy are acceptable options, but HPV testing as an initial management option is not sufficiently selective for all women with LSIL. However, HPV testing in older women with LSIL can be considered.
Quality assurance and collection of data on patient management are important elements of the management and follow-up of women referred with an abnormal cervical smear.
Colposcopy is sometimes proposed as an alternative screening method, but its specificity (and probably also its sensitivity) in primary screening is too low for this purpose.

Results

From January 2006 to December 2011, 9001 new referrals were seen by colposcopy services at the Northumbria Healthcare Trust. Out of 3000 women with borderline smears identified from AxSys during the study period, 175 (2%) were BNCs. Eight patients failed to attend colposcopy within 6 months of the index smear. Therefore, 167 (96%) women, who were seen within 6 months of the index smear, formed the basis of the study.

Median age (range) of the study group was 43 years (20–68) and the median parity (range) was 2 (0–5). Fifteen women (9%) had previous treatment, while 35 (21%) had previous abnormal smears. Twenty (12%) women were symptomatic. Twenty-six (15%) women were postmenopausal and one woman was pregnant. Forty-seven (28%) were on some form of hormonal treatment (Supplementary Table 1).

Colposcopy was satisfactory in 156 women (93%). One woman had a repeat cytology on her initial visit, while 11 (7%) underwent cytology surveillance following a normal colposcopy (there were no obvious lesions to biopsy). One woman did not undergo colposcopy at the initial visit, as her biopsy showed inflammation following a colposcopy and diagnostic biopsy in a clinic abroad. Histology was available in 154 women (92%); 9 (5%) excision biopsies and 145 (87%) diagnostic biopsies. Four women had excisional biopsies due to unsatisfactory colposcopy, two on suspicion of high-grade disease on colposcopy and one due to patient request. In two women, the reason for excisional biopsy was not documented. Thirty-seven women (22%) were diagnosed with high-grade histology on initial assessment; 1 (3%) on excision biopsy and 36 (97%) on diagnostic biopsy (Figure 1).

### Empiric care for minimally abnormal pap smears… [^a19ec81f]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

A significant number of Papanicolaou smears are obtained in the United States annually, and approximately 2. 5 million of them are reported to have low-grade cytologic abnormalities. Based on the Bethesda system for reporting Pap smear results, they are classified as minimally abnormal and include benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Although these minimally abnormal Pap smear results are common, management strategies vary from treatment with topical or oral antibiotics to repeating the Pap smear in three to six months. Because recent data have shown a link between minimally abnormal Pap smears and bacterial vaginosis, treatment with antibiotics should, in theory, resolve the abnormality. Ferrante and colleagues studied the efficacy of 0.

75 percent metronidazole vaginal gel therapy in asymptomatic patients who had minimally abnormal Pap smear results. Study participants included women who had routine Pap smears with minimally abnormal results, defined as limited by inflammation, benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes, or ASCUS, that did not favor any neoplastic process. Women who agreed to participate completed a questionnaire to elicit demographic information and risk factors for cervical cancer. Participants were randomized to receive treatment with 0. 75 percent metronidazole vaginal gel, one applicator-full at bedtime for five days, or no treatment. Pap smears were repeated three to four months after enrollment in the study. A follow-up questionnaire was completed at that time to collect data on risk factors for abnormal Pap smears and any side effects of the antibiotic treatment.

editor's note: When coping with abnormal Pap smear results, physicians face the dilemma of determining the best strategy for management. The fact that Pap smears with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be assessed by colposcopic examination of the cervix is not questioned in the literature. However, minimally abnormal Pap smear results do not have a clear-cut management strategy. The study by Ferrante and colleagues provides information about something that does not have an effect on abnormalities. Patients with minimal abnormalities can be followed with repeat Pap smears in four to 12 months, based on their risk factors. An important comment made by the authors is that the vast majority of invasive cervical cancers occur in women who have received no screening, so we should concentrate our efforts on that population. — k. e. m.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^e3116af8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine the appropriate course of management of cervical screening abnormalities. These risk-based management guidelines represent an evolution of the 2012 guidelines, which incorporated human papillomavirus (HPV) test results into an existing cytology-based management framework by benchmarking 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or higher (CIN 3+) after HPV-cytology cotest results to that of cytology-only results. Since 2013, screening has continued to evolve with HPV vaccination, the introduction of new screening technology, and new knowledge of how history of negative HPV testing changes the clinical meaning of test results. To address these changes while ensuring that future revisions to management guidelines are equitable and simple to apply, the 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral when immediate risk of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater").

In this article, we described the additional data sources and improved risk estimation methods used to estimate risks that support the 2019 guidelines. For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, we produced a risk profile of CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+), CIN 3+, and cancer risks from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test. We formalized how risk is used to determine the recommended risk-based management through the use of clinical action thresholds. Finally, we validated risk estimates by examining portability of risk-based management to diverse settings, including underinsured and underserved patients, using risks estimated from 3 independent, previously unpublished cohorts/trials and one published comparison.

Atypical endocervical or glandular cells favor neoplasia or endocervical AIS — If invasive disease is not identified during the initial colposcopic workup, it is recommended that women with atypical endocervical or glandular cells "favor neoplasia" or endocervical AIS undergo a diagnostic excisional procedure (AII). It is recommended that the type of diagnostic excisional procedure used in this setting provide an intact specimen with interpretable margins (BII), and concomitant endocervical sampling is preferred (BII).

### 2001 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities [^ab8d4aae]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer precursors.

Participants

A panel of 121 experts in the diagnosis and management of cervical cancer precursors, including representatives from 29 professional organizations, federal agencies, and national and international health organizations, were invited to participate in a consensus conference sponsored by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP).

Evidence and Consensus Process

Guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities were developed through a multistep process. Starting 6 months before the conference, working groups developed draft management guidelines based on formal literature reviews of English-language articles published in 1988–2001, as well as input from the professional community at large, obtained using interactive Internet-based bulletin boards. On September 6–8, 2001, the ASCCP Consensus Conference was held in Bethesda, Md. Guidelines with supporting evidence were presented and underwent discussion, revision, and voting.

Conclusions

Management of women with atypical squamous cells (ASC) depends on whether the Papanicolaou test is subcategorized as of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or as cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H). Women with ASC-US should be managed using a program of 2 repeat cytology tests, immediate colposcopy, or DNA testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Testing for HPV DNA is the preferred approach when liquid-based cytology is used for screening. In most instances, women with ASC-H, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, HSIL, and atypical glandular cells should be referred for immediate colposcopic evaluation.

### Role of screening history in clinical meaning and optimal management of positive cervical screening results [^b3fc1f43]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical cancer is caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. US consensus management guidelines for a positive cervical screening result typically focus on the current screening result only. A negative testing history may alter risk of the following positive screening results, caused by a new HPV infection, and therefore its optimal management.

Methods

Women ages 30years and older were screened with triennial HPV and cytology co-testing at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2003 to 2014. We estimated the subsequent 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or more severe diagnoses (CIN3+) in a cohort of 1 156 387 women following abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or worse) cytology and/or positive HPV testing, when the test result followed 0 (n = 990 013), 1 (n = 543 986), 2 (n = 245 974), or 3 (n = 79 946) consecutive negative co-test(s). All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Following 0–3 successive negative co-tests, 5-year CIN3+ risks following a positive HPV test decreased progressively from 7.2% (95% CI = 7.0% to 7.4%) to 1.5% (95% CI = 0.7% to 3.4%) (Ptrend < .001). Similarly, risks following an abnormal (ASC-US or worse) cytology result decreased from 6.6% (95% CI = 6.4% to 6.9%) to 1.1% (95% CI = 0.5% to 2.3%) (Ptrend < .001). Risks following low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, the risk threshold for referral to colposcopy in the United States, decreased from 5.2% (95% CI = 4.7% to 5.7%) to 0.9% (95% CI = 0.2% to 4.3%). Risks following high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or more severe, a specific marker for the presence of precancerous lesions, decreased from 50.0% (95% CI = 47.5% to 52.5%) to 10.0% (95% CI = 2.6% to 34.4%).

Conclusions

Following one or more sequential antecedent, documented negative co-tests or HPV tests, women with HPV-positive ASC-US or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion might have sufficiently low CIN3+ risk that they do not need colposcopy referral and might instead undergo 6-12-month surveillance for evidence of higher risk before being referred to colposcopy.

### Updated guidelines for management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities [^29cf1caa]. ACOG (2020). High credibility.

Risk-based framework for cervical cancer screening abnormalities — CIN 3+ risk thresholds for management are defined as follows for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older: Expedited treatment preferred at immediate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3+) risk ≥ 60%; Expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable at 25% to < 60% immediate risk; Colposcopy recommended at 4% to < 25% immediate risk; Repeat test in 1 year at 0.55% to < 4% 5-year risk; Repeat test in 3 years at 0.15% to < 0.55% 5-year risk; and Return to routine screening at 5-year intervals at < 0.15% 5-year risk. The guidelines provide risk thresholds for clinical action and CIN 3+ risk estimates based on a prospective longitudinal cohort validated with other data sets and developed by teams of experts and stakeholders.

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) risk thresholds — stakeholder agreement with proposed management thresholds included that the "3-year return threshold (b) was applied to women whose risk of developing precancer in the next 5 years was between 0.15% and 0.55%, consistent with screening guidelines recommending 3-year intervals after a negative Pap test with an HPV test", that "Nearly all (93%) respondents agreed with the 2% or greater threshold to send patients to colposcopy (d)", and that "Sixty-four percent of respondents agreed with recommendations that expedited treatment should be an option for patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher (CIN 3+) risks between 25% and 49% (e), and 61% of respondents agreed with recommendations to preferentially perform expedited treatment instead of biopsy for CIN 3+ risks exceeding 50% (f)", with the note "Note that CIN3+ risks of 50% correspond with CIN2+ risks of approximately 75%".

Precolposcopy Scenario

We restricted analyses in the precolposcopy scenario to 1,546,462 patients with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy who were not missing HPV or cytology results at the initial screen (insufficient and noncervical cytology results were also excluded). Risks were estimated for 4 testing rounds. Risk estimated from the initial HPV-based screen was used to inform precolposcopic management for patients whose histories of HPV status were unknown. Beginning with the second testing round, patients in a precolposcopy scenario had an important biomarker for risk stratification — their HPV-based test result from the previous round of testing. We estimated risks using the second round to inform precolposcopic management after immediately prior test results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL. We did not provide risk estimates for other prior abnormal test results (e.g. HPV positive/ASC-US, HPV positive/LSIL) that typically lead to colposcopy referral. The third and fourth testing rounds were primarily used to determine whether patients with multiple negative HPV or cotest results after an HPV-positive/NILM, HPV-negative/ASC-US, or HPV-negative/LSIL test result had sufficiently low subsequent risks to permit extension of their testing intervals. Management after more complicated screening histories were not included in these guidelines as we could not precisely estimate risks for some combinations of past/current test results because of the smaller sample sizes.

ASC-US in special populations — HIV-infected, other immunosuppressed women, and postmenopausal women with ASC-US should be managed in the same manner as women in the general population (BII). For pregnant women older than 20 years with ASC-US, management options are identical to those for nonpregnant women, except that it is acceptable to defer colposcopy until at least 6 weeks postpartum (CIII), and endocervical curettage is unacceptable in pregnant women (EIII).

ASCCP risk-based cervical screening management — framework and thresholds: The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine management, representing an evolution from prior result-based approaches that benchmarked 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ after HPV–cytology cotesting. The 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g., "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management, exemplified by "colposcopic referral when immediate risks of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater". For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, risk profiles of CIN 2+, CIN 3+, and cancer are produced from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test to link estimated risk to clinical action thresholds.

Applicability: Are There Concerns That the Included Patients Do Not Match the Research Question?

This question addresses whether the findings from the study population will be applicable to the target population. Applicability may be affected when the age range and age distribution of the study population differ from what is expected in routine clinical practice, when the extent of previous screening and management is not comparable with the target population, and/or if the study is restricted to individuals with certain screening results. In addition, there are other population characteristics that may influence the risk of disease, for example, HIV prevalence or immunosuppression, which may introduce concerns about applicability if the intended target is the general population.

Considerations for Specific Indications

For screening and triage, the source population should reflect individuals undergoing routine cervical cancer screening in the appropriate age range (e.g. 21–65 years), and the study population should include a series of consecutively screened patients or a random sample that can be weighted back to the full screening population. If the population is enriched for disease endpoints (e.g. from a colposcopy referral population), then a sampling frame and weighting scheme should be described that allows extrapolation back to the full screening population. Importantly, when colposcopy clinics are used for enrichment, use of referral criteria that differ from the study question risks the introduction of bias (e.g. if the colposcopy population is based on cytology screening, but the study is evaluating HPV screening). A screening population should include individuals without prior screening abnormalities because previous test results are an important indicator of risk. If the screening history of patients is not known, this should be specifically stated. For postcolposcopy surveillance, the source population is individuals who have undergone colposcopy without treatment; including those with CIN 2 or less. The study population should include a series of consecutive patients with previous colposcopy within 6 to 18 months. Previous screening methods and postcolposcopy management algorithms should be clearly described (e.g. cytology-based screening vs co-testing). For posttreatment surveillance, the source population should reflect individuals who have undergone excisional treatment for histologically confirmed CIN 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ and should not include patients treated for cervical cancer, as well as no or few (≤ 10%) treated less than CIN 2. The study population should include a series of consecutive patients with previous treatment in the last 6 to 18 months, and the treatment modality should be described.

G. RARE CYTOLOGY RESULTS

G.1 Evaluation of Cytology Interpreted as AGC or AIS

Guideline: For nonpregnant patients of all ages with all subcategories of AGC and AIS, except when atypical endometrial cells are specified, colposcopy is recommended regardless of HPV test result; endocervical sampling is recommended at initial colposcopy except in pregnancy (for management in pregnancy, see Section K.2) (AII). Accordingly, triage by reflex HPV testing is not recommended, and triage by repeat cytology is unacceptable (DII). Endometrial sampling is recommended in conjunction with colposcopy and endocervical sampling in nonpregnant patients 35 years or older with all categories of AGC and AIS (AII). Endometrial sampling is also recommended for nonpregnant patients younger than 35 years at increased risk of endometrial neoplasia based on clinical indications (e.g. abnormal uterine bleeding, conditions suggesting chronic anovulation, or obesity) (AII). For patients with atypical endometrial cells specified, initial evaluation limited to endometrial and endocervical sampling is preferred, with colposcopy acceptable at the time of initial evaluation. If colposcopy was deferred and no endometrial pathology is identified, additional evaluation with colposcopy is then recommended (see Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
This figure describes the initial workup of AGC found on cervical cytology.

Subsequent Management

Guideline: For patients with cytology showing AGC not otherwise specified or atypical endocervical cells not otherwise specified in whom histologic HSIL (CIN 2+) or AIS/cancer is not identified, cotesting at 1 and 2 years is recommended. If both cotests are negative, repeat cotesting at 3 years is recommended. If any test is abnormal, then colposcopy is recommended (BII). If CIN 2 or CIN 3 but no glandular lesion is identified histologically for patients with cytology atypical glandular, endocervical, or endometrial cells not otherwise specified, management should be according to the 2019 guidelines for the lesion diagnosed (Section I) (CII). For patients with atypical glandular or endocervical cells "favor neoplasia" or endocervical AIS cytology, if invasive disease is not identified during initial colposcopic workup, a diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended. The diagnostic excisional procedure used in this setting should provide an intact specimen with interpretable margins (BII). Endocervical sampling above the excisional bed is preferred (BII) (see Figure 4).

### Colposcopic evaluation after a repeat atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) smear [^55482a61]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Management of patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) remains controversial. We chose to repeat the Pap smear after four months. If ASCUS persisted in this second test, the patient was advised to undergo colposcopy. Our objective is to determine the clinical significance and the prediction of neoplasia among these patients through a colposcopic examination.

Methods

Of 29,827 patients who had a Pap smear, ASCUS were detected in 1387 (5%) and persisted in the repeat smear of 225 (16%). Colposcopy and an additional Pap smear were performed on 186 patients.

Results

Out of 186 colposcopic evaluations, 91 (49%) were normal and the patients had a negative Pap smear. Colposcopy was abnormal in 95/186 patients (51%) (Table 1). Histology of the directed biopsies revealed 38 (21%) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 17 (9%) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Forty patients (21%) with normal biopsies had ASCUS for the third time in the Pap smear.

Conclusions

Colposcopic evaluation after a repeated Pap smear with ASCUS is an appropriate cost-effective management. Finding 30% of LSIL or HSIL justifies this additional investigation.

Cytology-negative, HPV-positive women 30 years and older — risk and follow-up: Women negative by both tests have a "less than 1 in 1,000 risk of having CIN 2+" and "should not be rescreened before 3 years". In screened populations, the prevalence data showed "6.5%, and 58% of the HPV-positive women had a concurrent negative cytology", and the risk of undetected CIN 2+ in cytology-negative, HPV-positive women ranged "from 2.4% to 5.1%". For comparison, "CIN 2+ was detected at enrollment colposcopy in 10.2% of women of unknown HPV status with ASC-US in ALTS". Natural history data indicate "60% of HPV-positive women became HPV negative after a median follow-up of 6 months". Accordingly, "repeat cytology and HPV testing at 12 months seems to be the best management approach", with persistently HPV-positive women on repeat testing who "should undergo colposcopy, even if cytology negative", while those negative on both tests "can be rescreened in 3 years".

### Overview of the cytology laboratory: specimen processing through diagnosis [^098f7c40]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Screening for cervical cancer by the Papanicolaou or Pap test is a complex and multistep process. From the clinician's examination room to the cytology laboratory, the Pap test involves numerous laboratory personnel, different test types, and the possibility of computer-assisted screening and ancillary testing. The laboratory has in place well-defined procedures to ensure both error reduction and specimen quality to produce reliable Pap test results. The Bethesda System 2001 provides guidance and criteria for both specimen adequacy and diagnostic criteria. Understanding laboratory procedures in Pap testing aids in clinical understanding of tests and results and contributes to effective communication between the pathologist and those involved in patient management of women with cervical abnormalities.

Objective

To provide revised evidence-based consensus guidelines for managing women with abnormal cervical cancer screening test results.

Participants

A group of 146 experts, including representatives from 29 professional organizations, federal agencies, and national and international health organizations, met in Bethesda, MD, September 18–19, 2006, to develop the guidelines. MAJOR CHANGES IN GUIDELINES: The core recommendations for managing women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were changed minimally. Postcolposcopy management for women with these cytological abnormalities is now identical. Management recommendations for these conditions did change for "special populations", such as adolescents for whom a more conservative approach incorporating cytological follow-up for 2 years was approved. Core recommendations for managing women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and atypical glandular cells also underwent only minor modifications. More emphasis is placed on immediate "screen-and-treat" approaches when managing women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Testing for high-risk human papillomavirus DNA is incorporated into the management of women with atypical glandular cells after their initial evaluation with colposcopy and endometrial sampling. The 2004 Interim Guidance for the use of human papillomavirus DNA testing as an adjunct to cervical cytology for screening in women 30 years and older was formally adopted with only very minor modifications.

Conclusions

The 2006 Consensus Guidelines reflect recent data from large clinical trials and advances in technology and are designed to assist clinicians of all subspecialties.

Atypical endocervical, endometrial, or glandular cells not otherwise specified (NOS) — postcolposcopy follow-up when HPV status is known: For women without CIN 2,3 or glandular neoplasia identified histologically, the recommended management is to repeat cytological testing combined with HPV DNA testing at 6 months if HPV DNA positive and at 12 months if HPV DNA negative (CII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for high-risk (oncogenic) HPV DNA or who are found to have atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or greater on repeat cytology; if both tests are negative, women can return to routine cytological testing (BII).

Considerations for specific indications — screening and triage designs and verification are described: Clinical or registration trials typically refer all individuals positive for any test to colposcopy immediately and control follow-up for at least 3 years; for studies integrated in clinical practice, referral algorithms and times may be different, therefore the reference standard may not be applied to the whole population; if their screening results are negative, it is acceptable to assume no precancer or cancer in these individuals.

Endocervical sampling during colposcopy — evidence and utility: Sensitivity is significantly greater when 2 or more biopsies are obtained, and although the utility of performing endocervical sampling in all women undergoing colposcopy is controversial, there is some evidence to suggest that endocervical sampling may be useful even in women with satisfactory colposcopy; in one study the lesion was detected only by endocervical curettage in 5.5% of the women.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^d2c81d5e]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

HOW THE NEW APPROACH WILL WORK IN PRACTICE

Clinicians are likely to consult guidelines in 5 different clinical situations: consideration of a new abnormal screening result; management of a follow-up test result at a 1- or 3-year surveillance return visit; interpretation of colposcopic biopsy diagnosis; follow-up of postcolposcopy surveillance of patients not initially found to need treatment (e.g. a biopsy < CIN 2); and posttreatment follow-up. An individual patient under management would likely attend more than one of these visits.

It is important to realize that most clinical visits devoted to management of abnormal cervical cancer screening results will involve common and ultimately benign HPV infections and minor cytologic abnormalities. For example, roughly 20% of individuals participating in cotesting for 7 years at KPNC had at least 1 abnormal result (HPV and/or cytology). The 2019 guidelines address as many abnormal result combinations as possible, using 2 different approaches. The common initial visits that are mainly minor abnormalities are handled in the 2019 guidelines by use of risk tables and clinical action thresholds. At the KPNC, colposcopy referrals leading to postcolposcopy management decisions are about half as frequent as initial management visits; these are addressed by both risk tablesand, for uncommon or especially high-risk situations, management algorithm figures. Treatment and posttreatment visits are uncommon (approximately 1/10th as frequent as initial management visits in the KPNC data set), but are especially important to preventing cancer, and are addressed using a series of management algorithm figures.

Bethesda terminology and CIN categories — The 2001 Bethesda System terminology is used for cytological classification, employing low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Histology uses a 2-tiered system with CIN 1 for low-grade lesions and CIN 2,3 for high-grade precursors. Cytological LSIL is not equivalent to histological CIN 1 and cytological HSIL is not equivalent to histological CIN 2,3.

The HPV–negative ASC-US is also a reassuring history result (see Table 2A). A negative cotest after HPV-negative ASC-US warrants return to screening at 5-year intervals (5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.14%, which is less than the 0.15% 5-year surveillance threshold). Minor abnormalities (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US and HPV-positive LSIL) after HPV-negative ASC-US are recommended to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 2A). Though higher risk than HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL is less risky than previously thought, allowing minor abnormalities after HPV-negative LSIL (i.e. HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM) to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 2B). In addition, HPV-negative ASC-US and HPV-negative LSIL after HPV-positive NILM are recommended to have a deferred management of 1-year surveillance (see Table 2C).

Colposcopy performed for low-grade abnormalities, which confirms the absence of CIN 2+ reduces risk. After a colposcopic examination performed for low-grade abnormalities (e.g.; HPV-positive NILM × 2, HPV-positive ASC-US, or HPV-positive LSIL) at which CIN 1 or less was confirmed via biopsy, minor abnormalities (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US and HPV-positive LSIL) found on the first follow-up test are recommended to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 4A). Because all repeat abnormalities were referred back to colposcopy at KPNC, we cannot estimate risks for additional rounds of follow-up. Therefore, the 2019 guidelines recommend referral for colposcopy for abnormal results occurring on subsequent rounds of follow-up testing.

Approaches to managing women with ASC-US: Clinical data from ALTS and other studies have demonstrated that 2 repeat cytological examinations performed at 6-month intervals, testing for HPV, and a single colposcopic examination are all safe and effective approaches, and the 2001 Consensus Guidelines recognized that all 3 approaches were acceptable; a meta-analysis performed in 2004 reported that the pooled estimate of the sensitivity of HPV testing for detecting women with CIN 2,3 is considerably higher than that of a single repeat cytology, and in ALTS repeating cytology twice at 6-month intervals detected 95% of CIN 3 lesions using an ASC-US threshold for colposcopy and referred 67% of the women to colposcopy, while for comparison a single HPV test identified 92% of CIN 3 lesions.

INTRODUCTION

The 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines describe 6 clinical actions that providers can use when managing patients with abnormal cervical cancer screening test results: treatment; optional treatment or colposcopy/biopsy; colposcopy/biopsy; 1-year surveillance; 3-year surveillance; and return to 5-year regular screening. These clinical actions are recommended based on a patient's risk of either currently having or subsequently developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3), adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS), or cancer (defined subsequently as CIN 3+). Exploration of numerous potential risk factors led to the determination that a patient's CIN 3+ risk can be estimated based on current human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology test results and recent history of test results, colposcopic evaluation and biopsy results, and treatments.

The 2019 guidelines comprehensively use and expand upon the principle of "equal management for equal risks" that was introduced in the 2012 guidelines. Specifically, management is based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+, regardless of what combination of test results yields that risk level. The guidelines make recommendations based on immediate CIN 3+ risk, which is the probability of patient currently having CIN 3+, and 5-year CIN 3+ risk, which gives the probability of developing CIN 3+ over the ensuing 5 years. We conducted an extensive data analysis effort to produce risk estimates for all combinations of tests and recent screening history, considering 5 clinical scenarios: (a) current abnormal screening results, (b) surveillance of past screening results not requiring immediate colposcopic referral, (c) management based on colposcopy/biopsy results, (d) postcolposcopy surveillance after less than CIN 2 histology, and (e) posttreatment follow-up. This article navigates the most relevant risk-based management tables that inform the new guidelines for clinicians. The comprehensive risk database is stored at the National Institutes of Health, publicly accessible through this link: A user-friendly, electronic presentation of these risk estimates and their related recommendations is available via a smartphone app, and a web version (available via).

K. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Introduction: Guidelines described previously apply to the average risk individual with an intact cervix and are based primarily on screening and management data from patients aged 25 to 65 years in the KPNC population. However, several populations require special management considerations. Management of patients who are younger than 25 years, pregnant, immunosuppressed, posthysterectomy, and older than 65 years are detailed hereinafter.

K.1 Management of Patients Younger Than 25 Years

In the 2012 guidelines, patients aged 21 to 24 years were considered to be a special population. In the current guidelines, the consensus was to reference this group as "patients younger than 25 years".

Initial Management After an Abnormal Screening Test Result

Guideline: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results of LSIL, ASC-US HPV-positive, or ASC-US without HPV testing, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (HSIL, ASC-H, AGC, AIS) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex HPV testing for ASC-US is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e. histologic LSIL [CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g. repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher). Clinicians should switch to using risk estimates when patients reach the age of 25 years (see Figures 12, 13).

American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) 2019 management of common cervical screening abnormalities — Key actions include: For HPV-negative atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 3 yrs; for HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 1 yr. For HPV-positive cytology negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), colposcopy is recommended. If genotyping is positive for HPV 16, HPV 18, or both with ASC-US or LSIL, colposcopy is recommended. For HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL with negative screening results within the previous 5 yrs, repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 1 yr. For high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology that is HPV 16 positive, expedited treatment is recommended; if HPV is untyped, positive for a genotype other than HPV 16, or negative with HSIL, colposcopy or expedited treatment is acceptable. Footnotes specify that negative HPV test or cotest results only defer colposcopy if from screening within the last 5 years and that expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years.

### Incorporating stakeholder feedback in guidelines development for the management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests [^f5745c43]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Management of abnormal results during pregnancy — stakeholder views ranged from doing less to doing more. Some urged minimization of procedures: "Do not continue to do colposcopy on a pregnant woman… Never repeat biopsy during pregnancy — there is NO rush". Others favored additional evaluation if stable or worsening lesions, including repeat biopsy "(every 12–20 wks)", noting it could increase detection of "CIN 3 or cancer" without added morbidity and improve diagnostic sensitivity.

### Updated guidelines for management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities [^a4c7c3ff]. ACOG (2020). High credibility.

Cervical screening surveillance using cytology alone — indications and intervals: Surveillance with cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible, and because cytology is less sensitive than HPV testing for detection of precancer it is recommended more often; specifically, cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually, and cytology is recommended annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^79b03ea0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) — initial follow-up, HPV triage, and post-colposcopy care are specified with graded recommendations. Cytological testing should be performed at 6-month intervals until 2 consecutive "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy" results are obtained (AII), and colposcopy is recommended for women with ASC-US or greater cytological abnormality on a repeat test (AII); after 2 repeat negatives, women can return to routine cytological screening (AII). HPV DNA testing is presented as "Preferred if liquid-based cytology or co-collection available", with "HPV Positive* (managed in same manner as women with LSIL)". When colposcopy is used, "Endocervical sampling [is] preferred in women with no lesions, and those with unsatisfactory colposcopy", and if CIN is not identified, repeat cytology at 12 months is recommended (BIII); the algorithm lists "Cytology @ 6 to 12 mos OR HPV DNA Testing @ 12 mos", proceeding to "Repeat Colposcopy" for " ≥ ASC or HPV (+)" and to "Routine Screening" if "Negative", while cases with "CIN" are to "Manage per ASCCP Guideline". Because of overtreatment concerns, "the routine use of diagnostic excisional procedures such as the loop electrosurgical excision is unacceptable for women with an initial ASC-US in the absence of histologically diagnosed CIN 2,3. (EII)".
