## Question

How often should a patient with hypertension have their urinary protein measured?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often urinary protein should be measured in patients with hypertension, and how to operationalize that with the right test and follow-up cadence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial evaluation and baseline testing. Then, I should verify the recommended frequency for routine follow-up. Next, I will consider intensified monitoring for higher-risk phenotypes. After that, I need to check how to confirm abnormal results and what thresholds matter. Finally, I will integrate special populations and summarize a practical algorithm with caveats about underuse and quality improvement opportunities.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment. At the time hypertension is diagnosed, guidelines consistently recommend documenting kidney status with serum creatinine/eGFR and a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) from a spot sample, preferably first-morning, because ACR is more sensitive than dipstick for low-level albuminuria and informs both CKD staging and cardiovascular risk stratification [^1114ry3p] [^111gKpcm] [^113rtd45].

> Wait, let me verify the routine follow-up frequency. For patients with hypertension who do not have established CKD, repeating ACR at least annually is standard, aligning with ESC/ESH and ERA synopses that recommend documenting ACR at diagnosis and then rechecking at least yearly, with KDIGO similarly advising more frequent assessments when results will change management [^111gKpcm] [^111rAoay].

> Hold on, I should verify when to intensify monitoring. If CKD is diagnosed (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or ACR ≥ 30 mg/g), guidelines advise repeating serum creatinine/eGFR and ACR at least annually, and more frequently when CKD progression risk is higher or when results will influence therapy, which in practice often means every 3–6 months in those with faster-changing kidney function or higher albuminuria [^1114ry3p] [^111rAoay].

> I need to ensure I address confirmation of abnormal results. Because of biological variability, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with at least two additional measurements over about 3–6 months before labeling CKD or changing therapy; transient elevations can occur with exercise, infection, marked hypertension, heart failure, or acute illness, so repeating testing under stable conditions is prudent [^115xkS7v].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, proteinuria assessment is central to preeclampsia evaluation. If suspected, obtain quantitative testing with spot protein-to-creatinine ratio or ACR rather than relying on dipstick, and repeat as clinically indicated rather than on a fixed annual schedule, recognizing that management is driven more by blood pressure severity and end-organ features than by protein quantity alone [^112AeHE2] [^116a6eU2]. In children and adolescents with CKD and hypertension, proteinuria assessment is recommended, but routine annual ACR screening is not broadly endorsed outside of CKD or diabetes contexts, so frequency should be individualized to risk and disease stage [^116BJxMn].

> But wait, what about the test itself and underuse in practice. I should double-check that ACR is preferred over dipstick for detection of low-level albuminuria, and that real-world data show ACR is undermeasured; indeed, large cohorts show most patients starting antihypertensives do not have ACR checked, and cost-effectiveness modeling supports albuminuria screening in hypertension, reinforcing the need to build ACR into routine panels and consider home or digital strategies to close gaps [^113rtd45] [^1114S9wk] [^1155fpR9] [^116Tthfy].

> Let me synthesize a practical cadence. Baseline ACR at hypertension diagnosis for all, then annually if no CKD. If CKD is present or if ACR is elevated, repeat ACR at least annually and consider every 3–6 months when risk of progression is higher or when results will alter therapy. If an ACR is abnormal, confirm with two additional measurements over 3–6 months before making definitive decisions, and escalate follow-up frequency as albuminuria or eGFR worsens [^1114ry3p] [^111gKpcm] [^111rAoay] [^115xkS7v].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "every 6 months for everyone", but that overgeneralizes. I should correct that to "annually for routine follow-up in non-CKD hypertension", with more frequent checks individualized to CKD status, changing albuminuria, and clinical context, which aligns with contemporary European and KDIGO guidance [^111gKpcm] [^111rAoay].

---

Patients with hypertension should have urinary protein measured at **baseline** [^1114ry3p] with a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) from a spot urine sample [^111gKpcm], preferably first morning [^1124NKxH]. If the ACR is normal (< 30 mg/g), **repeat annually** [^1114ry3p]; if elevated (≥ 30 mg/g), confirm with two additional tests over 3–6 months [^115xkS7v] and then monitor every 6–12 months based on CKD stage and cardiovascular risk [^notfound]. Use ACR rather than dipstick [^113rtd45] because it is more sensitive and specific for detecting low-level albuminuria [^116oRh7U]; if ACR is unavailable, use a protein-to-creatinine ratio [^116WnUKT]. Routine urinalysis is not sufficient for detecting microalbuminuria [^113YWT6t].

---

## Recommended frequency of urinary protein measurement

### Initial assessment

At diagnosis, obtain a **baseline ACR** [^1114ry3p] in all patients with hypertension [^111gKpcm] to detect early kidney damage and guide risk stratification [^113RFeJ4].

---

### Routine monitoring

If the ACR is normal (< 30 mg/g), **annual monitoring** [^1114ry3p] is recommended [^111gKpcm]. If the ACR is elevated (≥ 30 mg/g), **confirm with two additional tests** over 3–6 months [^115xkS7v] to account for variability, then monitor every 6–12 months based on CKD stage and cardiovascular risk [^111rAoay].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ESC/ESH 2024 | - ACR at baseline [^1114ry3p] for all hypertension patients <br/> - Annual monitoring if CKD is present [^1114ry3p] |
| KDIGO 2024 | - ACR for CKD detection and monitoring [^notfound] <br/> - More frequent assessments in high-risk patients [^111rAoay] |
| ACC/AHA 2017 (KDOQI commentary) | - ACR preferred over dipstick [^113rtd45] for albuminuria screening [^116sH59e] <br/> - Annual monitoring if albuminuria is present |

---

## Clinical significance of urinary protein measurement

Urinary protein measurement is **critical** because albuminuria is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and CKD progression [^116Gs5oW]. Detecting and monitoring albuminuria enables early intervention to slow kidney disease progression and reduce cardiovascular risk [^111HZuoN].

---

## Factors influencing frequency of urinary protein measurement

Several factors **influence monitoring frequency**:

- **CKD stage**: More frequent monitoring in advanced CKD or rapidly changing kidney function [^111rAoay].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Higher risk patients may require closer monitoring [^114ETVC7].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other systemic conditions may necessitate more frequent assessment [^114ETVC7].
- **Medication changes**: Adjustments in antihypertensive or nephroprotective therapy may warrant closer monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Recommended methods for urinary protein measurement

ACR is the **preferred method** [^115Bhbq2] for detecting and monitoring albuminuria because of its sensitivity and specificity [^116oRh7U]. Protein-to-creatinine ratio is an **alternative** [^111hQ8aS] when ACR is unavailable. Dipstick testing is **not recommended** for routine screening due to low sensitivity and specificity [^116oRh7U].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated urinary protein levels

Elevated urinary protein levels indicate **increased risk** of cardiovascular events, CKD progression, and end-stage renal disease [^1114S9wk]. They also guide therapy — including ACE inhibitors or ARBs — and inform blood pressure targets and cardiovascular risk management [^114JoSkz].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Baseline assessment**: ACR at hypertension diagnosis [^1114ry3p] for all patients [^111gKpcm].
- **Annual monitoring**: If ACR is normal (< 30 mg/g) [^111gKpcm].
- **Elevated ACR**: Confirm with two additional tests over 3–6 months [^115xkS7v], then monitor every 6–12 months based on CKD stage and risk [^notfound].
- **Preferred method**: ACR from a spot urine sample, preferably first morning [^1124NKxH].

---

Urinary protein should be measured at **baseline** in all patients with hypertension [^1114ry3p], with annual monitoring if normal and more frequent monitoring if elevated, using ACR as the preferred method [^111gKpcm].

### Screening for chronic kidney disease: where does Europe go? [^116uNacG]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

This review discusses various screening approaches for chronic kidney disease that are used in Europe. The criterion for defining chronic kidney disease in the various programs differs but is frequently limited to estimated glomerular filtration rate, thus offering only data on chronic kidney disease stages 3 and higher; however, screening should not be limited to measuring only estimated glomerular filtration rate but should also include a measure of microalbuminuria, because this will offer identification of chronic kidney disease stages 1 and 2. Defining these earlier stages is of importance because the risk for developing end-stage renal disease that is associated with stages 1 and 2 is nearly equal to the risk that is associated with stage 3. Moreover, the risk for cardiovascular events in stages 1 and 2 is equal to that in stage 3. Various reports argue that costs of screening programs in general practitioner or outpatient offices are high and that they are cost-effective only for preventing end-stage renal disease when they are limited to target groups, such as patients with diabetes or hypertension and elderly. The benefits of screening programs, however, should not be evaluated only with respect to the prevention of renal events but should also include the benefits of preventing cardiovascular events. The use of preselection based on either an impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate or on protein-dipstick positivity or elevated albuminuria in a morning urine void has been found effective in various European countries as an alternative for targeted screening.

Taking these largely indirect findings together and considering that, at least after development of proteinuria, progression of kidney injury tends to follow the same course in different situations, the 2023 ESH Guidelines suggest that: (i) the BP target for proteinuric nondiabetic CKD applies to patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease as well and (ii) for both patient categories, a target SBP of < 130 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg, if well tolerated, can be associated with protection against CKD progression in individuals with an albuminuria > 30 mg/g. A similar target may be associated with a reduction in mortality in most patients with CKD. Particularly in patients with advanced CKD (G4 and G5), careful monitoring of eGFR is recommended as a further functional, but reversible, decline of GFR may occur on a lower BP. Finally, most of the patients with CKD have CV comorbidities that require respective target BP values to be taken into account, and thus these CV comorbidities and not CKD protection may primarily guide the target BP in an individual patient.

However, the 2023 ESH Guidelines acknowledge that these recommendations have a number of limitations: (i) none of the trials comparing different BP targets included patients with diabetes and CKD, thus current evidence cannot be readily extrapolated to this subpopulation; (ii) MDRD and AASK trials randomized participants to different mean BP levels, which cannot be readily extrapolated to SBP and DBP values; (iii) MDRD and AASK trials recruited patient populations of a relatively young age (mean age 51.7 and 54.6 years, respectively), and thus, their findings cannot be readily extrapolated to older patients with CKD; and (iv) even for the long-term observational analyses, the benefits associated with lower BP targets were mainly apparent in individuals with proteinuria.

Overall, as shown in Fig. 2, the guidelines recommend that in all patients with CKD the primary goal is to lower office SBP to < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg (CoR I, LoE A) and that in most CKD patients (young patients, patients with a urine ACR ≥ 300 mg/g, high CV risk patients) office BP may be lowered to < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated (CoR II, LoE B). Actively targeting an office SBP target of < 120 mmHg and DBP < 70 mmHg cannot be recommended because of the absence of relevant evidence and the potential to induce harm (CoR III, LoE C).

Question 2.1: does the determination of proteinuria have the same prognostic value for kidney function and the development of cardiovascular complications as albuminuria?

Albuminuria is an independent risk factor for both all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and its detection should rely on quantitative measures such as the albumin-to-creatinine (ACR) ratio. As a crucial marker for progression to ESKD, identifying albuminuria as the earliest indicator of renal damage progression could be helpful in establishing therapeutic approaches which minimize the burden of adverse outcomes in patients living with systemic arterial hypertension. In the context of Mexico and Latin America, the following clinical strategies aim to estimate impaired kidney function based on albuminuria and eGFR:
Determination of albuminuria and eGFR in all patients living with systemic arterial hypertension: All patients with risk factors for developing CKD (> 60 years, diabetes, hypertension, overweight or obesity, previous CVD, use of nephrotoxic drugs, hereditary/familial history KD or hypertensive disease in pregnancy) should have frequent albuminuria and eGFR determinations. Physicians should schedule follow-up visits and new evaluations, using albuminuria as the primary marker for predicting CKD progression, and refer patients to a nephrology specialist when necessary. In Fig. 2, we append the risk stratification of KD based on albuminuria and eGFR according to the KDIGO guidelines.
Albuminuria and proteinuria are metrics of renal structural damage: Albuminuria and endogenous proteinuria should not be used as equivalents to decreased kidney function, as they are not markers of kidney function but only indicators of structural damage within the kidney.
Estimate the risk of CKD progression and CVD using the KDIGO calculator: Although albuminuria is a strong predictor of CKD progression and CVD, some traditional risk estimations, such as the Framingham Risk Prediction Score, are not accurate in patients with CKD. To address this issue, KDIGO clinical guidelines have developed a CVD risk stratification score based on eGFR and albuminuria, which improves risk prediction, particularly given that the magnitude of albuminuria in CKD predicts a higher risk of CVD. Additionally, this calculator estimates the probability of initiating renal replacement therapy (RRT) for patients with CKD in clinical practice. This KDIGO calculator has been developed for risk prediction of RRT, risk of death, and CVD in patients with CKD, using eGFR and albuminuria as two of the evaluated criteria.
Use treatments based on ACE inhibitors or ARBs: ACE inhibitors and ARBs can reduce initial albuminuria by 30–52%, preserving kidney function and decreasing the incidence of CVD events, which are the leading cause of death in patients living with CKD. However, controversy persists over whether reducing albuminuria or blood pressure as a single strategy can effectively reduce the risk of progression to CKD in patients living with systemic arterial hypertension.

### Is it time to measure microalbuminuria in hypertension? [^1163mFSV]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Former guidelines on hypertension never made a commitment to the detection of microalbuminuria for screening or follow-up of hypertensive patients. On the other hand, growing evidence support the contributory role of microalbuminuria in the prediction of absolute cardiovascular risk in hypertension and document the potential relevance of this parameter to the initial choice of antihypertensive treatment. Upcoming new guidelines and diagnostic algorithms in hypertension need to underscore the clinical positioning of microalbuminuria for stratification of risk and follow-up purposes.

### Practical approach to detection and management of chronic kidney disease for the primary care clinician [^116TpWH4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A panel of internists and nephrologists developed this practical approach for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide assessment and care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care clinicians. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or markers of kidney damage for at least 3 months. In clinical practice the most common tests for CKD include GFR estimated from the serum creatinine concentration (eGFR) and albuminuria from the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Assessment of eGFR and albuminuria should be performed for persons with diabetes and/or hypertension but is not recommended for the general population. Management of CKD includes reducing the patient's risk of CKD progression and risk of associated complications, such as acute kidney injury and cardiovascular disease, anemia, and metabolic acidosis, as well as mineral and bone disorder. Prevention of CKD progression requires blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with albuminuria and hypertension, hemoglobin A1c ≤ 7% for patients with diabetes, and correction of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis. To reduce patient safety hazards from medications, the level of eGFR should be considered when prescribing, and nephrotoxins should be avoided, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The main reasons to refer to nephrology specialists are eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), severe albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The ultimate goal of CKD management is to prevent disease progression, minimize complications, and promote quality of life.

### Urine protein as a rapid screen for renal function in the ED: can it replace serum creatinine in selected patients? [^115NAp8q]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Many radiology departments are unwilling to perform studies that require contrast administration to adult emergency department patients over the age of 35 without having a documented serum creatinine concentration of less than 2.0 mg/dl within a week of the study. Significant diagnostic delays may ensue waiting for this serum test. The present study was performed to determine whether a negative urine protein test, obtained by dip testing, will serve as a marker for a serum creatinine concentration below 2.0 mg/dl in emergency department patients who give no history of a disease which potentially could cause renal insufficiency. Emergency patients aged 35 years or more presenting to a university hospital who did not volunteer a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, or systemic lupus erythematosus in triage were enrolled. Only patients with a negative urine protein test whose serum creatinine was tested for other reasons were included. Of the 310 patients who had no protein in their urine and no history of disease which potentially could cause renal insufficiency, none had a serum creatinine concentration greater than 2.0 mg/dl (mean = 0.82 mg/dl, SD 0.28). Ages ranged from 35 to 96 years (mean = 59.7 years, SD = 17.5). All patients would have qualified for a contrast load for contrast computed tomography studies or for intravenous pyelogram. In patients who do not have a known history of hypertension, multiple myeloma, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, or specific renal disease, urine dip testing for protein in the emergency department may be a rapid and safe screen for imaging studies requiring contrast without having to await serum creatinine testing.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to screening for proteinuria, SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain more definitive testing for proteinuria (by urinary protein:creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine collection) when there is a suspicion of preeclampsia, including: ≥ 1+ dipstick proteinuria in patients with hypertension and rising BP and in patients with normal BP but symptoms or signs suggestive of preeclampsia.

Cardiovascular risk assessment in population surveys

When performing population surveys in LMICs, a door-to-door approach has different advantages: data collected with a door-to-door approach allow avoiding the selection bias affecting hospital data in LMICs where universal health coverage is uncommon; the use of point-of-care instruments for biochemical assays of blood glucose and lipids, the procedure suggested by WHO, limits preanalytical errors (storage, transportation, standardization of procedure). WHO recommends the use of affordable and reliable electronic devices for BP measurement that have the option to select manual readings. Cost of personnel is a main component of budget in population surveys. Personnel costs and the logistic difficulties connected with organizing a two-visit strategy, therefore, lead to the adoption of a single-visit strategy in the WHO STEPwise Approach to Stroke Surveillance(STEPS) aimed at assessing cardiovascular risk in populations. Although the program allows structured between countries comparison and within country follow-up of implementation of prevention strategies, its results cannot be directly transferred to cost estimation for the plan of prevention strategies. High BP is the main factor guiding cardiovascular risk stratification and the diagnosis of hypertension requires recording BP values for several days in repeated visits. When the estimation of hypertension prevalence based on two visits was compared with the estimation based on a single visit, the strategy adopted in the STEP program, hypertension prevalence reduced by 12% in a cohort of individuals aged 62 ± 11 years, by 35% in a cohort of individuals aged 39 ± 9 years, and by 35% in a national wide survey for the age range between 15 and 69 years (Fig. 1). Differently from what was expected, misclassification is more common at young ages, two-thirds of men less than 30 years of age having normal BP values at the second visit. Thus, screening an individual at high cardiovascular risk at the first visit is crucial, but the panel of tests that can be included in surveys is to be seen in the perspective of costs. It is indeed unreliable to perform an echocardiogram in all participants in a national survey. However, the inclusion of a urine dipstick test for proteinuria in the test panel might be a sustainable approach. Proteinuria allows classifying a patient in the high or very high class of 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality as defined by international guidelines for the management of hypertension. When urine dipstick for proteinuria was added to the parameters included in a national survey based on two-visit assessments, the prevalence of individuals classified as at high or very high cardiovascular risk at the first visit remained stable at the second visit. More precisely, only 1.9% of individuals classified as at high or very high cardiovascular risk at the first visit moved to average, low or moderate cardiovascular risk categories at the second visit. With this approach, a stable estimation of individuals at high cardiovascular risk could be obtained already at the first visit.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117GDU5C]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Current evidence in the field comes mainly from two previous trials in non-diabetic CKD that randomized patients to different levels or ranges of mean BP and examined kidney outcomes. In the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study the projected GFR decline within 3 years, and the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and death were not significantly different between groups of low and usual BP target. However, analyses by baseline proteinuria showed that those with proteinuria > 1 g/day in the low-target group had a decrease in protein excretion and a slower GFR decline over time compared with patients in the usual-target group. Similarly, in the African American Study on Kidney Disease (AASK) no difference in outcomes between BP target groups was observed in the overall population; in a post hoc analysis, again, low BP was associated with better kidney outcomes in the small subset of patients with proteinuria > 1 g/day. Subsequent analyses of MDRD and AASK combined the randomized trial periods with subsequent observational follow-up phases. In MDRD long-term analysis, low-target BP was associated with overall reduced risk for ESKD and the composite of ESKD or death, but this was again mainly driven by a beneficial effect in patients with baseline proteinuria > 1 g/day. In the AASK long-term follow-up analysis, no difference in the risk of the composite outcome of doubling of SCr, ESKD or death was noted. However, for patients with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) > 0.22 g/g, which roughly equals proteinuria of 0.25–0.3 g/day and urine ACR > 100 mg/g in most patients, there was a beneficial effect with low BP. A subsequent analysis combining the trial and cohort periods of both these trials (adding up to 1907 patients and a median follow-up of 14.9 years), showed that low target BP was associated with significant reductions in the risks of ESKD and mortality in the total population; and this effect was mainly driven by changes in patients with urine PCR > 0.44 g/g (urine ACR roughly > 200 mg/g). Thus, sustainability of BP reduction and extent of proteinuria are major determinants of nephroprotection in patients with non-diabetic CKD.

### Improving proteinuria screening with mailed smartphone urinalysis testing in previously unscreened patients with hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^115cU2uz]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Another issue in our trial was that very few patients with trace or 1+ protein underwent confirmation testing by quantitative ACR or protein/creatinine ratio, over a relatively short follow-up period. Having learned how to use their smartphones to analyze the urine dipstick at home, it would have been intuitive to send an additional home testing kit to confirm whether ACR was elevated or not. Unfortunately, the Healthy.io semi-quantitative ACR home test was not available at the time of the trial, which could be an effective adjunct to confirm albuminuria at home. It seems likely that traveling to the laboratory for confirmation testing posed an additional barrier. Future studies should explore strategies where screening and confirmation of albuminuria is done solely using home testing kits.

Other studies have described similarly suboptimal rates of screening among patients at risk of CKD and even patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2. For example, in a study of stage 3–4 CKD patients receiving care from 2004 to 2008 in a group practice in eastern Massachusetts, only 30% had annual urine protein monitoring completed. Even in an optimal setting where clinical decision support in the form of a CKD checklist embedded in the EHR was implemented in a prospective study, annual ACR measurement still was only able to be improved to 73%. Thus, use of home testing may have a role in further improving adherence to albuminuria/proteinuria screening.

There were several limitations in this proof-of-concept study. Due to the requirement of having a smartphone to test the urinalyses, we limited our mostly white, patient population to active patient portal users, and results may not be generalizable to non-portal users. While smartphone ownership has risen from 35% in 2011 to 77% in 2018, other screening strategies may also be needed to reach those without access to smartphones. It is possible that some dipstick protein results could be false negatives or false positives, and we lacked repeat testing on most abnormal dipstick protein results. Whether or not early detection of albuminuria can improve outcomes will require future large-scale studies with longer follow-up and consideration of strategies to increase patient engagement and provider adherence to clinical guidelines for albuminuria.

### Optimization of screening strategy for chronic kidney disease by urine test strips using the albumin-creatinine read-out [^112kS5RG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical laboratories play a crucial role in the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The age-standardized global prevalence of CKD stages 1–5 in adults aged ≥ 20 years is 10.4% in men and 11.8% in women. Early diagnosis and management may improve long-term outcomes.

Albuminuria, characterized by the presence of excessive albumin in urine, serves as a crucial indicator of kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. Early detection of albuminuria is imperative for timely diagnosis, intervention, and management of patients predisposed to kidney damage. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are two laboratory-based criteria for the diagnosis of CKD. In CKD populations, urinary albumin may be the first and only sign of kidney disease, making it a highly sensitive marker for the detection of CKD, particularly in its early stages.

The measurement of albuminuria is important in screening for early CKD. Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown a graded relationship between increased albuminuria and mortality and kidney outcomes in diverse study populations, in addition to and independent of low eGFR and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The KDIGO guidelines, as well as the EFLM European urinalysis guideline 2023, primarily recommend screening using quantitative albumin tests. However, the cost of laboratory-based quantitative methods and reimbursement restrictions (e.g. in Belgium) may hamper the routine use of quantitative urinary albumin by clinicians as a screening tool in the general population or even populations at risk, and thus, potentially leading to underdiagnosis of CKD. For example, in Spain, it was previously shown that urinary albumin is under requested to properly monitor patients with diabetes and arterial hypertension. Screening by test strip analysis is suggested in the guidelines, albeit with lower priority and without further details on the type of reading to be used for screening or with the suggestion to use the total protein read-out.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of test strip analysis as a cost-effective tool for screening albuminuria. Several studies have shown promising results in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of albuminuria. However, most of these studies were performed in cohorts in which known and unknown CKD patients were mixed or the CKD status was unknown. In the current study, we aimed to provide novel insights into the analytical performance of urine test strips as a screening tool for unknown CKD by comparing the performance of multiple test strip readouts in several patient cohorts, including a patient cohort not known to have CKD.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^116Y8ZW1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Since its discovery, albuminuria measurement has undergone remarkable advancements, evolving from a rudimentary diagnostic tool to a pivotal biomarker in nephrology and cardiovascular medicine. Today, albuminuria can be measured with reasonable accuracy, and upcoming standardisation in measurement techniques and pre‐analytical protocols will further improve its reliability and clinical applicability. Despite these advancements, albuminuria screening remains under‐utilised in clinical practice. While population‐based screening may not yet be justified, routine albuminuria assessment should at least be incorporated into laboratory panels to provide a comprehensive cardiovascular risk profile — a practice that is rarely implemented today. Even among high‐risk individuals, such as those with diabetes or hypertension, albuminuria is insufficiently measured, limiting its potential to guide treatment and improve patient outcomes. Greater integration of albuminuria testing into routine clinical practice is therefore pivotal. Beyond its established role in CKD management, albuminuria has also become a key parameter for risk stratification and therapy selection. Recommendations for use in clinical practice are summarised in Table 4. The data presented in this review clearly demonstrate that albuminuria has emerged as a key biomarker for the detection, prognostication, surveillance and treatment optimisation of both kidney and cardiovascular disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^113rtd45]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension evaluation — at initial diagnosis, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends basic laboratory testing (complete blood count; serum sodium, potassium, and calcium; fasting blood glucose; lipid profile; thyroid-stimulating hormone) and an electrocardiogram to profile CVD risk and establish baseline characteristics; it also recommends serum creatinine to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and assessment of albuminuria with urine dipstick, with optional echocardiogram, serum uric acid, and quantification of urine albumin–creatinine ratio (UACR). The KDOQI commentary states "we recommend screening with a UACR measurement instead of urine dipstick, a less sensitive test".

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for management of blood pressure in CKD [^114BHbPZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In response to the 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline for blood pressure management in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis, the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in hypertension and transplant nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The overriding message was the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations. For patients with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria, goal blood pressure has been relaxed to ≤ 140/90 mm Hg for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. In contrast, KDIGO continues to recommend goal blood pressure ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for patients with chronic kidney disease with moderately or severely increased albuminuria and for all renal transplant recipients regardless of the presence of proteinuria, without supporting data. The expert panel thought the KDIGO recommendations were generally reasonable but lacking in sufficient evidence support and that additional studies are greatly needed.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^117R5P3C]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m², persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

### Unexpected random urinary protein: creatinine ratio results-limitations of the pyrocatechol violet-dye method [^112wkyxd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Our 2008 review of the diagnostic accuracy of the random urinary PrCr concluded that it is a "reasonable" rule-out test for detecting proteinuria of ≥ 0.3 g/d in hypertensive pregnancy. Our findings in the current study should have no impact on this conclusion. Although that review could not examine the impact of urine protein assay method on the results because of incomplete reporting of methods, none of the included studies used the current Vitros method; five used the dye pyrogallol red.

It should be highlighted that this is not a problem restricted to random urinary samples; 10% of 24-hour urine collections may be dilute (i.e. have urinary creatinine < 3 mM) and proteinuria is assayed in 24-hour urine samples by taking a sample, measuring the urine protein concentration, and then multiplying it by the volume of urine submitted to get the value for protein excretion in g/d.

The impact on maternal management of a false positive proteinuria result may include patient anxiety and greater use of health care resources due to enhanced maternal and fetal surveillance (as a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is associated with both maternal and perinatal risk), hospital admission, and/or earlier delivery. Higher costs related to misclassification of renal function related to creatinine standardization have also been previously published.

The first strength of our study is that in our current study cohort, we maximised generalisability by assessing a broad spectrum of (primarily outpatient) high-risk patients with and without significant proteinuria as diagnosed by a random urinary PrCr of ≥ 30 mg/mmol. We also expanded our analyses to two other cohorts of primarily inpatient women with pre-eclampsia. Second, we performed an additional exploratory dilution study using the Vitros proteinuria method, and validated our result in two separate cohorts of women with proteinuria measurement by a different dye-based method (i.e. pyrogallol red).

Some would point out that the random urinary PrCr result was not compared to 24-hour urinary protein; however, it must be acknowledged that the 24-hour urine collection is frequently incomplete in pregnancy and as such, is no longer considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis of proteinuria in pregnancy.

### Strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat kidney disease related to systemic arterial hypertension: a narrative review from the Mexican group of experts on arterial hypertension [^116zRtzE]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Choosing the right eGFR equation is crucial for diagnosing and managing CKD. Standardizing creatinine measurements, facilitating digital access to eGFR calculators, conducting studies for local reference values, promoting alternative markers like cystatin C, and individualizing the use of eGFR formulas based on patient needs can improve CKD diagnosis and management in Mexico and Latin America.

Question 2.3: what is the recommended technique for detecting albuminuria in patients with systemic arterial hypertension?

Proteinuria, characterized by elevated levels of urinary proteins, is a marker for KD progression and is associated with CVD morbidity and mortality. In contrast, albuminuria enables earlier CKD diagnosis and assists in the extrarenal diagnosis of systemic complications. Current guidelines advise annual screening for CKD in at-risk populations by assessing eGFR and albuminuria using three determinations. The 2012 KDIGO guideline for managing CKD recommends stratification based on the urinary ACR, preferably from the first-morning urine sample, as it strongly correlates with values measured in 24-h urine samples. Furthermore, regular screening for urinary albumin is recommended for individuals living with systemic arterial hypertension based on the following factors:
When significant albuminuria is present when two out of three samples collected over at least three months show increased values.
When patients are diagnosed with CKD and albuminuria (ACR > 300 mg/g or > 30 mg/mmol), monitoring can be performed using the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (PR/CR).
The protein-to-creatinine in urine is recommended for patients with suspected renal interstitial pathology since proteinuria in these contexts stems from low molecular weight tubular proteins, distinct from albumin.

### Screening for proteinuria in US adults: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^1155fpR9]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem. Screening for early identification could improve health but could also lead to unnecessary harms and excess costs.

Objective

To assess the value of periodic, population-based dipstick screening for early detection of urine protein in adults with neither hypertension nor diabetes and in adults with hypertension.

Design, Setting, and Population

Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov decision analytic model to compare a strategy of annual screening with no screening (usual care) for proteinuria at age 50 years followed by treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor blocker (ARB).

Main Outcome Measure

Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

Results

For persons with neither hypertension nor diabetes, the cost-effectiveness ratio for screening vs no screening (usual care) was unfavorable (282 818 dollars per QALY; incremental cost of 616 dollars and a gain of 0.0022 QALYs per person). However, screening such persons beginning at age 60 years yielded a more favorable ratio (53 372 dollars per QALY). For persons with hypertension, the ratio was highly favorable (18 621 dollars per QALY; incremental cost of 476 dollars and a gain of 0.03 QALYs per person). Cost-effectiveness was mediated by both chronic kidney disease progression and death prevention benefits of ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy. Influential parameters that might make screening for the general population more cost-effective include a greater incidence of proteinuria, age at screening (53 372 dollars per QALY for persons beginning screening at age 60 years), or lower frequency of screening (every 10 years: 80 700 dollars per QALY at age 50 years; 6195 dollars per QALY at age 60 years; and 5486 dollars per QALY at age 70 years).

Conclusions

Early detection of urine protein to slow progression of chronic kidney disease and decrease mortality is not cost-effective unless selectively directed toward high-risk groups (older persons and persons with hypertension) or conducted at an infrequent interval of 10 years.

### Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in patients with hypertension and risk of major cardiovascular events [^117JcefK]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

The usage of albuminuria screening has been assessed in few prior studies conducted on data from healthcare databases. In cohorts of patients with hypertension and diabetes, the prevalence of uACR screening was estimated to be around 35% and to be even lower in patients with hypertension alone. The results presented in this study confirm this trend as diabetes was more frequent among patients with measured uACR than among patients without. Moreover, this study revealed that despite universal healthcare access, the screening rate in a nationwide cohort was not considerately higher as 80% of the included patients did not have their uACR evaluated.

Prior findings revealed that any degree of albuminuria was a risk factor for cardiovascular events in patients with and without diabetes and that the risk increased with uACR, starting below the microalbuminuria cut-off. This correlates with the findings presented in this study as patients with uACR between 10 and 30 mg/g were found to be at increased risk of cardiovascular events. This could reflect a dose–response-like relationship between uACR and the risk of cardiovascular events starting below the microalbuminuria cut-off. This study also found that the proportion of patients living alone and with the lowest annual income was higher among patients with macroalbuminuria compared with patients with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria, reflecting the socioeconomic differences between the patient groups.

The use of both eGFR and uACR in terms of cardiovascular and renal risk assessment has been highlighted in several studies identifying the markers as supplementary and improving risk classification. In a prior meta-analysis, eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and uACR above 10 mg/g were found to be independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Patients included in the present study were subcategorised according to eGFR level, and the associated risk of cardiorenal events increased among patients with high levels of albuminuria compared with patients with lower levels of albuminuria and corresponding eGFR level between 30 and 120 mL/min/1.73 m². Findings like these suggest that the risk of cardiovascular and renal events should be quantified with both uACR and eGFR as they were both found to be independent predictors.

Management of hypertension/albuminuria in sickle cell disease — For children and adults with SCD and albuminuria, the ASH guideline panel suggests the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi's) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The initiation of ACEi's and ARBs for patients with SCD requires adequate follow-up and monitoring of side effects. When prescribing ACEi's or ARBs, recommended renal safety steps are to start medication at a lower dose in individuals with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², assess GFR and measure serum potassium within 1 week of starting medication or following any dose escalation, and temporarily suspend medication during interval illness, planned IV radiocontrast administration, or bowel preparation for colonoscopy or prior to major surgery. The panel did not assess evidence to guide albuminuria screening; Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines state albuminuria should be confirmed by either a first morning urine sample or 2 consecutive untimed urine samples.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^116sH59e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Albuminuria screening and measurement in hypertension — screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD), including assessing albuminuria, appears cost-effective in adults with hypertension, whereas general-population CKD screening has not been shown to be cost-effective; because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are associated with treatment benefits in adults with increased albuminuria in the setting of DM or CVD, albuminuria screening may inform hypertension medication choices, and, consistent with KDIGO and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), assessment of urine albumin excretion should be performed using timed urine collections or via the UACR in a random urine specimen; urine albumin measurements currently are not standardized by clinical laboratories, the American College of Physicians (ACP) has recommended against serial monitoring due to low quality of evidence though temporal trends may help monitor response to treatment, and further research is needed to define prognostic utility and whether lowering urine albumin improves hypertension management and decreases CVD risk.

Kidney assessment in hypertension — hypertension is highlighted as "the second most important cause of CKD after diabetes". Antihypertensive therapy can transiently affect creatinine: "BP reduction by antihypertensive treatment often leads to an acute increase in serum creatinine by as much as 20–30%, especially with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers", and CKD classification uses eGFR: "CKD is classified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the 2009 CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration formula". Albuminuria assessment is specified: "The albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is measured from a spot urine sample (preferably early morning urine), and is the preferred method to quantify urinary albumin excretion". Monitoring is advised: "Serum creatinine, eGFR, and ACR should be documented in all hypertensive patients, and if CKD is diagnosed, repeated at least annually", and urinalysis caveat: "One negative urinary dipstick test does not rule out albuminuria, in contrast to a normal ACR".

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^114sE8Uj]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Other drugs, such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and β-blockers, should be used as additional therapy to further lower blood pressure in patients already treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs or as alternate therapy in the rare individual unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Studies in patients with varying stages of nephropathy have shown that protein restriction helps slow the progression of albuminuria, GFR decline, and occurrence of ESRD. Protein restriction should be considered particularly in patients whose nephropathy seems to be progressing despite optimal glucose and blood pressure control and use of ACE inhibitor and/or ARBs.

Assessment of albuminuria status and renal function

Screening for microalbuminuria can be performed by measurement of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in a random spot collection (preferred method); 24-h or timed collections are more burdensome and add little to prediction or accuracy. Measurement of a spot urine for albumin only, whether by immunoassay or by using a dipstick test specific for microalbumin, without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine, is somewhat less expensive but susceptible to false-negative and -positive determinations as a result of variation in urine concentration due to hydration and other factors.

Abnormalities of albumin excretion are defined in Table 12. Because of variability in urinary albumin excretion, two of three specimens collected within a 3- to 6-month period should be abnormal before considering a patient to have crossed one of these diagnostic thresholds. Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, CHF, marked hyperglycemia, and marked hypertension may elevate urinary albumin excretion over baseline values.

Information on presence of abnormal urine albumin excretion in addition to level of GFR may be used to stage CKD. The National Kidney Foundation classification (Table 13) is primarily based on GFR levels and therefore differs from other systems, in which staging is based primarily on urinary albumin excretion. Studies have found decreased GFR in the absence of increased urine albumin excretion in a substantial percentage of adults with diabetes. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of those with CKD in the setting of diabetes have little or no detectable albuminuria. Serum creatinine should therefore be measured at least annually in all adults with diabetes, regardless of the degree of urine albumin excretion.

Serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and to stage the level of CKD, if present. GFR can be estimated using formulae such as the Cockroft-Gault equation or a prediction formula using data from the Modification of Diet and Renal Disease study. GFR calculators are available at. Many clinical laboratories now report estimated GFR in addition to serum creatinine.

### Increased urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein level predicts major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension [^116gEZDa]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) has been known as a potential biomarker for acute kidney injury. It has also been suggested to have an effective predictive value for cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes or critically ill condition. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the ability of urinary L-FABP in predicting mid-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension.

Methods

Urinary L-FABP levels in stable outpatients without diabetes who were treated with antihypertensive drugs were measured, and a 5-year follow-up was planned. The primary end-point was a combination of acute heart failure requiring hospitalization, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The secondary end-point was kidney disease progression defined as a relative decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 30% from the baseline.

Results

A total of 197 patients were recruited. Primary and secondary end-points occurred in 24 (12.2%) and 42 (21.3%) patients, respectively, during a median follow-up of 5.7 years. Patients with urinary L-FABP levels higher than the upper limit (8.4 µg/g creatinine) were more likely to reach the primary (30.43% vs. 9.77%; P = 0.003) and secondary end-points (56.52% vs. 16.67%; P < 0.001) than those with urinary L-FABP levels within the normal limits. Urinary L-FABP level was independently associated with both primary (hazard ratio (HR) 1.21; P = 0.03) and secondary end-points (HR 1.19; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that increased urinary L-FABP levels may predict adverse cardiovascular events and renal dysfunction progression even among stable nondiabetic patients with hypertension.

### Association of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and failure to monitor renal function with adverse outcomes in people with diabetes: a primary care cohort study [^114VWYrf]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

We report three principal findings: Both reduced eGFR, and proteinuria are independent predictors of adverse outcomes. Nearly everyone with diabetes and CKD has hypertension, using the diagnostic threshold recommended by national guidelines. People with unmonitored renal function do worse that those who are monitored and appear to receive suboptimal medical therapies.

The combination of proteinuria and reduced eGFR is associated with the highest risk of adverse outcomes in people with and without hypertension. In people with hypertension and normal eGFR, proteinuria, also significantly increases the odds of adverse outcomes.

Almost all patients with CKD had hypertension whether their CKD was diagnosed by the presence of proteinuria or reduced eGFR. There were, however, a considerable number of people with hypertension and no evidence of renal impairment. However, CKD testing in people with diabetes and hypertension is currently suboptimal: just over 10% of people had not had appropriate monitoring for CKD by measurement of eGFR and assessment for proteinuria.

People with unmonitored renal function have a higher risk of adverse outcomes than those with normal renal function. This group has the lowest prescription rates of antihypertensive medication, lipid lowering drugs, and aspirin, suggesting people in this group receive suboptimal therapy. They also had higher rates of excess alcohol use and smoking. Whether these differences reflect variation in provision of healthcare or in attitudes to healthcare remains uncertain.

Implications of the findings

This study highlights the importance of frequent monitoring of eGFR and proteinuria in people with diabetes. In particular, careful monitoring of renal function and testing for proteinuria is essential for people with hypertension and diabetes due to the very high proportion of people with renal impairment in this group.

It is plausible that failure to monitor renal function is associated with wider neglect in clinical management although whether this is due to patient factors or healthcare factors is unclear. Computerised prompts and other recall systems should perhaps focus on those at highest risk i.e. not monitored and not prescribed antihypertensive medication.

### Screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: US preventive services task force final recommendation statement [^114w4L9Q]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertensive disorders of pregnancy — screening tests and thresholds: Blood pressure measurements are routinely used as a screening tool for hypertensive disorders throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, and accurate blood pressure measurement requires an appropriate technique, a device validated for use in pregnancy, and a cuff of an appropriate size for the patient. A positive screening result for new-onset hypertension during pregnancy is defined as an elevated blood pressure reading (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) in the absence of chronic hypertension or kidney disease measured at least 4 hours apart. Screening evaluations include testing for proteinuria when preeclampsia is suspected; however, the USPSTF found that point-of-care tests for protein in the urine had low accuracy, and evidence does not support routine point-of-care urine tests to screen for preeclampsia because proteinuria alone may not be a good predictor of preeclampsia health outcomes. Protein measurement is not used in the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia.

### Microalbuminuria: do we need a new threshold? [^115xrZhi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (30–300 mg of albumin/24 h) is a well-known independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular disease and of mortality in diabetic, hypertensive and in the general population. However, recent studies indicate that increased risk is observed at levels of albuminuria much lower than those currently employed to define microalbuminuria. Such low levels were shown to predict heart disease and death, independent of age, sex, renal function, diabetes, hypertension and lipids, in subjects with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and in the general population; as well as to predict progression to hypertension. Correction of obesity and metabolic derangements lowered levels of albuminuria below 30 mg/24 h to levels not associated with increased risk (5–7 mg/24 h). Despite the lack of outcome studies, there is substantial evidence to indicate that the threshold for defining microalbuminuria (that is, albuminuria associated with increased risk) should be lowered by nearly three to four-fold from the currently defined threshold. It would be advisable that clinical scores and future guidelines would consider including microalbuminuria at the lower rates as an independent risk factor, and as an indication for implementing early intervention. Unfortunately, and despite the abundance of evidence, albuminuria measurements are still underutilized in clinical practice.

### The authors reply [^1128V3xr]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

We read with interest the letter by Fukuda and Miura, in response to our article. As they commented, the degree of sodium intake is known to significantly affect the effectiveness of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, in the OSCAR study, we did not monitor urinary sodium levels and therefore, the role of salt sensitivity in the OSCAR study is unclear. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the elderly patients enrolled in the OSCAR study exhibited glomerular hypertension or not. Unfortunately, measurement of urinary protein or albumin was not performed in the OSCAR study. However, 680 patients of 1164 enrolled patients had urinary protein test by dipstick analysis at baseline. According to the request, we present the subgroup analysis data according to the presence or absence of proteinuria at baseline (Figure 1). In patients with urinary protein +1 or greater, more primary events (a composite of cardiovascular events and non-cardiovascular death) occurred in the high-dose ARB group than in the ARB + calcium channel blocker (CCB) group (15 vs 5 events, hazard ratio (HR), 3.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–9.8; P = 0.0254). On the other hand, in patients with urinary protein – or ±, the incidence of primary events was similar between the two treatments (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.61–2.09; P = 0.7034). Thus, our subanalysis suggests that ARB+CCB combination, compared to high-dose ARB, conferred greater benefit in prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with proteinuria, being consistent with the findingson patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m². The superiority of ARB+CCB combination might be at least in part attributed to the potential improvement of renal blood flow through arterial vasodilation, because the elderly patients are characterized by significant vascular stiffness. However, further clinical study is required to define our proposal, as the number of patients in the OSCAR study is limited.

Rationale for research recommendations

Research recommendation 1: In children and young people with ADPKD does regular (e.g. yearly or every 2 years) urine albumin: creatinine monitoring and treatment improve outcome?

Rationale

The guideline committee was not able to make a recommendation on monitoring of urine albumin: creatinine in CYP with ADPKD or at risk of ADPKD. No relevant studies assessing outcomes in CYP with proteinuria were identified and no consensus was achieved in 2 rounds of the Delphi survey; only 41% of panellists agreed with the statement 'Urine protein estimation (best assessed at urine albumin:creatinine) should be offered at least every 2 years to children and young people with confirmed ADPKD commencing at 5 years of age'. The prevalence of proteinuria in CYP with ADPKD has been reported to be as high as 20%, however, a number of studies have failed to show a relationship between hypertension and proteinuria in children with ADPKD. In adults with ADPKD, established proteinuria and microalbuminuria are reported to be associated with increased mean arterial pressure and more severe renal cystic involvement.

Research recommendation 2: In children and young people with ADPKD what is a) the incidence of sub-arachnoid haemorrhage and b) the prevalence of intracranial aneurysm?

Research recommendation 3: In adults, children and young people with ADPKD with a family history of intracranial aneurysm or sub-arachnoid haemorrhage does Intracranial Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging reduce the risk of intracranial events?

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion (UAE) in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes duration of ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients, starting at diagnosis. (E)
Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes regardless of the degree of UAE. The serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present. (E)

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, with hypertension and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (UAE rate, GFR) and is recommended (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of UAE to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117W8iAV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of our systematic review were that, on average across all studies, the optimum threshold (to maximise sensitivity and specificity) for protein to creatinine ratio to detect significant proteinuria is between 0.30 and 0.35, relating to sensitivity and specificity values above 75%. However, no threshold gave a summary estimate above 80% for both sensitivity and specificity, and considerable heterogeneity existed in diagnostic accuracy across studies at most thresholds. Thus, although the protein to creatinine ratio shows promising diagnostic value, how it should be implemented in clinical practice is unclear from the evidence. For albumin to creatinine ratio, meta-analysis was not possible; the results are based on single studies and show that albumin to creatinine ratio shows potential to be a good diagnostic test. No studies assessed protein to creatinine ratio to predict adverse pregnancy outcome, and only one study assessed this for albumin to creatinine ratio, so insufficient evidence exists for us to comment on the use of these tests in this context.

The finding of "significant proteinuria" is key to the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, stratification of perinatal risk, and hence the management of pregnant women with hypertension. Women with significant proteinuria are at increased risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Accurate diagnosis and thus diagnostic tests are important to limit inappropriate intervention in the form of further testing or treatment. In the United Kingdom, the standard testing is for women to have a 24 hour urine collection for total protein estimation as either an outpatient or an inpatient, which is inconvenient for the women, has cost implications, can imply a delay in diagnosis and implementation of treatment, and has weaknesses resulting from incomplete collection and varying use of assays leading to inconsistent test results. A need thus exists for a quick, reliable, acceptable, and cost effective alternative. This systematic review evaluated spot protein to creatinine ratio and albumin to creatinine ratio in the management of pregnant women with suspected pre-eclampsia.

### Comparison between urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein dipstick testing for prevalence and ability to predict the risk for chronic kidney disease in the general population (iwate-KENCO study): a prospective community-based cohort study [^112v6RKJ]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Under the Japanese health insurance system, routine measurement of urine albumin is permitted for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disorders such as diabetes mellitus but not for other disorders. Microalbuminuria has been reported to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease among non-diabetic and non-hypertensive patients. It is possible that for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, cardiovascular risk assessment including albumin measurement for identification of CKD and more strict management of underlying disorders may improve prognosis. Hence, it may be beneficial to measure UACR to detect CKD even in populations at moderate cardiovascular risk, specifically diabetic, hypertensive, and obese people. As urine albumin measurement is relatively expensive compared with the cost of dipstick testing, further studies are required to identify the cost effectiveness of CKD screening using UACR for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality.

The current study has several strengths. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study included the largest general population sample in whom UACR and urine dipstick testing has been performed. UACR was measured in fresh urine samples without long term freezing and repeated thawing. Cardiovascular events were captured prospectively according to previously determined standard epidemiological criteria and confirmed by research staff on medical chart reviews. Baseline data including clinical characteristics and biochemical data were determined well before the start of the follow-up study. However, despite the study's merits, some limitations must be considered when interpreting the results. First, measurement of urine albumin was based on a single measurement, which did not completely comply with the clinical requirement for multiple urine collections for establishing a diagnosis of CKD. Second, what effects prescribed drugs such as renin-angiotensin inhibitors have on cardiovascular events and urine albumin levels in the current population are not known. Third, the study employed only the CKD epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation for eGFR and did not use other formulae, since there is no consensus on the best equation for eGFR in Asian populations.

### Proteomics in hypertension [^1139AtrJ]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Proteomics, the study of the proteins making up the proteome, has emerged in recent years as an important tool in several different fields of medical research for early disease detection, for assessment of response to treatment and for unravelling underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Although the majority of patients with hypertension are treated in a similar manner, the causes underlying the condition are diverse, and often poorly understood. Genetic studies have implicated several different candidate genes, but it may be that examination of the 'downstream' products of genes, the proteins, will help to improve understanding of the link between the environmental and genetic effects that contribute towards development of hypertension. Proteomic studies can be performed quickly and reliably on several different sample types including plasma and urine, requiring minimal pre-test preparation. In this review, we will compare the different analytical platforms and technical issues involved in proteomic analysis. We will discuss existing studies of proteomics in hypertension, as well as related conditions such as renal disease, pre-eclampsia and coronary artery disease. We will also explore potential future applications of proteomics-based research, which may ultimately lead to improved population screening, monitoring of therapy and early detection of target organ damage.

### Proteinuria and clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients [^115TLGYV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

This narrative review focuses on outcomes related to proteinuria in hypertension (HT), and also examines the role of current and future therapeutic strategies. Proteinuria is an independent marker of renal and cardiovascular (CV) disease in hypertensive populations, particularly in high-risk groups such as diabetic patients. Effective blood pressure (BP) control and proteinuria management are associated with significant improvements in the risk of key adverse outcomes, although a causative relationship needs careful assessment. Available antihypertensives have varying effects on proteinuria reduction. Drugs affecting the renin system offer antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects that are probably at least partially independent of their BP effects. Economic evaluations of these interventions confirm their cost-saving benefits relative to other antihypertensives, but outcomes-based research is needed in some settings.

### Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in patients with hypertension and risk of major cardiovascular events [^1114S9wk]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Evaluation of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) is a key component in the management of hypertension, yet there is a lack of data on the association between uACR and major cardiovascular events (MACEs) in large hypertensive cohorts, and it is also unknown how often uACR is measured among these patients. We aimed to evaluate the usage of uACR in a nationwide population of patients with hypertension. Furthermore, we sought to assess the risk of cardiorenal events according to uACR, among patients with hypertension.

Methods

We used Danish nationwide registries to identify patients who initiated antihypertensive treatment. The patients were grouped at treatment initiation according to uACR: normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria and no uACR measurement, and followed for 2 years, to evaluate the risk of a MACE, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) according to uACR.

Results

We included 144644 patients, of whom 116039 (80%) did not have their uACR evaluated at treatment initiation. Patients with macroalbuminuria comprised the greatest 2year absolute risk of MACE (5.3%, 95% CI: 4.0% to 6.6%) and had a greater risk of MACE (HR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.66), HF (HR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.35 to 2.95), 40% decline in eGFR (HR: 4.81, 95% CI: 3.78 to 6.10) and ESKD (HR: 4.52, 95% CI: 3.00 to 6.82) compared with patients with normoalbuminuria. Increased risk of MACE, HF and 40% decline in eGFR among patients with macroalbuminuria was persistent across subgroups of eGFR 120–30mL/min/1.73 m².

Conclusions

In this real-world cohort, uACR was not regularly measured among patients initiating antihypertensive treatment. Nonetheless, the 2-year risks of cardiorenal events were considerably higher among patients with albuminuria compared with patients without.

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve the goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events as well as the high costs of treating these morbid events. There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset. A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function. Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal as well as to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

### Urine haptoglobin and haptoglobin-related protein predict response to spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension [^113jnqMY]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension prevalence is progressively increasing, and prolonged exposure to suboptimal blood pressure control results in higher cardiovascular risk and end-organ damage. Among various antihypertensive agents, spironolactone seems the most effective choice to treat resistant hypertension once triple therapy including a diuretic fails. However success in blood pressure control is not guaranteed, adverse effects are not negligible, and no clinical tools are available to predict patient's response. Complementary to our previous study of resistant hypertension metabolism, here we investigated urinary proteome changes with potential capacity to predict response to spironolactone. Twenty-nine resistant hypertensives were included. A prospective study was conducted and basal urine was collected before spironolactone administration. Patients were classified in responders or nonresponders in terms of blood pressure control. Protein quantitation was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; ELISA and target mass spectrometry analysis were performed for confirmation. Among 3310 identified proteins, HP (haptoglobin) and HPR (haptoglobin-related protein) showed the most significant variations, with increased levels in nonresponders compared with responders before drug administration (variation rate, 5.98 and 7.83, respectively). Protein-coordinated responses were also evaluated by functional enrichment analysis, finding oxidative stress, chronic inflammatory response, blood coagulation, complement activation, and regulation of focal adhesions as physiopathological mechanisms in resistant hypertension. In conclusion, protein changes able to predict patients' response to spironolactone in basal urine were here identified for the first time. These data, once further confirmed, will support clinical decisions on patients' management while contributing to optimize the rate of control of resistant hypertensives with spironolactone.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111hQ8aS]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

24-h urine collection is time-consuming and subject to inadequacies in collection. Outside of pregnancy, uPCR and uACR are highly correlated with 24-h urine collection and are more convenient in clinical practice. Pregnant cohorts show a similar correlation between 24-h urine protein excretion and both uPCR and uACR. A prospective multi-centre cohort study of 959 pregnant women after 20 weeks' gestation with hypertension and trace protein or more on urine dipstick found that both uPCR and uACR could be both used as rule out tests for preeclampsia with no additional benefit from 24-h urine collection.

There is on-going debate as to whether uPCR or uACR should be preferentially used for the quantification of proteinuria in pregnancy. In non-pregnant patients with CKD, uACR is the investigation of choice as it provides greater sensitivity at lower levels of proteinuria, although uPCR can be used as an alternative, particularly where uACR is 70 mg/mmol or greater. In contrast, uPCR is currently the most common test used to quantify proteinuria in pregnancy. A single centre experience of 181 pregnant women without CKD showed that uACR and uPCR were highly correlated to each other, with equivalent performance in the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes. More recent, larger, prospective cohort data from normal pregnancies show that although uACR and uPCR are comparable in performance, uACR had a significantly higher area under the receiver-operating curve (ROC) for the diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia compared to local laboratory uPCR (ROC 0.89 versus 0.87, p = 0.004). However it remains unclear whether this small absolute difference translates into significant clinical benefit. Cost effectiveness for uACR over uPCR was also suggested, although 95% confidence intervals for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio crossed zero due to significant uncertainty and the small difference in incremental cost and quality added life years. There are no published data on the predictive and/or diagnostic benefits of uACR compered to uPCR in pregnant women with CKD. It is therefore the consensus of the guideline group that the decision to use uACR or uPCR should be based on local obstetric experience ensuring a baseline measurement in early pregnancy in order to be able to recognise relative change in proteinuria in pregnancy. In women without pre-existing proteinuria, diagnostic performance equivalent to 30 mg/mmol of uPCR is achieved with a uACR cut-off of 8 mg/mmol.

### Urine albumin / creatinine ratio below 30 mg / g is a predictor of incident hypertension and cardiovascular mortality [^113sbsUw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Why is low‐grade albuminuria, UACR below 30 mg/g, associated with increased CVD mortality and incident hypertension? Increased albumin excretion is the net result of glomerular filtration and tubular resorption, and it is suggested that in normal physiological conditions there is little filtration. When irreversible increases in albumin excretion occur it is assumed that there is increased glomerular hydraulic pressure, increased glomerular filtration coefficient, and change in size and charge selectivity of the glomerular membrane. 7 The mechanisms linking increased albuminuria and cardiovascular mortality are uncertain, but it is likely that increased urinary albumin excretion reflects widespread vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, 5, 14 and it is plausible that this might predispose to increased accumulation of atherogenic lipoproteins within the subendothelial cell space. 15 Thus, increased albuminuria might reflect glomerular and/or systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction that precedes development of hypertension in humans. 16 In previous cross‐sectional studies, increased urinary albumin excretion was associated with increased blood pressure in subjects with hypertension 17, 18 and in the general population, 19 suggesting that the increased level of urinary albumin excretion in the present study could be in part due to an increase in blood pressure below levels to diagnose hypertension.

### Guidelines-similarities and dissimilarities: a systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines for pregnancy hypertension [^112641ko]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to review pregnancy hypertension clinical practice guidelines to inform international clinical practice and research priorities.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Relevant national and international clinical practice guidelines, 2009–19, published in English, French, Dutch or German.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Following published methods and prospective registration (CRD42019123787), a literature search was updated. CPGs were identified by 2 authors independently who scored quality and usefulness for practice (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument), abstracted data, and resolved any disagreement by consensus.

Results

Of note, 15 of 17 identified clinical practice guidelines (4 international) were deemed "clinically useful" and had recommendations abstracted. The highest Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II scores were from government organizations, and scores have improved over time. The following were consistently recommended: (1) automated blood pressure measurement with devices validated for pregnancy and preeclampsia, reflecting increasing recognition of the prevalence of white-coat hypertension and the potential usefulness of home blood pressure monitoring; (2) use of dipstick proteinuria testing for screening followed by quantitative testing by urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine collection; (3) key definitions and most aspects of classification, including a broad definition of preeclampsia (which includes proteinuria and maternal end-organ dysfunction, including headache and visual symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of platelets, creatinine, or liver enzymes) and a recognition that it can worsen after delivery; (4) preeclampsia prevention with aspirin; (5) treatment of severe hypertension, most commonly with intravenous labetalol, oral nifedipine, or intravenous hydralazine; (6) treatment for nonsevere hypertension when undertaken, with oral labetalol (in particular), methyldopa, or nifedipine, with recommendations against the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors; (7) magnesium sulfate for eclampsia treatment and prevention among women with "severe" preeclampsia; (8) antenatal corticosteroids for preterm birth but not hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; (9) delivery at term for preeclampsia; (10) a focus on usual labor and delivery care but avoidance of ergometrine; and (11) an appreciation that long-term health complications are increased in incidence, mandating lifestyle change and risk factor modification. Lack of uniformity was seen in the following areas: (1) the components of a broad preeclampsia definition (specifically respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, fetal manifestations, and biomarkers), what constitutes severe preeclampsia, and whether the definition has utility because at present what constitutes severe preeclampsia by some guidelines that mandate proteinuria now defines any preeclampsia for most other clinical practice guidelines; (2) how preeclampsia risk should be identified early in pregnancy, and aspirin administered for preeclampsia prevention, because multivariable models (with biomarkers and ultrasonography added to clinical risk markers) used in this way to guide aspirin therapy can substantially reduce the incidence of preterm preeclampsia; (3) the value of calcium added to aspirin for preeclampsia prevention, particularly for women with low intake and at increased risk of preeclampsia; (4) emerging recommendations to normalize blood pressure with antihypertensive agents even in the absence of comorbidities; (5) fetal neuroprotection as an indication for magnesium sulfate in the absence of "severe" preeclampsia; and (6) timing of birth for chronic and gestational hypertension and preterm preeclampsia.

Conclusion

Consistent recommendations should be implemented and audited. Inconsistencies should be the focus of research.

### Detection and measurement of urinary protein [^116qeBca]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The measurement of urine total protein and albumin is central to the diagnosis and management of subjects with kidney disease and in assessing cardiovascular risk. Accurate assessment is vital to enable detection and management of the patient with proteinuria.

Recent Findings

The spot urine protein has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to 24-h urine collections. Recent studies suggest that this holds true for screening to exclude significant proteinuria (> 1 g/day) but data are lacking for the quantification of proteinuria and in assessing response to therapy. For albuminuria, while 24-h urinary albumin excretion remains the gold standard, spot urine samples are appropriate for screening. The optimal technique for the laboratory determination of urinary albumin has been questioned with the high-performance liquid chromatography-based method demonstrating significantly more albumin in the urine. Population-based studies have found dramatic increases in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with the new high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Whether this extra immunounreactive albumin detected by high-performance liquid chromatography is clinically important remains to be established.

Summary

Twenty-four-hour urine collection remains the gold standard for the accurate determination of both total urinary protein and albumin. Spot urine samples can be used for screening patients for albuminuria and proteinuria. The optimal method for measuring urinary albumin concentration remains to be established.

### The level of serum albumin is associated with renal prognosis and renal function decline in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113dRmhL]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Covariates

This study's covariates were chosen based on our clinical expertise, original research, and previous investigations of CKD progression risk factors. Therefore, based on the concepts mentioned above, the following variables were used as covariates: (1) continuous variables: body mass index (BMI), age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), eGFR, urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR), and hemoglobin (Hb); (2) categorical variables: diabetes, gender, hypertension, history of CVD, urinary occult blood, anti-hypertensive therapy including angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), diuretics, calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI).

At enrolment, medical history, lifestyle behaviors (self-feeding ability), and current prescriptions were documented. Using anthropometric body height and weight measurements, the BMI was derived. The blood pressure was taken with a conventional sphygmomanometer. Urine and blood samples were collected to measure creatinine, hemoglobin, urinary protein, urinary occult blood, and urinary creatinine. Due to the Japanese health insurance system, urine albumin was not frequently measured. Therefore, UPCR was measured. Nephrotic syndrome proteinuria was defined as UPCR ≥ 3.5 g/gCr. Low BMI (< 23.5 kg/m2) was defined as a cut-off value.

Definition of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and etiology of kidney disease

SBP of at least 140 mmHg or DBP of at least 90 mmHg, or clinician-diagnosed hypertension, or currently taking anti-hypertensive medication, was considered hypertension. HbA1c 6.5% (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) standard) or antidiabetic therapy history was used to define diabetes mellitus. The physician treating each patient at enrollment identified each patient's etiology of CKD based on the patient's clinical characteristics, medical history, and histological results on renal biopsy specimens.

History of coronary heart disease (including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization), congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, or stroke (transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or cerebral hemorrhage) was considered as CVD.

### How to measure proteinuria? [^114Riz3B]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

### Primary care approach to proteinuria [^114Jxx65]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common finding in primary care practice. Most adolescents who are diagnosed with proteinuria through screening urinalysis do not have renal disease, and the proteinuria will usually resolve on repeat testing. In contrast, proteinuria is suggestive of kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, primary renal disease, or other systemic illnesses. Quantification of proteinuria can be used longitudinally to monitor therapeutic effects of treatment of the underlying disease. Given the multitude of clinical settings in which proteinuria can occur, we suggest an algorithm that may help clinicians differentiate between benign and serious etiologies of proteinuria.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114ZsWZj]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values > 30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is < 60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (> 300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, > 90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

### Improving proteinuria screening with mailed smartphone urinalysis testing in previously unscreened patients with hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^117URAAt]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Proteinuria screening is recommended for patients with hypertension to screen for kidney disease and identify those at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease. However, screening rates among hypertensive patients are low. Home testing strategies may be useful in improving proteinuria screening adherence.

Methods

We conducted an individual-level, randomized trial at 55 primary care clinic sites in the Geisinger Health System to evaluate the effectiveness of a strategy using home smartphone urinalysis test (Dip.io) to complete proteinuria screening in previously unscreened non-diabetic patient portal users with hypertension. All patients received an educational letter and a standing urinalysis lab order, and then were randomized to control (usual care) or intervention. Intervention arm participants were invited to complete proteinuria screening with a mailed home smartphone urinalysis test. Co-primary outcomes were completion of proteinuria screening and number of albuminuria cases (albumin/creatinine ratio [ACR] ≥ 30mg/g or protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 150mg/g) at the end of 3months. We also evaluated patient satisfaction with the home test, and compliance with recommendations for patients with newly detected albuminuria.

Results

A total of 999 patients were randomized to intervention or control. Out of 499 patients assigned to the intervention arm, 253 were reached by phone, and 69/97 (71.1%) consented patients completed the home test. Overall, the intervention increased proteinuria screening completion (28.9% vs. 18.0%; p < 0.001) with no effect on the number of albuminuria cases (4 vs. 4) although only 6/57 (10.5%) patients with trace or 1+ urine dipstick protein had a follow-up quantitative test. Among the 55 patients who completed a survey after the home test, 89% preferred testing at home rather than the physician's office.

Conclusions

A strategy using a home urinalysis smartphone test increased proteinuria screening rates in previously unscreened patients with hypertension and may be useful in increasing rates of proteinuria screening compliance. Future studies should evaluate use of home testing kits to screen for and confirm albuminuria, and determine whether improving early detection of kidney disease can improve future kidney health.

### How Do home and clinic blood pressure readings compare in pregnancy? [^116xmWDg]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Worldwide, ≈10% of women have high blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP), including preeclampsia, are one of the commonest causes of maternal mortality, and are a leading cause of direct maternal deaths in the United Kingdom.

Hypertension is commonly defined as systolic BP of ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg. If hypertension presents after 20 weeks gestation, it is known as gestational hypertension, and when combined with the presence of maternal organ dysfunction, uteroplacental dysfunction, or significant proteinuria (> 300 mg proteinuria/24 hours or > 30 mg/mmol creatinine [protein-creatinine ratio]), it is known as preeclampsia. – Preeclampsia complicates 2% to 8% of all pregnancies and up to 25% of pregnancies in women with chronic hypertension.

Current guidelines identify risk factors for preeclampsia based on medical and family histories. The UK guidelines recommend BP monitoring with increased frequency in those at higher risk of preeclampsia. Despite this, women still develop preeclampsia in the interval between antenatal visits, and a significant proportion of subsequent deaths occur after HDP, which developed after apparently normal antenatal visits. Reliance on intermittent clinic measurements may lead to both false-positive (white coat hypertension [WCH]) and -negative (masked hypertension) interpretations. Enhanced identification of developing hypertension among higher risk women could improve outcomes.

Self-monitoring of BP (SMBP), where individuals measure their own BP in a home setting, allows multiple measurements for several days with little disturbance of lifestyle and is now commonplace in adults with hypertension. – Regular SMBP might improve detection of hypertension in the pregnant population while reducing the time, money, and inconvenience of frequent appointments, without compromising the ability to detect and monitor a potentially serious disease. Potential advantages of SMBP include more frequent BP monitoring, improved accuracy, and increased acceptability to pregnant women.

### Dipstick proteinuria: can it guide hypertension management? [^113UWHoL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines call for lower blood pressure targets in patients with proteinuria of 1 g/d or greater. Dipstick test for proteinuria is widely available, but no information on its sensitivity or specificity is available when implementing current guidelines. To determine performance characteristics of dipstick proteinuria, we studied 332 patients attending a Veterans Administration renal clinic who underwent simultaneous measurement of urine protein and creatinine, as well as automated urinalysis with a dipstick graded from 0 to 4+ with a machine reader. There was increasing severity of proteinuria with each increment in dipstick result. When the spot urine protein-creatinine ratio was less than 1, a lower specific gravity was associated with greater severity of proteinuria. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for 1 and 3 g protein/g creatinine were 0.945 and 0.905, respectively. This attests to the excellent performance of the urine dipstick. The likelihood of having a protein-creatinine ratio of 1 or greater was 7% when urine dipstick protein value was 1+ or 2+, 62% when dipstick protein value was 3+, and 92% when dipstick protein value was 4+. Thus, dipstick proteinuria assessed by an automated reader remains a useful test to predict the severity of proteinuria and can be used to guide therapy. A cutoff dipstick proteinuria value of 3+ has the best combination of sensitivity and specificity (96% and 87%, respectively) in predicting a protein-creatinine ratio of 1 or greater and a cutoff value of 4+ in predicting a protein-creatinine ratio of 3 or greater (sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 83%). These results suggest that patients with 3+ or greater proteinuria should not only trigger appropriate evaluation of proteinuria, but also have mean arterial pressures targeted to less than 92 mm Hg.

### Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in patients with hypertension and risk of major cardiovascular events [^114ahvPF]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction/aims

Evaluation of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) is a key component in the management of hypertension, yet there is a lack of data on the association between uACR and major cardiovascular events (MACEs) in large hypertensive cohorts, and it is also unknown how often uACR is measured among these patients.

We aimed to evaluate the usage of uACR in a nationwide population of patients with hypertension. Furthermore, we sought to assess the risk of cardiorenal events according to uACR, among patients with hypertension.

Methods

We used Danish nationwide registries to identify patients who initiated antihypertensive treatment. The patients were grouped at treatment initiation according to uACR: normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria and no uACR measurement, and followed for 2 years, to evaluate the risk of a MACE, hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) according to uACR.

Results

We included 144 644 patients, of whom 116 039 (80%) did not have their uACR evaluated at treatment initiation. Patients with macroalbuminuria comprised the greatest 2 year absolute risk of MACE (5.3%, 95% CI: 4.0% to 6.6%) and had a greater risk of MACE (HR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.66), HF (HR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.35 to 2.95), 40% decline in eGFR (HR: 4.81, 95% CI: 3.78 to 6.10) and ESKD (HR: 4.52, 95% CI: 3.00 to 6.82) compared with patients with normoalbuminuria. Increased risk of MACE, HF and 40% decline in eGFR among patients with macroalbuminuria was persistent across subgroups of eGFR 120–30 mL/min/1.73 m².

Conclusions

In this real-world cohort, uACR was not regularly measured among patients initiating antihypertensive treatment. Nonetheless, the 2-year risks of cardiorenal events were considerably higher among patients with albuminuria compared with patients without.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: a 2023 update [^1173N7pQ]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Renal and urinary complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) include chronic kidney disease (CKD), transplantation associated-thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), nephrotic syndrome (NS), and hypertension. The cumulative incidence of CKD varies from 7% to 48%, it may develop between 6 months and 10 years post-HCT, and ~4% of cases progress to end-stage renal disease; a progressive glomerular filtration rate decline is associated with increasingly higher risk for mortality. TA-TMA occurs most frequently early post-HCT but may occur late after HCT, often in association with cGVHD; elevated lactate dehydrogenase, rising urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and hypertension are the earliest markers and should prompt clinicians to pursue further workup. NS occurs most often after IST is tapered for GVHD at 6 to 12 months post-HCT. As many as 70% of patients develop hypertension at < 2 years post-HCT, and effective antihypertensive therapy is important for reducing cardiovascular disease risk and progression of CKD.

### A systematic review of the predictors of disease progression in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^111AkhQo]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Seventeen publications from the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies in Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) study were identified by the systematic review. CRISP is a prospective, long-term observational study, including 241 ADPKD patients with normal renal function who were considered at high risk of renal insufficiency. The study was initiated to increase the knowledge and understanding of ADPKD prognosis by establishing reliable measures of disease progression. Patients were diagnosed due to a positive family history (asymptomatic family screening) or based on signs and symptoms related to the disease. The study includes patients with defined hypertension diagnosed before the age of 35 years; ADPKD diagnosed in utero or in the first year of life; 24-h urinary protein excretion greater than 300 mg/day; or an episode of gross haematuria in men before the age of 30 years (CRISP I population). A range of measurements have thus far been reported, and patients have been stratified by several different criteria across the CRISP publications, demonstrating the relevance of a number of prognostic factors, such as gender and age at diagnosis (Table 2). CRISP has identified the importance of TKV as a key prognostic indicator, particularly in the early stages of ADPKD where significant renal enlargement can occur prior to the loss of renal function. The CRISP study is ongoing, with 203 patients having been re-enrolled in CRISP II from July 2007.

### Microalbuminuria as a target to improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes [^116Gs5oW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Albuminuria is a cardiovascular and renal risk factor in patients with diabetes, patients with hypertension, and the general population. Risk has been shown to increase continuously with increasing urinary albumin levels, starting at levels that once were considered normal. This association is maintained even after adjusting for numerous other factors. Studies also established that a decrease in albuminuria leads to improvement in both cardiovascular and renal outcomes. These data suggest that urinary albumin should be measured routinely and treated to afford cardiovascular and renoprotection.

### Random urine protein-creatinine ratio to predict proteinuria in new-onset mild hypertension in late pregnancy [^115pavBU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of random urine protein-creatinine ratio for prediction of significant proteinuria (≥ 300 mg/24 h) in patients with new-onset mild hypertension in late pregnancy.

Methods

Medical records of 185 consecutive pregnant patients with new onset of mild hypertension in late pregnancy were reviewed. Random urine samples were taken before 24-hour urine collection. The predictive values of the random urine protein-creatinine ratio for diagnosis of significant proteinuria were estimated by using at least a 300-mg protein level within the collected 24-hour urine as the gold standard.

Results

Thirty-nine patients (21%) had significant proteinuria. There was a significant association between 24-hour protein excretion and the random urine protein-creatinine ratio (rs = 0.56, P < .01). With a cutoff protein-creatinine ratio greater than 0.19 as a predictor of significant proteinuria, sensitivity and specificity were 85% and 73%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values of the test were 46% and 95%, respectively.

Conclusion

The random urine protein-creatinine ratio was a poor predictor for significant proteinuria in patients with new-onset mild hypertension in late pregnancy.

Study population and characteristics

We identified 158 096 patients who initiated antihypertensive treatment between 2013 and 2019 and who had a creatinine measurement within 1 year prior to index. Among these, we excluded 13 452 patients, leaving 144 644 patients in the study population (figure 1). Overall, 14% of the included patients had normoalbuminuria (uACR < 30 mg/g), 5% had microalbuminuria (30 ≤ uACR > 300 mg/g), 1% had macroalbuminuria (uACR ≥ 300 mg/g) and 80% (116 039) of patients initiating antihypertensive treatment did not have their uACR evaluated at treatment initiation. Among the patients without uACR measurement, 22.5% were analysed with protein dipstick tests, resulting in 89 956 (62%) patients without any assessment of proteinuria within 1 year prior to treatment initiation (table 1). During the first year of follow-up, 54 688 (38%) patients were subjected to either uACR evaluation or protein dipstick test to assess kidney function. About 46% of the included patients were not subjected to either uACR measurement or protein dipstick test within index ± 1 year. Patients with diabetes were more likely to have their uACR evaluated at index than patients without diabetes (table 1).

Selected baseline characteristics of the study population

The median age was lowest among patients with macroalbuminuria (56, IQR: 46, 68). Male sex was predominant across all subgroups of patients regardless of proteinuria status.

As presented in table 1, patients with macroalbuminuria were more likely to have a lower annual income and to be living alone compared with patients with either microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria and compared with patients with a missing uACR. Diagnoses of coagulopathy, atrial fibrillation, chronic liver disease, prior bleeding, alcohol abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and type 1 diabetes were all more frequent among patients with macroalbuminuria compared with patients with normoalbuminuria (table 1).

Baseline covariates and concomitant medication according to eGFR levels are presented in online supplemental tables 2 and 3.

Conclusions

Albuminuria was not evaluated regularly among patients initiating antihypertensive treatment. Nonetheless, patients with macroalbuminuria comprised the highest risks of cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and both patients with microalbuminuria and patients with macroalbuminuria were found to have a greater 2-year relative risk of cardiorenal outcomes, compared with patients with normalised uACR. This could result in high-risk patients not being identified.

### Proteinuria in adults: a diagnostic approach… [^1147GaKG]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Detecting and Quantifying Proteinuria Dipstick analysis is used in most outpatient settings to semiquantitatively measure the urine protein concentration. In the absence of protein, the dipstick panel is yellow. Proteins in solution interfere with the dye-buffer combination, causing the panel to turn green. False-positive results occur with alkaline urine; when the dipstick is immersed too long; with highly concentrated urine; with gross hematuria; in the presence of penicillin, sulfonamides or tolbutamide; and with pus, semen or vaginal secretions. 6 Most patients with persistent proteinuria should undergo a quantitative measurement of protein excretion, which can be done with a 24-hour urine specimen. The patient should be instructed to discard the first morning void; a specimen of all subsequent voidings should be collected, including the first morning void on the second day.

The urinary creatinine concentration should be included in the 24-hour measurement to determine the adequacy of the specimen. 13, 14 Correlation between the UPr/Cr ratio and 24-hour protein excretion has been demonstrated in several diseases, including diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia and rheumatic disease. 15–17 Recent evidence indicates that the UPr/Cr ratio is more accurate than the 24-hour urine protein measurement. Diagnostic Evaluation of Proteinuria MICROSCOPIC URINALYSIS When proteinuria is found on a dipstick urinalysis, the urinary sediment should be examined microscopically. The findings of the microscopic examination and associated disorders are summarized in Table 5. 6 Dysmorphic erythrocytes are a result of cell insult secondary to osmotic shift in the nephron, indicating glomerular disease. Gross hematuria will cause proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis, but microscopic hematuria will not.

To diagnose orthostatic proteinuria, split urine specimens are obtained for comparison. The first morning void is discarded. A 16-hour daytime specimen is obtained with the patient performing normal activities and finishing the collection by voiding just before bedtime. An eight-hour overnight specimen is then collected. The daytime specimen typically has an increased concentration of protein, with the nighttime specimen having a normal concentration. Patients with true glomerular disease have reduced protein excretion in the supine position, but it will not return to normal, as it will with orthostatic proteinuria.

### Monitoring for proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116T6bvC]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nephropathy is an established complication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Common risk factors for renal disease include older age, men, ethnic minority status, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and poor glycemic control. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on diabetes recommends at least annual monitoring of patients with T2DM for proteinuria.

Proteinuria may be monitored qualitatively, using a dipstick method, or quantitatively by assessing 24 h or a spot urine for urinary protein or albumin. Owing to different detection limits and different false-positive and false-negative rates in albuminuria test methods, the NICE guideline recommends repeating a urinary test if an abnormal albumin: creatinine ratio is obtained at each of the next two clinic visits but within a maximum of 3–4 months. Limited publications are available on the frequency of proteinuria, proteinuria monitoring, and its associations with renal disease risk factors in patients with T2DM.

The purposes of this study were to (1) assess the frequency of proteinuria monitoring in patients with T2DM; (2) understand the association between proteinuria monitoring and renal disease risk factors in patients with T2DM, and whether the frequency of proteinuria testing varies by age, sex, smoking status, history of hypertension, renal complications, and antidiabetic drug therapy; and (3) evaluate the prevalence of proteinuria in patients with T2DM in the UK.

### Proteinuria during pregnancy: definition, pathophysiology, methodology, and clinical significance [^116a6eU2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative measurement of urine protein excretion is one of the most common tests performed during pregnancy. For more than 100 years, proteinuria was necessary for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, but recent guidelines recommend that proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary for the diagnosis. Still, in clinical practice, most patients with gestational hypertension will be diagnosed as having preeclampsia based on the presence of proteinuria. Although the reference standard for measuring urinary protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is a reasonable "rule-out" test for proteinuria. Urine dipstick screening for proteinuria does not provide any clinical benefit and should not be used to diagnose proteinuria. The classic cutoff cited to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of > 300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. Using this cutoff, the rate of isolated proteinuria in pregnancy may reach 8%, whereas preeclampsia occurs among 3% to 8% of pregnancies. Although this threshold is widely accepted, its origin is not based on evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes but rather on expert opinion and results of small studies. After reviewing the available data, the most important factor that influences maternal and neonatal outcome is the severity of blood pressures and presence of end organ damage, rather than the excess protein excretion. Because the management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features is almost identical in frequency of surveillance and timing of delivery, the separation into 2 disorders is unnecessary. If the management of women with gestational hypertension with a positive assessment of proteinuria will not change, we believe that urine assessment for proteinuria is unnecessary in women who develop new-onset blood pressure at or after 20 weeks' gestation. Furthermore, we do not recommend repeated measurement of proteinuria for women with preeclampsia, the amount of proteinuria does not seem to be related to poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, and monitoring proteinuria may lead to unindicated preterm deliveries and related neonatal complications. Our current diagnosis of preeclampsia in women with chronic kidney disease may be based on a change in protein excretion, a baseline protein excretion evaluation is critical in certain conditions such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune or other renal disorders. The current definition of superimposed preeclampsia possesses a diagnostic dilemma, and it is unclear whether a change in the baseline proteinuria reflects another systemic disease such as preeclampsia or whether women with chronic disease such as chronic hypertension or diabetes will experience a different "normal" pattern of protein excretion during pregnancy. Finally, limited data are available regarding angiogenic and other biomarkers in women with chronic kidney disease as a potential aid in distinguishing the worsening of baseline chronic kidney disease and chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia.

### Association between urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio within normal range and hypertension among adults in the United States: data from the NHANES 2009–2018 [^113NT7UA]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health issue, About 37 million adult Americans have CKD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and prevalence projections indicate that they will rise as the population ages and the obesity and diabetes epidemics spread, although end‐stage renal disease (ESKD) development is a serious outcome of CKD, cardiovascular problems are mostly responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in these people.

Individualized hypertension control targets are an important intervention for CKD management in primary care. In addition to controlling the risk factors currently known to be associated with blood pressure, we also need to focus on the role of other biomarkers in blood pressure. Albuminuria was closely associated with the risks of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and several chronic diseases, and changes in albuminuria observed in trials of cardiorenal preventive therapies strongly correlate with clinical endpoints.

The urinary albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (uACR), which is a well‐known indicator of glomerular injury and a crucial diagnostic indicator of chronic kidney disease (CKD).UACR is a reliable method for monitoring the excretion of urine protein and has become a clinical qualitative and quantitative diagnostic index for proteinuria that can replace the traditional 24‐h urinary protein quantification. Given the negative effects of albuminuria on CVD and the ambiguity of intervention when individual urinary protein levels rise slightly in the normal range (< 30 mg/g), it is important to investigate the relationship between uACR and hypertension. Furthermore, fewer studies have examined the associations between uACR and hypertension, and no relevant research has been conducted in the NHANES population.

Therefore, we investigated the association between uACR and hypertension in US adults using data from the 2009 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We also looked at whether the association varies by participant characteristics like age, gender, BMI, behavioral risk factor, and comorbidities, which could help with future clinical management of uACR.

RECOMMENDATION: ACCEPTABLE SAMPLES TO TEST FOR INCREASED URINARY ALBUMIN EXCRETION ARE TIMED COLLECTIONS (e.g. 12 OR 24 h) FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE ALBUMIN CONCENTRATION AND TIMED OR UNTIMED SAMPLES FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE ALBUMIN–CREATININE RATIO B (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: THE OPTIMAL TIME FOR SPOT URINE COLLECTION IS THE EARLY MORNING. ALL COLLECTIONS SHOULD BE AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY TO MINIMIZE VARIATION. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT HAVE INGESTED FOOD WITHIN THE PRECEDING 2 h BUT SHOULD BE WELL HYDRATED (i.e. NOT VOLUME DEPLETED) GPP.

B. Preanalytical.

Collection of 24-h samples has disadvantages, specifically because many samples are collected inadequately and because total creatinine is not routinely checked to evaluate the adequacy of collection. The albumin–creatinine ratio is the superior method to predict renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes. The ratio has a within-person biological variation similar to that of the excretion rate and correlates well with both timed excretion and the albumin concentration in a first morning void of urine. For the ratio, a first morning void sample is preferable because this sample has a lower within-person variation than the ratio for a random urine sample taken during the day. Although the ratio appears entirely acceptable for screening, limited data are available on its use in monitoring the response to therapy. Recent post hoc analyses of clinical trials, however, have found that the albumin–creatinine ratio is a reasonable method to assess change over time. For screening, an untimed sample for albumin measurement (without creatinine) may be considered if one uses a concentration cutoff that allows high sensitivity for detecting an increased albumin excretion rate.

Albumin is stable in untreated urine stored at 4°C or 20°C for at least a week. Neither centrifugation nor filtration appears necessary before storage at −20°C or −80°C. Whether a urine sample is centrifuged, filtered, or not treated, the albumin concentration decreases by 0.27%/day at −20°C but shows no decreases over 160 days at −80°C. The urinary albumin excretion rate does not show marked diurnal variation in diabetes but does so in essential hypertension.

### Detection and evaluation of chronic kidney disease [^11581GHJ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 19 million adult Americans, and its incidence is increasing rapidly. Diabetes and hypertension are the underlying causes in most cases of chronic kidney disease. Evidence suggests that progression to kidney failure can be delayed or prevented by controlling blood sugar levels and blood pressure and by treating proteinuria. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease often is overlooked in its earliest, most treatable stages. Guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommend estimating glomerular filtration rate and screening for albuminuria in patients with risk factors for chronic kidney disease, including diabetes, hypertension, systemic illnesses, age greater than 60 years, and family history of chronic kidney disease. The glomerular filtration rate, calculated by using a prediction equation, detects chronic kidney disease more accurately than does the serum creatinine level alone; the glomerular filtration rate also is used for disease staging. In most clinical situations, analysis of random urine samples to determine the albumin-creatinine or protein-creatinine ratio has replaced analysis of timed urine collections. When chronic kidney disease is detected, an attempt should be made to identify and treat the specific underlying condition(s). The KDOQI guidelines define major treatment goals for all patients with chronic kidney disease. These goals include slowing disease progression, detecting and treating complications, and managing cardiovascular risk factors. Primary care physicians have an important role in detecting chronic kidney disease early, in instituting measures to slow disease progression, and in providing timely referral to a nephrologist.

### Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in patients with hypertension and risk of major cardiovascular events [^11548G9q]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

The results from our study showed that albuminuria was associated with an increased risk of cardiorenal outcomes independent of eGFR level among patients with eGFR between 30 and 120 mL/min/1.73 m², yet albuminuria was not regularly evaluated among patients initiating hypertensive treatment. Even though diabetes was more common among patients being tested for albuminuria in this study, the subgroup of patients without uACR comprised 5179 (4.5%) patients with diabetes type 2. Moreover, patients without uACR measurement were more likely to be suffering from cancer and to be treated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and less likely to have protein dipstick test performed than patients with measured uACR. Risk of cardiovascular and renal events was also higher among patients without uACR measurement compared with patients with normoalbuminuria. This suggests that the current approach to screening does not always include high-risk patients, and that albuminuria was not evaluated with either protein dipstick or uACR in a substantial proportion of patients. Whether this was caused by lack of knowledge from healthcare professionals or because patients were evaluated by eGFR is not known, yet as this study showed, eGFR measurements should not stand alone in risk evaluation of hypertensive patients.

Further research regarding the usage of uACR during follow-up and evaluation of risk factors associated with different uACR levels is warranted.

Data on 1860 nondiabetic patients were pooled in a patient-level meta-analysis. Progression of kidney disease was defined as a doubling of baseline serum creatinine level or onset of kidney failure. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the association of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and urine protein excretion with kidney disease progression at 22 610 patient visits.

Data Synthesis

Mean duration of follow-up was 2.2 years. Kidney disease progression was documented in 311 patients. Systolic blood pressure of 110 to 129 mm Hg and urine protein excretion less than 2.0 g/d were associated with the lowest risk for kidney disease progression. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remained beneficial after adjustment for blood pressure and urine protein excretion (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.84]). The increased risk for kidney progression at higher systolic blood pressure levels was greater in patients with urine protein excretion greater than 1.0 g/d (P < 0.006).

Conclusion

Although reverse causation cannot be excluded with certainty, a systolic blood pressure goal between 110 and 129 mm Hg may be beneficial in patients with urine protein excretion greater than 1.0 g/d. Systolic blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg may be associated with a higher risk for kidney disease progression.

3 MEASUREMENT

3.1 Measurement technique and urine sample type

Historically, urinary protein assessment relied on measuring 24‐h total protein excretion. Advances in the understanding of kidney disease, as reflected in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guideline, shifted the focus to albuminuria, recognising it as the predominant urinary protein in most kidney diseases. These recommendations have been retained in the updated KDIGO 2024 guidelines, further reinforcing the clinical importance of albuminuria assessment. Measuring urinary albumin, now widely recommended, is a relatively standardised and sensitive procedure that improves the sensitivity, quality and consistency of kidney disease detection and management. Although total protein measurements are less expensive, they lack the sensitivity to detect low but clinically significant levels of albuminuria, leading to their replacement by albumin‐specific assays (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Comparison of albuminuria measurement methods.

Albuminuria can be assessed using semi‐quantitative dipstick tests, particularly in resource‐limited settings. These reagent strips provide a quick, inexpensive and convenient screening method but have limited sensitivity and specificity, partly due to their inability to account for urine concentration or dilution. While these tests may eventually facilitate at‐home monitoring for CKD patients, they should currently be regarded as preliminary tools requiring confirmation through laboratory‐based methods to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective clinical decision‐making.

While 24‐h urine collection is the gold standard for assessing albuminuria due to its ability to account for variations in urine tonicity and the circadian rhythm of urinary albumin excretion, practical limitations often necessitate alternative methods. Although 24‐h urine collections provide comprehensive data, including assessments of muscle mass (via 24‐h creatinine excretion) and dietary intake (sodium and protein intake measured through sodium and urea excretion, respectively), they are labour‐intensive and prone to errors such as incomplete collection. Timed overnight collections are less cumbersome while still covering a reasonable collection interval; however, compliance remains poor compared to spot urine sampling. These challenges have led to the widespread adoption of more practical methods, including random urine samples, first‐morning voids and early‐morning voids.

### Improving proteinuria screening with mailed smartphone urinalysis testing in previously unscreened patients with hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^115UPVvw]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our intervention using smartphone-based home testing was successful in increasing proteinuria screening rates in previously unscreened patients with hypertension and may be preferable for some patients. We also found that few patients with trace or 1+ urine protein underwent follow-up ACR testing at the laboratory, limiting the effectiveness of a urine dipstick-first screening strategy. Future research directions should consider doing screening and confirmatory testing of ACR using home-testing modalities. Additional research is needed to determine whether improving adherence to albuminuria screening can improve patient-centered kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.

RECOMMENDATIONS RELEVANT TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERTENSION-MEDIATED KIDNEY DAMAGE AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS

The 2023 ESH Guidelines list assessment of serum creatinine (SCr), estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with the 2009 CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration formula and evaluation of urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) measured from a spot urine sample (preferably early morning urine) as two of the three (the third being 12-lead electrocardiogram) basic tests to assess HMOD and stage hypertension. These examinations should be documented in all patients upon hypertension diagnosis, and at least annually thereafter. Serum creatinine alone is identified as an insensitive marker of renal impairment, because a major reduction in kidney function can occur before SCr rises. It is also suggested that a negative urinary dipstick test does not rule out A2 albuminuria, as many times it cannot detect ACR levels at the lower range, but it can offer information on other signs of kidney injury (i.e. microscopic hematuria, active urine sediment) and should be performed at least at the initial evaluation. The document endorses the currently universally used definition for CKD, involving an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at any level of albuminuria or an ACR > 30 mg/g at any levels of eGFR persisting for more than 3 months, and the current nomenclature for albuminuria, to highlight the risk associated to albuminuria increase, i.e. (i) normal/mildly increased, ACR < 30 mg/g (A1, formerly termed normoalbuminuria); (ii) moderately increased, ACR 30–300 mg/g (A2, formerly termed microalbuminuria); and (iii) severely increased, ACR > 300 mg/g (A3, formerly termed macroalbuminuria).

Patient Evaluation

Both guidelines recommend obtaining a personal and family history, performing a physical examination that includes measurement of BP, and obtaining basic laboratory testing (Table II in the Data Supplement). Although the specifics of the latter overlap in requiring a fasting blood glucose, blood/serum sodium and potassium, lipid profile, serum creatinine/estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinalysis, and ECG, there are discrepancies with the ACC/AHA (only) recommending a complete blood count, serum calcium, and thyroid stimulating hormone, and the ESC/ESH (only) recommending a hemoglobin/hematocrit, blood uric acid, glycated hemoglobin A1c, liver function tests, urine protein test or, ideally, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. An echocardiogram, uric acid, and urinary albumin-to-creatine ratio are optional tests in the ACC/AHA guideline. In the ESC/ESH, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound, pulse wave velocity, ankle-brachial index, cognitive function testing, and brain imaging are additional tests that can be used for recognition of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD). Thus, the assessment of HMOD and its implementation in risk stratification was an important consideration for CVD risk prediction in the ESC/ESH CPG.

4. Interpretation

A. Nonanalytical sources of variation.

Transient increases in urinary albumin excretion have been reported with short-term hyperglycemia, exercise, urinary tract infections, marked hypertension, heart failure, acute febrile illness, and hyperlipidemia.

RECOMMENDATION: LOW URINE ALBUMIN CONCENTRATIONS (i.e. < 30 mg/g CREATININE) ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IF THE eGFR IS > 60 mL · min −1 · (1.73 m 2) −1 AND THE PATIENT IS NORMOTENSIVE. IF THE eGFR IS < 60 mL · min −1 · (1.73 m 2) −1 AND/OR THE LEVEL OF ALBUMINURIA IS ≥ 30 mg/g CREATININE ON A SPOT URINE SAMPLE, A REPEAT MEASUREMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN WITHIN THE YEAR TO ASSESS CHANGE AMONG PEOPLE WITH HYPERTENSION A (moderate).

B. Frequency of measurement.

The NKF, ADA, and JNC 7 recommend annual measurement in diabetic patients with albumin–creatinine ratios < 30 μg/mg. After the documentation of stage A2 albuminuria (i.e. with results as defined above on two of three tests performed within 3 to 6 months), repeated testing is reasonable to determine whether a chosen therapy is effective. It may also be useful in determining the rate of disease progression and thus may support planning for care of end-stage renal disease. Although the ADA recommendations suggest that such testing is not generally needed before puberty, testing may be considered on an individual basis if it appears appropriate because of an early onset of diabetes, poor control, or a family history of diabetic nephropathy. The duration of diabetes prior to puberty is reportedly an important risk factor in this age-group and thus can be used to support such testing in individual patients.

MISCELLANEOUS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ANALYTES. I. INSULIN AND PRECURSORS

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: THERE IS NO ROLE FOR ROUTINE TESTING FOR INSULIN, C-PEPTIDE, OR PROINSULIN IN MOST PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MAY BE MADE IN MOST CASES ON THE BASIS OF THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND THE SUBSEQUENT COURSE. THESE ASSAYS ARE USEFUL PRIMARILY FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. OCCASIONALLY, C-PEPTIDE MEASUREMENTS MAY HELP DISTINGUISH TYPE 1 FROM TYPE 2 DIABETES IN AMBIGUOUS CASES, SUCH AS PATIENTS WHO HAVE A TYPE 2 PHENOTYPE BUT PRESENT IN KETOACIDOSIS B (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: THERE IS NO ROLE FOR MEASUREMENT OF INSULIN CONCENTRATION IN THE ASSESSMENT OF CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK, BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS VALUE DOES NOT ALTER THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE PATIENTS B (moderate).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia — diagnostic criteria require hypertension plus proteinuria or, if proteinuria is absent, specific new-onset end-organ findings. Blood pressure criteria are: SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions at least 4 h apart after ≥ 20 wk of gestation in a woman with previously normal BP, or SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Proteinuria is defined as ≥ 300 mg per 24 h urine collection, protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3, or dipstick 2+. In the absence of proteinuria, new-onset hypertension with any of the following qualifies: platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L, serum creatinine concentrations > 1.1 mg/dL or doubling of creatinine without other renal disease, elevated liver transaminases to twice normal, pulmonary edema, or new-onset headache unresponsive to medication and not explained by other diagnoses or visual symptoms.

Asymptomatic hypertension — urine dipstick screening for acutely elevated serum creatinine: In a prospective observational study, 143 patients with diastolic blood pressure ≥ 115 mm Hg were evaluated with serum creatinine and a urine dipstick, and of 143 patients, 24 met criteria for acutely elevated serum creatinine (> 1.2 or acute elevation > 25% above baseline). The presence of either hematuria or proteinuria on dipstick identified these patients with 100% sensitivity and 29.7% specificity, and specificity rose to 42.4% when an abnormal dipstick was defined as hematuria or ≥ 1+ proteinuria; reported 95% CI 83% to 100%.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115t1TDJ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 — investigation of hypertension in pregnancy recommends basic laboratory monitoring including urine analysis, blood count, haematocrit, liver enzymes, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid, noting that hyperuricaemia in hypertensive pregnancies identifies women at increased risk of adverse maternal and foetal outcomes. All pregnant women should be assessed for proteinuria in early pregnancy to detect pre-existing renal disease and, in the second half of pregnancy, to screen for pre-eclampsia; a dipstick test of ≥ 1+ should prompt evaluation of ACR in a single spot urine sample and a value < 30 mg/mmol can reliably rule out proteinuria in pregnancy. Among additional tests, a soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1:placental growth factor ratio of ≤ 38 can be used to exclude the development of pre-eclampsia in the next week when suspected clinically.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114jogtT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — loss of GFR within CKD stage 1 in people with elevated urinary albumin excretion may already represent DKD, and formulae estimating GFR from serum creatinine values are problematic in their application to patients with diabetes. Measures of albuminuria in combination with estimates of GFR will serve as useful guides in assessing and managing patients with diabetes and CKD, and the Work Group developed a novel grid (Table 6) to combine staging by albuminuria classification and GFR, although evidence to define DKD probabilities within each box is lacking. The diagnosis and staging of DKD in an individual patient should include an evaluation of other related factors, and apart from albuminuria and GFR, patients should be evaluated for the presence of hypertension, poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, and smoking. A family history of DKD or hypertension and/or CVD and stroke in persons without diabetes also is relevant, and because DKD typically does not occur in isolation, patients with DKD should have regular surveillance for other microvascular and macrovascular complications.

The surrogate marker "increased albumin excretion" does not only indicate the development of chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease, but serves also as an indicator for cardiovascular prognosis. In the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) trial, increased albumin excretion, even in the normal range (the so-called low-grade albuminuria), is associated with increased cardiovascular event rate. In the general population-based PREVEND study, there was a progressively enhanced risk of cardiovascular mortality with increased albumin concentration in the spot urine. Thus, increased urinary albumin excretion (low-grade albuminuria, microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria) fulfils all the requirements of an ideal surrogate parameter for renal and cardiovascular disease. In particular, the simplicity of measuring urinary albumin excretion from the spot urine, as well as its high sensitivity and prognostic importance, has been well evidenced in the last 5–10 years.

Key Points

Question

Among at-risk patients with hypertension or diabetes, what is the prevalence of albuminuria that is undetected?

Findings

In this cohort study of 192 108 adults with hypertension or diabetes having at least 2 outpatient health care visits during 2017 to 2018, the estimated prevalence of albuminuria was 17.5%; approximately two-thirds did not have urine albumin tested. Albuminuria testing was associated with higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease treatment.

Meaning

These results suggest that improving identification of albuminuria among at-risk individuals represents a substantial opportunity to optimize care delivery for reducing kidney disease progression and cardiovascular complications.
