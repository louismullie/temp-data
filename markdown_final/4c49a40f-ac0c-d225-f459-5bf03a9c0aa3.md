## Question

In the fall of 1996, a total of 800 students participated in an annual school clean-up day.  The organizers of the event expect that in each of the years 1997, 1998, and 1999, participation will increase by 50% over the previous year.  The number of participants the organizers will expect in the fall of 1999 is
$\text{(A)}\ 1200 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 1500 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 2000 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 2400 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 2700$

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate the expected number of participants in the fall of 1999, given that participation increases by 50% each year from 1996 to 1999, starting from 800 participants in 1996. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the base year and the growth factor. Then, I should verify the year-by-year calculations for 1997, 1998, and 1999. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and match the result to the provided options.

> Let me first confirm the starting point and the growth rule. In 1996, there were 800 participants, and each subsequent year (1997, 1998, 1999) the organizers expect a 50% increase over the previous year, which means multiplying by 1.5 each time [^notfound].

> Now, I will calculate the expected participants for 1997. A 50% increase on 800 is 800 × 1.5 = 1200 participants. Wait, let me verify that: 800 × 0.5 = 400, and 800 + 400 = 1200, so that checks out [^notfound].

> Next, I should calculate 1998. Applying the same 50% increase to the 1997 total, I get 1200 × 1.5 = 1800 participants. Hold on, I should verify: 1200 × 0.5 = 600, and 1200 + 600 = 1800, which is correct [^notfound].

> Finally, I will calculate 1999. Increasing 1998's 1800 by 50% gives 1800 × 1.5 = 2700 participants. Let me double-check: 1800 × 0.5 = 900, and 1800 + 900 = 2700, so the math is consistent [^notfound].

> I should confirm the answer against the options. The expected number of participants in the fall of 1999 is 2700, which corresponds to option E. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 2400 might be the answer, but that would be incorrect because 1800 × 1.5 is definitely 2700, not 2400, so I need to correct that initial impulse and stick with 2700 [^notfound].

---

The expected number of participants in 1999 is **2700**. This is calculated by applying a 50% increase each year for three years: 800 × 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 2700. Therefore, the correct answer is **(E) 2700**.

---

## Calculation

- **Initial participation in 1996**: 800 students.
- **Expected increase per year**: 50% (i.e. multiply by 1.5).

| **Year** | **Calculation** | **Expected participants** |
|-|-|-|
| 1997 | 800 × 1.5 | 1200 |
| 1998 | 1200 × 1.5 | 1800 |
| 1999 | 1800 × 1.5 | 2700 |

---

Thus, the expected number of participants in 1999 is **2700**.

## Answer

The correct answer is **(E) 2700**.

### Sports specialization and intensive training in young athletes [^81ca8fcc]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Youth sports participation—epidemiology and background: According to a national report, 60 million youth aged 6 through 18 years participated in organized sports, an increase from 45 million in 1997. The sex ratio has remained constant, with 66% of young athletes being male and 34% being female. Of the 60 million young athletes reported, 27% participated in only 1 sport. Participation by children aged ≤6 years increased from 6% in 1997 to 12% in 2008. Unfortunately, 70% of children drop out of organized sports by 13 years of age. According to the 2013–2014 high school athletics participation survey, 7.8 million high school students participated in sports.

### A student-initiated interactive course as a model for teaching reproductive health [^a4bd2d6c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Medical students at Stanford University established an elective lecture series in reproductive health to teach 10 women's health competencies to preclinical medical students. In the second year, student organizers implemented interactive components to improve the number of competencies students learned.

Study Design

We surveyed students from the first two years this series was offered to assess their preferred modes of learning and the number of competencies students perceived they had gained. Students were asked to self-assess their learning of key reproductive health competencies taught in the course.

Results

We identified 4 factors associated with statistically significant improvements in the number of competencies students learned, according to self-assessment.

Conclusion

Students who felt they learned more competencies agreed that they were active participants in the course, that their preferred style of learning was matched by the course, and that they had received academic credit for the course. Furthermore, students who attended an innovative reproductive health fair organized by students participating in the course perceived that they had learned significantly more competencies. We expect these self-assessed improvements to correlate with increased demonstration of the competencies as students progress to the clinical level.

### Applying the PROSPER prevention delivery system with middle schools: emerging adulthood effects on substance misuse and conduct problem behaviors through 14 years past baseline [^5d64d042]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

METHOD

Site selection and assignment

The PROSPER study involved 28 rural community school districts from Iowa and Pennsylvania (14 in each state). Eligibility criteria entailed school district enrollment of 1300 to 5200 students, local CES and school district agreement to random assignment, and a willingness and capacity to support PROSPER implementation if assigned to the intervention condition. Following their recruitment and enrollment, the 28 school districts were blocked (matched) on size and geographic location, randomized to experimental condition (intervention or control), and then informed of their condition assignment. Participating universities’ Institutional Review Boards approved study procedures. Additional details related to recruitment procedures are available in Spoth, Clair, et al.

Sample and data collection

The study began with two successive cohorts of sixth graders. Figure 1 summarizes sample tracking across waves of data collection. All enrolled sixth graders from the two cohorts were recruited for participation and 90% of the eligible sample provided baseline data. Consistent with the characteristics of rural Iowa and Pennsylvania communities in 2002, most students were White (85%), 51% were female, 64% lived with both biological parents, and 31% received free or reduced‐cost school lunches. The average age of participants was 11.8 years in the fall of sixth grade and 24.6 years at the last wave of data collection.

In‐school survey and young adult follow‐up assessment: Total participation by wave. Note : Reported participation rates include all students in both study cohorts completing the in‐school survey at the indicated wave. All students enrolled in the project school districts and in the targeted grades were eligible for participation, regardless of their participation in earlier survey waves; as a result, participation at later waves may exceed participation at pretest. Young adult assessments were conducted with randomly selected participants from the in‐school assessment sample that completed Sixth‐grade pretest assessments and were still enrolled in their baseline school district in the ninth grade. 1985 young adults completed their survey at age 19—1628 (82.0%) and 1595 (80.4%) of those completed the surveys at ages 23 and 25, respectively. The numbers by the intervention condition are included in the figure above

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^b6bf4600]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Physical activity behaviors of children and adolescents—many youths are not regularly active. In 2002, 62% of children and adolescents aged 9–13 years did not participate in any organized physical activity during nonschool hours, and 23% did not engage in any free-time physical activity. Among high school students, the 2009 national YRBS indicated that only 18% had been physically active for 60 minutes every day in the previous week. Regarding physical education, in 2009, although 56% reported being enrolled, only 33% attended physical education classes 5 days in an average school week, compared with 43% in 1991; additionally, nationwide 58% of high school students reported playing on at least one sports team run by their school or a community group in 2009.

### Educational programs in US medical schools, 2000-2001 [^58d4c24b]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

We used data from the 2000-2001 Liaison Committee on Medical Education Annual Medical School Questionnaire, which had a 100% response rate, and other sources to describe the status of medical education programs in the United States. In 2000-2001, the number of full-time medical school faculty members was 103, 553, a 1.1% increase from 1999-2000. The 37, 092 applicants for the class entering in 2000 represented a 3.7% decrease from the number of applicants in 1999. The majority of medical schools (58%) were in the process of major curriculum review and change during 2000-2001. In 72 schools (58%), students were required to pass both Steps 1 and 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examinations to advance or graduate. The availability of patients to participate in clinical teaching during 2000-2001 decreased in almost half of schools compared with 1999-2000. Many schools reported difficulty in recruiting or retaining volunteer faculty members to provide clinical education in the community. Forty medical schools provided monetary payment to some or all community volunteer faculty members.

### Applying the PROSPER prevention delivery system with middle schools: emerging adulthood effects on substance misuse and conduct problem behaviors through 14 years past baseline [^7899f075]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

From the 6th through the 12th grades, data were collected via machine‐scored written questionnaires administered in students’ classrooms. Pretest assessments were conducted in the fall of 2002 (for Cohort 1) and 2003 (for Cohort 2). Beginning in the spring of 6th grade, follow‐up assessments were conducted annually through the 12th grade (from 0.5 to 6.5 years past baseline). On average, 88% of all eligible students completed questionnaires across the eight in‐school survey waves, with slightly higher rates of participation in earlier waves.

Because of the high cost of following the entire sample into adulthood, a randomly selected and stratified subsample was recruited for continued follow‐up beyond 12th grade, with the intention of recruiting approximately 2000 participants. Students who were still enrolled in the same school district in the ninth grade were eligible for participation in the emerging adult follow‐up assessments. Selection for the emerging adult follow‐up was stratified by school district, gender, and risk status. Risk status was based on five dichotomous factors reported by participants at baseline: lifetime gateway substance use (use of alcohol, cigarettes, or marijuana); conduct problem behaviors (at least 2 of 12 possible behaviors during the past year); eligibility for the free and reduced cost school lunch program; lower family cohesion (dichotomized); and living with one or no biological parents (vs. two biological parents). Students were classified as being at higher risk if they reported (a) any three or more of the five risk factors or (b) two risk factors, if gateway substance use or conduct problems were among the two. To enhance statistical power to investigate risk‐related moderation effects in multilevel models (see Montgomery,), higher‐risk participants were oversampled and comprised 37.4% of the participating subsample, versus 29.2% of the eligible sample. At age 23, 1628 (82.0%) of this emerging adult subsample participated in the study, and at age 25, 1595 (80.4%) participated. Details of sample participation at different points in the study are provided in Figure 1. Randomly selected, stratified subsamples were selected in the two participating states and prospective participants were sent an invitation to continue with the study, until 1985 of those who agreed completed the survey. At age 19, participants were 90.6% White and 54.1% female. At ages 23 and 25, as was the case at age 19, participants completed assessments through a computer‐assisted telephone interview or a web‐based survey (9% and 91%, respectively, at age 23, and 6% and 94% at age 25).

### Effectiveness of university of California postbaccalaureate premedical programs in increasing medical school matriculation for minority and disadvantaged students [^a23945d8]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Many medical schools administer postbaccalaureate premedical programs targeting underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students, with the goal of increasing the number of these students matriculating into medical school.

Objective

To determine whether University of California (UC) postbaccalaureate programs are effective in increasing medical school matriculation rates for program participants.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study assessing 5 UC medical school postbaccalaureate programs. The cohort comprised 265 participants in the postbaccalaureate programs in the 1999 through 2002 academic years and a control group of 396 college graduates who applied to the programs but did not participate. Of the participants, 66% were underrepresented minorities, and for 50% neither parent had attended college.

Main Outcome Measure

Matriculation by 2005 into a US medical school accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education.

Results

By 2005, 67.6% of participants and 22.5% of controls had matriculated into medical school (P<.001). After adjusting for baseline student characteristics, students who participated in postbaccalaureate programs had a higher probability of matriculating into medical school in a regression model controlling for grade point average and demographic characteristics (odds ratio, 6.30; 95% confidence interval, 4.08-9.72) and in a model further controlling for preparticipation Medical College Admissions Test score (odds ratio, 8.06; 95% confidence interval, 4.65-13.97).

Conclusion

Postbaccalaureate premedical programs appear to be an effective intervention to increase the number of medical school matriculants from disadvantaged and underrepresented groups.

### Participation in the academic associate program: effect on medical school admission rate [^d3a7c2f8]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Several emergency medicine programs are using premedical students as research assistants for clinical research in the emergency department (ED). These programs have been shown to enhance faculty research productivity, but the effects of these programs on the students' goals have not been assessed. The authors evaluated the effect of the Academic Associate Program (AAP) on medical school acceptance rates.

Methods

From 1997 to 2002, premedical students who attended informational sessions about the AAP completed a 28-item survey including demographic information, educational experiences, career goals, grade point average (GPA), and prior research participation. Premedical students who had a career goal of becoming a physician were included in the study if they matriculated into medical school or changed their career plans by the fall of 2003. Medical school acceptance was determined by contacting students or their parents via telephone and e-mail. Students enrolled in the AAP were compared with Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) data to determine whether they were more or less likely to be accepted into medical school.

Results

During the study period, 198 students enrolled in the AAP had attained a final disposition with respect to medical school matriculation. Students were a mean age of 22.4 +/- 3.0 years, 55% female, and 43% nonwhite. Most students (91%) were junior year or later with respect to educational level. Prior research experience included being an author on an abstract (25%), being an author on a manuscript (17%), and presenting research at a scientific meeting (14%). The mean GPA ( +/- standard deviation) for Academic Associates was 3.38 ( +/- 0.31). Medical school acceptance rates were 79% for students in the AAP (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 73.1 to 84.5). This is higher than expected based on AAMC published data with a 49% (95% CI = 48.5 to 49.5) acceptance rate for students with a mean GPA of 3.46.

Conclusions

Compared with AAMC data, students in the AAP have a higher medical school acceptance rate despite a slightly lower GPA. This finding suggests that participation in the program enhances a student's likelihood of matriculating in medical school.

### Testing the effectiveness of the developing inclusive youth program: a multisite randomized control trial [^f51abe83]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

METHOD

Participants

Participants included N = 983 students in third (n = 323, females = 172, M age = 8.64 years, SD age = 0.36), fourth (n = 337, females = 176, M age = 9.65 years, SD age = 0.38), and fifth (n = 323, females = 154, M age = 10.63 years, SD age = 0.36) grades (see Table 1). Participants were from racial and ethnic majority and minority backgrounds (see Table 1). The program was implemented under routine conditions in a large public school district in a major metropolitan area in the Mid‐Atlantic region of the United States. The six participating schools had a mean of 8.1% students on Free and Reduced Priced Meals (FARMS) with a range from 5% to 11.4%. This project received approval from the University of Maryland Institutional Review Board Approval #1093717. The data were collected during fall of 2018 and fall of 2019.

TABLE 1 
Demographics of students participants

In designing the study, we attempted to have a minimum detectable effect size (MDES) for the overall standardized treatment effect of.31 at a power of.80. Specifically, we determined (using Optimal Design v3.01; Raudenbush et al.), that including six participating schools as blocks, each with six classrooms (i.e. one treatment and one BAU classroom at each grade—third, fourth, and fifth) with 25 students per classroom, resulting in 900 students total, would yield an MDES of.31. This estimate is based on assumptions that the school site blocking variable explained.40 of the variance of the outcome measure and classroom‐level predictors explained.70 of the variance of the outcomes at the classroom level. Additionally, the ICC value was assumed to be.10 and the standardized treatment effect size variation across sites was assumed to be.01. The minimum detectable effect sizes will be larger for tests involving moderation. The eventual design matched the planned design, except for a lower average number of students per classroom (20.45 students per classroom) and for two schools, four classroom participated at each grade.

### Environmental interventions for eating and physical activity: a randomized controlled trial in middle schools [^c84dc4c5]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of environmental, policy, and social marketing interventions on physical activity and fat intake of middle school students on campus.

Design

Twenty-four middle schools were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Baseline measures were collected in spring 1997, and interventions were conducted during the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 school years SETTING/PARTICIPATION: The schools had mean enrollments of 1109, with 44.5% nonwhite students. Over 2 years, physical activity interventions were designed to increase physical activity in physical education classes and throughout the school day. Nutrition interventions were designed to provide and market low-fat foods at all school food sources, including cafeteria breakfasts and lunches, a la carte sources, school stores, and bag lunches. School staff and students were engaged in policy change efforts, but there was no classroom health education.

Main Outcomes Measures

Primary outcomes were measured by direct observation and existing records.

Results

Randomized regression models (N =24 schools) revealed a significant intervention effect for physical activity for the total group (p <0.009) and boys (p <0.001), but not girls (p <0.40). The intervention was not effective for total fat (p <0.91) or saturated fat (p <0.79). Survey data indicated that the interventions reduced reported body mass index for boys (p <0.05).

Conclusions

Environmental and policy interventions were effective in increasing physical activity at school among boys but not girls. The interventions were not effective in reducing fat intake at school. School environmental and policy interventions have the potential to improve health behavior of the student population, but barriers to full implementation need to be better understood and overcome.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^d73c45a8]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Women’s sport participation—key early Olympic milestones show initial exclusion followed by staged inclusion: in 1896, no women were permitted to compete in any Olympic event; by 1900, Twenty-two females of 997 athletes competed; in 1912, swimming was opened to women with 2 events; in 1928, Athletics included Five events but the 800 m was dropped after 1928; in 1960, the Women’s Olympic 800-m track race was reinstated; in 1984, the women’s Olympic marathon competed for the first time; and in 1999, Serena Williams’ first Grand Slam (top 4) title exemplified professional progress.

### Effects of naturally existing peer groups on changes in academic engagement in a cohort of sixth graders [^6aa7259b]. Child Development (2007). Low credibility.

This study examined the effects of peer groups on changes in academic engagement in 11- to 13-year-old children. From the entire cohort of 366 sixth graders in a town, 87% participated at the beginning and end of the school year. Peer groups were assessed using socio-cognitive mapping; as an indicator of motivation, teachers reported on students' classroom engagement. Peer groups were homogeneous in terms of engagement, and despite considerable member turnover across time, their motivational composition remained fairly intact. Peer group engagement levels in the fall predicted changes in children's motivation across time. Although the magnitude of effects was relatively small, evidence for group influences persisted when controlling for peer selection and the influence of teacher and parent involvement.

### First cannabis use: does onset shift to younger ages? Findings from 1988 to 2003 from the Dutch national school survey on substance use [^734bf6fd]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the hypothesis that changes in cannabis prevalence among Dutch secondary school students (aged 12-17 years) were paralleled by shifts in the age of first cannabis use.

Design and Participants

Data were derived from five waves (1988, 1992, 1996, 1999 and 2003) of the Dutch National School Survey on Substance Use, a nationally representative cross-sectional study, with a total of 32,777 respondents.

Measurements

Written questionnaires on cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, other drug use and socio-demographic and behavioural variables were administered in classroom settings.

Findings

Survival analysis showed a strong increase in cumulative incidences by age of first cannabis use from 1988 to 1992, a further increase in 1996 and stabilization in 1999, continuing into 2003. From 1992 to 1996, age of onset shifted towards younger ages. Onset peaked at age 15 in 1992 and age 14 in 1996. The proportion of life-time cannabis users starting at age 13 or younger increased from 26% in 1992 to 41% in 1996. The overall trend was similar for boys and girls.

Conclusions

The study largely confirmed the expectation that the increase in cannabis use from 1988 to 1996 was paralleled by a decrease in the age of first cannabis use. From 1996 to 2003 age of first cannabis use and prevalence stabilized, possibly occasioned by a change in cannabis policy in the mid-1990s.

### US graduate medical education, 2000-2001 [^c5c70052]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

For the last three quarters of a century, the American Medical Association's national collection of graduate medical education (GME) data has evolved in its scope and methods. This year's GME survey involved new technology. The National GME Census for 2000-2001, jointly administered by the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges, was part of an Internet-based product called GME Track. Because of technical problems, data collection was less complete than in previous years. Similar to the 1999-2000 survey, we observed an increase in the number of subspecialty programs, with 79 more than last year (2.1% increase), and a decrease in the number of specialty programs, with 40 (0.9%) fewer. Parallel to this continuing trend was a decrease in the number of graduates of US medical schools who were matched into primary care residencies, particularly family practice programs (20% decrease compared with 1996-1997). The number of graduates of osteopathic medical schools training in allopathic programs continued to rise, increasing 7.9% from last year. Numbers of Hispanic and Asian graduates from US allopathic medical schools (USMDs) in graduate year 1 (GY1) positions increased numerically to 887 and 2356, respectively, and proportionally by 7.2% and 17.3%, respectively. Although the number of white USMDs in GY1 positions increased, their proportion decreased slightly among those with known race or ethnicity from 72.2% to 71.7%, and the number of black USMD GY1 residents, numbering 859, declined from the previous year. Although we observed an overall decline in the average number of on-duty hours expected of residents in their first year in a program (from 55 in 1996-1997 to 54 in 2000-2001; P<.001), the average number of hours reported by the majority of programs that typically report the most on-duty hours did not decrease. The issues of resident work hours and the diversity and specialty distribution of the physician workforce continue to foster debate.

### Does long-term recreational gymnastics prevent injurious falls in older women? A prospective 20-year follow-up [^9c140501]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this study are the long follow-up time and comprehensive evaluation of participants’ specific history in recreational gymnastics (determined in 10-year periods from the age of 16 to 45 years, and 5-year periods thereafter including duration and number of sessions per week, training months and years). The eligibility of controls as being sedentary was verified by their answers to the same questions. In addition, injurious falls were verified from medical records, which increased the reliability of the data. The types of injuries and the treatment provided were well described in the records, including the most severe traumas with exact ICD-codes, but the location (e.g. outdoors/indoors) or circumstances of the fall were not always mentioned.

One limitation of the study is that while the recreational gymnasts had exercised an average of 33 years at baseline in 1997, we had no information about their physical activity, participation in gymnastics, physical performance or mobility status after the 6-year follow-up in 2003. It is possible that participants’ physical activity and performance have declined with aging, chronic diseases, other incident health problems have increased or social issues changed, but we have no measured data to support this phenomenon. Physical activity was not recorded systematically in the medical records, nor was physical performance or functioning. However, we decided not to invite the former participants to the 20-year follow-up measurements because it was expected that only the women in good physical condition would have been able to participate, and this would have biased the analyses.

### An interactive problem-solving approach to teach traumatology for medical students [^924d8654]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Subjects

Seven tutorials, having 5-9 students each, were given to fourth year medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, Auckland, New Zealand (3 tutorials) and subsequently to fifth year students at the Faculty of Medicine, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (4 tutorials) during the period of 1997-2001. Students were exposed to the tutor for the first time, had limited knowledge of trauma and had been used to a traditional, didactic approach to teaching and learning medicine. Significant student participation was expected and encouraged. A total of 50 students have attended these tutorials.

At the end of tutorial sessions, a reproduced self-administered questionnaire was utilized to gain students' feedback. This questionnaire consisted of 16 validated items focusing on the educational tool, tutor-based skills, and student-centered skills (Table 2). These items were selected from the Student Evaluations of Courses and Teaching booklet, Centre for Professional Development, Auckland University. The advised number of items to be selected was 9 to 19 depending on what is needed to be evaluated. Areas selected were attitude with students, audiovisual aids, communication skills, motivation, and organization. Students anonymously rated items on a 7 point Likert-type scale. 15 items had the scale of (1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = mediocre, 4 = acceptable, 5 = good, 6 = very good, and 7 = outstanding). Only one attribute (pace of presentation) was different (1 = too slow, 4 = just right, 7 = much too fast). Space was also provided for open-ended comments to the question "what did you like most about this person's lecturing?"

### Medical student teaching and recruiting: 50 years of balancing two educational aims [^bc5f56e2]. Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Family medicine (FM) undergraduate medical educators have had two distinct missions, to increase the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of all students while also striving to attract students to the field of family medicine. A five decade literature search was conducted gathering FM curricular innovations and the parallel trends in FM medical student interest. Student interest in FM had a rapid first-decade rise to 14%, a second 1990's surge, followed by a drop to the current plateau of 8-9%. This falls far short of the 30-50% generalist benchmark needed to fill the country's health care needs. Curricular innovations fall into three periods: Charismatic Leaders &amp; Clinical Exposures (1965-1978), Creation of Clerkships of FM (1979-1998) and Curricular Innovations (1998-present). There is good evidence that having a required third-year clerkship positively impacts student interest in the field, however there is little research regarding the recruitment impact of specific clerkship curricula. Other tools associated with student interest include programming geared towards primary care or rural training and extracurricular opportunities such as FM Interest Groups. Strategic plans to improve the primary care work force should focus funding and legislative efforts on effective methods such as: establishing and maintaining FM clerkships, admitting students with rural and underserved backgrounds or primary care interest, developing longitudinal primary care tracks, and supporting extracurricular FM activities. Rigorous research is needed to assess how best to utilize limited educational resources to ensure that all students graduate with a core set of FM competence as well as an increased FM matriculation.

### Evaluation of a cancer prevention and detection curriculum for medical students [^346234bf]. Preventive Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Undergraduate medical education needs revision to ensure that medical students graduate with the skills necessary to assist their patients in cancer prevention and detection. We sought to implement and incorporate a cancer education curriculum into the students' core curriculum and to assess their skill levels prior to (1996), during (1997), and at the peak (1998-1999) of the incorporation of new hours.

Methods

We conducted pretest and posttest surveys of students at Boston University School of Medicine (medical student years 1-4) enrolled in each of the four study years (1996-1999). A total of 1,956 surveys (response rate, 82%) were completed. The primary outcome measure was the student's self-reported skill level (with responses ranging from 1 (very unskilled) to 5 (very skilled)) for counseling for tobacco cessation, tobacco prevention, and sun protection and for the early detection of breast, skin, and cervical cancer. Mean scores were computed for each chronological year of the study and medical school year. Differences and trends over time in mean scores of students in each medical school year were evaluated using multiple regression analysis.

Results

The number of hours of cancer education increased from 6 in 1996 to 15 in 1999. Strong improvements in self-rated skill levels were recorded for four of the six measures. In particular, tobacco cessation counseling skill rose from 2.16 (1996) to 3.13 (1999) for second year students (P < 0.001) and from 3.27 (1996) to 4.17 (1999) for fourth year students (P < 0.001). Among fourth year students, the percentage reporting that cancer prevention was given too little emphasis declined from 62% (1996) to 26% (1999) (P < 0.001), suggesting that the expanded curriculum reflected the students' preferences.

Conclusions

Cancer education can be interwoven into the existing medical school curriculum and produce improvements in students' skill levels for counseling and examinations. Strategies to enhance prevention teaching can use this model.

### Does participation in an epidemiological study improve appropriate prescription of screening mammography for asymptomatic women? [^bdf80a2f]. Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

To analyze the effect of participating in an epidemiological study on quality of care (i.e., appropriate prescription of mammographic screening), we have analyzed data collected in the framework of a cross-sectional study conducted in Italy among women attending menopause clinics.

Methods

In 1997, a large cross-sectional study was organized on the characteristics of women who attended a network of first-level outpatient clinics for general counseling about menopause or treatment of menopausal symptoms. Women consecutively observed during the study were eligible, and the protocol did not set any exclusion criteria. All women who agreed to participate underwent a gynecological examination and were asked about their general characteristics and lifestyle habits, reproductive and menstrual history, and selected medical history. Laboratory and instrumental tests were required on clinical grounds; the protocol did not consider any test mandatory for all women, but all centers were asked to collect information on the examinations prescribed as routine clinical practice. The study began in 1997 in 25 centers. By March 1999, the number of centers had increased to 268 of which 63 were in the north, 81 in the center, and 124 in the south of Italy. Fewer than 3% of eligible women refused to participate. The study included 48,444 women. The present analysis looked at current attitudes toward screening mammography (SM) in asymptomatic women, as prescribed by gynecologists in menopausal centers in Italy.

Results

A SM was correctly requested in 55.6% of women who entered the study during the second semester of 1997. This rose to 72.8% by July-August 2000. The correct prescription of a SM was slightly higher in current users of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) and lower in women aged 45-50 years, the differences being significant (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

These results show that appropriate requests for SM increased in centers participating in a collaborative epidemiological study on menopause in Italy over a 3-year period.

### Breast cancer mortality in neighbouring European countries with different levels of screening but similar access to treatment: trend analysis of WHO mortality database [^41d7baec]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

The Netherlands and Belgium

In the Netherlands, a national organised mammography screening programme was initiated in 1989 (table 1). After gradual implementation, the programme reached full coverage in 1997.Women aged 50-69 are invited to mammography every two years, and since 1998 women aged 70-74 are also invited. Figure 2shows that participation in screening gradually increased from 1989 to 1996, and after 1997 it has remained constant at around 70-79%. Non-organised screening is uncommon.

Fig 2 Participation in mammography screening and age adjusted (European standardised rates) breast cancer mortality in women of all ages in the Netherlands and Belgium

In Belgium, breast screening was left to the discretion of the women and doctors until 2001, after which a national screening programme was established. Population surveys before 1999 suggested that less than 30% of women in the 50-69 year age group had undergone mammography during the past two years (for screening or diagnostic purposes).Around 2000, about 30% of women aged 50-69 had undergone screening or diagnostic mammography in the past two years.By around 2005 this proportion had increased to about 59% (fig 2). At that time two thirds of screening examinations were done as part of the organised programme in Flanders, and for less than one sixth in Brussels and Wallonia. Participation in screening (organised and non-organised) in Flanders was low until about 2002-3, and by 2004-6 it was still below the coverage in the Netherlands in 1997 (fig 2).

In the Netherlands the overall reduction in breast cancer mortality from 1989 to 2006 was slightly greater than in Belgium (25.0% v 19.9%) but did not differ noticeably from Flanders (25.0% v 24.6%; table 2 and fig 2).

### A randomized controlled trial to improve the success of women assistant professors [^9f846abd]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

(3) Department/division and institutional leader engagement

The joint principal investigators of the trial worked closely with the dean, vice-deans, chairs, and chiefs to generate top-down support and accountability for change. An NIH-TAC Trial research team investigator met with each chair or chief of the intervention departments/divisions every 6 months for the duration of the trial to elicit their feedback and continued full participation. The two primary responsibilities of these intervention senior leaders within their departments/divisions were (1) to encourage the full participation of intervention women assistant professors in the trial faculty professional development initiatives and (2) to oversee and support the task force process. In addition, an intervention summit was held each year in which intervention chairs/chiefs were brought together with task force members along with senior leaders in the medical school, to report on progress and learn from each other.

Control group

All chairs/chiefs of eligible departments/divisions agreed to participate before randomization. Both control and intervention leaders understood the randomization scheme and trial methods. After obtaining their consent, the research team did not contact the control chairs/chiefs during the ensuing 3-year trial. There were no interventions in the 14 departments/divisions in the control group or for the women assistant professors in those units. The research team's only contact with the control faculty after randomization was at the end of the study when post-intervention questionnaires and updated curricula vitae (CV) with grant information were requested from the women assistant professors in both control and intervention groups.

Outcomes

Publications and grants

Intervention and control group women assistant professors submitted updated CVs at the beginning and end of the trial. Research assistants, blinded to participant status, abstracted information that included duration in rank, academic track, and information on publications and grants. Two study authors reviewed random samples of CVs and assessed abstraction and coding accuracy. The few differences (<10%) were resolved by consensus. Information on publications included year, first-author status, and whether the publication was classified as peer reviewed. Information on grants included funding organization, dates, and faculty role (principal investigator vs. other). A participant's grant status was classified as improved if any of the following criteria were met comparing the baseline (pre-intervention) and post-intervention CVs: (1) increase in total number of grants; (2) increase in federally funded grants; or (3) increase in number of grants in which the participant was the principal investigator.

### Immediate and delayed effects of mammographic screening on breast cancer mortality and incidence in birth cohorts [^2f2d2c25]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The Dutch screening programme

In 1989, the implementation of the population-based biennial mammography screening programme in the Netherlands started, inviting all women aged 50–69 years. The geographic coverage of the screening programme increased from 11% in 1990, to 26% in 1991, 48% in 1992, 69% in 1993, 77% in 1994, 88% in 1995 and to its full capacity in 1996. The attendance during this implementation period increased from 72.5% in 1990 to 80.1% in 1997; thereafter, it remained stable at around 80%. In 1997, the screening programme was extended to include women aged 70–74 years. The geographic coverage of the screening programme of the age group of 70–74 years increased from 26% in 1998, to 86% in 1999, 91% in 2000 and to its full coverage in 2001. Furthermore, the percentage of definite non-participants, that is, those who do not wish to receive further invitations to participate in the screening programme, has always been low (2.0–7.5%). From mid-2004 to 2010, there was a transition from screen-film mammography to digital mammography.

### Sun exposure and sun protection behaviours among Australian adolescents: trends over time [^a60e288f]. Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This study compared the sun exposure and sun protection behaviours of adolescent students between 1993 and 1999.

Methods

Schools from all Australian states and the two territories participated in each of the 1993, 1996, and 1999 surveys and a sample of students from years 7 to 12 were surveyed. In each of the states and territories a random sample of schools was selected within each education sector (government, Catholic, independent). The questionnaire was a self-completed booklet with questions about sunburn history during the previous summer, tan preferences, skin-type, and usual reported behaviour. Data from a total of 78,032 students were available for analysis.

Results

From 1993 to 1999 there was a significant increase in the number of students reporting sunburn during the previous summer (chi(2) = 225.77, df = 2, P < 0.01). However, the percentage of students who preferred no tan at all increased over the same period (chi(2) = 184.47, df = 2, P < 0.01). The percentage of students who usually or always wore clothing that covered most of their body decreased between 1993 and 1999 (chi(2) = 20.46, df = 2, P < 0.01); the percentage of students usually or always wearing maximum protection sunscreen decreased over time (chi(2) = 27.71, df = 2, P < 0.01). Staying in the shade increased from 1993 (26%) to 1996 (32%) but decreased slightly in 1999 (30%). Across all survey years, only 11% of students routinely followed all three protective behaviours of wearing a hat, sunscreen, and clothes that cover the body.

Conclusions

Sun protection practices among adolescents are still below optimal levels. Future educational programs require innovative approaches that aims to change attitudes toward tanning as being healthy and attractive and modify adolescent behaviours in relation to sun exposure.

### Advance consent for participation in acute stroke trials (ACTION): protocol for a feasibility study [^6926917a]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Primary outcome measures

Over 1 year, how many patients seen in the stroke clinic will be eligible to provide advance consent? Based on established data,we conservatively expect this number to be 800 patients.
Over 1 year, how many eligible patients will agree to participate in our feasibility study? Based on the fact that 51% of patients seen in the SPC agree to be contacted for research studies, we are estimating that 50% of eligible patients (400/800) will agree to participate in our study.
Among participants, how many will agree or strongly agree with this statement: ‘I believe it is appropriate to invite people at risk of stroke to provide or decline consent for participation in a clinical research trial in case they have a stroke’? We expect that 50% of participants of the 400 participants above (200) will agree. This expectation is based on studies of emergency department patients in which 45%–70%of respondents felt this is acceptable for emergency studies.
Among participants, how many will agree to provide advance consent for a specific stroke trial? Our expectation is that 200 (50%) will provide consent to at least one of the current active trials (3).
How many participants who provided advance consent for one or several trial(s) will be enrolled on that trial or another trial? Based on analysis of available data, we anticipate this number to be 5%–10% of eligible patients.

Secondary outcome measures

Proportion of participating patients that will still report that advance consent is acceptable after 1 year.
Proportion of patients who will withdraw their advance consent or withdraw from the feasibility study.
The reasons for patients’ decisions to provide or not provide advance consent, both at the time of initial assessment and at follow-up.
The male–female breakdown among patients agreeing to provide advance consent.
Proportion of patients who provide advance consent are enrolled on a trial using the advance consent.
Door-to-door randomisation times of patients enrolled on acute stroke trials with advance consent.
Given the number of enrolments into trials using advance consent and the cost of an advance consent programme, the cost per enrolment.
Feelings of staff in the emergency department and acute stroke team about enrolling via advance consent.
Experiences of clinic staff with identifying patients for consideration of advance consent

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^8d6b2ff7]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) epidemiology in infectious mononucleosis (IM) describes humans as the only source, with transmission “primarily through oral secretions,” including sharing cups or food or close contact such as sneezing, and notes an incubation period of EBV of 30–50 days. In children “<16 years old” with clinically diagnosed IM, “85.4% were because of EBV and 14.6% were because of cytomegalovirus (CMV).” In young adults “between 15 and 19 years old,” the annual symptomatic IM rate is “between 200 and 800 cases per 100,000.” Among freshmen, “30% to 50%” remain susceptible with an “annual incidence of 1% to 5%.” A United Kingdom study with “2325 participants” found “96.4% of women and 95.5% of men by age 20 to 25 years were seropositive for EBV,” and “each year increase in age corresponded to a 12% increase in the rate of seropositivity.” It also states that EBV is “not uncommon” to be unrecognized in children because symptoms are generally less severe than in older adults.

### Outcome of the AVID college preparatory program on adolescent health: a randomized trial [^4a566685]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Socio-demographic characteristics and intervention exposure: at baseline, students reported demographic (birthplace, home language, family structure, race and ethnicity) and parental characteristics (educational attainment, employment, birthplace), and whether they participated in AVID during middle school. At follow-up students reported whether they participated in AVID during the fall and spring semesters of ninth grade. Sex and grade point average came from eighth grade academic transcripts.

Analytic Strategy

T-test and χ 2 analyses compared demographic characteristics and baseline health behaviors across groups. Intent-to-treat analyses tested whether intervention students had improved outcomes relative to control students. We used multilevel mixed effects models to account for clustering within schools and control for baseline values of the outcome of interest. Psychosocial outcome measures were standardized on follow-up sample values with a mean of 0 and SD of 1. As prespecified, interaction terms tested whether effects were moderated by sex and, when significant, we estimated sex-stratified models. Our prespecified primary outcomes on which the study was powered was the difference in proportion of prosocial peers in the network and difference in 30-day marijuana use between AVID and Control groups at the end of 11th grade. Although we present interim findings from the end of ninth grade, we maintained these primary outcomes. We also examined the odds of naming a prosocial peer in the network and past-12 month substance use. Finally, similar to other studies seeking to measure negative peer influence,,, we tested whether naming an AVID student in the social network was associated with more risky networks and higher odds of substance use, violence, or delinquency for students in the high-performing comparison group. All outcome data were complete.

### One-and two-year predictors of decline in physical activity among inner-city schoolchildren [^4324ced5]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Alarming secular declines in physical activity (PA) have been observed among youth over the last decade. A better understanding of the predictors of these declines is crucial to identifying those children most at risk and to developing interventions that target youth before the onset of decline. This report identifies 1- and 2-year predictors of decline in PA among fourth- and fifth-grade students from inner-city neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada.

Methods

Data for this study were collected in classroom questionnaires each May/June from 1993 to 1997. Analyses for this paper were completed in 2001. The cohort included active (at least one PA per day) children with baseline and 1-year (n =1873) or 2-year (n =509) follow-up data.

Results

In boys, 1-year predictors of decline to an inactive status identified in generalized estimating equations analysis included moderate (vs high) baseline PA (odds ratio [OR]=1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.91-3.05); low PA self-efficacy (OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.03-2.71); born outside Canada (OR=2.13; 95% CI=1.31-3.46); Asian origin (OR=1.81; 95% CI=1.03-3.16) and no participation in school teams (OR=1.81, 95% CI=0.93-3.55). In girls, these 1-year predictors included moderate PA (OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.10-3.32); low PA self-efficacy (OR=1.70, 95% CI=1.15-2.49); watching four or more TV programs per day (OR=1.40, 95% CI=0.97-2.02); mother unemployed (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.07-2.23); and grade five (vs grade four) (OR=1.35, 95% CI=0.94-1.93). Two-year predictors in boys included moderate baseline PA (OR=2.52, 95% CI=0.84-7.50), and born outside Canada (OR=1.96, 95% CI=0.91-4.20). In girls, these 2-year predictors included moderate baseline PA (OR=2.75, 95% CI=1.01-7.49); no participation in school teams (OR=2.14, 95% CI=0.92-5.00); watching four or more TV programs per day (OR=1.93, 95% CI=0.99-3.74); and born outside Canada (OR=1.85, 95% CI=0.96-3.55).

Conclusions

Reduced TV viewing among girls and increased participation in school sports teams in boys and girls may prevent declines in PA among pre-adolescents from inner-city neighborhoods.

### An olfactory self-test effectively screens for COVID-19 [^6ccd32f5]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Recruitment

There was no systematic recruitment. We formed a small international consortium, and each participating lab tried to inform the local media in their country of residence. This resulted is several news stories published in several countries, and these led to dissemination. The success of the publicity varied greatly from country to country due to the resources available to participating labs and to public disposition. Participants were directed to the web-tool atwhere they consented to participate anonymously in a study that was approved by the Wolfson Hospital Helsinki Committee (Approval #0066-20-WOMC). We note that during the initial reported time period we had 12,800 participants, but of these 780 participants reported only partial data, retaining only 12,020 participants for full analysis. In a reported follow-up we then analyzed an added 1464 participants, culminating at 13,484 participants. This study size reflected a balance between two considerations: Web-based questionnaires on odor intensity and pleasantness gain sufficient power at 198 participants per odorant. We wanted this power for at least 40 odorants, and indeed here report on 42 odorants with more than 198 respondents. In turn, we did not wait for this number of respondents on all possible odorants, as we wanted to report on this in a timely manner, given the progression of the pandemic.

### Hiring of diagnostic radiologists in 1998 [^c029211c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine the 1998 hiring activities of physician practices with respect to diagnostic radiologists.

Materials and Methods

A survey was mailed to a sample of 970 radiology practices in the spring through fall of 1999; 73.0% responded. Responses were weighted to represent all practices in the United States providing diagnostic radiology services. Findings were compared with results of similar surveys from previous years.

Results

In 1998, multiradiologist groups sought to hire 2299 (+/-148 [standard error]) diagnostic radiologists, an increase of 20% from 1977. Positions offered in 1998 were split almost equally between expansion positions and replacements for those who had left a practice. Another 422 (+/-58) positions had been vacated that practices did not seek to refill. In 1998, 621 (+/-57) diagnostic radiologists left active practice, which is more than the usual number of approximately 400 annually but less than the approximately 800 of 1996 and 1997. There was no significant association between hiring activity and the self-perceived effect of managed care on a group.

Conclusion

The pace of hiring and turnover of diagnostic radiologists increased in 1998. Positions available continue to exceed radiologists available to fill them; the excess was approximately 330 positions, which is not significantly different from the excess reported for 1997, but is higher than the (not statistically significant) net shortfall of 51 positions estimated for 1996.

### Youth problem behaviors 8 years after implementing the communities that care prevention system: a community-randomized trial [^8f20338d]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Community-based efforts to prevent adolescent problem behaviors are essential to promote public health and achieve collective impact community wide. OBJECTIVE To test whether the Communities That Care (CTC) prevention system reduced levels of risk and adolescent problem behaviors community wide 8 years after implementation of CTC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A community-randomized trial was performed in 24 small towns in 7 states, matched within state, assigned randomly to a control or intervention group in 2003. All fifth-grade students attending public schools in study communities in 2003-2004 who received consent from their parents to participate (76.4% of the eligible population) were included. A panel of 4407 fifth graders was surveyed through 12th grade, with 92.5% of the sample participating at the last follow-up.

Interventions

A coalition of community stakeholders received training and technical assistance to install CTC, used epidemiologic data to identify elevated risk factors and depressed protective factors for adolescent problem behaviors in the community, and implemented tested and effective programs for youths aged 10 to 14 years as well as their families and schools to address their community's elevated risks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Levels of targeted risk; sustained abstinence, and cumulative incidence by grade 12; and current prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use, delinquency, and violence in 12th grade.

Results

By spring of 12th grade, students in CTC communities were more likely than students in control communities to have abstained from any drug use (adjusted risk ratio [ARR]= 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63), drinking alcohol (ARR= 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.58), smoking cigarettes (ARR= 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27), and engaging in delinquency (ARR= 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36). They were also less likely to ever have committed a violent act (ARR= 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98). There were no significant differences by intervention group in targeted risks, the prevalence of past-month or past-year substance use, or past-year delinquency or violence.

Conclusions and Relevance

Using the CTC system continued to prevent the initiation of adolescent problem behaviors through 12th grade, 8 years after implementation of CTC and 3 years after study-provided resources ended, but did not produce reductions in current levels of risk or current prevalence of problem behavior in 12th grade.

### Adolescent sexual behavior during periods of increase and decrease in the abortion rate [^ed74317e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To study changes in adolescent sexual behavior in periods of increase (1994-2000) and decrease (2001-2007) in the abortion rate.

Methods

School surveys with self-administered questionnaires were carried out annually among eighth graders (mean age 14.8 years) and ninth graders (mean age 15.8 years) (N=286,665) in 1996/1997 and 2006/2007. Schools participated biennially. The proportions of respondents reporting noncoital (kissing, light petting, heavy petting) and coital (ever had sexual intercourse, intercourse at least 10 times, at least three partners) sexual experience and nonuse of contraception were studied.

Results

Among adolescents, both coital and noncoital sexual experiences and the proportion of those not using contraception increased between 1996-1997 and 2000-2001 (P for trend <.01, all) and decreased from 2000-2001 onward (P<.001, all), except the proportion of at least 10 coital events, which did not decrease. Among sexually experienced adolescents, a similar increase in coital experiences (intercourse at least 10 times from 38.2% to 41.5%, at least three partners from 27.8% to 30.7%, P<.001) and in not using contraception (from 17.2% to 19.1%, P=.002) was seen before 2000-2001, but after that the only significant change was a further increase in the proportion of those reporting intercourse at least 10 times (from 41.5% to 47.8%, P<.001).

Conclusion

The proportion of adolescents reporting noncoital sexual experiences, intercourse, or not using contraception increased in the 1990s and decreased in the 2000s, reflecting the changes in the abortion rate. However, as the abortion rate decreased, the intensity of sexual activity further increased among sexually experienced adolescents, suggesting that the fall in the abortion rate may be due to contraception and more effective sexual education.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^e7dfdee8]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Public health approaches—school-based nutrition policies and outcomes: Many U.S. children obtain a large proportion of daily energy in school, and competitive foods often are not required to meet dietary standards; preliminary efforts that improved nutrition standards with physical activity and education may have begun to affect overweight rates. In a multicomponent school nutrition policy initiative that randomized 10 schools in which at least 50 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price meals, after 2 years, among 1,349 initially fourth- through sixth-graders, there was a 50 percent reduction in the incidence of overweight and the prevalence of overweight was also lower in intervention schools, while no differences were observed in the incidence, prevalence, or remission of obesity at 2-year follow-up. The findings suggest to the Expert Panel that public health approaches to overweight may have significant impact but that more intensive intervention may be needed for obese children, and that public health approaches can increase supportive environments for fruit and vegetable intake.

School nursing—medical changes and staffing needs—are characterized by rising survival of extremely preterm infants and increasing chronic conditions among students, creating higher demand for services and qualified staffing. Survival rates of preterm infants have increased to more than 80% at 26 weeks' gestation and to more than 90% after 27 weeks' gestation, with associated increases in disabilities and learning or behavioral problems. Chronic illness burdens include, in 2010, 215,000 people younger than 20 years with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, rising food allergy prevalence from 3.4% in 1997–1999 to 5.1% in 2009–2011, and asthma affecting an average of 1 in 10 school-aged children with more than 13 million missed school days per year. When a school nurse is not available at all times, national organizations recommend that delegated, unlicensed assistive personnel be trained and supervised to deliver specific school health services under the guidance of a registered nurse. Policy has previously supported ratios of 1 school nurse to 750 students in healthy populations and 1:225 for those requiring daily professional nursing services, but the use of a ratio for workload determination in school nursing is described as inadequate to meet increasingly complex student health needs.

### Risk factors for type 2 diabetes in a sixth-grade multiracial cohort: the HEALTHY study [^1eb49f2a]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

HEALTHY is a 3-year middle school intervention program designed to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes risk factors at baseline in a cohort of 6,358 sixth-grade students is reported.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Forty-two schools at seven U.S. sites were randomly assigned to intervention or control. Students participated in baseline data collection during fall of 2006.

RESULTS

Overall, 49.3% of children had BMI ≥85th percentile, 16.0% had fasting blood glucose ≥100 mg/dl (<1% had fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dl), and 6.8% had fasting insulin ≥30 μU/ml. Hispanic youth were more likely to have BMI, glucose, and insulin levels above these thresholds than blacks and whites.

CONCLUSIONS

Sixth-grade students in schools with large minority populations have high levels of risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The HEALTHY intervention was designed to modify these risk factors to reduce diabetes incidence.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^5814af6d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Healthy People 2020 objectives—Physical activity (PA) among children and adolescents set targets to increase the proportion of adolescents who meet current federal physical activity guidelines for aerobic physical activity and for muscle-strengthening activity, to increase the proportion of the nation’s public and private schools that require daily physical education for all students, and to increase the proportion of adolescents who participated in daily school physical education. School recess objectives are to increase regularly scheduled elementary school recess in the United States by increasing the number of states and the proportion of school districts that require regularly scheduled elementary school recess and to increase the proportion of school districts that require or recommend elementary school recess for an appropriate period of time. Sedentary behavior goals are to increase the proportion of children and adolescents who do not exceed recommended limits for screen time and to increase the proportion of those aged 2 years through 12th grade who view television, videos, or play video games for no more than 2 hours a day. Community access objectives seek to increase the proportion of the nation’s public and private schools that provide access to their physical activity spaces and facilities for all persons outside of normal school hours. Active transport goals are to increase the proportion of trips made by walking, with children and adolescents aged 5–15 years making trips to school of ≤1 mile, and to increase the proportion of trips made by bicycling, with children and adolescents aged 5–15 years making trips to school of ≤2 miles.

### Assessment of a program for SARS-CoV-2 screening and environmental monitoring in an urban public school district [^07f51810]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

During late 2020, most northern hemisphere countries experienced their most severe COVID-19 epidemic waves. Athough many factors may have contributed to the acceleration of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the fall, the return of minors to congregate school settings was temporally associated with the initiation of increased community transmission.Overall, direct data demonstrating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among school-aged children within communities remain limited.Many experts and public health authorities have urged communities to resume full-time in-person learning, citing the absence of school-associated case clusters and the lower rate of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses among school-age children vs adults.,, However, despite the lower rates of confirmed infections among youths, results of serologic surveys suggest that current symptom-based testing and tracing likely miss a large proportion of COVID-19 cases, especially in children and adolescents.Data through November 2020 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 serologic survey revealed that persons aged 17 years or younger had the highest proportion of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of any age group in 23 of 28 states (82.1%) providing data.Outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools have been well documented,including a large outbreak in a school in Israel with infection rates of 13% among students and 17% among staff.

### Chlamydia positivity in New Orleans public high schools, 1996-2005: implications for clinical and public health practices [^cccad24d]. Academic Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the trends in chlamydia positivity among New Orleans high school students tested in a schoolwide screening between 1996 and 2005, and to determine factors associated with chlamydia positivity among students during the 10-year period.

Methods

Between school years 1995-1996 and 2004-2005, students in New Orleans public high schools were tested for chlamydia using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in urine specimens (LCx assay until 1999-2000; BD assay from 2000-2001 to 2004-2005). For each year, we calculated chlamydia positivity by dividing the number of students testing positive by the total number of students tested. Data were analyzed separately by gender. Logistic regressions were performed to determine independent predictors of chlamydia positivity during the 10-year period.

Results

Between 1996 and 2005, the average chlamydia positivity was 7.0% (95% confidence interval 6.6-7.4) in boys and 13.1% (95% confidence interval 12.6-13.7) in girls (P < .001). Chlamydia detection increased with the switch from LCx to BD assay. In multivariate analyses, chlamydia positivity among boys and girls was significantly associated with age, black race, and gonorrhea coinfection. Additionally, positivity was significantly different by school year among boys (P = .03) and by NAAT used among girls (P = .008).

Conclusions

The trends in chlamydia positivity observed between 1996 and 2005 more likely reflected a high and stable prevalence of chlamydia in the New Orleans school-age adolescent population. Any benefit of screening on individuals tested was likely to be mitigated by participants' uninterrupted social interactions with the dynamic forces that sustain the sexual transmission of chlamydia in the population.

### ACOG committee statement no. 9: ethical considerations for increasing inclusivity in research participants [^bf6d042d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Ethical informed consent and inclusion of people who can become pregnant—Ethical implementation of a research protocol requires an appropriate informed consent process that ensures autonomous decision making, and researchers have an obligation to disclose and discuss with prospective participants all material risks, including all material risks to fetuses or potential future children; disclosure should include risks that are likely to affect an individual’s decision to participate or not to participate, and participation in studies with greater than minimal risk requires careful consideration. Imposing a heavier burden of consideration on people who could become pregnant, who could have become pregnant, who are lactating, or who identify as women ahead of participation in studies represents a structural barrier to equal inclusion and should be avoided, and respect for autonomous decision making by all people, whether they can become pregnant or not, avoids imposing unethical obstacles to research participation. Researchers should be cautioned to avoid the therapeutic misconception in decision making; because informed consent cannot anticipate all conceivable risks, participants must be made aware that should they develop unanticipated complications during the research, they should contact the researcher or a representative of the IRB immediately, individuals should be informed of all available therapeutic options, and when people who could become pregnant or are pregnant have been exposed to more than minimal risk, they should be encouraged to participate in any available follow-up evaluations to assess the effects on themselves and on their future children.

### Effect of school-based body mass index reporting in California public schools: a randomized clinical trial [^1f321fab]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Annually, US schools screen millions of students' body mass index (BMI) and report the results to parents, with little experimental evidence on potential benefits and harms.

Objective

To determine the impact of school-based BMI reporting on weight status and adverse outcomes (weight stigmatization and weight-related perceptions and behaviors) among a diverse student population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cluster randomized clinical trial. The Fit Study (2014-2017) randomized 79 California schools to BMI screening and reporting (group 1), BMI screening only (group 2), or control (no BMI screening or reporting [group 3]) in grades 3 to 8. The setting was California elementary and middle schools. Students in grades 3 to 7 at baseline participated for up to 3 years. A modified intent-to-treat protocol was used. Data analysis was conducted from April 13, 2017, to March 26, 2020.

Interventions

School staff assessed BMI each spring among students in groups 1 and 2. Parents of students in group 1 were sent a BMI report each fall for up to 2 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes in BMI z score and in adverse outcomes (based on surveys conducted each fall among students in grades 4 to 8) from baseline to 1 and 2 years of follow-up.

Results

A total of 28 641 students (14 645 [51.1%] male) in grades 3 to 7 at baseline participated in the study for up to 3 years. Among 6534 of 16 622 students with a baseline BMI in the 85th percentile or higher (39.3%), BMI reporting had no effect on BMI z score change (-0.003; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.01 at 1 year and 0.01; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03 at 2 years). Weight dissatisfaction increased more among students having BMI screened at school (8694 students in groups 1 and 2) than among control participants (5674 students in group 3). Results of the effect of BMI reporting on other adverse outcomes were mixed: compared with the control (group 3), among students weighed at school (groups 1 and 2), weight satisfaction declined more after 2 years (-0.11; 95% CI, -0.18 to -0.05), and peer weight talk increased more after 1 year (0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.09); however, concerning weight control behaviors declined more after 1 year (-0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

Body mass index reports alone do not improve children's weight status and may decrease weight satisfaction. To improve student health, schools should consider investing resources in evidence-based interventions.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^95ae4448]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology—incidence and trends in U.S. children and adolescents: It is estimated that 1.1 million to 1.9 million recreational concussions and sport-related concussions (SRCs) occur annually in children 18 years or younger, and historically up to 3.8 million occur annually at all ages in the United States. Concussion incidence and reporting have increased over the last 2 decades, with high school athletes showing an increase in SRCs from 0.12 in 1000 athletic exposures (AEs) in 1997–1998 to 0.51 in 1000 AEs in 2011–2012; an AE means participation in some or all of 1 practice or 1 game. Emergency department visits for recreational concussions and SRCs have also increased over the last decade, ranging from 57% to more than 200% in the 8- to 19-year-old age group, and concussions in pediatric and adolescent age groups account for the majority of SRCs because of the large number of youth and high school sport participants.

### School-based programmes for preventing smoking [^7dc71fe6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Smoking rates in adolescents are rising in some countries. Helping young people to avoid starting smoking is a widely endorsed goal of public health, but there is uncertainty about how to do this. Schools provide a route for communicating with a large proportion of young people, and school-based programmes for smoking prevention have been widely developed and evaluated.

Objectives

To review all randomized controlled trials of behavioural interventions in schools to prevent children (aged 5 to12) and adolescents (aged 13 to18) starting smoking.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyclNFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Health Star, Dissertation Abstracts and studies identified in the bibliographies of articles. Individual MEDLINE searches were made for 133 authors who had undertaken randomized controlled trials in this area.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: those in which individual students, classes, schools, or school districts were randomized to the intervention or control groups and followed for at least six months.

Types Of Participants

Children (aged 5 to12) or adolescents (aged 13 to18) in school settings. Types of interventions: Classroom programmes or curricula, including those with associated family and community interventions, intended to deter use of tobacco. We included programmes or curricula that provided information, those that used social influences approaches, those that taught generic social competence, and those that included interventions beyond the school into the community. We included programmes with a drug or alcohol focus if outcomes for tobacco use were reported. Types of outcome measures: Prevalence of non-smoking at follow up among those not smoking at baseline. We did not require biochemical validation of self-reported tobacco use for study inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed whether identified citations were randomized controlled trials. We assessed the quality of design and execution, and abstracted outcome data. Because of the marked heterogeneity of design and outcomes, we computed pooled estimates only for those trials that could be analyzed together and for which statistical data were available. We predominantly synthesized the data using narrative systematic review. We grouped studies by intervention method (information; social competence; social influences; combined social influences/social competence; multi-modal programmes). Within each group, we placed them into three categories (low, medium and high risk of bias) according to validity using quality criteria for reported study design.

Main Results

Of the 94 randomized controlled trials identified, we classified 23 as category one (most valid). There was one category one study of information-giving and two of teaching social comeptence. There were thirteen category one studies of social influences interventions. Of these, nine found some positive effect of intervention on smoking prevalence, and four failed to detect an effect on smoking prevalence. The largest and most rigorous study, the Hutchinson Smoking Prevention Project, found no long-term effect of an intensive eight-year programme on smoking behaviour. There were three category one RCTs of combined social influences and social competence interventions: one provided significant results and one only for instruction by health educators compared to self-instruction. There was a lack of high quality evidence about the effectiveness of combinations of social influences and social competence approaches. There was one category one study providing data on social influences compared with information giving. There were four category one studies of multi-modal approaches but they provided limited evidence about the effectiveness of multi-modal approaches including community initiatives.

Authors' Conclusions

There is one rigorous test of the effects of information-giving about smoking. There are well-conducted randomized controlled trials to test the effects of social influences interventions: in half of the group of best quality studies those in the intervention group smoke less than those in the control, but many studies failed to detect an effect of the intervention. There are only three high quality RCTs which test the effectiveness of combinations of social influences and social competence interventions, and four which test multi-modal interventions; half showed significant positive results.

### Weight-gain reduction among 2-year college students: the CHOICES RCT [^9ddae151]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The young adult years have been recognized as an influential period for excess weight gain. Non-traditional students and those attending 2-year community colleges are at particularly high risk for a range of adverse weight-related outcomes.

Design

Choosing Healthy Options in College Environments and Settings was an RCT with students randomly assigned into a control or intervention condition after baseline assessment. The study was designed to evaluate if a 24-month weight-gain prevention intervention reduces the expected increase in BMI and overweight prevalence in young adults attending 2-year colleges. Two cohorts were recruited, corresponding to the fall and spring semesters. Data collection occurred at four time points for each cohort, with baseline occurring in fall 2011 for Cohort 1 and spring 2012 for Cohort 2. The 24-month follow-up occurred in fall 2013 for Cohort 1 and spring 2014 for Cohort 2. Data analysis occurred in 2015-2016.

Setting/Participants

This research was conducted with 441 students from three community colleges in Minnesota.

Intervention

The 24-month intervention began with a 1-credit college course on healthy weight behaviors. A social networking and social support website was introduced as part of the course and participation encouraged for the duration of the trial.

Main Outcome Measures

Changes in BMI, weight, body fat percentage, waist circumference, and weight status were assessed.

Results

Retention of the cohorts at 24 months was 83.4%. There was not a statistically significant difference in BMI between conditions at the end of the trial. However, there was a statically significant difference in the prevalence of overweight/obesity between treatment conditions at 24 months. Also, participants randomized to the intervention who were overweight or obese at baseline were more than three times as likely to transition to a healthy weight by the end of the trial as compared with control students.

Conclusions

The intervention was not successful in achieving BMI differences between treatment groups. However, an 8% reduction in the prevalence of overweight and obesity over time may have population-level significance.

Trial Registration

This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01134783.

Main Results

Of the 76 randomised controlled trials identified, we classified 16 as category one (most valid). There were no category one studies of information giving alone. There were fifteen category one studies of social influences interventions. Of these, eight showed some positive effect of intervention on smoking prevalence, and seven failed to detect an effect on smoking prevalence. The largest and most rigorous study, the Hutchinson Smoking Prevention Project, found no long-term effect of an intensive 8-year programme on smoking behaviour. There was a lack of high quality evidence about the effectiveness of combinations of social influences and social competence approaches.

There are well-conducted randomised controlled trials to test the effects of social influences interventions: in half of the group of best quality studies those in the intervention group smoke less than those in the control, but many studies showed no effect of the intervention. There is a lack of high-quality evidence about the effectiveness of combinations of social influences and social competence interventions, and of multi-modal programmes that include community interventions.

### Exercise and fall prevention: narrowing the research-to-practice gap and enhancing integration of clinical and community practice [^4edcf3f3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Few Comprehensive Community Programs Are Available

Although community service providers may wish to sponsor fall prevention programs, they often do not have adequate knowledge of best practices in fall prevention 29 nor do they have the expertise to support program implementation (e.g. determining the cost and financing for the intervention, training instructors, and monitoring fidelity of intervention delivery). In addition, most CDC‐compiled interventions do not provide an implementation plan with details on program installation, instructor training requirements, class conduct, or program fidelity and adaptation. Consequently, the majority of the interventions are not easily accessible, readily available, or widely disseminated to local communities (Table 1).

Clinicians and Community Providers Do Not Connect

Although it seems obvious that maximizing the impact of any intervention relies primarily on clinicians referring patients to existing community‐based programs, little effort has been made to bridge the communication gap between clinicians and community service providers. Most communities have no coordinated system that allows clinicians to determine what specific interventions are available, which would be the best fit for a particular patient, or whether a patient has enrolled in and completed a program. Similarly, community providers have no standard means to gauge potential demand for specific interventions and generally have offered programs using an “if you build it, they will come” approach rather than responding to a clear need identified by healthcare professionals. These gaps have made implementation of any proven intervention challenging for clinicians and community service providers.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^67d29025]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Step 1: Increasing what is feasible

If the trial was originally envisaged as enrolling patients from a single centre, city, region or country, with specific eligibility criteria, and following patients up for a specific period, it is important to consider how broadening the collaboration, making the eligibility criteria more inclusive and extending the follow-up could help to make the trial feasible.

Increasing accrual time and/or follow-up time

Extending the follow-up time typically can increase the information content from a randomised trial and is particularly relevant for time-to-event data, where the sample size is determined by the number of events, rather than the number of patients.

Broadening eligibility criteria

Investigators should reconsider eligibility criteria, treatments etc. to see if more participants can be entered into the trial. If eligibility criteria can be broadened while retaining patient safety and applicability of the plausible effect, then doing so is a good step. The research question of the trial itself may be altered by doing so: the patient group for whom the RCT provides an internal result is broadened. This may impact in a number of ways on how the result generalises outside of a RCT.

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^c09677e8]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Technical remarks—combination strategies, cutoffs, and sequential approach: Very few studies are available that have solely compared the combination of serum biomarkers to a single biomarker; simple single blood-based NILDA such as APRI, FIB-4, and NFS with upper and lower cutoffs (e.g., FIB-4 1.3–2.67) are available, and 2-step cutoffs categorization can better classify patients according to fibrosis severity. Analyses supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates with quality of evidence judged to be low; for identifying patients with NAFLD advanced fibrosis, AASLD recommended a sequential approach with FIB-4 followed by imaging NILDA or ELF in FIB-4 ≥ 1.3 when available.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^245a28cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Health literacy—effects on outcomes and vulnerable populations—Limited health literacy is ubiquitous, and a growing body of literature demonstrates a correlation between health literacy and health outcomes. Adults with low health literacy are at increased risk of hospitalization, encounter barriers to accessing health services, and are less likely to understand medical advice, and individuals with limited health literacy skills have poorer health status than those with adequate skills. This is often the case with older patients and those with limited or no English proficiency, and in the United States, seniors 65 years and older use 30% of prescription drugs and 40% of over-the-counter drugs, with significant risks and consequences posed to the senior population by inadequate comprehension of information on medication labels. Low health literacy also may be a problem for immigrant populations for whom English is a second language, and according to a California survey, 25% of College Fellows reported that one quarter of their patients have limited English proficiency, and 38% reported an increase in patients with limited English proficiency during the preceding 5 years. Individuals with low health literacy are vulnerable to receiving lower-quality care and to exposure to medical errors because of communication barriers, and according to the American Medical Association, patients have the right to understand health care information and health care providers have a duty to provide information in simple, clear and plain language and to check that patients have understood the information before ending the conversation.

### Risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection in a university student population [^c902ba21]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted sensitivity analyses to address potential limitations of our study. First, to differentiate between reinfection and an existing infection, we excluded individuals who did not provide a negative test between the initial infection and reinfection. Second, because weekly testing was not mandated for nonresidential students in the fall 2020 semester, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infections went undetected in this population. We therefore repeated the analyses for residential students only, as these students were subjected to weekly testing for the majority of the fall 2020 semester.

### Six steps in quality intervention development (6SQuID) [^dd3f822e]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

6. Collect sufficient evidence of effectiveness to justify rigorous evaluation/implementation

Before committing resources to a large scale rigorous evaluation (typically a ‘phase III’ RCT), the final step is to establish sufficient evidence of effectiveness to warrant such investment. Beyond the research world, especially in third sector organisations, inadequate resources often mean practitioners move to wide scale implementation without such rigorous evaluation. This makes step 6 all the more critical.

What is being sought at this stage is some evidence that the intervention is working as intended, it is achieving at least some short-term outcomes, and it is not having any serious unintended effects, for instance exacerbating social inequalities. It is unlikely that the evaluation design will seek to prove causality so theory-based evaluation approaches are likely to be most appropriate. There are numerous guides on evaluation that adequately cover step 6,but it is worth re-stating that often the most practical way to collect evidence of effectiveness with limited resources is through a before and after survey, or by using routinely collected data. If possible, a control group greatly increases the strength of evidence. If a phase III RCT is planned, an ‘exploratory trial’ can provide valuable information about the acceptability of evaluation designs, appropriate measures and likely effect sizes to inform subsequent trials. Plans for this final step with our case study are set out below.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE METHODOLOGY: methodology [^1ca4ad94]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline development—topic selection, timeline, team composition, and grading indicate that each committee selects 2–3 new topics annually and the development process typically spans 24–36 months from initial topic selection to final publication. The process is led by a document writing team composed of committee members and subject matter experts, and Two committee members are selected to serve on the document writing team with the subject matter expert to develop the outline, synthesize evidence, propose recommendations, and author the manuscript. ACOG’s guideline development process incorporates a modified GRADE framework, with recommendations classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, and ungraded Good Practice Statements may be incorporated when evidence is extremely limited or nonexistent.

### Informing women about overdetection in breast cancer screening: two-year outcomes from a randomized trial [^42d08b08]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This article reports new evidence of how informing women about overdetection in breast cancer screening affects their long-term knowledge, screening participation, and psychosocial outcomes. Both study groups received a decision aid providing information about the breast cancer mortality benefit from screening and the likelihood of false-positives, whereas the intervention additionally explained the chance of overdetection. Our key findings are that the intervention durably increased women’s understanding of potential outcomes of breast screening, with overall knowledge remaining superior in the intervention group over 2 years of follow-up, and that screening participation rates during this period did not differ between study groups. We also observed a sustained reduction in worry about developing breast cancer among the intervention group, suggesting a further positive effect of the intervention.

The unique strengths of our study are its randomized design, long follow-up period of 2 years with high participant retention, and objective measurement of screening behavior. As far as we know, such a long-term effect of a decision aid on knowledge has not been shown before, with most studies focusing on short-term effects. To complement self-reported screening participation data, we used data linkage (with individual consent) to obtain matched records of mammograms provided through either the statewide public screening program or the national Medicare health insurer (the 2 main avenues for provision of mammography to this population). As expected, we found relatively few women in this cohort were screened outside the organized program (7%; Supplementary Table 7, available online—noting that although 50 years is the recommended starting age, women aged 40-49 years can also access mammography either within or outside the program). Agreement between self-report and screening records was high (among those willing to have their data cross-checked), suggesting that self-report may be considered a reliable way to measure participation. To further our understanding of how and why the study intervention worked, we have explored the psychological pathways involved and will separately report an embedded longitudinal qualitative study.

### Prevention of VTE in nonsurgical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^65f15e26]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—patient values for antithrombotic therapy varied across scenarios with explicit stroke–bleed trade-offs. When participants were told that warfarin, compared with aspirin, resulted in a 1% reduction in stroke and a 2.5% increase in bleeds, the majority (69%) chose aspirin; 4% chose warfarin, 14% chose no medication, and 13% were unable to decide, and the majority who chose aspirin placed an implicit value on stroke reduction of < 2.5 times the disutility of bleeding. In the moderate-risk group, warfarin, compared with aspirin, was described as a 3% absolute risk reduction in stroke and a 2.5% increase in bleeds; the majority (58.1%) chose aspirin, 11% no treatment, 12% warfarin, and 18.4% were unable, with the majority who chose aspirin placing a value on stroke reduction of < 0.83 times the value placed on bleeding. In a scenario using an audiotape and booklet, warfarin provided a 6% absolute risk reduction in stroke (9%-3%) and a 4% absolute risk increase in bleed (2%-6%) compared with no treatment; 65% chose warfarin and 35% chose no treatment, and for those choosing warfarin the disutility of one stroke was at least 1.5 times greater than that of a major bleed. Potential explanations include previous experience with antithrombotic treatment, with a 1996 study reporting > 50% had a disutility of stroke vs bleeding > 3:1 and noting that 90% had been taking warfarin and that all participants had previously been prescribed warfarin, while a 1999 study reported a higher disutility with bleeds, participants had chosen aspirin prophylaxis alone in SPAF 2 years earlier, and most had not experienced a stroke during the subsequent 2 years.
