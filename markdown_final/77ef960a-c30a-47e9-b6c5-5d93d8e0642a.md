## Question

Does vanc cause atn

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vancomycin causes acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity and how it is defined. Then, I should verify the histopathologic patterns reported in biopsy-proven cases, especially ATN. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility, including oxidative stress and cast nephropathy. After that, I should review dose–exposure relationships and risk factors that make ATN more likely. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence and translate it into practical clinical implications for monitoring and prevention, making sure I double-check areas where confounding is common and where guidelines diverge from older trough-based targets.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) is well described and typically presents with rising serum creatinine after several days of therapy; most cases are mild and reversible, but the risk increases with higher exposure and coexisting illness, and onset commonly occurs between days 4 and 17 of therapy, which fits a tubular process timeline [^1133Eibk] [^113sXCee].

> Wait, let me verify the histopathology. Although renal biopsy is rarely performed, multiple biopsy-proven reports document that vancomycin can cause ATN, often alongside acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), and occasionally a distinctive vancomycin-associated cast nephropathy with obstructive tubular casts composed of vancomycin aggregates. This pattern has been reproduced in animal models, strengthening causal inference for ATN as a direct toxic mechanism in some cases [^113AWuso] [^112qftjV] [^111dG4oA].

> I need to check the mechanistic plausibility. Direct proximal tubular epithelial injury via oxidative stress is a leading hypothesis, and the discovery of vancomycin–uromodulin casts provides a concrete obstructive pathway to ATN. Additionally, vancomycin is filtered and can accumulate in proximal tubules via megalin/cubilin-mediated uptake, which aligns with a dose-dependent toxicodynamic model of injury [^115LP5uu] [^112qftjV] [^1155991N].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose alone. I should review exposure–toxicity relationships. Higher vancomycin exposure, whether measured by trough or AUC, correlates with AKI risk in a graded fashion, with multiple studies showing increased odds of nephrotoxicity as troughs rise above about 15–20 mg/L and as AUC exceeds roughly 600–650 mg·h/L. Importantly, AUC-guided dosing strategies that keep AUC in the 400–600 mg·h/L range reduce AKI compared with trough-only approaches, supporting a toxicodynamic link rather than mere confounding by illness severity [^11418XMv] [^116w5EbH] [^112hbm4W].

> I should confirm risk modifiers that make ATN more likely. Critical illness, preexisting CKD, concomitant nephrotoxins (notably piperacillin–tazobactam, aminoglycosides, contrast), longer duration of therapy, and higher daily doses all increase risk. The combination of vancomycin with piperacillin–tazobactam has repeatedly been associated with a two- to fourfold higher AKI risk in observational cohorts and meta-analyses, although causality remains debated pending randomized data [^112UcR34] [^113GCpSC] [^116Kuisy].

> But wait, what if the apparent association is just sicker patients having higher troughs rather than vancomycin causing ATN? I need to ensure we account for reverse causation. While some early studies were limited by confounding, convergent lines of evidence — biopsy-proven ATN, mechanistic plausibility, dose–response gradients, and mitigation of risk with AUC-guided dosing — together support a direct nephrotoxic effect in a subset of patients, even though multifactorial AKI is common in the critically ill [^112qftjV] [^116w5EbH] [^112hbm4W].

> Let me synthesize. Yes, vancomycin can cause ATN, documented by biopsy-proven cases and supported by mechanistic data on oxidative tubular injury and obstructive cast nephropathy. The risk is exposure dependent and amplified by patient and treatment factors, and it is most convincingly mitigated by AUC-guided monitoring to avoid excessive exposure while maintaining efficacy [^113AWuso] [^112qftjV] [^112hbm4W].

> Next, I should review practical implications to prevent or detect ATN early. I should confirm that current guidelines recommend AUC-guided dosing with a target AUC/MIC of 400–600 mg·h/L (assuming MIC ≈1 mg/L), avoid routine targeting of high troughs (15–20 mg/L), monitor renal function and vancomycin concentrations closely in high-risk patients, and reassess therapy promptly if AKI occurs. If AKI develops and other causes are excluded, discontinuation or dose reduction is appropriate, and in severe cases with markedly elevated levels, enhanced clearance strategies may be considered [^112CF5wr] [^115VvJhz] [^115f2LfP] [^117TuJiW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost defaulted to the old teaching that troughs of 15–20 mg/L are necessary for serious infections. Hold on, I should verify whether that still applies. Contemporary consensus has shifted toward AUC-guided targets because trough-only strategies often overshoot exposure and increase AKI without clear efficacy gains, so I should correct that outdated habit and emphasize AUC 400–600 mg·h/L instead of chasing high troughs [^112CF5wr] [^115VvJhz].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the totality of evidence: vancomycin can cause ATN via direct tubular toxicity and obstructive cast formation, the risk rises with higher exposure and coexposures, and risk is minimized by AUC-guided dosing and vigilant monitoring. While confounding is common in ICU cohorts, biopsy, mechanistic, and exposure–response data together establish ATN as a genuine, though preventable, vancomycin toxicity phenotype [^112qftjV] [^116w5EbH] [^112UcR34].

Vancomycin can cause **acute tubular necrosis (ATN)** [^115f2LfP], particularly with high trough levels (> 15–20 mg/L), prolonged therapy (> 7 days), or when combined with other nephrotoxins (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, aminoglycosides) [^113GCpSC] [^1178MT7z]. The mechanism is **direct proximal tubular toxicity** with oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury, and in some cases obstructive cast nephropathy from vancomycin aggregates [^112qftjV]. ATN typically presents 4–8 days after initiation with rising creatinine, oliguria, and tubular epithelial cell casts, and is confirmed by biopsy when needed [^113sXCee] [^113AWuso]. Risk is reduced by AUC-guided dosing (target AUC 400–600 mg·h/L) [^112CF5wr], avoiding supratherapeutic troughs, and close renal monitoring [^112UcR34]; most cases resolve with drug cessation and supportive care, though some require dialysis [^113sXCee].

## Mechanisms of vancomycin-induced ATN

Vancomycin-induced ATN arises from **direct proximal tubular toxicity**, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and, in some cases, obstructive cast nephropathy [^112qftjV].

- **Direct tubular toxicity**: Vancomycin is filtered and taken up by proximal tubular cells, causing mitochondrial injury, oxidative stress, and cell death [^1155991N].

- **Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction**: ROS and mitochondrial damage drive tubular epithelial injury and necrosis [^113NdoVy].

- **Obstructive cast nephropathy**: Vancomycin aggregates with uromodulin can form intratubular casts, causing obstruction and ATN [^112qftjV].

---

## Clinical evidence linking vancomycin to ATN

Multiple clinical and experimental studies support **vancomycin-associated ATN**:

- **Biopsy-proven cases**: Renal biopsies have documented ATN in vancomycin-associated AKI, often with interstitial nephritis [^113AWuso] [^111dG4oA].

- **Observational studies**: Higher vancomycin exposure (troughs > 15–20 mg/L, AUC > 600 mg·h/L) is linked to increased AKI risk, consistent with ATN [^112UcR34] [^114iEPVC].

- **Meta-analyses**: Vancomycin is associated with a higher AKI risk than comparators (RR ~2.45), supporting causality [^114UjYzH].

## Risk factors for vancomycin-induced ATN

Several factors increase the risk of **vancomycin-induced ATN**:

| **Risk factor category** | **Specific risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-related | - Pre-existing renal impairment <br/> - Critical illness <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Advanced age <br/> - Comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension) [^112UcR34] |
| Drug-related | - High trough levels (> 15–20 mg/L) <br/> - Prolonged therapy (> 7 days) <br/> - High daily doses (≥ 4 g/day) <br/> - Loading doses in severe renal impairment [^112UcR34] [^112NUWLF] |
| Drug interactions | - Concomitant nephrotoxins (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, aminoglycosides, contrast media) [^113GCpSC] [^1178MT7z] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Vancomycin-induced ATN typically presents with:

- **Timing**: Onset 4–8 days after initiation, sometimes earlier with high exposure [^113sXCee].

- **Clinical features**: Rising serum creatinine, oliguria, tubular epithelial cell casts, and non-nephrotic proteinuria [^114BxDE9].

- **Diagnosis**: Clinical context plus exclusion of other causes; biopsy confirms ATN when uncertain [^113sXCee].

---

## Preventive strategies and management

Prevention and management focus on **dose optimization and monitoring**:

- **AUC-guided dosing**: Target AUC 400–600 mg·h/L to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity risk [^112CF5wr] [^112UcR34].

- **Avoidance of supratherapeutic levels**: Keep troughs ≤ 15–20 mg/L to reduce toxicity [^112UcR34] [^114iEPVC].

- **Monitoring**: Regular renal function and vancomycin levels, especially in high-risk patients [^115f2LfP].

- **Management**: Stop or reduce vancomycin, provide supportive care, and consider dialysis in severe cases [^115f2LfP] [^117WZkHD] [^111dG4oA].

---

## Prognosis and reversibility

Most cases resolve with drug cessation and supportive care, though recovery may take days to weeks; severe injury may require temporary dialysis, and rare cases progress to chronic kidney disease [^113sXCee] [^113AWuso].

---

Vancomycin can cause **ATN** through direct tubular toxicity, oxidative stress, and obstructive casts, with risk rising with higher exposure and co-exposures. AUC-guided dosing, avoiding supratherapeutic levels, and close monitoring reduce risk, and most cases resolve with supportive care.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) in pediatrics — exposure–response and dose limits: The risk of AKI increases with vancomycin exposure, especially when trough concentrations exceed 15 to 20 mg/L. A meta-analysis of 10 pediatric studies found that troughs of 15 to 20 mg/L increased the risk for AKI by 2.71-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.82–4.05). Additional risk correlates include dose augmentation of 5 mg/kg at each additional day of therapy and late-onset AKI occurring after 7 days with association to age < 1 year. In a large PK analysis using 1,576 concentrations from 680 pediatric subjects, AKI occurred in 10%, 33%, and 57% among those achieving AUC values of ≥ 400, 800, and 1,000 mg·h/L, respectively; an AUC of ≥ 800 mg·h/L and trough concentrations of ≥ 15 mg/L were independently associated with a greater than 2.5-fold increased AKI risk, and AUC correlated strongly with troughs (Spearman's coefficient, 0.963; P < 0.001). Based on projected exposure, vancomycin doses of ≥ 100 mg/kg/day should be avoided because the projected median AUC and trough values are 843 mg·h/L and 21 mg/L, respectively, at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Infusion-Related Events

During or soon after rapid infusion of vancomycin, patients may develop anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension (see ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY), wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, or pruritus. Rapid infusion may also cause flushing of the upper body ("red neck") or pain and muscle spasms of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours. Such events are infrequent if vancomycin is given by a slow infusion over 60 minutes. In studies of normal volunteers, infusion-related events did not occur when vancomycin was administered at a rate of 10 mg/min or less.

Nephrotoxicity

Renal failure, principally manifested by increased serum creatinine or BUN concentrations, especially in patients administered large doses of vancomycin, has been reported rarely. Cases of interstitial nephritis have also been reported rarely. Most of these have occurred in patients who were given aminoglycosides concomitantly or who had preexisting kidney dysfunction. When vancomycin was discontinued, azotemia resolved in most patients.

Gastrointestinal

Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS).

Ototoxicity

A few dozen cases of hearing loss associated with vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug. Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported rarely.

Hematopoietic

Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of therapy with vancomycin or after a total dosage of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has rarely been reported. Although a casual relationship has not been established, reversible agranulocytosis (granulocytes < 500/mm3) has been reported rarely.

Phlebitis

Inflammation at the injection site has been reported.

Miscellaneous

Infrequently, patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, nausea, chills, eosinophilia, rashes including exfoliative dermatitis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and vasculitis in association with administration of vancomycin.

Chemical peritonitis has been reported following intraperitoneal administration of vancomycin (see PRECAUTIONS).

Post Marketing Reports

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vancomycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Nephrotoxicity from vancomycin combined with piperacillin-tazobactam: a comprehensive review [^116Kuisy]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies have identified the combination of vancomycin with piperacillin-tazobactam (VPT) to be associated with increased nephrotoxicity. Multiple, large cohort studies have found this widely used combination to have a higher risk of nephrotoxicity than other regimens in a variety of populations.

Summary

This review summarizes the epidemiology and clinical features of VPT-associated acute kidney injury (AKI). Potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon are also discussed. Key Message: VPT-associated nephrotoxicity is a recently recognized clinical entity. Clinical strategies to minimize the risk of toxicity in this setting include antimicrobial stewardship, monitoring of kidney function, and emerging data supporting the potential role for novel biomarkers in predicting and managing AKI.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^114BxDE9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients of Intensive Care Units (ICU) are often characterized by a state of immunosuppression induced by underlying disease, therapies, and impairment of mechanical and immunological protective barriers, which exposes them to higher risk of hospital-acquired infections. Over the years, the repeated administration of antibiotic therapy has favoured the diffusion of Gram-positive Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), calling for stronger antibiotic therapies such as vancomycin, which is currently considered the treatment of choice for most MRSA infections.

Vancomycin, which is a poorly metabolized glycopeptide, is mainly excreted unchanged through urine and has its total body clearance correlated with glomerular filtration rate. Indeed, creatinine clearance (CrCl) is frequently used as the clinical surrogate for glomerular filtration and its measurement can be used in clinical routines to help dose kidney-excreted drugs, such as vancomycin. Accumulation of vancomycin may have major adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, in both patients with and without renal dysfunction. The incidence of nephrotoxicity can vary between 5% and 35% both in patients with and without kidney dysfunction; the adverse effects of nephrotoxicity may include an increase of creatinine, azotemia as well as changes in urinary sediment (hematuria, proteinuria and casts). The incidence of ototoxicity ranges between 1% and 9% in both patients population.

However, more recently, it has been underlined that antibiotics overdosing could be of less clinical relevance when compared to underdosing, since the latter is associated with an increased mortality. Recent studies suggest that alterations of fluid distribution, hemodynamic parameters, microcirculation and organ functions may be associated with subtherapeutic level of vancomycin. The latter is responsible of treatment failure, selection of resistant organisms and higher mortality, underlying that low plasmatic levels of vancomycin are even more relevant for patient outcome than increased plasmatic concentration. Furthermore, subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin has been associated with augmented renal clearance (ARC), which is characterised by an enhanced renal elimination of circulating solutes observed in critically ill patients.

Hence, when treating an ICU patient with vancomycin, physicians should balance accumulation with subtherapeutic level of vancomycin; though this can be particularly challenging in patients with kidney dysfunction, as vancomycin clearance is mainly related to kidney function and such patients are at a higher risk of nephrotoxicity (compared to those with normal kidney function).

### Increasing evidence of the nephrotoxicity of piperacillin / tazobactam and vancomycin combination therapy-what is the clinician to Do? [^1178MT7z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Early administration of appropriate empiric antibiotics is essential for achieving the best possible outcomes in sepsis. Yet the choice of antibiotic therapy has become more challenging due to recent reports of nephrotoxicity with the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, the "workhorse" regimen at many institutions. In this article we assess the evidence for nephrotoxicity and its possible mechanisms, provide recommendations for risk mitigation, address the advantages and disadvantages of alternative antibiotic choices, and suggest areas for future research.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam added to vancomycin increases risk for acute kidney injury: fact or fiction? [^111J7bdd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam are 2 of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in hospitals. Recent data from multiple meta-analyses suggest that the combination increases the risk for vancomycin-induced kidney injury when compared to alternative viable options. However, these studies are unable to prove biologic plausibility and causality as randomized controlled trials have not been performed. Furthermore, these studies define acute kidney injury according to thresholds of serum creatinine rise. Serum creatinine is not a direct indicator of renal injury, rather a surrogate of glomerular function. More reliable, specific, and sensitive biomarkers are needed to truly define if there is a causal relationship with increased toxicity when piperacillin-tazobactam is added to vancomycin. This viewpoint will explore the available evidence for and against increased acute kidney injury in the setting of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam coadministration.

### Expression and 7-day time course of circulating microRNAs in septic patients treated with nephrotoxic antibiotic agents [^116HXJui]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin is a glycopeptidic antibiotic with effects that depend on time and area under the curve (AUC) above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen. It exerts bactericidal effects on Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The most useful parameter for detecting the effects of vancomycin treatment is a 24-h AUC:MIC ratio ≥ 400 mg x h/L with a pathogen MIC < 2 mg/L. Vancomycin nephrotoxicity not only tracks with total administered dose but also can be worsened by other concomitant therapy, patient age, and trough serum vancomycin > 16.5 mg/L. Gentamicin is a concentration-dependent aminoglycoside antibiotic that is effective against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella sp. The pathophysiological mechanism of its nephrotoxicity involves many factors, including direct tubular, glomerular, or vascular damage with activation of oxidative stress. Gentamicin is eliminated by glomerular filtration and partially undergoes tubular resorption with accumulation in cytoplasm and lysosomes with activation of cell death.

In the quest for new preventive or therapeutic targets in septic/nephrotoxic acute renal damage, a current research focus is on the small RNAs known as micro-RNAs (miRNAs or miRs, 18–31 nucleotides). Their clinical significance varies because they can positively or negatively regulate a substantial number of target genes. Many miRNAs have been investigated in animal and human studies, including in blood, urine, or sweat, for potential use as biomarkers of sepsis. Among critically ill patients, sepsis and the non-septic systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) are associated with substantial and differential changes in circulating miRNAs. In sepsis, miRNAs can critically affect the innate and acquired immunity systems. Many of these molecules influence biochemical pathways associated with NF-kB activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-12, and IL-10.

### Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury in Hong Kong in 2012–2016 [^112uMT6m]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

This study is the first large scale investigation of VA-AKI in Hong Kong. In previous studies, the incidence of VA-AKI in Chinese varied from 2.4 to 45% (Additional file 1: Table S1). The difference of estimated incidence is due to different populations, sample sizes, inclusion criteria and AKI definition. In USA, the incidence of VA-AKI declined from 42.6% in 2007 to 14.1% in 2017. This might be due to doctors' awareness of the toxicity of vancomycin and improvements in vancomycin purity. Our study reports a lower incidence of VA-AKI than the previous study, since the large database is less prone to publication and other biases.

In the literature, nephrotoxicity occurs in 1–9% of neonates receiving currently recommended doses, and 6–14% of paediatric patients. Since these studies were all based on different population, the incidence of VA-AKI cannot be compared. Our study compared the incidence of VA-AKI in different age group based on the same population. By age group, the order of incidence from high to low was children from 1 to 12 years old (16.3%), adolescents above 12 years of age and adults (12.2%), elderly patients aged over 60 years (11.3%), new-borns and infants (6.2%). The characters of young patients with VA-AKI were different from elderly patients. The median of trough vancomycin in patients under 60 years old were all lower than 10 mg/L, yet the incidence of VA-AKI still accounted for a sizeable proportion. In new-borns and infants receiving parenteral administration the incidence of VA-AKI was distinctively higher.

### Effect of N-acetylcysteine on antimicrobials induced nephrotoxicity: a meta-analysis [^1161wNYs]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobials are commonly used in clinical practice to treat various infectious diseases. In accordance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, clinicians are encouraged to administer early, broad-spectrum anti-infective regimens to patients diagnosed with sepsis. The guidelines posit that prompt diagnosis (within one hour) and prompt application of effective antimicrobials can increase patient survival by 7.6%. Nevertheless, the administration of antimicrobials is accompanied by the potential for adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity, which is defined as kidney injury resulting from the administration of pharmaceutical agents or toxic substances. Antimicrobials induced nephrotoxicity has the potential to result in acute kidney injury (AKI), prolonged hospitalization, and elevated healthcare costs.

It has been established that several classes of antibiotics have the potential to cause nephrotoxicity. These include aminoglycosides, vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams. Aminoglycosides are known to have nephrotoxicity, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving prolonged courses of treatment. Vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity has been linked to the development of interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis. Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an elevated risk of nephrotoxicity, particularly in older adults and those with preexisting kidney disease. Beta-lactams, including penicillins and cephalosporins, have been demonstrated to induce nephrotoxicity through a range of mechanisms, including interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, and crystal nephropathy. Despite the implementation of various strategies to prevent nephrotoxicity, the occurrence of antimicrobials induced AKI remains a common phenomenon.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a frequently prescribed antioxidant agent that has demonstrated favorable renoprotective outcomes in numerous researches. NAC has been reported to attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation, improve renal function, and protect against nephrotoxic injuries in both experimental animal models and clinical setting.

Although NAC may reduce the incidence of AKI in patients with cardiac surgery and contrast administration, the absence of randomized clinical trials present a significant challenge in evaluating its efficacy in patients recieving antimicrobials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of NAC administration on clinical outcomes in patients with antimicrobials compared with placebo.

### Association of vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam with early changes in creatinine versus cystatin C in critically ill adults: a prospective cohort study [^115LP5uu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vancomycin (VN) and piperacillin–tazobactam (PT) are two cornerstones of antibiotic therapy in acutely ill patients with sepsis. In a recent analysis of 576 United States hospitals, these agents were the two most commonly used antibiotics, accounting for over 13 million days of antibiotic therapy in 2016. Given the key role of this antibiotic combination, the emergence of evidence linking VN + PT to acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major drug safety concern. Nearly fifty observational studies have demonstrated this association, with a recent meta-analysis suggesting VN + PT increases AKI risk two-fold. In response to these data, some health systems have implemented large-scale initiatives to avoid the combination.

Despite this epidemiologic evidence, the mechanism of potential interaction is unknown. VN can cause acute tubular necrosis via oxidative stress and the formation of obstructive tubular casts. In contrast, there is little evidence linking PT to nephrotoxicity, other than rare cases of acute interstitial nephritis. Moreover, animal models have failed to demonstrate synergistic toxicity, with some suggesting that PT may actually reduce VN nephrotoxicity.

### Biopsy-proven vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury: a case report and literature review [^11246zzA]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In general, an AKI episode is an independent risk factor for end-stage renal disease and death, and patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at higher risk for long-term mortality and dialysis after hospital discharge.

The first case series of VCM-induced AKI was reported in 1958. The incidence of VCM-induced nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 5% of patients. VCM-induced AKI is initially diagnosed when 50% sCr (or 44.2 μmol/l) elevation from baseline is detected in at least two different time points after administration of VCM treatment. However, many of recent studies are committed to the definition and classification of AKI of RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO criteria.

Plasma VCM level should be controlled in the appropriate range to prevent VCM-induced AKI. Plasma VCM level could be measured with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), such as VCM trough and area under the curve (AUC). However, VCM trough and AUC might be insufficient for prediction of VCM-induced AKI in large population study. Moreover, available TDM guidelines still need optimizations to establish a more reliable VCM-TDM strategy in accordance with risk factors. Previous studies showed that minimal sCr elevation is associated with prognosis of AKI, and intensive monitoring of urine output could be useful for AKI diagnosis and better outcomes. More careful monitoring should be used to detect AKI as soon as possible in VCM usage.

Although VCM nephrotoxicity was well known in clinical settings, only 12 cases of biopsy-proven VCM-induced AKI have been reported so far as renal biopsy is rarely performed for such cases (Table 2). Most of them showed AIN, and three cases showed ATN. Renal biopsy in our case (peak sCr, 1020.1 μmol/L) and one of the reported cases (peak sCr, 1034.3 μmol/L) revealed ATN and AIN. Diabetic nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, and lupus nephritis were found simultaneously.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^1133Eibk]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Toxicodynamics — acute kidney injury (AKI) definitions, thresholds, and incidence with vancomycin are summarized as follows: Most studies defined AKI as an increase in the serum creatinine (SCr) level of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL, or a 50% increase from baseline in consecutive daily readings, or a decrease in calculated creatinine CL (CLcr) of 50% from baseline on 2 consecutive days in the absence of an alternative explanation. A more sensitive threshold — an increase in SCr of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL over a 48-hour period — may be considered as an indicator of vancomycin-associated AKI and was adopted from AKIN and KDIGO criteria. Reported prevalence has varied from 5% to 43%, and a meta-analysis of 13 studies found a relative risk of 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.69–3.55) with an attributable risk of 5%. Most episodes developed between 4 and 17 days after initiation of therapy.

### An evaluation of the incidence of nephrotoxicity after a loading dose of vancomycin in patients with severe renal impairment [^117SkzPr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Loading doses of vancomycin assist in the rapid achievement of target trough concentrations. Patients with renal dysfunction have been excluded from studies evaluating loading doses.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate nephrotoxicity related to initial vancomycin dose in patients with severe renal dysfunction.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of a large, academic health system. Adults were included if they received intravenous vancomycin in the emergency department and presented with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min. Chronic dialysis patients were excluded. The primary outcome was incidence of nephrotoxicity after an initial high (> 20 mg/kg) vs. low (≤ 20 mg/kg) dose of vancomycin. Secondary outcomes included dialysis, vancomycin concentrations, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and a composite outcome of nephrotoxicity or dialysis.

Results

Of the 927 patients included in the analysis, nephrotoxicity occurred in 7.2% and 13.8% of patients in the high- and low-dose groups, respectively (p < 0.01). Patients in the high-dose group had a reduced risk of nephrotoxicity (relative risk 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.35–0.78). The reduction in risk remained after fitting a generalized linear model adjusting for weight, age, sex, initial serum creatinine, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (relative risk 0.61; 95% confidence interval 0.39–0.93). Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and single-center population.

Conclusion

These data suggest that vancomycin loading doses do not increase nephrotoxicity compared with lower doses in patients with severe renal dysfunction. These patients should be included in future studies relating to vancomycin loading doses.

### Cardiorenal syndrome in COVID-19 [^113WMn5Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

During the initial management of COVID-19 and possible cardiomyopathy without obvious cause, the patient had high-grade temperature spikes (39°C–40°C) with CRP < 100 mg/L. He was initially prescribed ceftriaxone considering bacterial superinfection, although his blood and urine cultures were negative. Three days later, his CRP started creeping up with no significant improvement in fever spikes. Ceftriaxone was then changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin added to cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In next 2–3 days, the patient's renal functions started deteriorating with gradual worsening of creatinine clearance. Vancomycin levels were checked and found to be within normal range. The renal functions kept on deteriorating even when the patient was off the vancomycin and his creatinine clearance (GFR) became < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with a creatinine of 657 μmol/L (figure 3). He became oliguric and started on intermittent haemodialysis. As a result, a renal biopsy was planned which showed acute tubular injury with some granular casts and some localised inflammation around injured tubules. Extensive investigations by the nephrology colleagues resulted in the impression that it was a case of acute tubular necrosis/tubular injury either viral or drug induced with no glomerular change on light microscopy. The patient received vancomycin for 3 days not exceeding 4 g/day. Studies have demonstrated the strong relationship between AKI and measures of vancomycin exposure. In this regard, longer duration of therapy exceeding 7 days or a daily dose of vancomycin in excess of 4 g correlate with higher risk of nephrotoxicity in multiple studies.

### 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the management of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^114kGQ7Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Vancomycin monitoring in outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) should occur throughout treatment, as the guideline states that vancomycin levels should be monitored throughout the OPAT course and recommends drug levels be monitored not just during the initial phase; a widely followed statement recommends dose adjustments based on serum trough levels, and there is emerging consensus that area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration monitoring may allow more appropriate dosing, though this practice has not yet gained widespread adoption. An observational study found that nephrotoxicity is frequently noted more than 2 weeks into treatment, which informed the recommendation to monitor levels throughout OPAT.

### Randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of early switch from vancomycin to vancomycin alternatives as a strategy to prevent nephrotoxicity in patients with multiple risk factors for adverse renal outcomes (STOP-NT) [^115Ym72m]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Use of alternative antimicrobials to vancomycin is a potential strategy to reduce acute kidney injury (AKI) in high-risk patients, but current data do not support widespread adoption of this practice.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of early switch to a nonnephrotoxic alternative for prevention of AKI in high-risk patients who receive vancomycin.

Methods

This was an IRB-approved, prospective randomized controlled trial in a single, tertiary care academic medical center. Patients initially prescribed vancomycin between October 2011 to April 2013 with at least 2 risk factors for AKI were included. Treatment randomization was stratified by indication for therapy. Patients were randomized to continuation of dose-optimized vancomycin or early switch to an alternative antimicrobial agent. The primary end point was nephrotoxicity by consensus guideline definition adjudicated by blinded review; the secondary end point was AKI network-defined AKI.

Results

A total of 103 patients were randomized; 100 were included in the modified intent-to-treat population, 51 in the vancomycin group and 49 in the alternative group. The incidence of nephrotoxicity was 6.1% in the alternative therapy arm and 9.8% in the vancomycin group (P = 0.72). The incidence of AKI was 32.7% in the alternative therapy group and 31.4% in the vancomycin group (P = 0.89).

Conclusions

No significant difference in nephrotoxicity or AKI was detected among patients treated with alternative antimicrobials compared with vancomycin. The use of alternative antimicrobial therapy instead of vancomycin solely for the purpose of preventing AKI in high-risk patients does not appear to be warranted.

### Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury in Hong Kong in 2012–2016 [^114uRSNH]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has gained considerable attention due to its high morbidity, limited effective treatments available and increased incidence. Vancomycin has been recommended as the first line treatment for MRSA infections by American, European, and Chinese guidelines for infectious diseases control and management control for antibiotics. However, the significant nephrotoxicity limits the use of vancomycin in daily clinical practice. It has been reported the incidence of VA-AKI ranges from 0% to over 40%.

AKI is one of the examples of nephrotoxicity that accounts for about 1.7 million deaths every year worldwide. The consequences of AKI can be severe, ranging from hospitalization to life-long dialysis and transplantation. From a recent meta-analysis, the pooled incidence of AKI was 19.4% in eastern Asia. Drugs are the third main cause of AKI. The prognosis in drug-associated AKI is poor, especially in critically ill patients.

In Hong Kong, there is limited published literature on the incidence of drug-induced nephrotoxicity. A previous study reported an incidence of 23.1% for VA-AKI in a hospital. A systematic population-wide study is clearly needed, in view of the serious implications of this potentially preventable and reversible condition. Therefore, we investigated the incidence of VA-AKI in Hong Kong from 2012 to 2016, characterized patients with VA-AKI as well as identified predictors for the development of VA-AKI.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^116UoHvG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

By contrast, several earlier studies reported no significant increase in nephrotoxicity comparing the vancomycin/aminoglycoside combination with either agent alone. When these positive and negative studies were combined in a 1993 meta‐analysis, combination therapy did have a significant 13% (P < 0.01) higher rate of nephrotoxicity than vancomycin alone and a 4% (P < 0.05) higher rate than aminoglycosides alone. 91 A more recent study found no difference in nephrotoxicity with addition of gentamycin to vancomycin, by multivariate analysis. 68 As noted earlier, in an RCT of patients with staphylococcal bacteremia, vancomycin plus gentamicin was no more nephrotoxic than penicillin plus gentamicin, but both regimens were significantly more toxic than daptomycin without an aminoglycoside. 4 It remains uncertain whether the enhanced rate of nephrotoxicity reported with vancomycin use in combination with aminoglycosides is the result of severity of underlying illness, the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides per se, or a true nephrotoxic synergy between the agents.

The combination of piperacillin‐tazobactam (PTZ) with vancomycin was first noted to potentially result in enhanced nephrotoxicity compared to vancomycin without PTZ in several abstracts published in 2011. Subsequent studies have been conflicting. For example, Meaney et al. found a significant adjusted OR of 5.36 of AKI when PTZ was added to vancomycin therapy in 125 adult patients. 72 Gomes et al. studied 224 adults receiving vancomycin and found a significantly higher AKI incidence when PTZ was added (35% vs. 13%, P < 0.0001). 92 Propensity score matching confirmed this significance (P = 0.003). Kim et al. showed a significantly reduced OR (0.14) of vancomycin monotherapy compared to combination with PTZ by multivariable analysis in 228 adult patients that was confirmed in a propensity score analysis (OR = 0.17). 93 Fodero et al. studied 453 veterans receiving vancomycin and noted a significant OR (3.21) for nephrotoxicity with concomitant PTZ by multivariable analysis. 94

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^112CYUYx]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Continuous infusion versus intermittent infusion of vancomycin — administration by continuous infusion (CI) has been evaluated as an alternative to intermittent infusion (II) with potential advantages of earlier target attainment, less variability in serum concentrations, ease of drug level monitoring, and lower the potential risk of AKI. Most studies compared CI to II for the risk of AKI and attainment of target serum concentrations; only 4 studies included other outcome endpoints such as treatment failure and mortality, and measures of exposure reported include trough and average steady-state concentrations and AUCτ. In critically ill patients, a total of 7 studies compared CI vs II; in one randomized trial comparing CI (n = 61) and II (n = 58) in 119 patients, mean steady-state and trough concentrations were 24 mg/L and 15 mg/L for both groups, with AUCτ values comparable between groups and significantly less variability in the CI group (P = 0.026). Clinical failure rates were similar on day 10 (21% vs 26%) and at end of treatment (21% vs 19%), although the mean AUCτ was lower with CI than II (596 [SD, 159] mg·h/L vs 685 [SD, 260] mg·h/L, P < 0.05). Nephrotoxicity occurred in 18% overall with similar rates between CI and II (16% vs 19%), but dialysis was required more often with CI than II (6 of 10 patients vs 3 of 11 patients). Among critically ill burn patients, another study comparing CI (n = 90) with II (n = 81) reported mortality rates numerically higher for those receiving CI but not reaching statistical significance; when mortality was compared by treatment indications, those who received CI for non-gram-positive sepsis had significantly higher mortality (70% vs 16.7%, P = 0.001). Nephrotoxicity occurred numerically less frequently with CI than II based on increase in Scr of 0.5 mg/dL at end of therapy (6.7% vs 14.8%).

### Vancomycin and the risk of AKI: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UjYzH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Vancomycin has been in use for more than half a century, but whether it is truly nephrotoxic and to what extent are still highly controversial. The objective of this study was to determine the risk of AKI attributable to intravenous vancomycin.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials and cohort studies that compared patients treated with intravenous vancomycin with a control group of patients given a comparator nonglycopeptide antibiotic and in which kidney function or kidney injury outcomes were reported. PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from 1990 to September of 2015. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed study risk of bias, and one reviewer adjudicated the assessments. A meta-analysis was conducted on seven randomized, controlled trials (total of 4033 patients).

Results

Moderate quality evidence suggested that vancomycin treatment is associated with a higher risk of AKI, with a relative risk of 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.69 to 3.55). The risk of kidney injury was similar in patients treated for skin and soft tissue infections compared with those treated for nosocomial pneumonia and other complicated infections. There was an uncertain risk of reporting bias, because kidney function was not a prespecified outcome in any of the trials. The preponderance of evidence was judged to be indirect, because the majority of studies compared vancomycin specifically with linezolid.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that there is a measurable risk of AKI associated with vancomycin, but the strength of the evidence is moderate. A randomized, controlled trial designed to study kidney function as an outcome would be needed to draw unequivocal conclusions.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^114Hvxps]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

VANCOMYCIN AUC

Several studies compared the relationship between vancomycin exposure as indicated by the AUC and nephrotoxicity. Using a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis in a retrospective study of 166 patients, Lodise et al. found a significant breakpoint of 1,300 mg × h/L with nephrotoxicity rates of 26% and 10% above and below this level (P = 0.05). 58 By multivariable analysis, AUC was no longer a significant predictor of nephrotoxicity, while the trough level was. In contrast, a breakpoint of 563 mg × h/L was determined by CART analysis in a recent retrospective study of 127 patients, with significance confirmed by multivariable analysis. 69 Trough levels were not independently predictive in this study. In a smaller study of 31 patients, an AUC of ∼700 (by visual inspection of a figure) associated with nephrotoxicity compared to about 500 in those without (P = 0.014), but a specific breakpoint was not established. 25 Comparison of AUC and VANT has not been widely studied.

### Vancomycin area under the curve and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis [^116w5EbH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This study analyzed the relationship between vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and acute kidney injury (AKI) reported across recent studies.

Methods

A systematic review of PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and compiled references was conducted. We included randomized cohort and case-control studies that reported vancomycin AUCs and risk of AKI (from 1990 to 2018). The primary outcome was AKI, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/L or a 50% increase from baseline on ≥ 2 consecutive measurements. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Primary analyses compared the impact of AUC cutpoint (greater than ~650 mg × hour/L) and AKI. Additional analysis compared AUC vs trough-guided monitoring on AKI incidence.

Results

Eight observational studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria with data for 2491 patients. Five studies reported first-24-hour AUCs (AUC0–24) and AKI, 2 studies reported 24- to 48-hour AUCs (AUC24–48) and AKI, and 2 studies reported AKI associated with AUC- vs trough-guided monitoring. AUC less than approximately 650 mg × hour/L was associated with decreased AKI for AUC0–24 (OR, 0.36 [95% CI, .23-.56]) as well as AUC24–48 (OR, 0.45 [95% CI, .27-.75]). AKI associated with the AUC monitoring strategy was significantly lower than trough-guided monitoring (OR, 0.68 [95% CI, .46-.99]).

Conclusions

AUCs measured in the first or second 24 hours and lower than approximately 650 mg × hour/L may result in a decreased risk of AKI. Vancomycin AUC monitoring strategy may result in less vancomycin-associated AKI. Additional investigations are warranted.

### Vancomycin hydrochloride (vancomycin) [^114EgTMS]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Infusion Reactions

Rapid bolus administration (e.g., over several minutes) may be associated with exaggerated hypotension, including shock and rarely cardiac arrest.

Vancomycin hydrochloride should be administered in a diluted solution over a period of not less than 60 minutes to avoid rapid-infusion-related reactions. Stopping the infusion usually results in prompt cessation of these reactions.

Nephrotoxicity

Systemic vancomycin exposure may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). The risk of AKI increases as systemic exposure/serum levels increase. Monitor renal function in all patients, especially patients with underlying renal impairment, patients with co-morbidities that predispose to renal impairment, and patients receiving concomitant therapy with a drug known to be nephrotoxic.

Ototoxicity

Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride. It may be transient or permanent. It has been reported mostly in patients who have been given excessive doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside. Vancomycin should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency because the risk of toxicity is appreciably increased by high, prolonged blood concentrations.

Dosage of vancomycin hydrochloride must be adjusted for patients with renal dysfunction (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### The association between vancomycin trough concentrations and acute kidney injury in the neonatal intensive care unit [^1178KZQy]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Nephrotoxicity in the neonatal population is poorly defined. Several definitions of acute kidney injury (AKI) exist in the literature; however, there are no standard criteria for diagnosing AKI in neonates. Commonly used definitions of AKI in neonates include oliguria of less than 1 mL/kg/h of urine output that develops 24 h after birth and persists for at least 24 h, an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) to greater than 1.5 mg/L 72 h after birth, or an increase in SCr between 0.5 and 1 mg/L per day. Nephrotoxicity attributed to vancomycin use is not clearly defined in neonates; however, the mechanism of injury to the kidney is believed to be the result of proximal tubule damage. Although causality has not been proven, a higher risk of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity in the pediatric population with higher vancomycin trough concentrations has been speculated.

Due to pharmacokinetic differences between adults and neonates, and since neonates have immature renal function compared to adults, the applicability and adverse effects of increased target troughs in premature neonates remain unknown. Lastly, it has been documented in adult populations that concurrent treatment using other known nephrotoxic agents, such as aminoglycosides, is associated with an increased risk for nephrotoxicity with vancomycin. Again, it is unclear whether this is true in the neonatal population.

Previously done studies in children receiving vancomycin alone have reported incidence of AKI from 9%–14%. Linder et al. and Nahata et al. found the incidence of AKI in neonatal population to be low. Their studies did not show statistically significant difference in the incidence of AKI with concomitant administration of gentamicin. However, McKamy and Knoderer et al. reported slightly higher overall incidence of AKI at 14% in children between the ages 1 month and 17 years. Both the studies also reported significantly higher incidence of AKI with vancomycin trough > 15 mg/L at 28% and 18% respectively.

### Co-administration of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is associated with increased renal dysfunction in adult and pediatric burn patients [^115o6tN6]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to this study that warrant consideration. The single center, retrospective design precludes inferences which could have been made from a prospectively designed randomized trial. This study focuses on the serum creatinine definition of KDIGO classification as diuresis data was not available in a sufficiently comprehensive manner to be included into the analysis; however, this affects all treatment and age groups equally and should therefore not skew the analysis, despite a tendency to potentially underestimate the incidence of AKI. Furthermore, sensitivity of serum creatinine alone has been reported to be sufficient in detecting AKI and to be more precise than urinary output measures. This study does not have a control group of piperacillin monotherapy to allow for inferences towards whether the observed toxicity of vancomycin/piperacillin is attributable to vancomycin, piperacillin, or both. In light of the large body of evidence that suggests no individual toxicity of piperacillin, future studies will need to verify the exact mechanism underlying the observed phenomenon.

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^114tKcjm]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock however, target concentrations may be difficult to achieve due to the increased distribution volume and the presence of augmented renal clearance (ARC). These factors may lead to reduced trough concentrations and underdosing, leading to inadequate bacterial killing and possible treatment failure. Moreover, insufficient dosing may facilitate development of multidrug resistance. As vancomycin is renally cleared and distributes widely throughout the body, its pharmacokinetics may be altered from the pathophysiological alterations inherent to sepsis. Furthermore, these factors imply great interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics complicating accurate prediction of serum concentrations in septic patients.

Alternatively, the course of ICU patients may be complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI), in which case decreased vancomycin clearance and subsequent increased trough concentrations may cause toxicity. Should AKI worsen, renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required with drug clearance varying according to mode of RRT, dose of RRT delivered, filter material and surface area, and blood flow rate. As such, factors that may lead to underdosing as well as overdosing are to be considered. The above-mentioned conditions call for an altered dosing approach in critically ill patients compared with mild-to-moderately ill patients. Several investigators reported on pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients but most studies are single centre designs and there is no insight in current practice - and therefore in pharmacokinetics variability - across ICUs.

The objective of this study was to describe the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients and to examine whether contemporary antibiotic dosing for ICU patients achieves concentrations that are associated with favourable response in previous reports. We hypothesised that vancomycin target trough concentrations and AUC 0–24 /MIC are frequently not achieved and demonstrate considerable variability in critically ill patients. Furthermore, we investigated the role of continuous infusion of vancomycin. We also studied factors associated with favourable pharmacokinetic outcome (trough concentration ≥ 15 mg/L and AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio > 400).

### Co-administration of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is associated with increased renal dysfunction in adult and pediatric burn patients [^114VyBF9]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

With regard to endpoints that surpass the 7-day study window, there was an increased incidence of hemodialysis after antibiotic treatment with vancomycin/piperacillin in the adult patient population. Furthermore, all but one patient who progressed to RRT belonged to the vancomycin/piperacillin cohort. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as they may have been confounded by a multitude of clinical variables during the time after exposure to vancomycin/piperacillin. This is, in part, supported by the fact that only less than half of subjects who progressed to RRT were identified with a KDIGO-positive event during their initial 7-day study period

The mechanistic explanation of our findings remains elusive; nephrotoxicity of vancomycin is thought to be caused by oxidative stress and acute tubular necrosis, which in turn can be promoted by product impurities, pre-existing renal dysfunction, concomitant critical illness, and increased doses and duration of administration. Quite recent experimental data by Luque et al. elucidated the matter further by describing a distinct cast-nephropathy caused by nanospheric intratubular vancomycin aggregates in mice and humans (cit). Most clinical studies do not report incidences of vancomycin-associated acute renal dysfunction of more than 5%. Piperacillin-tazobactam in comparison to other β-lactam antibiotics has been associated with impaired renal recovery by some study groups, and an additive detrimental effect on renal function in combination with vancomycin has been proposed. It has been suggested that piperacillin may decrease vancomycin clearance, thus leading to increased accumulation and dose-dependent nephrotoxicity of vancomycin. However, this is unlikely to be the case, as comparable doses of vancomycin were administered regardless of the co-administered agent and that administration of vancomycin itself was monitored closely by trough measurements.

### High-dose intravenous vancomycin therapy and the risk of nephrotoxicity [^116SZZKC]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

National guidelines recommend higher serum trough concentrations when using vancomycin to treat certain clinical conditions, but there is concern that higher-dose vancomycin therapy causes nephrotoxicity. We evaluated risk factors associated with nephrotoxicity in patients receiving high-dose intravenous vancomycin.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated the clinical outcome of 80 hospitalized adult patients with normal baseline renal function who received ≥ 4 g/d of intravenous vancomycin for ≥ 48 hours between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. After abstracting clinical risk factors, we used an analysis by methods of best clinical subsets to develop a multivariable model predicting nephrotoxicity in patients receiving high-dose vancomycin.

Findings

The overall rate of nephrotoxicity in the study population was 6%. Trough concentrations > 20 mg/L were identified in a similar proportion of patients who did and did not develop nephrotoxicity. Patients who developed nephrotoxicity trended toward having a lower body mass index, higher daily dose, longer duration of therapy, and greater exposure to intravenous contrast and nephrotoxic medications. In a multivariable model, the combination of intravenous contrast and nephrotoxic medications was a significant predictor of nephrotoxicity, and duration of high-dose vancomycin was a significant confounder.

Implications

Administration of high-dose intravenous vancomycin may have less associated nephrotoxicity than previously reported, although duration of vancomycin therapy may play a role. Concomitant exposure to intravenous contrast and other nephrotoxic medications is a more significant predictor of developing nephrotoxicity than vancomycin dose or trough.

### The association between vancomycin trough concentrations and acute kidney injury in the neonatal intensive care unit [^115GgVNk]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

There has been an on-going debate on the dosage, frequency of administration and the most appropriate monitoring of vancomycin therapy. This is the result of multiple factors responsible for clearance of vancomycin including gestational age, post-natal age, weight, renal tubular function and creatinine levels. Historically, area-under-the-curve concentration versus time to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC), was accepted as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic predictor of adequate treatment with vancomycin. AUC: MIC > 400 has been recommended to achieve desired anti-microbial effect in both adult and pediatric populations. A consensus statement released by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists in 2009 recommended vancomycin as the first choice drug for MRSA with MIC < 2. The consensus statement also recommends assessment of vancomycin clinical effectiveness through serum vancomycin trough concentrations at steady state. Studies have demonstrated that trough between 7–10 mg/L corresponds to AUC:MIC > 400 if the MIC of MRSA is < 1. However, with increasing MIC's higher trough concentrations are recommended. In serious clinical infections such as endocarditis, meningitis, hospital-acquired pneumonia, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis trough concentrations between 15–20 are recommended. These higher troughs allow for greater vancomycin exposure, a higher AUC and the ability to reach the goal AUC:MIC ≥ 400, or a trough concentration approximately four to five times the MIC of the infecting organism. Concerns for increased nephrotoxicity, an adverse effect traditionally associated with vancomycin, has accompanied the recommendation for more aggressive dosing.

In adults, increasing serum vancomycin trough concentrations have been associated with increasing incidence of AKI. In a study done to evaluate vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity incidence in adults with MRSA infections with serum trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L and receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications, a significantly higher incidence of AKI was noted. A 2011 prospective study also showed similar results. Adults with MRSA infections had a greater risk of AKI with serum vancomycin trough concentration greater than 15 mg/L. Similarly, adults with MRSA pneumonia were shown to be at a 3–5 times greater risk for developing AKI with vancomycin serum trough concentrations of 15 mg/L. On the other hand, there are other studies in adults which did not show increased risk of AKI with elevated serum vancomycin trough > 15 mg/L. In study done by Prabaker et al. an overall incidence of 2.1% was noticed with vancomycin serum trough concentration between 15–20 mg/L.

### Vancomycin-associated acute interstitial nephritis in a patient with infective endocarditis [^1131B3ti]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Vancomycin, a bacterial cell wall inhibitor, can cause nephrotoxicity, typically presenting as acute tubular necrosis (ATN) but, in rare cases, can lead to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Risk factors include high doses, prolonged use, other nephrotoxic drugs and pre-existing kidney impairment. This case describes a man in his 70s with multiple comorbidities who developed AIN after 9days of vancomycin therapy for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection from infective endocarditis. His serum creatinine rose from 1.2 to 5.5mg/dL, correlating with a supratherapeutic vancomycin level (40 mcg/mL). Despite stopping vancomycin, his renal function continued to worsen, leading to a diagnosis of AIN confirmed by renal biopsy. Despite high-dose corticosteroids, haemodialysis was required to stabilise renal function, emphasising the importance of early monitoring of vancomycin levels to mitigate nephrotoxicity risks.

### Intravenous vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring in children: evaluation of a pharmacy-driven protocol and collaborative practice agreement [^1145EVMN]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vancomycin optimization is challenging, requiring careful therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to avoid toxicity and ensure an efficacious concentration. Most prescriptions are empiric and often discontinued within 72 hours, which makes early TDM unnecessary. Although TDM using trough levels is common, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is the preferred pharmacodynamic target. We studied the effect of a pharmacy-driven vancomycin collaborative practice agreement (CPA) at a children's hospital that delayed TDM up to 72 hours and targeted a 2-point 24-hour AUC of ≥ 400 mg × h/L.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed vancomycin courses in patients aged ≥ 30 days who received vancomycin between April 1, 2011, and August 30, 2017. We implemented the CPA on June 1, 2014. Outcomes included CPA use, use of TDM, dosage adjustments, and development of acute kidney injury; we compared courses given while monitoring only trough levels (TO-TDM) with those given while using the CPA (AUC-TDM). We performed interrupted time series analyses to account for preintervention trends.

Results

We included 2379 courses in the TO-TDM period and 2155 in the AUC-TDM period. During AUC-TDM, 87% of the courses were managed by the CPA. In adjusted interrupted time series analyses, CPA implementation was associated with an initial change in level of -0.265 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.336 to -0.189) TDM and an initial change in level of -0.332 (95% CI, -0.506 to -0.163) dosage adjustments. The 1-year risk of acute kidney injury decreased after CPA implementation (odds ratio, 0.695 [95% CI, 0.539–0.91]).

Conclusion

The pharmacy-driven vancomycin CPA resulted in less monitoring and fewer dose adjustments without increasing AKI.

Background

Current recommendations are to dose vancomycin to target 24-hour area under the curve (AUC) of 400–600 mg·h/L to optimize efficacy and safety. Limited data support AUC monitoring, and some centers continue to use trough concentrations. A target of 10–20 mg/L has been proposed to reduce nephrotoxicity risk.

Objective

To use previously published pharmacokinetic equations in a Monte Carlo simulation relating AUC exposure to trough concentrations when targeting an AUC between 400 and 600 mg·h/L.

Methods

Previously published pharmacokinetic data were used as input parameters for a Monte Carlo simulation using previously published formulae to correlate AUC to simulated trough concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assumed to occur in a normal distribution pattern. We excluded irrelevant simulated cases. Maintenance doses of 15 mg/kg were rounded to the nearest 250 mg. Calculated trough concentrations for AUCs of both 400 and 600 mg·h/L were evaluated in each simulation.

Results

A total of 10000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed. Targeting an AUC of 400 mg·h/L resulted in a mean trough concentration of 10.3 ± 0.8 mg/L. Targeting an AUC of 600 mg·h/L resulted in a mean trough concentration of 15.4 ± 1.2 mg/L.

Conclusion and Relevance

We demonstrate that a lower trough concentration range may be supported by an AUC of 400–600 mg·h/L, which may reduce risk and rates of nephrotoxicity without compromising previously established efficacious target trough concentrations.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^112UcR34]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin exposure–related acute kidney injury (AKI) — data suggest risk rises with higher trough concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) exposures, particularly when troughs are maintained above 15 to 20 mg/L and when daily AUC exceeds 650 to 1,300 mg·h/L; in cohorts, AKI was more frequent with AUC 600–800 mg·h/L than 400–600 mg·h/L (P = 0.014), increased 2.5-fold when AUC was above 1,300 mg·h/L vs lower values (30.8% vs 13.1%, P = 0.002), and AUC thresholds of ≥ 1,218 mg·h/L for 0 to 48 hours, ≥ 677 for 0 to 24 hours, and ≥ 683 for 24 to 48 hours or troughs of ≥ 18.2 mg/L were associated with a 3- to 4-fold increased risk; risk increased stepwise along the day 2 AUC continuum with values of ≥ 793 mg·h/L at greatest risk, and additional risk factors include increased body weight, pre-existing renal dysfunction, critical illness, and concurrent nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, amphotericin B, intravenous (i.v.) contrast, vasopressors, piperacillin/ tazobactam, and flucloxacillin.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^11418XMv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

VANCOMYCIN TROUGH LEVELS

Many studies have assessed the relationship between trough levels as a measure of exposure and VANT. In general, there is a major issue with reverse causation, in that reduced kidney function from any cause will lead to an elevated trough level. In an effort to reduce this bias, some studies consider only the initial trough level. Even that, however, does not obviate kidney injury from another cause. Some studies consider mean trough levels, others maximal troughs.

A dose–response relationship has been shown repeatedly. Lodise et al. found a 5% rate of nephrotoxicity if the initial trough was < 10 mg/L compared to rates of 21% for troughs of 10–15 mg/L, 20% for 15–20 mg/L, and 33% for > 20 mg/L (P < 0.05). 58 For each mg/L increase, the OR for nephrotoxicity increased by 13%. Horey et al. found nephrotoxicity rates of 5%, 3%, 11%, 24%, and 82% for maximal troughs of 5–10 mg/L, 10.1–15, 15.1–20, 20.1–35, and > 35, respectively. 48 Similarly, Barriere et al. showed that renal adverse events occurred in 0% of patients with median trough levels < 10 mg/L compared to 3% if 10– < 15 and 17% if > 15 (P < 0.01). 28 Cano et al. found that nephrotoxicity increased from 7% at initial trough < 10 mg/L, but increased up to 34% at > 20 mg/L (P = 0.0003 for trend). 60 Wunderink et al. noted 18% nephrotoxicity with day 3 trough < 15 mg/L vs. 22% at 15–20 mg/L vs. 37% if ≥ 20 mg/L (significance not assessed). 70 In contrast, Kullar et al. found no more significant nephrotoxicity with troughs of 15–20 mg/L (13%) compared to 10–15 mg/L (17%) and < 10 mg/L (15%), although the rate was significantly higher if > 20 mg/L (27%, P = 0.032). 61 The question remains as to whether higher exposure as reflected in higher troughs causes VANT or whether trough levels rise as a result of its occurrence.

### Review of vancomycin-induced renal toxicity: an update [^114ZbtRi]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

In recent times the use of larger doses of vancomycin aimed at curbing the increasing incidence of resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus has led to a wider report of acute kidney injury (AKI). Apart from biological plausibility, causality is implied by the predictive association of AKI with larger doses, longer duration, and graded plasma concentrations of vancomycin. AKI is more likely to occur with the concurrent use of nephrotoxic agents, and in critically ill patients who are susceptible to poor renal perfusion. Although most vancomycin-induced AKI cases are mild and therefore reversible, their occurrence may be associated with greater incidence of end-stage kidney disease and higher mortality rate. The strategy for its prevention includes adequate renal perfusion and therapeutic drug monitoring in high-risk individuals. In the near future, there is feasibility of renoprotective use of antioxidative substances in the delivery of vancomycin.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Neonatal vancomycin pharmacokinetics and AUC–trough targets — Monte Carlo simulations with Bayesian estimation found that trough concentrations ranging from 7 to 11 mg/L were highly predictive of an AUC24 of > 400 mg·h/L in at least 90% of neonates, and dosages to achieve this target ranged from 15 to 20 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours depending on postmenstrual age and SCr. In a study of 243 neonates with 734 vancomycin concentrations, a trough concentration of 11 mg/L predicted the attainment of an AUC of ≥ 400 mg·h/L in 93% of neonates, but a trough concentration alone did not precisely predict AUC and Bayesian approaches to support dosing decisions for neonates in the clinical setting are needed. A model-based dosing calculator improved attainment of a serum concentration of 15 to 25 mg/L from 41% to 72% without any cases of AKI. The incidence of vancomycin-associated AKI reported in neonates has been low, ranging from 1% to 9%, and in a large, retrospective, multicenter, propensity score–matched cohort study AKI was not associated with vancomycin alone but may occur in the presence of other recognized risk factors.

### Biopsy-proven vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury: a case report and literature review [^111dG4oA]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous vancomycin (VCM) is the antibiotic of first choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis infections. The increasing use of higher VCM doses has led to a higher incidence of VCM-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), particularly in patients with risk factors such as hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit, obesity, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease, although most of the evidence was based on observational studies. The mechanism behind VCM-induced AKI is still uncertain; however, animal models and a few biopsy-proven cases have shown that VCM could induce acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and/or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A common strategy for preventing and treating VCM-induced AKI is monitoring plasma VCM levels and subsequent VCM withdrawal as necessary. Haemodialysis, particularly high-flux haemodialysis, may be useful in a more effective removal of VCM in some cases. Alternatively, oral prednisone has been tested in the cases of AIN. Here we present a biopsy-proven case of VCM-induced AKI in a patient with Fournier gangrene and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and review previous published cases.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^113zXtF6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

CLINICAL VANCOMYCIN NEPHROTOXICITY

The Guidelines define nephrotoxicity as a rise in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dl or 50% above baseline on two consecutive measurements after several days of vancomycin and with no other apparent cause. This is the definition used most frequently, although other studies use the more sensitive risk‐injury‐failure‐loss‐ESRD (RIFLE) 48, 49 or AKI network (AKIN) 50 criteria for AKI (Table 2). Herein, VANT refers to the Guideline‐based definition of nephrotoxicity and AKI to either the RIFLE or AKIN criteria. Studies using these latter criteria have found most cases to be of lower stages based on creatinine criteria. In one study using AKIN criteria, 92% reached stage 1, 50 whereas in two studies using RIFLE criteria, 50% 48 and 71% 51 reached only R. No study has specified VANT or AKI stage based purely on urine output criteria. Older studies showed mean increases of serum creatinine from baseline of ∼1–1.5 mg/dl. 52

### Reducing acute kidney injury due to vancomycin in trauma patients [^111pETFq]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Supratherapeutic vancomycin trough levels are common after trauma and associated with both increased acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality. We sought to limit the adverse effects of vancomycin in trauma patients through more frequent trough monitoring.

Methods

Beginning in January 2011, trauma patients treated with vancomycin had trough levels (VT) monitored daily until steady state was reached. Trauma patients admitted from January 2011 to May 2015 (POST) were compared with those admitted from January 2006 to December 2010 (PRE). Inclusion criteria required administration of intravenous vancomycin, admission serum creatinine (SCr), and SCr within 72 hours of highest VT. Acute kidney injury was defined as an increase in SCr of at least 0.3 mg/dL or 50% from admission to post-vancomycin administration. Those in the POST group were prospectively followed up until discharge or death.

Results

Two hundred sixty-three patients met inclusion criteria in the PRE-phase and 115 in the POST-phase. The two groups were similar in age, gender, race, body mass index, pre-existing comorbidities, admission systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale, and head Abbreviated Injury Scale. Injury Severity Score was higher in the POST cohort (18 PRE vs. 25 POST, p < 0.001). Compared with PRE, the POST cohort had lower rates of supratherapeutic VT (> 20 mg/L) (34.6% PRE vs. 22.6% POST, p = 0.02) and AKI (30.4% PRE vs. 19.1% POST, p = 0.026). After adjusting for confounders, the POST group had a significantly lower risk of AKI with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.457 (p = 0.027). There was a trend toward decreased mortality in the POST cohort, but this did not reach significance (10% PRE vs. 5.2% POST, p = 0.162).

Conclusions

A reduction in AKI was observed in trauma patients with daily vancomycin trough levels monitored until steady state. Increased awareness regarding closer surveillance of VT in trauma patients may limit the incidence of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic study, level IV.

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^1134EGGK]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

These standard definitions will become increasingly important when designing tools within the EMR to screen for DIKD. Such screening tools have been successful at identifying AKI and guiding the physician on the need for nephrology consultation. Pharmacovigilence programs can identify patients who have been exposed to nephrotoxic medications and develop AKI with high serum drug concentrations. Additionally, these electronic screening tools can be customized. At risk patients, such as those receiving multiple nephrotoxins or prolonged nephrotoxin exposures, can be targeted. Identification of such patients can prompt interventions such as intensified Scr monitoring and improve the recovery of DIKD. However, electronic screening and identification cannot establish causality. These tools are limited due to the complex interplay of risk factor assessment, concurrent multi-drug exposures, lack of TDM, comorbid conditions and lack of kidney damage biomarkers. It is important that DIKD cases are adjudicated for causality and an attribution of risk is estimated for each contributing drug or risk factor. In the case of vancomycin, a pharmaco-vigilence program identified 32% of patients exposed to vancomycin with high trough concentrations and AKI. However, when the cases were adjudicated, only 8.4% of AKI cases were attributed to vancomycin toxicity. Attribution of risk from each potential risk factor or from each causal drug in the case of multi-drug injury is difficult since these assessments are based on the individual patient presentation and might reflect a substantial degree of subjectivity depending on the adjudicator's knowledge of DIKD and AKI epidemiology. We recommend when evaluating cases of DIKD, the consulting nephrologist document their causality assessment in the medical record including a percent attribution assigned to each causal drug with an overall likelihood to cause the DIKD, as well as a percent attribution for each of the identified concurrent AKI risk factors. Adverse event causality scoring tools exist for general adverse events as well as drug induced liver and skin injury (Naranjo, Rucam, Liverpool), however, these tools have not been evaluated for the causality scoring of DIKD. Previous genomic studies of drug induced liver and skin injury have employed adjudication of cases by unbiased hepatologists or immunologists/dermatologists, respectively. Often, published case reports lack the evaluation of causality using these scoring systems or adjudication. As the body of knowledge surrounding DIKD increases, we recommend employing these scoring tools in addition to adjudication of cases by a secondary nephrologist when publishing case reports or series.

### Effect of N-acetylcysteine on antimicrobials induced nephrotoxicity: a meta-analysis [^113NdoVy]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effect of NAC in three RCTs. They found that NAC treatment significantly reduced incidence of antimicrobials induced nephrotoxicity (including colistin, vancomycin, and amphotericin B). Meanwhile, NAC treatment reduced Scr levels on Day 2.

Medication-induced nephrotoxicity accounts for about one-fourth of all acute kidney injury (AKI) cases among hospitalized patients. It is well established that antibiotics and other antimicrobials are among the most commonly implicated medications in the development of AKI. These agents have been identified as significant contributors to structural and functional renal impairment. A multiplicity of mechanisms has been delineated, though the most prevalent are acute interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, intratubular crystal deposition, and proximal/distal tubulopathy with electrolyte wasting abnormalities. Therefore, the utilization of specific anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pharmaceutical agents to avert antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity represents a crucial strategy.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is recognized for the mechanism of antimicrobials associated with nephrotoxicity. ATN refers to cellular deterioration and sloughing of the proximal and distal basement membranes. Damaged mitochondria lead to cytotoxicity in the tubules, a disrupted tubular transport mechanism and an increase in oxidative stress caused by the production of free radicals. NAC exhibits its antioxidant property in several ways, including interaction with the electrophilic groups of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and acting as a precursor to glutathione (GSH). The deleterious effects of oxidative stress and the beneficial impact of NAC have been substantiated in sepsis, reperfusion-ischemia, and drug-induced nephrotoxicity. The biological functions of NAC are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of antimicrobials-induced nephrotoxicity. Given the inconsistency of results observed across multiple clinical trials investigating the efficacy of NAC in reducing nephrotoxicity, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to gain further insight into this area of research.

### Teicoplanin versus vancomycin for proven or suspected infection [^114sYkUY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin and teicoplanin are commonly used to treat gram-positive infections, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There is uncertainty regarding the effects of teicoplanin compared to vancomycin on kidney function with some previous studies suggesting teicoplanin is less nephrotoxic than vancomycin.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin versus teicoplanin in patients with proven or suspected infection.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of nephrology textbooks, review articles with relevant studies and sent letters seeking information about unpublished or incomplete studies to investigators involved in previous studies.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language comparing teicoplanin to vancomycin for patients with proven or suspected infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted data using standardised data extraction forms. Study investigators were contacted for information not available in the original manuscripts. Random effects model was used to estimate the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included 24 studies (2,610 patients) in this review. Teicoplanin reduced the risk of nephrotoxicity compared to vancomycin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.90). The effects of teicoplanin or vancomycin were similar for clinical cure (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.08), microbiological cure (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03) and mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to1.30). Six studies reported no cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) needing dialysis. Adverse events were less frequent with teicoplanin including cutaneous rash (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.92), red man syndrome (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.59) and total adverse events (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.00). A lower risk of nephrotoxicity with teicoplanin was observed in patients either with (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.88) or without aminoglycosides (RR 0.31, 95% 0.07 to 1.50), and also when vancomycin dosing was guided by serum levels (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.52).

Authors' Conclusions

Teicoplanin and vancomycin are both effective in treating those with proven or suspected infection; however the incidence of adverse effects including nephrotoxicity was lower with teicoplanin. There were no cases of AKI needing dialysis. It remains unclear whether the differential effect on kidney function should influence which antibiotic be prescribed, although it may be reasonable to consider teicoplanin for patients at higher risk for AKI needing dialysis.

### Vancomycin trough and acute kidney injury: a large retrospective, cohort study [^114iEPVC]. American Journal of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The association between vancomycin trough (VT) and acute kidney injury (AKI) at the recommended doses remains controversial.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of 500 adult patients who received vancomycin for ≥ 72 h. Data collected included 2 main predictors: average VT (including only VTs before the occurrence of AKI), first VT and other possible risk factors for AKI. The baseline characteristics/variables between patients with AKI and patients with no AKI were compared. Logistic regression models were used to develop multivariate models. The authors divided the patients into 4 subgroups: (1) VT < 10, (2) 10 ≤ VT < 15, (3) 15 ≤ VT < 20 and (4) VT ≥ 20 µg/ml. All subgroups were compared to subgroup 2 (reference group).

Results

AKI occurred in 12.85% of patients while on vancomycin. The incidence of AKI in subgroups 1–4 was 8.02, 13.61, 13.70 and 31.82%, respectively, using the first VT, that is significantly higher in subgroup 4. Using average VT, AKI incidence was 5, 10.38, 19.01 and 25.58%, respectively, that is significantly higher in subgroups 3 and 4. On multivariate logistic regression, average VT, first VT, average VT > 15, first VT > 15, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and morbid obesity were significantly associated with increased incidence of AKI.

Conclusion

Clinicians should be careful when aiming for a VT > 15 μg/ml as this is associated with increased incidence of AKI.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^115BJDoA]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric vancomycin exposure targets — dosing in children should be designed to achieve an AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L); this PK target range, specifically a range closer to an AUC/ MIC of 400 rather than 600, has been widely used by investigators to model pediatric dosing and therapeutic monitoring. With inadequate PK studies and outcomes data to support the higher end of the AUC target range in pediatrics, it is prudent to aim for an AUC/MIC of 400 in pediatrics to limit the development of exposure-related AKI. In pediatrics, an AUC/MIC target of 400 is more readily achievable than it is in adults and correlates to trough concentrations of 7 to 10 mg/L rather than concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L as are reported in adults, and this wide variability in trough concentrations between these populations with regard to achieving an AUC/ MIC of 400 corroborates the need for an AUC-guided approach to dosing and monitoring.

### An overview of drug-induced acute kidney injury [^113YFVgJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The complex nature of critical illness often necessitates the use of multiple therapeutic agents, many of which may individually or in combination have the potential to cause renal injury. The use of nephrotoxic drugs has been implicated as a causative factor in up to 25% of all cases of severe acute renal failure in critically ill patients. Acute tubular necrosis is the most common form of renal injury from nephrotoxin exposure, although other types of renal failure may be seen. Given that this is a preventable cause of a potentially devastating complication, a comprehensive strategy should be used to avoid nephrotoxicity in critically ill patients including: accurate estimation of pre-existing renal function using serum creatinine-based glomerular filtration rates, avoidance of nephrotoxins if possible, ongoing monitoring of renal function, and immediate discontinuation of suspected nephrotoxins in the event of renal dysfunction.

### Recent changes in vancomycin use in renal failure [^116Edsz1]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key tool in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. A progressive increase in vancomycin resistance with consequent treatment failure has been observed in staphylococci. Therefore, new dosing guidelines advocating much higher vancomycin doses have been issued. Target trough levels of 15–20 microg/ml are proposed. Whether and how these targets can be achieved in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis are still under evaluation. The higher vancomycin doses to achieve these treatment targets carry a substantial risk for nephrotoxicity. This risk is incremental with higher trough levels and longer duration of vancomycin use. Critically ill patients, patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, and patients with already compromised renal function are particularly at risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.

### The relationship of nephrotoxicity to vancomycin trough serum concentrations in a veteran's population: a retrospective analysis [^112TJuTU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity varies greatly depending on the trough concentration. Recent guidelines suggest target vancomycin trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L as a predictor of efficacy in the treatment of severe gram-positive infections. Limited data exist quantifying the risk for nephrotoxicity with various ranges of vancomycin troughs.

Objective

To determine the occurrence of nephrotoxicity during vancomycin therapy and up to 72 hours after its completion, in relation to the maximum trough concentration value, and identify risk factors that impact nephrotoxicity associated with vancomycin use.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of veterans with a baseline serum creatinine less than 2 mg/dL who received 48 or more hours of vancomycin therapy and had 1 or more vancomycin trough samples obtained within 96 hours of therapy initiation from January 1, 2006, to November 1, 2008, to determine the occurrence of nephrotoxicity (as defined by RIFLE [Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease] criteria).

Results

Thirty-four (12.6%) patients developed nephrotoxicity. In multiple logistic regression analysis, maximum trough concentrations (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.20), documented hypotension (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 16.4), and weight (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.03) were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of nephrotoxicity. Once stratified into ranges of 5–10 mg/L (4.9%), 10.1–15 mg/L (3.1%), 15.1–20 mg/L (10.6%), 20.1–35 mg/L (23.6%), and greater than 35 mg/L (81.8%), increasing trough ranges were associated with a subsequently higher risk of nephrotoxicity.

Conclusions

In the population evaluated, hypotension and trough concentrations were predictors of nephrotoxicity; elevated vancomycin trough concentration had the highest odds of association. These data reinforce the close therapeutic monitoring guidelines for vancomycin trough concentrations, especially when targeting troughs of 15–20 mg/L.

### Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury in Hong Kong in 2012–2016 [^111xXLke]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the incidence of VA-AKI in Hong Kong is low but shows no decline. As there is increased usage of vancomycin to combat MRSA, there should be increased awareness of VA-AKI. Patients with higher baseline creatinine, chronic diseases and multiple drugs are at risk of VA-AKI and should have their vancomycin level monitored. Our findings facilitate the development of strategies and guidelines to prevent vancomycin-associated AKI.

### Aminoglycoside impregnated cement spacer precipitating acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis [^111Bg94P]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

The current standard of care for prosthetic joint infection includes two-stage arthroplasty, with antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers (ACS) utilized between the stages. We report a 75-year-old woman with previously normal renal function, who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to biopsy-proven acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis after ACS placement containing tobramycin and vancomycin. Peak tobramycin level measured 25.3 mcg/mL, the highest value reported in the literature after ACS placement. Intermittent hemodialysis was initiated with subsequent full recovery of renal function. This paper reviews the published literature regarding the accumulation, toxicity and removal dynamics of aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics and vancomycin in renal patients. Obtaining serum AG level should be strongly considered in patients experiencing AKI after ACS. Renal replacement therapy may assist in reducing toxic AG levels.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^115VvJhz]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin in serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — AUC-based targets and MIC considerations state that daily AUC values (assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L) should be maintained between 400 and 600 mg·h/L to maximize efficacy and minimize the likelihood of acute kidney injury (AKI). MIC utility is limited because the BMD MIC90 in most institutions is 1 mg/L or less, measurement is imprecise with dilution of ± 1 log and a variation of 10% to 20% considered acceptable, and results are typically not available within the first 72 hours even though the vancomycin AUC/MIC ratio needs to be optimized early in infection; additionally, trough-only monitoring may be insufficient to guide dosing in all patients.

### Increasing vancomycin serum trough concentrations and incidence of nephrotoxicity [^1113szqG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

conflicting evidence regarding the association of vancomycin serum concentrations with efficacy and toxicity has resulted in controversy regarding optimal target concentrations. Recent publications recommend attaining higher vancomycin trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L for target infections, yet limited research is available assessing the correlation of vancomycin serum concentrations with toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between vancomycin serum trough concentrations and nephrotoxicity.

Methods

a 2-phase retrospective analysis was completed. Phase 1 evaluated 2493 courses of vancomycin completed between January 2003 and December 2007. The analysis describes a 5-year trend in vancomycin prescribing practices and assesses the association of nephrotoxicity with baseline serum creatinine, vancomycin serum trough concentrations, and duration of vancomycin therapy. Phase 2 examined patients receiving vancomycin therapy during 2007 to evaluate specific risk factors for development of nephrotoxicity.

Results

the proportion of vancomycin serum trough concentrations ≥ 15 mg/L and ≥ 20 mg/L increased significantly over time. Statistical analysis identified vancomycin serum trough concentrations ≥ 14 mg/L, duration of vancomycin therapy ≥ 7 days, and baseline serum creatinine levels ≥ 1.7 mg/dL as independent predictors of nephrotoxicity. Phase 2 analysis again implicated mean vancomycin serum trough concentration as a significant predictor of nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity resolved in 81% (17/21) of cases evaluated.

Conclusions

a higher vancomycin serum trough concentration and prolonged vancomycin therapy are associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity. The decision to target increased vancomycin trough concentrations should be based on an assessment of the severity of the infection and must consider the nephrotoxicity risk associated with increased vancomycin levels.

### AKI in a hospitalized patient with cellulitis [^114r3tY7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

AKI occurs commonly in hospitalized patients with multiple comorbidities. In this Attending Rounds, a woman with AKI in the setting of an infection, use of antibiotics and other medications, bacteremia, and hypotension is considered. Such patients lead to a broad differential diagnosis for AKI including prerenal AKI, acute tubular injury/acute tubular necrosis, infection-related GN, and drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis. The roles of an accurate history, physical examination, laboratory data, and kidney biopsy are highlighted in establishing the correct diagnosis in such patients.

### Acute kidney injury following the concurrent administration of antipseudomonal β-lactams and vancomycin: a network meta-analysis [^113GCpSC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury is a major complication of vancomycin treatment, especially when it is co-administered with other nephrotoxins.

Objectives

This meta-analysis aims to comparatively assess the nephrotoxicity of antipseudomonal β-lactams when combined with vancomycin.

Data Sources

Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were systematically searched from inception through 20 August 2019.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Studies evaluating acute kidney injury risk following the concurrent use of antipseudomonal β-lactams and vancomycin were selected.

Participants

Adult and paediatric patients treated in hospital or intensive care unit.

Interventions

Administration of vancomycin combined with any antipseudomonal β-lactam.

Methods

Acute kidney injury incidence was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included severity, onset, duration, need of renal replacement therapy, length of hospitalization and mortality. Quality of evidence was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool and the Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis approach.

Results

Forty-seven cohort studies were included, with a total of 56 984 patients. In the adult population, the combination of piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin resulted in significantly higher nephrotoxicity rates than vancomycin monotherapy (odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.17–3.46) and its concurrent use with meropenem (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.02–3.10) or cefepime (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.13–2.77). In paediatric patients, acute kidney injury was significantly higher with vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam than vancomycin alone (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.01–17.29) or vancomycin plus cefepime OR 3.71, 95% CI 1.08–11.24). No significant differences were estimated for the secondary outcomes. Credibility of outcomes was judged as moderate, mainly due to imprecision and inter-study heterogeneity.

Conclusions

The combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is associated with higher acute kidney injury rates than its parallel use with meropenem or cefepime. Current evidence is exclusively observational and is limited by inter-study heterogeneity. Randomized controlled trials are needed to verify these results and define preventive strategies to minimize nephrotoxicity risk.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^111Bdg38]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

SEVERITY OF ILLNESS

Severity of illness impacts development of AKI in patients receiving vancomycin. In less sick patients, VANT is uncommon (< 5%). For example, in prospective RCTs restricted to vancomycin use for complicated skin and skin structure infections, adverse renal event rates of 2.7% 83 and 3.8% 84 were reported, although criteria of renal injury were not specified. In the critically ill, other causes of AKI besides vancomycin use frequently coexist, such as sepsis, hemodynamic stress, contrast exposure, and concurrent nephrotoxic medications, and AKI may develop in a quarter to a half of such patients. In observational studies of VANT, severity of illness, as assessed by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, 49, 85 Charlson Comorbidity Index, 72 Sequential Organ Failure Assesment, 76 or by residence in the ICU, 50, 58, 68 was found by multivariable analysis to be an independent risk factor for kidney dysfunction. Other comorbid conditions significantly associated with nephrotoxicity include hypotension 48, 72 heart failure, 74 cancer, 50, 73, 74 impaired kidney function, 50, 58 and prior AKI. 50

It remains uncertain to what degree vancomycin is directly responsible in any individual case when multiple factors are involved. The only RCT to date with a primary renal endpoint included 100 patients initially prescribed vancomycin with ≥ 2 risk factors for AKI who were randomized to either continue therapy as planned or use an alternative agent. 5 There was no difference between groups in either the Guideline‐based nephrotoxicity definition or AKIN defined AKI. Furthermore, equipoise remains as to whether a critically ill patient receiving vancomycin who develops AKI can continue therapy with TDM or should be switched to an alternative agent. More data are clearly needed to provide guidance in the critically ill.

### Vancomycin [^115V6J8A]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of vancomycin hydrochloride IV (also known as Vancocin):
- Allergic reactions: use extreme caution in patients undergoing rapid administration of the drug.
- Injection site hematoma, phlebitis, injection site necrosis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vancomycin is known to cause these adverse effects.
- Nephrotoxicity: use extreme caution in patients with renal impairment, especially in geriatric patients.
- Ototoxicity: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vancomycin has been associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity, especially in patients with underlying hearing loss, renal impairment, older patients, or those receiving higher doses or concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as aminoglycosides. Monitor serum concentrations of vancomycin and renal function in all patients receiving parenteral vancomycin. Consider obtaining serial auditory function tests to minimize the risk of ototoxicity.
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis: use caution in all patients.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^112cJep5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The potential mechanism of enhanced toxicity of this combination remains uncertain. Piperacillin‐tazobactam is not considered a nephrotoxin, but support for potential nephrotoxicity comes from post‐hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial of 1,200 critically ill patients which showed receipt of PTZ was associated with impaired renal recovery. 99 Acute interstitial nephritis has been reported with PTZ in case reports. It is possible that an AIN induced by PTZ could complicate toxic proximal tubulopathy or AIN induced by vancomycin.

In our opinion, the enhanced nephrotoxicity of this combination appears real. This regimen should be used carefully and only under the guidance of an antimicrobial stewardship program with TDM. In support, a recent retrospective study of 320 patients receiving vancomycin‐PTZ found an alarming 33% incidence of AKI. 100 Associated factors that were significantly associated with AKI and were potentially modifiable by antimicrobial stewardship included a vancomycin loading dose, longer duration of dual therapy, and concomitant nephrotoxins.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^1173CabP]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — AUC-guided therapeutic monitoring for vancomycin, preferably with Bayesian estimation, is suggested for all pediatric age groups based on developmental changes of vancomycin clearance (CL) documented from the newborn to the adolescent; the suggestion aligns with adults, including application of Bayesian estimation after 1 trough concentration or first-order pharmacokinetic (PK) equations with 2 concentrations (B-II). Both serum concentrations of vancomycin and renal function should be monitored since vancomycin CL and CLcr are not always well correlated in pediatrics, and aggressive dosing to maintain target AUC exposure and decrease the risk of potential acute kidney injury (AKI) in treatment of MRSA infection necessitates drug monitoring.

### Vancomycin hydrochloride (sterile vancomycin hydrochloride) [^112tBzcT]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

General

Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients being treated for active C. difficile -induced pseudomembranous colitis after multiple oral doses of vancomycin.

Prolonged use of vancomycin may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible microorganisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. In rare instances, there have been reports of pseudomembranous colitis due to C. difficile developing in patients who received intravenous vancomycin.

In order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity when treating patients with underlying renal dysfunction or patients receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside, serial monitoring of renal function should be performed and particular care should be taken in following appropriate dosing schedules (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity.

Reversible neutropenia has been reported in patients receiving vancomycin (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients who will undergo prolonged therapy with vancomycin or those who are receiving concomitant drugs which may cause neutropenia should have periodic monitoring of the leukocyte count.

Vancomycin is irritating to tissue and must be given by a secure intravenous route of administration. Pain, tenderness and necrosis occur with inadvertent extravasation. Thrombophlebitis may occur, the frequency and severity of which can be minimized by slow infusion of the drug and by rotation of venous access sites.

Table 2
Current criteria for diagnosing and staging acute kidney injury

Various novel blood and urine biomarkers have been studied for their ability to detect impending AKI prior to the standard measures, i.e. serum creatinine and urine output (Table 3). These include neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule‐1, insulin‐like growth factor‐binding protein 7, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases‐2, among others. 53 A number of these have been qualified by the FDA and European Medicines Agency for nonclinical animal toxicology evaluation of new drug entities. No studies have specifically addressed the utility of any biomarkers for the early detection of vancomycin nephrotoxicity in humans, although limited preclinical data exist. 54 An in‐depth discussion of biomarkers is beyond the scope of this article.

Table 3
Novel biomarkers

The onset of VANT typically occurs after about 4–8 days of therapy. A systematic review by van Hal et al. found a mean range of nephrotoxicity occurrence of 4.3–17 days after initiation of vancomycin. 55 Onset as early as 2 56 to 3 57 days of therapy has been reported. In general, about three‐quarters of patients will have improvement or resolution by the time of discharge, 2, 58, 59 often within a week or less, including patients remaining on vancomycin after onset of nephrotoxicity. Dialysis has been rarely necessary in any study, with an overall incidence of 3% in the van Hal et al. review. As expected, however, VANT is associated with increased mortality 50 and length of stay in the ICU 60 and hospital. 50, 61

The vast majority of patients with VANT do not undergo kidney biopsy. It is presumed that the underlying pathophysiology is toxicity to proximal tubular cells, with or without frank necrosis (ATN). In support, several case reports have documented ATN based on clinical evaluation or by renal biopsy. 62 Similarly, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been clinically diagnosed or documented by biopsy. 63 Occasionally, both lesions have been found on biopsy. 64 Various skin lesions have been reported in cases of vancomycin‐associated AIN, including maculopapular rash, erythema multiforme, 63 toxic epidermal necrolysis, 63 and the Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. 65 Infectious glomerulonephritis would also be a consideration when supported by the urinalysis. If there is clinical uncertainty, biopsy is indicated.

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^113QFrAZ]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Response

Treatment of nephrotoxicity is dependent on the phenotype, severity of the injury and the underlying condition for which the medication was prescribed. The decision to stop or reduce the dose of the offending drug requires a careful consideration of the risk versus benefit. In Type A reactions, dose reduction may be sufficient to mitigate the injury (e.g. vancomycin or gentamicin). However, stage 2 AKI often warrants drug discontinuation. In the setting of vancomycin DIKD, a critical appraisal of other therapeutic options and dose minimization is warranted. National guidelines on the use of vancomycin have recommended higher target trough concentrations to obtain a high area under the curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio. However, the level of evidence for this recommendation was grade IIIb (limited evidence). With the widespread adoption of this recommendation, the rate of nephrotoxicity has increased. Meta-analysis conducted found the incidence of nephrotoxicity to be between 5–43% and target trough concentrations > 15 ng/mL to have a 2.67 odds ratio for the development of nephrotoxicity. A more recent study of 1430 patients receiving vancomycin provides support for the association between concentrations and duration of therapy with risk of nephrotoxicity. Post hoc analysis of prospective studies have examined the need for higher targets and demonstrated equivocal or lower cure rates with trough concentrations above 15 ng/mL for the treatment of staphylococcus aureus nosocomial acquired pneumonia. Additionally, these studies have demonstrated that alternative treatments such as linezolid or telavancin could be considered. Based on these studies, we believe that DIKD from higher vancomycin trough concentrations is a real concern. However, prospective studies designed to evaluate the benefits and risks of high therapeutic concentrations need to be done. Type B DIKD, which is idiosyncratic, will require discontinuation of the offending drug and careful observation. Severe injuries or type B reactions often require longer periods of time to improve and may not completely resolve.

### Biopsy-proven vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury: a case report and literature review [^112nKecj]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, we present an adult patient with type 1 DM who developed VCM-induced AKI during treatment for Fournier gangrene. Early diagnosis and treatment led to the successful recovery of his renal function. This case suggests that more careful VCM-TDM and intensive monitoring of sCr and urinary output to detect AKI should be considered in VCM usage. For the diagnosis, renal biopsy of VCM induced AKI is useful to assessment prognostic and therapeutic option in cases at a high risk or those with other renal disorders. For the treatment, frequent haemodialysis could be useful in high concentration plasma VCM.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — Given the narrow vancomycin AUC range for therapeutic effect and minimal acute kidney injury (AKI) risk, the most accurate and optimal way to manage vancomycin dosing should be through AUC-guided dosing and monitoring (A-II). We recommend to accomplish this in one of two ways. One approach relies on the collection of 2 concentrations obtained near steady-state — a postdistributional peak concentration at 1 to 2 hours after infusion and a trough concentration at the end of the dosing interval — and utilizing first-order pharmacokinetic (PK) equations to estimate the AUC (A-II). It is also highly preferred that concentrations are collected near steady-state conditions.

### Population pharmacokinetic / toxicodynamic model for polymyxin B in critically ill patients to identify the risk of nephrotoxicity [^1155991N]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The final model identified sex as a significant covariate on SCr 0 with estimated values ranging from 0.56 to 5.04 mg/dL for males and 0.25 to 1.91 mg/dL for females. Differences in body composition between sexes significantly impact creatinine production. Other factors, such as patients treated concurrently with amikacin, appeared more sensitive to polymyxin B. A previous analysis of 129 patients treated with colistin found that concomitant use of aminoglycosides (P = 0.047) was significantly associated with increased nephrotoxicity. Amikacin, like other aminoglycosides, is nephrotoxic and causes tubular necrosis upon accumulation in the renal proximal tubular cells. Amikacin accumulation occurs via endocytic‐mediated transporters, megalin and cubulin, and via transient receptor potential cation channels TRPV1 and TRPV4.

Vancomycin, another nephrotoxic antibiotic, has also been identified as a risk factor for polymyxin B‐associated nephrotoxicity when used concomitantly. Patients treated with vancomycin showed increased sensitivity to polymyxin B, with lower polymyxin B concentrations inhibiting SCr elimination. Similar to polymyxin B, vancomycin‐associated nephrotoxicity occurs when vancomycin accumulates in renal proximal tubular cells via megalin to cause oxidative stress. A retrospective analysis of 192 adult patients with normal renal function who received polymyxin B identified concomitant vancomycin as a risk factor for developing nephrotoxicity (50% SCr increase; hazard ratio = 1.89; P = 0.003).

In the current study, amikacin and vancomycin were co‐administered only for a short duration during polymyxin B treatment, with amikacin and vancomycin given to 20 and 38 patients out of 117, respectively. While our PK/TD model could not include these concomitant nephrotoxic antibiotics, it is likely that the nephrotoxic effects of amikacin or vancomycin, in addition to the structural kidney injury caused by polymyxin B, make these patients highly susceptible to kidney injury.

### Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity: grave concern or death by character assassination? [^113ramNE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity was reported in 0% to 5% of patients in the 1980s. This has been confirmed by numerous clinical trials comparing novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents with vancomycin at the Food and Drug Administration-approved dosage of 1 g every 12 hours. Treatment failures of vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections have been reported despite in vitro susceptibility. These failures have led to the use of vancomycin doses higher than those approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Higher doses are being administered to achieve goal vancomycin trough concentrations of 10 to 20 microg/mL recommended by several clinical practice guidelines endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Recent studies suggest that increased rates of nephrotoxicity are associated with aggressive vancomycin dosing. These increased rates are confounded by concomitant nephrotoxins, renal insufficiency, or changing hemodynamics. These studies also have demonstrated that vancomycin's nephrotoxicity risk is minimal in patients without risk factors for nephrotoxicity. Clinicians unwilling to dose vancomycin in accordance with clinical practice guidelines should use an alternative agent because inadequate dosing increases the likelihood of selecting heteroresistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^114yvKui]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Vancomycin use is often associated with nephrotoxicity. It remains uncertain, however, to what extent vancomycin is directly responsible, as numerous potential risk factors for acute kidney injury frequently coexist. Herein, we critically examine available data in adult patients pertinent to this question. We review the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of vancomycin metabolism. Efficacy and safety data are discussed. The pathophysiology of vancomycin nephrotoxicity is considered. Risk factors for nephrotoxicity are enumerated, including the potential synergistic nephrotoxicity of vancomycin and piperacillin‐tazobactam. Suggestions for clinical practice and future research are given.

### Vancomycin area under the curve-guided dosing and monitoring for adult and pediatric patients with suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: putting the safety of our patients first [^114b2RdS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The revised vancomycin consensus guidelines recommended area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing/monitoring for patients with serious invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections as a measure to minimize vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) while maintaining similar effectiveness. Data indicate that the intensity of vancomycin exposure drives VA-AKI risk. Troughs of 15–20 mg/L will ensure an AUC ≥ 400 mg × hr/L but most patients will have daily AUCs > 600. VA-AKI increases as a function of AUC, especially when > 600. In addition to minimizing VA-AKI risk while maintaining similar efficacy, AUC-guided dosing/monitoring is a more precise way to conduct therapeutic drug monitoring for vancomycin relative to trough-only control.

### Relationship between initial vancomycin concentration-time profile and nephrotoxicity among hospitalized patients [^11418UTz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Data suggest that higher doses of vancomycin can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. No study has been undertaken to determine the pharmacodynamic index (ie, the area under the curve [AUC] or the trough value) that best describes the relationship between vancomycin exposure and onset of nephrotoxicity.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted among patients who received vancomycin for a suspected or proven gram-positive infection during the period from 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2006 at Albany Medical Center Hospital. Patients were included in our study if they (1) were ≥ 18 years old, (2) had an absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 1000 cells/mm(3), (3) received vancomycin for > 48 h, (4) had 1 vancomycin trough level collected within 96 h of vancomycin therapy, and (5) had a baseline serum creatinine level of < 2.0 mg/dL. Patients were excluded if they (1) had a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, (2) received intravenous contrast dye within 7 days of starting vancomycin or during therapy, or (3) required vasopressor support during therapy. Demographics, comorbid conditions, and treatment data were collected. The highest observed vancomycin trough value within 96 h of initiation of vancomycin therapy and the estimated vancomycin AUC were analyzed as measures of vancomycin exposure. The vancomycin AUC value from 0 to 24 h at steady state (in units of mg x h/L) for each patient was estimated by use of the maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian procedure in ADAPT II. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL or 50%, whichever was greater, following initiation of vancomycin therapy. Logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models identified the vancomycin pharmacodynamic index that best describes the relationship between vancomycin exposure and toxicity.

Results

During the study period, 166 patients met the inclusion criteria. Both initial vancomycin trough values and 0–24-h at steady state AUC values were associated with nephrotoxicity in the bivariate analyses. However, the vancomycin trough value, modeled as a continuous variable, was the only vancomycin exposure variable associated with nephrotoxicity in the multivariate analyses.

Conclusions

The results indicate that a vancomycin exposure-toxicity response relationship exists. The vancomycin trough value is the pharmacodynamic index that best describes this association.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^11549Bdx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS

Vancomycin is ∼50% protein‐bound, with a volume of distribution of 0.4–1.0 L/kg and a β‐elimination half‐life of 3–6 h with normal kidney function. 8 The drug is not metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Clearance is linearly related to the glomerular filtration rate. Penetration into tissues is variable, especially into pulmonary epithelial lining fluid in the critically ill, which is of obvious concern when treating MRSA pneumonia. 9

The bactericidal activity of vancomycin is considered time‐dependent but concentration‐independent. 10 Increasing concentrations of vancomycin are not associated with enhanced bacterial killing. 10 Rather, the ratio of the 24‐h AUC to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) is the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best correlated with effectiveness. 8 Consensus guidelines published in 2009 by the American Society of Health‐System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists (herein referred to as Guidelines) recommend an AUC/MIC of ≥ 400. 8 Available clinical evidence supports this ratio. 11, 12

The two most common ways to determine the MIC of staphylococci are broth microdilution (BMD) and the Etest, with the Etest result typically 0.5–1.5 times higher after log conversion. 13 Hence, a given AUC will result in a lower ratio if MIC is determined by the Etest. Of note, the Guidelines were derived from data generated using BMD. The BMD method only allows for 2‐fold dilutions, i.e. 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 mg/L, etc. whereas the Etest is based on a continuous gradient and can give greater discrimination with half‐dilution values (e.g. 1.5 mg/L). 14 In 2006 the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) lowered the MIC breakpoint for vancomycin susceptibility from ≤ 4 mg/L to ≤ 2 mg/L by BMD, owing to a greater chance for failure at ≥ 4 mg/L. 15

Limitations of the study

This was a prospective single-center study that included patients treated according to the center guideline, as other centers may have adopted different treatment approaches. The sample was representative and divided by age and other attributes that may affect the drug pharmacokinetics. However, important subgroups had a limited sample size, which may have undermined the statistical power to identify significant associations. In addition, important clinical values (SCr and trough level) were sometimes missing. Lastly, the SCr was the only marker used to identify patients developing AKI as per the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition of AKI. A different method of identification may have affected the AKI incidence. There was no control group (patients not taking vancomycin), which may have the possibility of confounding by indication. We believe that our analysis may offer the basis for future studies to be conducted for an increased period.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — adults and pediatrics: we recommend targeting an AUC/MICBMD ratio of 400 to 600 (assuming an MICBMD of 1 mg/L) for empiric dosing to maximize clinical efficacy and minimize AKI risk. Furthermore, the AUC should be therapeutically monitored using 1 or 2 postdose concentrations (ie, a peak concentration measured after the early vancomycin tissue distribution phase and a trough level measured prior to the next dose), preferably integrating the Bayesian approach. Future studies in all patient populations are necessary to address existing gaps, including efficacy data to support vancomycin use in specific patient populations (including immunocompromised and pediatric patients and patients with renal disease and obesity) and for other types of infections; efficacy data for specific pathogens, including coagulase-negative staphylococcus and Streptococcus species; robust pediatric efficacy data for MRSA and other gram-positive pathogens causing different types of serious infections; optimal loading and maintenance dosing regimens for patients with obesity and renal insufficiency; efficacy benefit and the need for a dosing algorithm (specifically incorporating a loading dose followed by maintenance infusion); and toxicodynamics of vancomycin CI in critically ill patients.

### Standard operating procedures for antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of acute kidney injury: a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study [^116TLJU8]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as decrease in urine production or an increase of retention parameters bringing disturbances in electrolyte, acid-base, and fluid balance. AKI occurs in about 7% of all hospitalized patients and in about 66% of the patients on the ICU. This not only increases mortality but also increases hospital length of stay as well as costs. The most frequent reasons for renal impairment are septic shock, surgical intervention, cardiogenic shock, and nephrotoxic medications. About 5 to 6% of these patients require kidney replacement therapy. Uchino et al. showed that septic shock (47% of patients) was the most predominant reason for an AKI. Furthermore, they were able to show that in 19% of patients with AKI there was an association with potentially nephrotoxic medications. Treatment of critically ill patients demands a broad therapy regimen of medications, some of them with the potential to seriously damage kidney function either alone or in combination. This includes medications such as aminoglycosides, vancomycin, amphotericin B, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to name only a few. Based on the current literature, there is evidence that 19 to 25% of AKI is influenced by potentially nephrotoxic medication.

Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is accused of causing tubular necrosis when applied in high doses. This mechanism has been demonstrated in animal experiments. Incidence of AKI in humans in relation to vancomycin therapy was demonstrated to occur in 10 to 31% of patients. The aminoglycoside antibiotics gentamycin and tobramycin are mostly used in combination therapy against gram-negative pathogens. For these agents, incidence of nephrotoxicity was described in 10 to 20% of patients depending on the dosing regimen.

Claims for the adequate anti-infective therapy and preceding diagnostics on ICUs are complex and should be evidence-based. Introduction of guidelines for anti-infective therapy into clinical practice has been shown to improve outcomes on ICU.

To date, few studies refer to the effect on AKI by using computer-aided decision support for optimizing therapy with potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics. Against this background, we hypothesized that antibiotic therapy following guidelines for nephrotoxic agents is associated with reduced incidence of kidney dysfunction. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impact of adherence to evidence-based dosing guidelines for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics on the occurrence of AKI.

### Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury in Hong Kong in 2012–2016 [^111FgQdp]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Several explanations have been put forth on the cause of VA-AKI, including impurities in vancomycin, critically-ill patients with complications and on multiple drugs, and lack of suitable control patients. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to identify the relationship between vancomycin and the development of AKI. Patients were randomized to continuation of dose-optimized vancomycin or early switch to an alternative antimicrobial agent. The incidence of AKI in both groups was similar (32.7 to 31.4% [P = 0.89]), but this was a small study of 103 patients in a single center.

The strength of this study was that it was population-based and territory-wide, and used a very large database. In the limited literature, the incidence of AKI in Hong Kong was reported as 11.7%, similar to the incidence of VA-AKI in our study. It provides good evidence that dosing and monitoring practices of vancomycin in Hong Kong are sound. However, there were limitations. Since it was an observational study, causation cannot be proven. Patients with VA-AKI could have other reasons for AKI, such as comorbidities, hypotension, sepsis and concomitant drugs. It is distinctly difficult to determine the actual risk factors of VA-AKI.

### Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury epidemiology in children: a systematic review [^116jst2C]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vancomycin is a recognised cause of drug-induced acute kidney injury (AKI).

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the incidence of, and the risk factors for, vancomycin-associated AKI (v-AKI) in children.

Design

A systematic search was performed in November 2020 on the search engines PubMed, Web of Science and Medline, using predefined search terms. The inclusion criteria were primary paediatric studies, intervention with vancomycin and studies that included AKI as an outcome. Study quality was assessed using the relevant Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. The data are reported using descriptive statistics.

Results

890 studies were identified and screened with 25 studies suitable for inclusion. A cohort of 12730 patients with v-AKI were included and the incidence of v-AKI in children was found to be 11.8% (1.6%-27.2%). The median age of the cohort was 2.5 years (range 0–23) and 57% were male patients. Risk factors that increased the likelihood of v-AKI were concomitant use of nephrotoxic medications, increased trough concentrations and, to a lesser extent, increased dose, longer duration of treatment, impaired renal function and if the patient required paediatric intensive care.

Conclusions

The incidence of v-AKI in children is significant and methods to reduce this risk should be considered. Further prospective interventional studies to understand the mechanisms of nephrotoxicity from vancomycin are needed and targeting risk factors may make vancomycin administration safer.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^112bXgq3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is the drug of choice for methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 1 but has been associated with significant nephrotoxicity. It remains uncertain, however, to what extent vancomycin is directly responsible. Herein, we critically examine relevant available data in adult patients. We review the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of vancomycin metabolism and discuss efficacy and safety data. The pathophysiology of vancomycin nephrotoxicity is considered. Risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) development are enumerated, and suggestions for practice and further research are given.

Vancomycin has been plagued with concerns about nephrotoxicity since its approval in 1958. Initial preparations were termed "Mississippi mud" and had significant impurities considered the major reason for the nephrotoxicity. Through improved purification procedures, current preparations contain ∼90–95% vancomycin B (the active moiety). The rate of nephrotoxicity with use of modern preparations varies in the literature, with the incidence ranging from as low as 0% in the absence of concurrent nephrotoxins to over 40%. 2 Unfortunately, the majority of studies assessing nephrotoxicity are retrospective, often lacking a control group, and are typically subject to confounding by indication and other biases, as many of the patients are critically ill and have other potential reasons for kidney injury.

Numerous potential risk factors for development of AKI while receiving parenteral vancomycin therapy have been ascertained. Some factors are directly related to vancomycin exposure, such as total daily dose, duration of therapy, method of administration, trough level, and area under the concentration vs. time (AUC) curve. Others are patient‐related, including obesity, preexisting kidney disease, severity of illness, and receipt of concurrent nephrotoxins.

Overall, there is only moderate quality evidence linking vancomycin to renal injury. Sinha Ray et al. performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis restricted only to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that compared vancomycin to another nonglycopeptide antibiotic. Seven RCTs (six compared to linezolid, one to ceftaroline) and six cohort studies (all compared to linezolid) were included, suggesting a small risk for AKI. 3 The relative risk for AKI in the RCTs was 2.45 (P < 0.001), but none were considered at low risk for bias. Only two of six cohort studies showed significantly worse renal outcomes with vancomycin, and all studies were of moderate or high risk for bias. The strength of causal association was weakened, as kidney injury was neither a primary endpoint nor a prespecified secondary outcome in any of the trials.

### Vancomycin-associated cast nephropathy [^112qftjV]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a widely prescribed antibiotic, but the exact nature of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity is unclear, in particular when considering the frequent coadministration of aminoglycosides. We describe here the initial case of a 56-year-old woman with normal renal function developing unexplained ARF without hypovolemia after administration of vancomycin without coadministration of aminoglycosides. Studying the patient's renal biopsy specimen, we ascertained that obstructive tubular casts composed of noncrystal nanospheric vancomycin aggregates entangled with uromodulin explained the vancomycin-associated ARF. We developed in parallel a new immunohistologic staining technique to detect vancomycin in renal tissue and confirmed retrospectively that deleterious vancomycin-associated casts existed in eight additional patients with acute tubular necrosis in the absence of hypovolemia. Concomitant high vancomycin trough plasma levels had been observed in each patient. We also reproduced experimentally the toxic and obstructive nature of vancomycin-associated cast nephropathy in mice, which we detected using different in vivo imaging techniques. In conclusion, the interaction of uromodulin with nanospheric vancomycin aggregates represents a new mode of tubular cast formation, revealing the hitherto unsuspected mechanism of vancomycin-associated renal injury.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^115JS1Sw]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

DURATION OF VANCOMYCIN

Some studies found no significant relation of nephrotoxicity to duration of therapy, 48, 50, 71, 72 but more often a positive result was found. 2, 51, 59, 60, 73, 74, 75 Significantly positive durations include ≥ 7 days, 57, 59 ≥ 14 days, 2 and > 15 days. 75 One study found a significant 12% increase in OR for each additional day of therapy, 60 and another study found a 4% increased OR for each additional day. 76 Based on available evidence, it is improbable that less than 48–72 h of vancomycin exposure is sufficient to cause nephrotoxicity. Hence, we feel it is safe to include vancomycin in initial broad‐spectrum coverage, with consideration of continuation based on severity of illness, risk, and culture results.

AUC-guided vancomycin dosing — compared with trough monitoring, individualized AUC-guided dosing was independently associated with a significant decrease in AKI (odds ratio [OR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34–0.80; P = 0.003) and produced lower median Bayesian-estimated AUCs (474 [SD, 360–611] mg·h/L vs 705 [SD, 540–883] mg·h/L; P < 0.001); in a prospective cohort transitioning from troughs of 10 to 20 mg/L to AUC values of > 400 mg·h/L, nephrotoxicity occurred in 8% in year 1 and in 0% and 2% in years 2 and 3 (P = 0.01), and AKI was associated with a median trough of 15.7 mg/L and AUC of 625 mg·h/L versus 8.7 mg/L and 423 mg·h/L without AKI (P = 0.02).

### Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury in Hong Kong in 2012–2016 [^112ZaKbe]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and data sources

A retrospective study was conducted using Clinical Data Analysis and Report System (CDARS), a database managed by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA). HA is the sole public hospital service provider in Hong Kong. More than 90% of Hong Kong residents use the public hospital services. CDARS captures patient records in Hong Kong in all public hospitals and outpatient clinics since 1993. This database provides a convenient platform for pharmaco-epidemiological studies.

All patients' records with vancomycin prescription and measurement of serum drug level from January 2012 to December 2016 in Hong Kong were retrieved from CDARS. Demographics, laboratory parameters, concomitant medications and co-morbidities were collected as the covariates. Patients with vancomycin prescription and steady-state serum trough vancomycin level were included as the exposure status. Patients who had no baseline and follow-up concentration of creatinine within 48 h, vancomycin treatment < 3 days or steady state serum trough vancomycin level were excluded. Trough concentrations were defined as the results from the samples taken within 1 h of the next due dose. The first trough concentration was measured after 3 days of vancomycin administration.

Definition of AKI

With the use of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, patients with AKI were identified as increase in serum creatinine (SCr) by 0.3 mg/dL or more within 48 h, or as a 1.5~1.9 times increase in SCr from baseline. These patients were at least of stage I in severity. Stage II was defined as 2~2.9 times increase in SCr from baseline. Stage III was defined as 3 times increase in SCr from baseline or increase in SCr to ≥ 4 mg/dL. Vancomycin-associated AKI was the main outcome for the study. Patients without VA-AKI were classified as non-VA-AKI group.

### Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury in a large veteran population [^112GqRnH]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To determine the association of vancomycin with acute kidney injury (AKI) in relation to its serum concentration value and to examine the risk of AKI in patients treated with vancomycin when compared with a matched cohort of patients receiving non-glycopeptide antibiotics (linezolid/daptomycin).

Methods

From a cohort of > 3 million US veterans with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, we identified 33,527 patients who received either intravenous vancomycin (n = 22,057) or non-glycopeptide antibiotics (linezolid/daptomycin, n = 11,470). We examined the association of the serum trough vancomycin level recorded within the first 48 h of administration with subsequent AKI in all patients treated with vancomycin and association of vancomycin vs. non-glycopeptide antibiotics use with the risk of incident AKI.

Results

The overall multivariable adjusted ORs of AKI stages 1, 2, and 3 in patients on vancomycin vs. non-glycopeptides were 1.1 (1.1–1.2), 1.2 (1–1.4), and 1.4 (1.1–1.7), respectively. When examined in strata divided by vancomycin trough level, the odds of AKI were similar or lower in patients receiving vancomycin compared to non-glycopeptide antibiotics as long as serum vancomycin levels were ≤ 20 mg/L. However, in patients with serum vancomycin levels > 20 mg/L, the ORs of AKI stages 1, 2, and 3 in patients on vancomycin vs. non-glycopeptide antibiotics were 1.5 (1.4–1.7), 1.9 (1.5–2.3), and 2.7 (2–3.5), respectively.

Conclusions

Vancomycin use is associated with a higher risk of AKI when serum levels exceed > 20 mg/L.

### Factors associated with acute kidney injury among preterm infants administered vancomycin: a retrospective cohort study [^113dxf9x]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vancomycin (VCM) is an antibiotic that is widely used for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species found in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, nephrotoxicity is a well-known side effect of VCM that may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) in preterm infants.

There have been few studies on the risk factors for VCM-induced AKI in the pediatric population, especially those examining higher doses of VCM or longer duration of treatment. Other risk factors for AKI during VCM treatment include co-administration of nephrotoxic drugs and age of < 12 months. In one propensity-matched cohort study of newborn infants, the presence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bacteremia, and low birth weight are associated with VCM-induced AKI. Additionally, higher trough levels, hypotension, and furosemide use have also been associated with AKI. However, in a retrospective study of preterm infants, VCM-induced nephrotoxicity is rare, even with high peak serum concentrations.

Recently, concerns have been raised that VCM-induced nephrotoxicity may be aggravated by combination therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP). In a single-center retrospective study of an adult population, concurrent use of TZP and a higher trough concentration of VCM increased the incidence of nephrotoxicity. Moreover, in a multicenter retrospective study of hospitalized children, co-administration of VCM and TZP increased the risk of AKI. As piperacillin inhibits tubular secretory clearance, decreased clearance of VCM may play a role in the increased risk of AKI during co-administration of TZP. However, there is a lack of data indicating that concomitant use of VCM and TZP increases the risk of AKI in the newborn population.

Therefore, this retrospective cohort study investigates whether the administration of TZP increases the risk of AKI during VCM use and explores factors associated with AKI during VCM treatment in preterm infants.

### The association between vancomycin trough concentrations and acute kidney injury in the neonatal intensive care unit [^114mcQgz]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Based on our study, vancomycin troughs greater than 20 mg/dl may be associated with increased incidence of AKI. We recommend close monitoring of vancomycin trough concentrations during therapy and appropriate alteration in dosage/frequency should be made based on serum trough concentrations. However, this was a single-center retrospective study, and larger prospective studies are required to validate this finding.

HIGH DAILY DOSES

One retrospective cohort study assessed the nephrotoxicity of high‐dose vancomycin. Lodise et al. compared 26 patients receiving ≥ 4 g/day vancomycin to 220 patients receiving < 4 g/day and 45 patients receiving linezolid and found nephrotoxicity rates of 35%, 11%, and 7%, respectively (P = 0.001). 68 There was no difference in time to nephrotoxicity between the low‐dose vancomycin group and the linezolid group. By multivariate analyses, the high dose regimen had an OR of 4.4 (P = 0.003) for occurrence of nephrotoxicity and a hazard ratio 4.37 (P < 0.001) for time to its occurrence.

### Expression and 7-day time course of circulating microRNAs in septic patients treated with nephrotoxic antibiotic agents [^112F8mGd]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is generally defined as a life-threatening and dysregulated reaction to infection leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction in the worst-case scenario.

More than 40% of critically ill hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) in intensive care units (ICUs) have sepsis or septic shock. The overall incidence of AKI is 10 to 15% in hospitalized patients and more than 50% in ICUs. AKI in critically ill patients is a common and usually serious condition associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality. Depending on the stage of renal damage, AKI is often linked to decreased diuresis, leading to a volume overload and exacerbations in critically ill patients. AKI is classified globally based on two parameters, increased serum creatinine (S crea) and decreased urine output, as established by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) association in 2012. The pathophysiology of sepsis-induced AKI is considered to be multifactorial, with damage to almost all parts of the renal parenchyma at various levels, from the renal macro- and microcirculation to cycle cell arrest and lethal injury of renal epithelial cells. From a clinical perspective, worsening of kidney function to KDIGO stage 2 or 3 usually indicates the need to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and carries increased risk for in-hospital mortality and chronic dialysis. In addition, effective antimicrobial treatment is crucial in sepsis therapy, but the risk of renal injury increases with the use of these lifesaving but often potentially nephrotoxic treatments, as does development of ischemia via organ hypoperfusion and inflammation in sepsis. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity from these antimicrobial treatments varies from a relatively mild form of acute interstitial nephritis (with, e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, antiretrovirals, and fluoroquinolones) to severe renal damage, as indicated by acute tubular necrosis and a frequent need for RRT (with, e.g. vancomycin, aminoglycosides, or polymyxins). To prevent nephrotoxicity and avoid subtherapeutic dosing, drug serum concentrations are usually monitored, with adjustment of dose or dosing interval according to pharmacokinetic models.

5.3 Nephrotoxicity

Vancomycin Injection can result in acute kidney injury (AKI), including acute renal failure, mainly due to interstitial nephritis or less commonly acute tubular necrosis. AKI is manifested by increasing blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr). The risk of AKI increases with higher vancomycin serum levels, prolonged exposure, concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs, concomitant administration of piperacillin-tazobactam [see Drug Interactions (7.2)], volume depletion, pre-existing renal impairment and in critically ill patients and patients with co-morbid conditions that predispose to renal impairment.

Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function in all patients receiving Vancomycin Injection. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with comorbidities that predispose to impairment in renal function or are concomitantly receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, in critically ill patients, in patients with changing renal function, and in patients requiring higher therapeutic vancomycin levels. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue Vancomycin Injection or reduce the dose.

5.4 Ototoxicity

Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin. It may be transient or permanent. Ototoxicity manifests as tinnitus, hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo. The risk is higher in older patients, patients who are receiving higher doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside or who have underlying renal impairment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ototoxicity during therapy. Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function in all patients receiving parenteral vancomycin. Discontinue Vancomycin Injection if ototoxicity occurs. Dosage of Vancomycin Injection must be adjusted for patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity.

5.5 Severe Dermatologic Reactions

Severe dermatologic reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) have been reported in association with the use of vancomycin. Cutaneous signs or symptoms reported include skin rashes, mucosal lesions, and blisters.

Discontinue Vancomycin Injection at the first appearance of signs and symptoms of TEN, SJS, DRESS, AGEP, or LABD.

### The systemic immune response due to cholesterol crystal embolization syndrome: a case report [^114CqCjq]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

We assumed that the major cause of AKI was diffuse tubulointerstitial nephritis, triggered by the administration of vancomycin, not daptomycin, after the onset of systemic allergy in CES. AKI only became apparent nine days after vancomycin administration, the concentration of which reached a level previously reported to be a high risk for vancomycin-related nephropathy. Vancomycin and daptomycin have different effects on renal tubular cells. In tobramycin kidney injury studies, daptomycin reduced renal damage, whereas vancomycin did not exhibit renal protective effects. Previous clinical studies showed higher rates of AKI in patients treated with vancomycin than that in those treated with daptomycin (odds ratio of 4.4 in one study). In addition, the pathology of vancomycin-induced nephropathy has been reported to exhibit acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis. Considering the above information, vancomycin was considered more probable than daptomycin as the suspect drug for the AKI in the present patient. Drug-induced allergic reactions developed cutaneous and renal injury during a typical CES in this case. CES has the possibility of causing allergic complications besides direct organ damage. Although further research is needed, we believe this case is an important stepping stone.

RISK FACTORS

Numerous risk factors have been defined for developing VANT or AKI in patients receiving vancomycin (Table 4). Various measures of vancomycin exposure have been studied, including use of a loading dose, maximal dose, duration of therapy, method of administration (intermittent vs. continuous infusion), AUC, and trough level. Other risk factors include demographic features, associated medical conditions, severity of illness, preexisting kidney disease, and concurrent nephrotoxins.

### Nephrotoxicity with vancomycin in the pediatric population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qJ3s3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin is frequently used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in pediatric patients. Vancomycin exposure may lead to an increase in frequency of nephrotoxicity. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review to describe predictors of nephrotoxicity associated with vancomycin, including documented trough concentrations ≥ 15mg/L. We also aimed to use a meta-analysis to assess the impact of a vancomycin trough ≥ 15mg/L on nephrotoxicity.

Methods

A literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Sciences database. We included randomized clinical trials and observational studies evaluating the relationship between vancomycin troughs and nephrotoxicity in pediatric-age patients. Studies not measuring troughs or defining a different cut-off point than 15mg/L were excluded. Data on age, exclusion criteria, nephrotoxicity definition, risk factors for nephrotoxicity and vancomycin trough levels were extracted from selected papers.

Results

Ten studies were identified for meta-analysis. All subjects had comparatively normal baseline serum creatinine values. Common risk factors identified included elevated (≥ 15mg/L) trough levels, renal impairment, hypovolemia and concurrent use of nephrotoxic medications. Troughs ≥ 15mg/L increased nephrotoxicity by 2.7-fold (odds ratio (OR), 2.71; 95% confidence interval: 1.82–4.05; I(2) = 40%; Q = 0.09). These odds were further increased among patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (OR, 3.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.21–10.74; I(2) = 45%; Q = 0.18).

Conclusions

Though the rate of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is increased in pediatric patients with higher vancomycin troughs, other factors such as intensive care unit admission, hypovolemia and concurrent nephrotoxic drug use appear to contribute to the development of nephrotoxicity.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of vancomycin hydrochloride PO (also known as Vancocin):
- Nephrotoxicity: use extreme caution in patients with renal impairment, especially in geriatric patients.
- Ototoxicity: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vancomycin has been associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity, especially in patients with underlying hearing loss, renal impairment, older patients, or those receiving higher doses or concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as aminoglycosides. Consider obtaining serial auditory function tests to minimize the risk of ototoxicity.
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis: use caution in all patients.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^116r1MRT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Vancomycin used at currently recommended doses is minimally nephrotoxic when used in noncritically ill patients with less serious infections. In sicker patients with multiple risk factors for AKI, VANT occurs much more commonly, but it remains uncertain to what degree vancomycin is directly responsible. In our opinion, it is safe to initiate therapy with vancomycin in critically ill patients with multiple risk factors for AKI, pending culture results with use of TDM and antibiotic stewardship (Table 5). Trough levels should be obtained within 48–72 h, by which time initial culture results should be available. Decisions regarding continuation of vancomycin therapy can be individualized, based on culture result, MIC (if staphylococci are isolated), AKI risk, and side‐effect profile of alternative agents. Loading doses are safe. Trough levels with intermittent dosing should always be > 10 mg/L to prevent resistance. It remains uncertain whether Guideline‐based trough levels of 15–20 mg/L are more efficacious than 10–15 mg/L in serious infections. Trough levels of 15–20 mg/L, however, are clearly associated with greater VANT than levels < 15 mg/L, but it remains uncertain whether these levels are the cause or the result of the nephrotoxicity. Combination with PTZ should be avoided or duration minimized. In patients receiving vancomycin who develop AKI that is not easily correctible with fluid resuscitation or discontinuation of other agents, cessation of vancomycin should be considered. This very important issue clearly warrants a large, multicenter RCT to answer definitively. Further issues need research as well, preferably with RCTs (Table 6).

### Sacituzumab-govitecan-induced severe acute tubulointerstitial nephritis requiring hemodialysis [^112pNDXF]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

ATIN, which differs from acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) by the former's additional involvement of renal tubules, is primarily caused by pharmacologic agents. Alternative causes include infection and autoimmune or systemic diseases. When this renal damage is drug-induced, renal function typically falls within 7 to 10 days after exposure and is typically associated with non-nephrotic range proteinuria, less than 1 g/day.

In evaluating this patient's ATIN, a thorough work-up ruled out autoimmune conditions. Review of medications received before and during hospitalization identified three possible pharmacologic causes of ATIN: pantoprazole, vancomycin, and sacituzumab govitecan. Pantoprazole is well-documented to cause ATIN and AIN, particularly in patients receiving multiple nephrotoxic agents. Because pantoprazole is not a home medication of this patient and none was given until hospitalization at outside hospital, it is unlikely that it contributed to AKI, proteinuria, nor the tubular injury. Vancomycin, at a supratherapeutic level, is rarely associated with AIN, and is more commonly associated with acute tubular necrosis. In this patient, vancomycin did reach a supratherapeutic level after the second dose. However, she experienced worsening renal function prior to administering vancomycin with documentation of worsening proteinuria before achieving supratherapeutic levels of this medication. Both pantoprazole and vancomycin were eliminated as causes of ATIN due to the timing of administration of medications as compared to the worsening renal symptoms. Sacituzumab govitecan was administered twice before hospitalization, with the second dose being given nine days prior to the development of non-nephrotic range proteinuria associated with worsening renal failure. This places her AKI within the expected 7–10 days after drug exposure, consistent with drug-induced ATIN.

### Biopsy-proven vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury: a case report and literature review [^113AWuso]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin is the first-line antibiotic for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative strains. The risk of vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury increases with plasma vancomycin levels. Vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury is histologically characterized by acute interstitial nephritis and/or acute tubular necrosis. However, only 12 biopsy-proven cases of vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury have been reported so far, as renal biopsy is rarely performed for such cases. Current recommendations for the prevention or treatment of vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury are drug monitoring of plasma vancomycin levels using trough level and drug withdrawal. Oral prednisone and high-flux haemodialysis have led to the successful recovery of renal function in some biopsy-proven cases.

Case Presentation

We present the case of a 41-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus, who developed vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury during treatment for Fournier gangrene. His serum creatinine level increased to 1020.1 μmol/L from a baseline of 79.6 μmol/L, and his plasma trough level of vancomycin peaked at 80.48 μg/mL. Vancomycin discontinuation and frequent haemodialysis with high-flux membrane were immediately performed following diagnosis. Renal biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis and focal acute interstitial nephritis, mainly in the medullary rays (medullary ray injury). There was no sign of glomerulonephritis, but mild diabetic changes were detected. He was discharged without continuing haemodialysis (serum creatinine level, 145.0 μmol/L) 49 days after initial vancomycin administration.

Conclusions

This case suggests that frequent haemodialysis and renal biopsy could be useful for the treatment and assessment of vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury, particularly in high-risk cases or patients with other renal disorders.
