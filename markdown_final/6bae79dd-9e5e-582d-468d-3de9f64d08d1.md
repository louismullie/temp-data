## Question

Niacin and lp a

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the effect of niacin on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], including how much it lowers Lp(a), whether that translates into fewer cardiovascular events, and what current guidelines recommend. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic effect of niacin on Lp(a) and its magnitude. Then, I should verify the clinical outcomes data with niacin in modern, statin-treated populations. Next, I will review guideline positions and weigh benefits versus harms. After that, I should consider alternatives like PCSK9 inhibitors and apheresis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note special populations and assay considerations.

> Let me first confirm the magnitude of Lp(a) lowering with niacin. Multiple sources consistently show that niacin reduces Lp(a) by about 20–40% in a dose-dependent fashion, with meta-analytic estimates around 23–31% and absolute reductions on the order of 7–12 mg/dL depending on baseline, which is clinically meaningful for a parameter that is otherwise hard to modify [^24dd2ec4] [^4040ab29] [^5bb50007] [^ed950e36].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism because it informs expectations. Niacin appears to lower Lp(a) primarily by decreasing hepatic production of apo(a) and Lp(a)-apoB-100, as shown by stable-isotope kinetic studies, and this effect is more pronounced in those with higher baseline Lp(a), which aligns with the observed larger absolute reductions at higher starting levels [^53df10dd] [^9fb215c8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical benefit just because Lp(a) falls. I need to check the outcomes trials. In contemporary, statin-treated populations, large randomized trials such as AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE showed no reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with extended-release niacin despite favorable changes in Lp(a), HDL-C, and LDL-C, and HPS2-THRIVE actually signaled harm with excess serious adverse events, which shifts the risk–benefit calculus against routine niacin use for Lp(a) lowering [^f46e058a] [^25d0178b] [^24dd2ec4].

> I should confirm guideline positions next. The 2024 NLA scientific statement explicitly states that niacin is not recommended for Lp(a) lowering because combination studies with statins showed no clinical benefit despite roughly 20% reductions in Lp(a), and the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus similarly advises against niacin for this purpose, emphasizing instead aggressive management of other risk factors and consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors or apheresis in selected high-risk patients [^24dd2ec4] [^087d2abd] [^c85e9dd0].

> Let me consider the balance of benefits and harms more carefully. While niacin reliably lowers Lp(a), it does not improve hard outcomes in modern practice, and it carries nontrivial adverse effects including flushing, hepatotoxicity, dysglycemia, and in HPS2-THRIVE, increased risks of infection, bleeding, and musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal events, which together outweigh any theoretical benefit from Lp(a) reduction alone [^25d0178b] [^d55c57aa].

> Next, I should review alternatives for patients with elevated Lp(a) who remain at high risk. PCSK9 inhibitors reduce Lp(a) by about 20–30% and show greater absolute risk reduction in those with higher baseline Lp(a), though Lp(a) lowering is not an approved indication; lipoprotein apheresis achieves large Lp(a) reductions and is reasonable for very high-risk patients with progressive ASCVD despite optimal therapy; and investigational nucleic acid therapies targeting apo(a) are achieving 70–90% Lp(a) reductions in phase 2–3 programs, with outcome trials underway to test event reduction [^c85e9dd0] [^58a5c1c2] [^a572f127].

> But wait, what if the patient has very high Lp(a) and cannot access PCSK9 therapy or apheresis? I should double-check whether any niche role remains for niacin. Even in such cases, given the lack of outcome benefit and the adverse effect burden, expert consensus advises prioritizing intensified LDL-C lowering, blood pressure control, diabetes optimization, and lifestyle measures rather than resorting to niacin for Lp(a) alone, reserving apheresis for exceptional, refractory cases with progressive disease [^c85e9dd0] [^087d2abd].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and practical details. In pediatrics, niacin has not been studied for Lp(a) lowering and is not recommended; in women of reproductive potential, niacin is discouraged during lactation and is not used for ASCVD prevention; and for assay interpretation, Lp(a) should be measured once in adulthood using isoform-insensitive molar units (nmol/L) with no fixed mg/dL conversion, recognizing that statins may modestly increase Lp(a) but should not be discontinued for that reason [^c1372567] [^6b6e1200] [^c307be2a] [^ae1e158a].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Niacin lowers Lp(a) by a clinically meaningful 20–40%, but in the era of background statin therapy and modern risk reduction, this biochemical change has not translated into fewer cardiovascular events and is accompanied by significant adverse effects, leading major guidelines to recommend against niacin for Lp(a) lowering; therefore, management should focus on comprehensive risk factor optimization and evidence-supported alternatives rather than niacin [^24dd2ec4] [^087d2abd] [^c85e9dd0].

---

Niacin lowers Lp(a) by **20–30%** on average [^24dd2ec4] [^4040ab29], with larger absolute reductions at higher baseline Lp(a) [^ed950e36]. However, **no outcome benefit** has been demonstrated in modern trials [^f46e058a], and niacin is not recommended for Lp(a) lowering because of adverse effects and lack of clinical benefit [^24dd2ec4] [^087d2abd]. Current guidelines prioritize statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and lifestyle measures for ASCVD risk reduction in patients with elevated Lp(a) [^c85e9dd0] [^84939dff].

---

## Mechanism of niacin-mediated Lp(a) lowering

Niacin lowers Lp(a) by **reducing hepatic apo(a) production** [^53df10dd] and decreasing Lp(a) assembly, with additional effects on LDL and HDL metabolism that may indirectly influence Lp(a) levels [^a71c597d].

---

## Magnitude of Lp(a) reduction

Clinical trials show niacin reduces Lp(a) by **20–30%** on average [^24dd2ec4] [^4040ab29], with larger absolute reductions at higher baseline Lp(a) [^ed950e36]. In HPS2-THRIVE, the mean reduction was 31% overall, but only 18% in those with small apo(a) isoforms and very high Lp(a) [^5bb50007] [^79edddd1].

---

## Clinical evidence and outcomes

Although niacin lowers Lp(a), **modern outcome trials show no cardiovascular benefit** when added to statins [^f46e058a] [^25d0178b]. AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE found no reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with niacin, despite favorable lipid changes [^f46e058a] [^25d0178b].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Niacin has significant adverse effects, including flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatotoxicity, and worsened glycemic control [^d55c57aa]. HPS2-THRIVE also showed increased risks of infection, bleeding, and diabetes complications, limiting its use [^25d0178b].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Given the lack of outcome benefit and adverse effects, **niacin is not recommended** for Lp(a) lowering [^24dd2ec4] [^087d2abd]. Guidelines emphasize statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and lifestyle measures for ASCVD risk reduction in patients with elevated Lp(a) [^c85e9dd0] [^84939dff].

---

## Comparison with other Lp(a)-lowering therapies

| **Therapy** | **Magnitude of lp(a) reduction** | **Clinical outcomes** | **Current recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Niacin | 20–30% | No benefit in modern trials | Not recommended |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | 20–30% | Reduced events in high Lp(a) | Recommended |
| Antisense/siRNA | 70–90% | Under investigation | Promising |
| Lipoprotein apheresis | 60–80% | Reserved for extreme cases | Reserved |

---

## Clinical scenarios where niacin may still be considered

Niacin may be considered only when Lp(a) is markedly elevated with progressive ASCVD despite maximal therapy, and PCSK9 inhibitors or apheresis are unavailable or contraindicated. Even then, **use is rare and individualized**.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Niacin lowers Lp(a) by 20–30% [^24dd2ec4] [^4040ab29], but **no outcome benefit** has been shown in modern trials [^f46e058a], and adverse effects limit its use [^25d0178b]. Current guidelines do not recommend niacin for Lp(a) lowering; instead, use statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and lifestyle measures for ASCVD risk reduction [^c85e9dd0] [^84939dff].

### Niacin and lipoprotein (a): facts, uncertainties, and clinical considerations [^ca867f9c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Over the years, niacin has gained recognition as an atheroprotective agent, in part because of its capacity to lower the plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and very-low- and low-density lipoproteins and to substantially raise high-density lipoprotein. In high doses, niacin has also been reported to lower the plasma level of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]). However, the published research on the subject suffers from a lack of uniformity regarding patient selection, drug dose, length of administration, and methods for plasma Lp(a) quantification. In this report, the authors examine the most relevant niacin-related Lp(a) studies and hypothetical mechanisms of drug action, also considering the emerging notion of Lp(a) as a potential proinflammatory entity.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^e0645101]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment

Studies using niacin alone or in combination with, for example, statins have shown cardiovascular benefit; – niacin reduces Lp(a) levels by up to 30–40% in a dose-dependent manner and in addition exerts other potential beneficial effects by reducing LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and remnant cholesterol and by raising HDL cholesterol. In a meta-analysis including 11 randomized controlled trials with 2682 patients in the active group and 3934 in the control group, niacin 1–3 g/day reduced major coronary events by 25% (95% CI: 13–35%), stroke by 26% (8–41%), and any cardiovascular event by 27% (15–37%).

However, there have been no randomized, controlled intervention trials with selective reduction in plasma lipoprotein(a) levels aimed to reduce CVD: we urgently need trials demonstrating that selective reduction of Lp(a) in those with Lp(a) above the 80th percentile will benefit clinically with reduced CVD. Until such trials are published, reduction in Lp(a) should mainly be achieved using niacin, as the use of niacin for CVD risk reduction as described above is evidence-based. However, in addition to lowering Lp(a), niacin lowers LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and remnant cholesterol and concomitantly increases HDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, the favourable effects of niacin on CVD cannot be ascribed solely to Lp(a) reduction. Nevertheless, these studies clearly demonstrate that the use of niacin for reduction in Lp(a) to the suggested desirable levels (Table 2) is safe and in all likelihood beneficial.

Niacin — niacin may lower Lp(a) by decreasing apo(a) production and, in meta-analysis of 14 trials with 9013 patients, was associated with a "23% reduction in Lp(a) levels", but combination studies with statins showed no clinical benefit "despite ~20% reductions in Lp(a) level", so "niacin is not recommended for Lp(a) lowering".

### Existing and emerging strategies to lower lipoprotein (a) [^58a5c1c2]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abundant evidence links elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) to higher cardiovascular risk, leaving clinicians with the challenge of what measures to take to mitigate Lp(a)-associated risk. Some therapies that may reduce cardiovascular risk, such as aspirin, statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe, have little effect on Lp(a) and in some cases may even increase its concentration. Other agents that reduce levels of Lp(a), such as niacin or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have neutral or only slightly favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The only currently available therapeutic approaches that lower Lp(a) and reduce cardiovascular risk are PCSK9 inhibitors and lipoprotein apheresis. For PCSK9 inhibitors, the magnitude of clinical benefit is associated with the baseline level of Lp(a) and appears to be associated with the degree of Lp(a) reduction. Antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA agents targeting apolipoprotein(a) have the potential to reduce circulating Lp(a) concentrations by more than 70%. The results of cardiovascular outcomes trials will determine whether such substantial reductions in Lp(a) are associated with meaningful clinical benefit.

### Impact of PCSK9 inhibitors on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations with or without a background of niacin therapy [^c9c870b6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an atherogenic lipoprotein associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Niacin and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) both lower Lp(a).

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine if addition of PCSK9i to background niacin therapy further lowers Lp(a).

Methods

This study is a retrospective analysis of patients who met the following inclusion criteria: initiated PCSK9i therapy, had Lp(a) measurements before and after initiation of PCSK9i, and for the combination therapy group, PCSK9i was added on top of baseline niacin monotherapy. Of the 150 patients included in this study, 136 were on monotherapy (PCSK9i) and 14 were on combination therapy (niacin + PCSK9i). Lp(a) values were assessed in both groups before and after the addition of PCSK9i.

Results

Median percent and absolute Lp(a) reductions in the niacin + PCSK9i combination therapy group were -15.3% (interquartile range [IQR] -31.8, -1) and -9 mg/dL (IQR -37.2, -0.5), respectively, from a baseline Lp(a) of 95 mg/dL (IQR 20.5, 171). These reductions were statistically significant or nearly so (P = 0.04 and P = 0.05, respectively). Median percent and absolute Lp(a) reductions in the PCSK9i monotherapy group were -17.3% (IQR -34.4, 0) and -6 mg/dL (IQR -16, 0), respectively, from a baseline Lp(a) of 39.5 mg/dL (IQR 15, 117.5). There was no difference in median percent and absolute change in Lp(a) between monotherapy and combination therapy groups (P = 0.84 and P = 0.54, respectively).

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that the addition of PCSK9i to background of niacin therapy is associated with ∼15% reduction in Lp(a) beyond that achieved with background niacin monotherapy.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^c1e14540]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The aims of the study were, first, to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor and, second, to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies.

Methods and Results

The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)/coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) < 80th percentile (less than ∼50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1–3 g/day, as a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials demonstrates reduced CVD by niacin treatment. In extreme cases, LDL-apheresis is efficacious in removing Lp(a).

Conclusion

We recommend screening for elevated Lp(a) in those at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk, a desirable level < 50 mg/dL as a function of global cardiovascular risk, and use of niacin for Lp(a) and CVD/CHD risk reduction.

### What do we know about the role of lipoprotein (a) in atherogenesis 57 years after its discovery? [^55897656]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Elevated circulating concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is strongly associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and degenerative aortic stenosis. This relationship was first observed in prospective observational studies, and the causal relationship was confirmed in genetic studies. Everybody should have their Lp(a) concentration measured once in their lifetime. CVD risk is elevated when Lp(a) concentrations are high i.e. > 50 mg/dL (≥ 100 mmol/L). Extremely high Lp(a) levels > 180 mg/dL (≥ 430 mmol/L) are associated with CVD risk similar to that conferred by familial hypercholesterolemia. Elevated Lp(a) level was previously treated with niacin, which exerts a potent Lp(a)-lowering effect. However, niacin is currently not recommended because, despite the improvement in lipid profile, no improvements on clinical outcomes have been observed. Furthermore, niacin use has been associated with severe adverse effects. Post hoc analyses of clinical trials with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have shown that these drugs exert clinical benefits by lowering Lp(a), independent of their potent reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It is not yet known whether PCSK9 inhibitors will be of clinical use in patients with elevated Lp(a). Apheresis is a very effective approach to Lp(a) reduction, which reduces CVD risk but is invasive and time-consuming and is thus reserved for patients with very high Lp(a) levels and progressive CVD. Studies are ongoing on the practical application of genetic approaches to therapy, including antisense oligonucleotides against apolipoprotein(a) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, to reduce the synthesis of Lp(a).

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^7552d23a]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Investigations and measurement.

There is no consensus regarding screening individuals for Lp(a) levels. Some guideline committees, such as the European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology and Canadian Cardiovascular Society, suggest measuring Lp(a) once as an adult for risk stratification. Other societies, such as the National Lipid Association, suggest screening only in high-risk situations, such as in individuals with a personal or family history of premature ASCVD, or those with known FH. At high concentrations, Lp(a) can interfere with LDL determination as a substantial portion of measured LDL-C may be contained within Lp(a) particles; therefore, measurement of Lp(a) may also be warranted in anyone who presents with LDL-C levels > 5.0 mmol/L (> 194 mg/dL) or reduced responsiveness to statins.

Because circulating Lp(a) is thought to remain relatively stable throughout life, once a baseline level is obtained, further monitoring is not required. Mass measurements of Lp(a) are less useful for predicting ASCVD risk; therefore, assays that measure molar concentrations are preferred. A high level of Lp(a) is considered to be ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL).

Management.

Pharmacologic treatments targeting Lp(a) are currently in development, with an antisense oligonucleotide against Lp(a) demonstrating up to an 80% lowering. Ongoing outcome studies will establish if there is a role for this agent to treat elevated Lp(a) in ASCVD prevention. Until this is clarified, management of other ASCVD risk factors should be the mainstay of treatment for individuals with elevated Lp(a). More aggressive LDL-C lowering than would otherwise be recommended based on cardiovascular risk assessment may be warranted in those with elevated Lp(a).

Of currently approved lipid agents, statins can elevate Lp(a) levels, but are nonetheless considered first-line treatment in patients with high Lp(a) because of their general benefit with respect to elevated ASCVD risk. Ezetimibe has a neutral effect on Lp(a), whereas niacin lowers Lp(a). In a meta-analysis that included 6566 individuals, PCSK9 inhibitors lowered Lp(a) by 26%, although Lp(a) lowering is not currently an approved use for these agents.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^2538b48d]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Desirable levels

Scientific and clinical evidence favouring an interpretation of causality between elevated levels of a lipoprotein and increased CVD risk constitutes a pre-requisite for selection of desirable levels. For an interpretation of causality, five types of evidence should each favour causality and all three types of human evidence (epidemiology, genetics, and intervention trials) must concur (Table 1). For elevated LDL cholesterol levels, all five criteria are well documented and the consensus is causality. On the basis of the same criteria, elevated Lp(a) levels probably are also causally related to increased CVD risk (Table 1).

Recommendations proposing desirable levels should preferably be based on evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials documenting benefit of treatment (level Ia evidence). Desirable levels for LDL cholesterol levels are based on such evidence from statin trials (Table 2). For Lp(a), the evidence is less clear; however, a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials documenting benefit of niacin (= nicotinic acid) treatment has recently been published(see below).

Table 2
Desirable levels for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) levels in the fasting or non-fasting state

For reduction of plasma Lp(a) as a secondary priority after reduction in LDL and total cholesterol levels, we recommend a desirable level below the 80th percentile (less than ∼50 mg/dL; Table 2). As for LDL reduction, treatment of high Lp(a) levels in persons without CVD/CHD or diabetes is recommended for those with intermediate or high absolute risk of CVD/CHD (see Graham et al. and Grundy et al. and Figure 3 in Kamstrup et al.).

If statin treatment in a person with Lp(a) > 50 mg/dl, but without CVD or diabetes, reduces absolute risk for fatal CVD to < 3% or for fatal and/or non-fatal CHD to < 10%, there might be no need for further treatment with niacin; however, in those with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and elevated Lp(a), or recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, niacin may still be justified despite aggressive LDL cholesterol reduction with a statin.

### Genetic variants associated with plasma lipids are associated with the lipid response to niacin [^71cc0b19]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Recent large‐scale genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 157 loci to be significantly associated with basal fasting lipid traits. 12 Plasma Lp(a) concentrations are highly genetically regulated with the majority of genetic variation being attributable to the LPA locus. 4, 13 It is unknown whether genetic variation at these loci also mediates the effects of lipid‐lowering medications. Individual response to niacin is highly heterogeneous suggesting a potential influence of genetic variation on the pharmacologic response. Although genetic predictors of lipid response to other lipid‐altering drugs (statins, 14, 15 fibrates 16, 17) have been reported, the pharmacogenetics of niacin has not been fully examined.

Here we investigated whether genetic loci associated with basal lipid traits and Lp(a) are associated with the change in plasma lipids and Lp(a) on treatment with ER Niacin in the AIM‐HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides and Impact on Global Health Outcomes) study. We also examined whether these loci were associated with atherothrombotic events in the trial by treatment group.

### What is the role of advanced lipoprotein analysis in practice? [^7320a0a3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Some practitioners use advanced lipoprotein analysis with the goal of better predicting risk and individualizing lifestyle and drug therapy for cardiovascular prevention. Unfortunately, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle number and size, other lipoprotein subfractionation, apolipoproteins B and A, and lipoprotein(a) have not yet met current standards for biomarker evaluation, and it remains to be determined whether these tests incrementally add to cardiovascular risk predicted by traditional risk factors. More importantly, it has yet to be determined whether treatment strategies guided by, or targeting, these measures improve cardiovascular outcomes. Drug therapies known to alter advanced lipoprotein analysis parameters, specifically niacin and fenofibrate, have not been shown to additionally reduce cardiovascular risk in recent randomized trials of high-risk patients treated with statin therapy. These findings suggest advanced lipoprotein analysis-guided strategies may not further reduce cardiovascular events and could lead to increased adverse effects and costs; this approach needs further research to establish its role in individualizing therapies for cardiovascular prevention. In contrast, a large body of evidence supports focusing on LDL cholesterol reduction and intensification of statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Genetic variants associated with plasma lipids are associated with the lipid response to niacin [^b87a894d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Niacin has been used in the treatment of dyslipidemias for over 50 years. 1, 2 Niacin reduces total cholesterol (TC), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), triglycerides (TG), and increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C). 2 Niacin also lowers lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], an independent risk factor for coronary disease. 3, 4 Niacin was one of the first pharmacologic agents shown to reduce the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death. 1 Niacin has also demonstrated beneficial effects on arterial plaque regression in combination with statin therapy. 5, 6 However, in recent clinical outcome trials, the addition of extended‐release niacin to intensive LDL‐C–lowering therapy did not further reduce atherothrombotic events compared with intensive LDL‐C–lowering therapy alone. 7, 8

### Effect of lipid-lowering therapies on lipoprotein (a) levels: a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^4040ab29]. Atherosclerosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In this study we aimed at assessing the effect of currently available lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) on Lp(a) plasma levels.

Methods

A meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Databases were searched up to May 2025. Inclusion criteria were: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (≥ 18 years), phase II, III or IV; (2) English language; (3) comparing the effect of lipid-lowering drugs vs placebo (addition of the same drug to both intervention and control group was acceptable); (4) reporting the effects on Lp(a) levels; (5) intervention duration of more than 3 weeks. The between-group (treatment-placebo) Lp(a) absolute mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each drug class separately.

Results

A total of 145,314 subjects from 147 RCTs were included. Statins, bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, omega-3 fatty acids, and fibrates did not affect Lp(a) concentration. Lp(a) levels were significantly reduced by PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (PCSK9mAbs, -6.37 mg/dL [-7.26 to -5.47], a 29% reduction from baseline), inclisiran (-4.76 mg/dL [-5.83 to -3.69], a 22% reduction from baseline), CETP inhibitors (CETPi, -6.77 mg/dL [-8.67 to -4.88], a 46% reduction from baseline), and niacin (-7.06 mg/dL [-9.27 to -4.85], a 37% reduction from baseline). In the subgroup analysis by baseline Lp(a) levels, a larger absolute reduction of Lp(a) levels was observed with increasing baseline levels of Lp(a) for PCSK9mAbs, inclisiran, and CETPi.

Conclusions

Among available LLTs, PCSK9mAbs, inclisiran, CETPi, and niacin significantly decreased Lp(a) levels. Further research is necessary to understand whether this effect would translate into a clinically relevant cardiovascular benefit.

### Lipoprotein (a)-we know so much yet still have much to learn… [^a2ff128a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In addition to the discussion about the role of Lp(a) as an important biomarker of CVD, we are faced with the very great challenge of treating patients with high Lp(a) levels. Currently, the appropriate management of high Lp(a) is not known and there are limited therapeutic options to lower Lp(a) directly. 2, 6 Niacin reduces Lp(a) levels by up to 30% to 40% in a dose‐dependent manner and in addition exerts other potential beneficial effects by reducing LDL‐C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and remnant cholesterol and by raising high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C); however, the available trials did not show any cardiovascular benefit with niacin administration as an agent to reduce residual risk of increasing high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, niacin is not commonly available in many European countries. 2, 6, 11 New agents, such as cholesteryl ester transfer protein and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, are also very effective; however, they are not still available. In the case of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, the studies with torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, and evacetrapib were terminated prematurely and we await the results of the Determining the Efficacy and Tolerability of CETP INhibition with AnacEtrapib (DEFINE) trial with anacetrapib, which seems to be the most potent agent, both increasing high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol by even 140%, and significantly reducing LDL‐C and Lp(a). 12, 13 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, but due to the lack of reimbursement in most countries as well as the high cost of the therapy they are also still not commonly available. 5, 14 Therefore, according to the current recommendations and expert opinions, statins should be considered as a first‐line therapy in case of high level of Lp(a), despite their limited efficacy, because such therapy is aimed to reduce overall cardiovascular risk. 2, 5, 6 There are also other drugs as well as nutraceuticals/functional foods that may be effective in Lp(a) lowering. Within the Lipid and Blood Pressure Meta‐analysis Collaboration Group, Kotani et al 15 investigated the effects of tibolone treatment on circulating Lp(a) levels in postmenopausal women through systematic review and meta‐analysis of available randomized controlled trials. Meta‐analysis of 12 trials suggested a significant reduction of Lp(a) levels following tibolone treatment (weighted mean difference: −25.28%, 95% CI: −36.50, −14.06; P < 0.001), and the effect remained significant both for the doses < 2.5 (−17.00%) and ≥ 2.5 mg/day (−29.18%), as well as in the subsets of trials with follow‐up either < 24 (−26.79%) or ≥ 24 months (−23.10%). 15 The same group has recently evaluated the effect of‐carnitine supplementation on Lp(a) concentrations. 16 The meta‐analysis showed a significant reduction of Lp(a) levels following‐carnitine supplementation (weighted mean difference: −8.82 mg/dL, 95% CI: −10.09, −7.55, P < 0.001), especially when‐carnitine was administrated orally (−9.00 mg/dL) but not intravenously (−2.91 mg/dL). 16 In another meta‐analysis from the Lipid and Blood Pressure Meta‐analysis Collaboration Group, Serban et al investigated the effect of garlic on Lp(a) concentrations; however, they did not show any effect of garlic supplementation on the reduction of Lp(a) levels. 17

### Lipoprotein (a) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the impact of available lipid-lowering medications on lipoprotein (a): an update on new therapies [^9c1f8d8c]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review evidence of existing and new pharmacological therapies for lowering lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) concentrations and their impact on clinically relevant outcomes.

Methods

We searched for literature pertaining to Lp(a) and pharmacological treatments in PubMed. We reviewed articles published between 1963 and 2020.

Results

We found that statins significantly increased Lp(a) concentrations. Therapies that demonstrated varying degrees of Lp(a) reduction included ezetimibe, niacin, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, lipoprotein apheresis, fibrates, aspirin, hormone replacement therapy, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, and small interfering RNA therapy. There was limited data from large observational studies and post hoc analyses showing the potential benefits of these therapies in improving cardiovascular outcomes.

Conclusion

There are multiple lipid-lowering agents currently being used to treat hyperlipidemia that also have a Lp(a)-lowering effect. Two RNA therapies specifically targeted to lower Lp(a) are being investigated in phase 3 clinical trials and, thus far, have shown promising results. However, evidence is lacking to determine the clinical relevance of reducing Lp(a). At present, there is a need for large-scale, randomized, controlled trials to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes associated with lowering Lp(a).

### Novel therapeutic targets and agents for pediatric dyslipidemia [^eadc599f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1955, niacin was considered the initial therapeutic option for reducing elevated levels of blood cholesterol. Since that time, the treatment of both elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs) has evolved greatly. With recognition of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) as a major public health challenge worldwide, over the past two decades, many newer lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) have been developed. Some have evolved from knowledge gained with the use of targeted treatment of individuals with rare disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, while others were informed by results of Mendelian randomization studies. While data of LLT initiated in youth and continued for up to 20 years have been promising for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), treatment of other lipid disorders, such as those with elevated TG have been less successful. In addition, while most currently available LLT options are well tolerated and improve lipid levels, not all youth are able to reach a desirable treatment target. Thus, additional therapeutic options are needed.

In this manuscript, we review currently available and novel therapeutic agents in development for the treatment of elevated cholesterol and TG. We have categorized these novel agents into those that predominantly reduce (1) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); (2) TG, or (3) both. Included in our discussion of the later are agents that reduce Lp(a). Since clinical trials using currently available and evolving novel LLT are limited in youth, much of the evidence supporting the mechanisms of action, safety and efficacy are summarized from data derived from adults, and are so noted. Data for youth have been included whenever available. It should be noted that many, but not all LLT have been FDA approved for youth less than 18 years-of-age.

Similar results were observed in post hoc analyses of the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial, which studied individuals with acute coronary syndrome. Individuals in the highest quartile of Lp(a) (> 60 mg/dL in ODYSSEY Outcomes) had an absolute risk reduction with alirocumab of 2.1%, which was 5.3‐fold higher compared to the absolute risk reduction of 0.4% observed for those with Lp(a) in the 1st quartile (< 6.7 mg/dL). These results corresponded to a 3‐year number needed to treat to prevent one major adverse cardiovascular event with alirocumab of 49 versus 238 for the 4th and 1st quartiles of Lp(a), respectively. Among ODYSSEY participants with LDL near 70 mg/dL, post hoc analyses have demonstrated that alirocumab provides additional risk reduction for individuals with Lp(a) ≥ median but not < median (~14 mg/dL). There are no post hoc outcome data involving Lp(a) and inclisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA)‐based therapy; inclisiran is associated with a 20%–25% reduction in Lp(a) — similar to PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. Niacin has been shown to reduce Lp(a) levels by approximately 20%–30%. However, clinical trials of niacin, including AIM‐HIGH and HPS2‐THRIVE, did not demonstrate ASCVD event reduction in contemporary settings and were not enriched for individuals with elevated Lp(a). Due to the lack of benefit and adverse effects, niacin is not currently recommended for ASCVD prevention.

Clinical guidance: What to do with the patient with high Lp(a)?

In the absence of approved specific Lp(a)-lowering drugs, this panel recommends early, intensive management of other risk factors for individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels, consistent with most guidelines. Personalized management of LDL-C, blood pressure, glucose, and lifestyle factors, taking into account baseline cardiovascular risk and the untreated Lp(a) level, is recommended to reduce ASCVD risk sufficiently to mitigate increased risk caused by an elevated Lp(a) level (Figure 6B).

LDL-C management should be in accordance with current guidelines. Although statins may slightly increase Lp(a) levels, treatment should not be discontinued as the cardiovascular benefits in patients with high Lp(a) far outweigh any potential risk associated with modest increases in Lp(a) levels. Lipoprotein apheresis can be considered in patients with very high Lp(a) and progressive ASCVD despite optimal treatment of other risk factors as uncontrolled data indicate benefit.

In major studies with PCSK9 inhibitors, the absolute cardiovascular risk reduction with this treatment was higher at higher baseline Lp(a) levels. In FOURIER, the absolute risk reduction was 2.41% vs. 1.41% with an Lp(a) > 50 vs. < 50 mg/dLand in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, 3.7% at Lp(a) > 60 mg/dL vs. 0.5% in the lowest Lp(a) quartile. However, PCSK9 inhibitors are not registered for Lp(a) lowering.

Niacin is not recommended given the lack of clinical benefit in two outcomes studies. Current data also do not support targeting aspirin use based on Lp(a) levels. Whether aspirin might be beneficial among individuals with markedly elevated Lp(a) is uncertain (see Supplementary material online).

### Lipoprotein (a): a frustrating final frontier in lipid management? [^52182e13]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

Despite this conjunction of observational epidemiology and genetic data, the therapeutic targeting of Lp(a) has proven frustrating. The usual menu of drugs that target lipid metabolism have little effect on Lp(a), save for niacin. Unfortunately, nicotinic acid's benefit for CAD patients has recently come into question on the basis of results of recent outcome trials.

The antibodies that neutralize proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), currently under investigation as LDL-lowering agents, offer a glimmer of hope in this otherwise bleak preventive perspective. Studies that have monitored lipoprotein profiles in patients treated with these agents reproducibly and consistently show reductions in Lp(a). We eagerly await the results of the large outcome trials that are currently underway with 3 agents of this class. Perhaps these studies will enroll enough individuals with higher categories of Lp(a) to permit subgroup analyses of sufficient power to test whether the anti-PCSK9 antibodies can improve outcomes in individuals with augmented risk due to higher concentrations of Lp(a). We might then at last with these new line of agents have an evidence-based therapy to offer to our patients and families with elevated risk of premature arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Antisense oligonucleotide strategies (ASO) for inhibiting apo(a) synthesis also show promise as a novel therapeutic approach to lower plasma Lp(a) levels. Yet the anti-PCSK9 antibodies and antisense oligonucleotide strategy agents require parenteral administration and entail considerable expense. Hence, understanding the mechanisms by which anti-PCSK9 antibodies reduce Lp(a) might provide insight that could lead to a more specific approach to lowering levels of this highly atherogenic lipoprotein.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) — there is currently no medication therapy specific for elevated Lp(a); management may focus on addressing other risk factors and on more aggressively managing concomitant elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C), triglycerides (TG), and non–HDL–C. In adults, niacin will lower Lp(a) approximately 15 percent, but this has not been studied in children.

### Niacin (niaspan) [^571040fe]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Niacin functions in the body after conversion to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the NAD coenzyme system. Niacin (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses reduces total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in HDL-C is associated with an increase in apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and a shift in the distribution of HDL subfractions. These shifts include an increase in the HDL :HDL ratio, and an elevation in lipoprotein A-I (Lp A-I, an HDL-C particle containing only Apo A-I). Niacin treatment also decreases serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of Lp(a), a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. In addition, preliminary reports suggest that niacin causes favorable LDL particle size transformations, although the clinical relevance of this effect requires further investigation. The effect of niacin-induced changes in lipids/proteins on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in individuals without preexisting coronary disease has not been established.23

A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of TC, LDL-C, and Apo B promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of Total-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.

Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and their remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma TG are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

### Niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) [^b615c169]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical Studies

In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, 28-week, active-comparator study in patients with Type IIa and IIb hyperlipidemia, ADVICOR was compared to each of its components (NIASPAN and lovastatin). Using a forced dose-escalation study design, patients received each dose for at least 4 weeks. Patients randomized to treatment with ADVICOR initially received 500 mg/20 mg. The dose was increased at 4-week intervals to a maximum of 1000 mg/20 mg in one-half of the patients and 2000 mg/40 mg in the other half. The NIASPAN monotherapy group underwent a similar titration from 500 mg to 2000 mg. The patients randomized to lovastatin monotherapy received 20 mg for 12 weeks titrated to 40 mg for up to 16 weeks. Up to a third of the patients randomized to ADVICOR or NIASPAN discontinued prior to Week 28. In this study, ADVICOR decreased LDL-C, TG and Lp(a), and increased HDL-C in a dose-dependent fashion (Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 below). Results from this study for LDL-C mean percent change from baseline (the primary efficacy variable) showed that:

LDL-lowering with ADVICOR was significantly greater than that achieved with lovastatin 40 mg only after 28 weeks of titration to a dose of 2000 mg/40 mg (p < .0001)
ADVICOR at doses of 1000 mg/20 mg or higher achieved greater LDL-lowering than NIASPAN (p < .0001) The LDL-C results are summarized in Table 3.

ADVICOR achieved significantly greater HDL-raising compared to lovastatin and NIASPAN monotherapy at all doses (Table 4).

In addition, ADVICOR achieved significantly greater TG-lowering at doses of 1000 mg/20 mg or greater compared to lovastatin and NIASPAN monotherapy (Table 5).

The Lp(a) lowering effects of ADVICOR and NIASPAN were similar, and both were superior to lovastatin (Table 6). The independent effect of lowering Lp(a) with NIASPAN or ADVICOR on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein (a): a review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^4c58e970]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Beyond lipid‐lowering therapy, there is observational evidence to support the utilisation of low‐dose aspirin for individuals with elevated Lp(a) who do not have clinical ASCVD. Post hoc analyses of the Women's Health Studyand ASPREE trial identified between a 54% and a 76% relative risk reduction with aspirin therapy for individuals with a high‐risk LPA variant (rs3798220), and other observational studies have observed similar findings with measured Lp(a) values. Among nearly 2200 individuals in the MultiEthnic Study of Atherosclerosis, individuals with Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL reporting aspirin use of at least three times weekly had a 46% lower risk of incident CHD over a median follow‐up of 15.7 years in a propensity‐matched analysis, independent of traditional risk factors. In a separate analysis among nearly 3000 individuals without clinical ASCVD in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, regular aspirin use was associated with a 52% lower risk of ASCVD mortality for those with Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL. Mechanistically, aspirin may help lower Lp(a)‐associated risk by limiting the thrombotic activity attributable to apo(a).

Beyond statins, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and aspirin, there are no observational data involving outcomes for other lipid‐lowering therapies across Lp(a) levels. While niacin is associated with a reduction in Lp(a), trials involving niacin were not enriched for those with elevated Lp(a) and niacin did not lead to a significant reduction in ASCVD events. Among therapies approved for individuals with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, findings from small studies indicate that lomitapide and evinacumab may be associated with a 13% and 6% reduction in Lp(a), respectively.

### Niacin treatment of the atherogenic lipid profile and Lp (a) in diabetes [^1ad6063a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We tested the hypotheses that niacin is effective for the separate treatments of abnormalities of LDL particle size, HDL2 percentage and Lp(a) without potential negative effects on glycated haemoglobin.

Research Design and Methods

The atherogenic lipid profile lipids, such as triglycerides, small, dense LDL cholesterol (LDLc) particle mass, LDL particle size, total HDLc and HDL2 percentage as well as Lp(a), were measured in 42 diabetic patients with abnormalities of LDL particle size, HDL2 percentage and/or Lp(a) levels before and after niacin treatment. LDL particle size and HDL2 were measured using polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoreses and Lp(a) was measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbance assay (ELISA).

Results

After niacin treatment, LDL peak particle diameter increased from 252 ± 7 A to 263 ± 7 (p < 0.0001), small, dense LDLc particle mass decreased from 27 ± 11 mg/dL to 15 ± 4 (p < 0.0001), total HDLc increased from 39 ± 7 mg/dL to 51 ± 11 (p < 0.0001), HDL2 as the percentage of total HDLc mass increased from 29 ± 8% to 45 ± 10 (p < 0.0001) and Lp(a) decreased from 43 ± 17 mg/dL to 25 ± 10 (p < 0.0001). Mean haemoglobin A1c level was improved during treatment from 7.6 ± 1.8% to 6.5 ± 1.0 (p < 0.0001) using increased oral agent and insulin treatment doses in more than 90% of the patients. A total of 21% of the patients were unable to tolerate niacin owing to reversible side-effects, and 14% were unable to adhere to the niacin dosing regimen of three times daily.

Conclusions

These data indicate that in diabetic patients, niacin (i) is effective for treating diabetic dyslipidaemias associated with both the atherogenic lipid profile and Lp(a); (ii) must be used with modern and aggressive oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin treatment; and (iii) is an important drug to treat diabetes dyslipidaemias because of its broad spectrum of effectiveness.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^44921192]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this substudy of HPS2-THRIVE, niacin–laropiprant resulted in a mean percentage reduction in Lp(a) of 31%, in line with the previously reported effects of niacin. However, because Lp(a) reductions depended strongly on apo(a) isoform size, the mean Lp(a) was lowered by 12 nmol/L overall, only 20% of the overall adjusted mean level in the placebo arm of 60 nmol/L. In participants in the top quintile by Lp(a) levels, the mean percentage and absolute reductions were 18% and 34 nmol/L, respectively (Figure 2).

Large-scale genetic studies provide a basis for estimating the strength of the causal association between Lp(a) levels and coronary risk following the Mendelian randomization principle. Such studies have found an odds ratio of ≈1.5 for coronary risk associated with carrying particular variants in the LPA gene, and indirect published evidence supplemented by direct unpublished evidence using assays well aligned to the reference method (Table IV in the) suggests an Lp(a) difference of ≈110 to 115 nmol/L per variant. Mendelian randomization studies of LDL-C have found an odds ratio for coronary disease of ≈2 per 1 mmol/L higher LDL-C, which is much stronger than the effect seen in statin trialsand so suggest that only a third to a half of the coronary risk per unit LDL-C from lifelong genetically elevated LDL-C is reversed within a few years of statin therapy. Assuming the same holds for Lp(a) then, taken together, the literature suggests that therapeutic lowering of Lp(a) during a trial might be expected to produce a 15% to 20% reduction in coronary risk per 100 nmol/L lower Lp(a). Similar sized benefits of Lp(a) lowering may be seen for peripheral vascular disease outcomes, but the potential benefits for stroke appear to be smaller.

Results

Study Population and Lipoprotein Changes

The clinical and demographic characteristics for the AIM‐HIGH population that provided DNA during the course of the study as compared with the whole cohort are provided in Table 1. In the whole cohort as previously published, 7 treatment with niacin resulted in a significant increase in HDL‐C and a significant decrease in triglyceride concentrations as compared with the placebo group. The change in lipids we observed in the genetic subgroup was similar to that in the whole AIM‐HIGH cohort. In a separate analysis of AIM‐HIGH, the addition of niacin resulted in a significant reduction in Lp(a) levels by 21% in the statin+ER niacin group compared with 5.9% in the statin+placebo group (P < 0.05). 23

Clinical and Demographic Characteristics of the Study Participants

Baseline Associations

The SNP genotypes, their chromosomal locations, and the nearest genes and their allele frequencies in the AIM‐HIGH trial are shown in Table S1. Allele frequencies were comparable to those previously reported by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium 12 and in a recent GWAS for Lp(a). 13 We tested associations of these SNPs with baseline HDL‐C, LDL‐C, TC, TG, and Lp(a). All (P < 0.05) associations are shown in Table 2. The threshold for Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was an adjusted α level of 0.0002. At this level we replicated associations with HDL‐C at 1 locus and LDL‐C at 1 locus. We also replicated the association of 8 variants within the LPA locus with Lp(a) levels. Given the size of our genotyped cohort, this is consistent with expectations based on power. Furthermore, more than 90% of the AIM‐HIGH cohort was taking a statin at baseline and had a median LDL‐C of 74 mg/dL, which may have obscured additional baseline associations.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^84939dff]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a)-directed treatment actions — In adults aged 40–75 y with a 10-y ASCVD risk of 7.5%–19.9%, the finding of an Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL is reasonable to be used as a risk-enhancing factor to favor initiation of a moderate- or high-intensity statin. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, it is reasonable to consider more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering to achieve greater ASCVD risk reduction. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients taking a maximally tolerated statin with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, the addition of ezetimibe is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), and the addition of a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL). Lipoprotein apheresis is reasonable for high-risk patients with FH and ASCVD whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, and niacin or hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone, which lower Lp(a), is not recommended to reduce ASCVD risk.

### Simvastatin and niacin (simcor) [^75044809]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Niacin

Niacin (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses reduces LDL-C, Apo B, Lp(a), TG, and Total-C, and increases HDL-C. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in HDL-C is associated with an increase in apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and a shift in the distribution of HDL subfractions. These shifts include an increase in the HDL2:HDL3 ratio, and an elevation in lipoprotein A-I (Lp A-I, an HDL-C particle containing only Apo A-I). Niacin treatment also decreases serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of Lp(a), a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. In addition, preliminary reports suggest that niacin causes favorable LDL particle size transformations, although the clinical relevance of this effect requires further investigation.

Simvastatin

Simvastatin reduces elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with primary heterozygous familial and nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Simvastatin reduces total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin decreases VLDL, total-C/HDL-C ratio, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^25d0178b]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The Lp(a) reductions with niacin of 12 nmol/L overall and 34 nmol/L in the top quintile by Lp(a) levels in the present study might, therefore, have been expected to produce reductions in the risk of coronary events of only ≈2% and 5% to 6%, respectively. Hence, compared with the contribution from the LDL-C reduction of 0.3 mmol/L with niacin–laropiprant in the HPS2-THRIVE trial, which would be expected to reduce major vascular events risk by 5% to 6% (Methods V in the), the overall benefits of the Lp(a) lowering achieved with niacin–laropiprant are likely to be much smaller.

No significant reduction in cardiovascular events with niacin was found in either the HPS2-THRIVE or AIM-HIGH trials, but there were significant excesses in the rates of various serious adverse events (including those related to diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, skin, infectious, and bleeding outcomes) among the niacin-allocated participants. – There was no trend in the excess of these serious adverse events with Lp(a) level in the present substudy (data not shown). Therefore, even in participants with high Lp(a), any benefits of niacin do not seem to outweigh the hazards.

The present results indicate that the effects of Lp(a)-lowering therapies should typically be considered in terms of their absolute reductions in Lp(a) levels rather than in terms of their proportional effectsbecause the proportional reductions can vary by baseline Lp(a) level (as well as be unduly influenced by the extent to which an assay is able to measure low Lp[a] levels; Figure 2; Table II in the). To produce 12% to 15% reductions in risk through Lp(a) lowering, novel therapies that reduce high Lp(a) levels by at least 80 nmol/L (ie, 40% among those in the top quintile of Lp[a] levels where mean Lp[a] was ≈200 nmol/L) are likely to be needed. Emerging therapies under evaluation, such as antisense oligonucleotides targeting apo(a) mRNA, hold the potential to achieve such reductions.

### Efficacy of extended-release niacin with lovastatin for hypercholesterolemia… [^e916ddf2]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Each 500-mg increase in niacin ER, on average, decreased LDL-C levels an additional 4% and increased HDL-C levels 8%. The maximum recommended dose increased HDL-C levels 29% and decreased LDL-C levels 46%, triglyceride levels 38%, and lipoprotein levels 14%. All lipid responses were dose dependent and generally additive. Graphs of the dose-response relationships as 3-dimensional surfaces documented the strength and consistency of these responses. For primary comparisons, mean reductions in LDL-C levels were significantly greater with niacin ER/lovastatin than with lovastatin alone and significantly greater with niacin ER/lovastatin than with lovastatin alone. Niacin ER/lovastatin produced incremental, dose-dependent decreases from baseline in LDL-C level from 22% at 500/10 mg/d to 47% at 2500/40 mg/d.

These changes were approximately equal to the arithmetic sum of the decreases seen with the individual components. On average, each 500-mg increase in niacin ER dose was associated with an additional 4% decrease in LDL-C level. After 4 weeks of receiving the maximum recommended dose of 2000 mg /40 mg, mean levels for LDL-C, TG, and Lp were reduced by 46%, 38%, and 14%, respectively, from baseline, while mean HDL-C level increased 29% from baseline. These results are equivalent to those reported in a prior open-label study, in which after 4 weeks, niacin ER/lovastatin was associated with mean LDL-C level reductions of 47%, TG level reductions of 41%, and HDL-C level increases of 30% from baseline, 22 supporting the reliability of the present study.

The mean reductions in LDL-C levels of 32%, 35%, and 39% at the 1000/20-, 1500/20-, and 2000/20-mg doses, respectively, were significantly greater than the reductions seen with lovastatin or lovastatin.

ADVICOR reduces LDL-C, TC, and TG, and increases HDL-C due to the individual actions of niacin and lovastatin. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality.

Niacin

Niacin functions in the body after conversion to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the NAD coenzyme system. Niacin (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses reduces LDL-C, Apo B, Lp(a), TG, and TC, and increases HDL-C. The increase in HDL-C is associated with an increase in apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and a shift in the distribution of HDL subfractions. These shifts include an increase in the HDL2:HDL3ratio, and an elevation in lipoprotein A-I (Lp A-I, an HDL-C particle containing only Apo A-I). In addition, preliminary reports suggest that niacin causes favorable LDL particle size transformations, although the clinical relevance of this effect is not yet clear.

Lovastatin

Lovastatin has been shown to reduce both normal and elevated LDL-C concentrations. Apo B also falls substantially during treatment with lovastatin. Since each LDL-C particle contains one molecule of Apo B, and since little Apo B is found in other lipoproteins, this strongly suggests that lovastatin does not merely cause cholesterol to be lost from LDL-C, but also reduces the concentration of circulating LDL particles. In addition, lovastatin can produce increases of variable magnitude in HDL-C, and modestly reduces VLDL-C and plasma TG. The effects of lovastatin on Lp(a), fibrinogen, and certain other independent biochemical risk markers for coronary heart disease are not well characterized.

### Dramatic lowering of very high Lp (a) in response to niacin [^b0a76afe]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a patient with markedly elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) without any other lipid abnormalities. After a myocardial infarction, she was treated with combination of extended-release niacin and statin. An 88% reduction in Lp(a) was observed during 5 years of treatment, which is much better response than usually reported.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^00368d4f]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Lp(a) is an important risk factor for coronary disease, particularly among individuals with genetic variation resulting in small apo(a) isoform size and high Lp(a) levels. However, even in individuals with extreme Lp(a) levels, the potential benefits of Lp(a) lowering with niacin–laropiprant on coronary event risk are likely to be small and would not be expected to outweigh the adverse effects of niacin. The impact of niacin–laropiprant varied substantially with apo(a) isoform size and, therefore, dependence on apo(a) isoform size or Lp(a) levels should be considered when assessing the potential benefits of novel Lp(a)-lowering therapies. Knowledge about variation in response by apo(a) isoform size may also be valuable for elucidating the mechanisms determining Lp(a) levels.

### Effects of extended-release niacin on the postprandial metabolism of Lp (a) and apoB-100-containing lipoproteins in statin-treated men with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^53df10dd]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The effects of extended-release niacin (ERN; 1–2 g/d) on the metabolism of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and apolipoprotein (apo) B-100-containing lipoproteins were investigated in 11 statin-treated white men with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a randomized, crossover trial of 12-weeks duration.

Approach and Results

The kinetics of Lp(a) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB-100 were determined following a standardized oral fat load (87% fat) using intravenous administration of D3-leucine, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and compartmental modeling. ERN significantly decreased fasting plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. These effects were achieved without significant changes in body weight or insulin resistance. ERN significantly decreased plasma Lp(a) concentration (-26.5%) and the production rates of apo(a) (-41.5%) and Lp(a)-apoB-100 (-32.1%); the effect was greater in individuals with elevated Lp(a) concentration. ERN significantly decreased VLDL (-58.7%), intermediate-density lipoprotein (-33.6%), and LDL (-18.3%) apoB-100 concentrations and the corresponding production rates (VLDL, -49.8%; intermediate-density lipoprotein, -44.7%; LDL, -46.1%). The number of VLDL apoB-100 particles secreted increased in response to the oral fat load. Despite this, total VLDL apoB-100 production over the 10-hour postprandial period was significantly decreased with ERN (-21.9%).

Conclusions

In statin-treated men with type 2 diabetes mellitus, ERN decreased plasma Lp(a) concentrations by decreasing the production of apo(a) and Lp(a)-apoB-100. ERN also decreased the concentrations of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins by decreasing VLDL production and the transport of these particles down the VLDL to LDL cascade. Our study provides further mechanistic insights into the lipid-regulating effects of ERN.

### Niacin (Niacor) [^e12f1a86]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Nicotinic acid (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses produces an average 10% to 20% reduction in total and LDL cholesterol, a 30% to 70% reduction in triglycerides, and an average 20% to 35% increase in HDL cholesterol. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in total HDL is associated with a shift in the distribution of HDL sub-fractions (as defined by ultra-centrifugation) with an increase in the HDL2:HDL3ratio and an increase in apolipoprotein A-I content. The mechanism by which nicotinic acid exerts these effects is not entirely understood, but may involve several actions, including a decrease in esterification of hepatic triglycerides. Nicotinic acid treatment also decreases the serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. The effect of nicotinic acid-induced changes in lipids/lipoproteins on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in individuals without pre-existing coronary disease has not been established.

Pharmacokinetics

Following an oral dose, the pharmacokinetic profile of nicotinic acid is characterized by rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and a short plasma elimination half-life. At a 1 gram dose, peak plasma concentrations of 15 to 30 µg/mL are reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Approximately 88% of an oral pharmacologic dose is eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged drug and nicotinuric acid, its primary metabolite. The plasma elimination half-life of nicotinic acid ranges from 20 to 45 minutes.

Introduction

Cardiovascular risk remains elevated in some high-risk patients even after lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and stopping smoking. Targeting other aspects of lipid metabolism, such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], as well as lowering LDL-C further, offers the prospect of additional cardiovascular risk reduction.

Niacin has potentially beneficial effects on multiple lipid fractions

Niacin is an old drug whose lipid modification properties at high doses have been recognized for many years. In patients already receiving a statin, extended release (ER) niacin 2 g daily is reported to increase HDL-C by ∼20% and apolipoprotein A 1 (apoA1) by ∼7%, as well as reducing LDL-C, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and Lp(a) levels by ∼20% and triglycerides by ∼25%. Previous observational studies have demonstrated a strong positive association of cardiovascular disease risk with LDL-C and a strong inverse association with HDL-C. Randomized trials of statin therapy indicate that the LDL-C association is causal, but it remains uncertain whether the association with HDL-C is causal. There is also evidence for a causal association between Lp(a) and CHD, with lower Lp(a) associated with lower CHD risk. Niacin does, therefore, have multiple effects on lipid metabolism which might be beneficial. In addition, niacin can reduce blood pressure, but it also has potentially adverse effects on glucose metabolism.

14.1 Niacin Clinical Studies

The role of LDL-C in atherogenesis is supported by pathological observations, clinical studies, and many animal experiments. Observational epidemiological studies have clearly established that high TC or LDL-C and low HDL-C are risk factors for CHD. Additionally, elevated levels of Lp(a) have been shown to be independently associated with CHD risk.

Niacin's ability to reduce mortality and the risk of definite, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) has been assessed in long-term studies. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of niacin and other lipid-altering drugs in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Over an observation period of 5 years, niacin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal, recurrent MI. The incidence of definite, nonfatal MI was 8.9% for the 1,119 patients randomized to nicotinic acid versus 12.2% for the 2,789 patients who received placebo (< 0.004). Total mortality was similar in the two groups at 5 years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; = N.S.). At the time of a 15-year follow-up, there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the niacin group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; = 0.0004). However, mortality at 15 years was not an original endpoint of the Coronary Drug Project. In addition, patients had not received niacin for approximately 9 years, and confounding variables such as concomitant medication use and medical or surgical treatments were not controlled. p p p

### The re-emergence of lipoprotein (a) in a broader clinical arena [^356ce57d]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetic, independent and likely causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Lp(a) levels are primarily genetically determined and tend to fluctuate only mildly around a pre-determined level. In primary care settings, one Lp(a) measurement can reclassify up to 40% of patients in intermediate risk score categories. In secondary care settings, recent data from the JUPITER and AIM-HIGH trials demonstrate that elevated Lp(a) remains part of the "residual risk" despite achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels < 70 mg/dL. Recent reports suggest that statins can increase Lp(a) levels, potentially further contributing to this residual risk. Current therapies to lower Lp(a) are limited to niacin, mipomersen and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin-type 9 inhibitors, but these drugs are limited by weak efficacy and not specifically approved for Lp(a) lowering. Emerging therapies to lower Lp(a) may shed new light into the potential clinical benefit of lowering Lp(a) in CVD and CAVS.

### Relationship of apolipoproteins A-1 and B, and lipoprotein (a) to cardiovascular outcomes: the AIM-HIGH trial (atherothrombosis intervention in metabolic syndrome with low HDL / high triglyceride and impact on global health outcomes) [^f46e058a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the relationship between baseline and on-study apolipoproteins (apo) A-1 and B and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels and the development of subsequent cardiovascular (CV) events in the AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes) trial.

Background

Niacin has been reported to lower apoB and Lp(a) and to raise apoA-1.

Methods

Individuals with CV disease and low baseline levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were randomized to simvastatin plus placebo or simvastatin, plus extended-release niacin ([ERN], 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day), with ezetimibe added as needed, in both groups, to maintain an on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the range of 40 to 80 mg/dl. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to evaluate the relationship between levels of apoA-1, apoB, and Lp(a), and CV events in each treatment group.

Results

Baseline apoB and the apoB/apoA-I ratio were significantly predictive of CV events only for the placebo group (HR: 1.17 [p = 0.018] and HR: 1.19 [p = 0.016]). Baseline and on-study Lp(a) were predictive of CV events in both simvastatin plus placebo (baseline HR: 1.24 [p = 0.002] and on-study HR: 1.21 [p = 0.017]) and the simvastatin plus ERN group (baseline HR: 1.25 [p = 0.001] and on-study HR: 1.18 [p = 0.028]). The ERN modestly increased 1-year apoA-1 (7%), decreased apoB (13%), decreased the ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio (19%), and decreased Lp(a) 21%, but did not reduce CV events.

Conclusions

Lp(a) was associated with increased CV risk in both treatment groups indicating that it contributes to residual CV risk. However, there was no evidence that ERN reduced CV risk, despite favorable lipoprotein changes.

14.3 NIASPAN and Lovastatin Clinical Studies

Combination NIASPAN and Lovastatin Study: In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, 28-week study, a combination tablet of NIASPAN and lovastatin was compared to each individual component in patients with Type IIa and IIb hyperlipidemia. Using a forced dose-escalation study design, patients received each dose for at least 4 weeks. Patients randomized to treatment with the combination tablet of NIASPAN and lovastatin initially received 500 mg/20 mg (expressed as mg of niacin/mg of lovastatin) once daily before bedtime. The dose was increased by 500 mg at 4-week intervals (based on the NIASPAN component) to a maximum dose of 1000 mg/20 mg in one-half of the patients and 2000 mg/40 mg in the other half. The NIASPAN monotherapy group underwent a similar titration from 500 mg to 2000 mg. The patients randomized to lovastatin monotherapy received 20 mg for 12 weeks titrated to 40 mg for up to 16 weeks. Up to a third of the patients randomized to the combination tablet of NIASPAN and lovastatin or NIASPAN monotherapy discontinued prior to Week 28. Results from this study showed that combination therapy decreased LDL-C, TG and Lp(a), and increased HDL-C in a dose-dependent fashion (Tables 8, 9, 10, and 11). Results from this study for LDL-C mean percent change from baseline (the primary efficacy variable) showed that:

Lp(a) as a target

Elevated Lp(a) levels are an ASCVD risk factor across numerous patient demographics and geographic ancestries, as well as in patients treated with statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. The Lp(a) particle resembles LDL, but is independently regulated and metabolized. Both niacin and serial apheresis treatments were previously recommended to reduce Lp(a) but each has significant drawbacks and neither reduced ASCVD events. PCSK9 inhibitors — both monoclonal antibodies and inclisiran — lower Lp(a) by 26%, but this is insufficient for individuals with very high Lp(a) levels. A GalNAc-linked ASO against Lp(a) (TQJ230, trade name pelacarsen, Novartis) reduces its levels by 80% to 90% with no effect on other variables; this agent is being evaluated in a large randomized of secondary prevention of ASCVD in individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels. An siRNA compound aimed at reducing apo(a) synthesis (AMG 890, trade name olpasiran, Amgen) is also under investigation. Depending on results of outcome trials, these agents could be helpful for patients with elevated Lp(a) levels.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^84dfbaa9]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The strong genetic determination and highly skewed distribution of Lp(a) are in marked contrast to the features of LDL particles not associated with Lp(a). However, both Lp(a) and other LDL particles are causally associated with coronary disease and are reduced by some of the same lipid-modifying therapies. The most widely used treatment that lowers Lp(a) substantially is nicotinic acid (niacin), which is reported to lower Lp(a) by 30% to 40% on average. Niacin also lowers LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and has been widely used in the United States as an addition to statin therapy with the intention of producing greater reductions in cardiovascular risk, and is under consideration for the prevention of aortic valve disease. Recent randomized evidence has, however, demonstrated several hazards associated with niacin and, in the HPS2-THRIVE (Heart Protection Study 2–Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) and AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) trials, there were no significant benefits of the extended release niacin formulations on vascular outcomes. – The CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibitor, anacetrapib, and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors also lower Lp(a) to a similar extent, – in conjunction with lowering LDL-C and other lipid changes.

ApoB was baseline 82.9 ± 20.7; at year 3, niacin 70.4 ± 19.7 vs placebo 77.6 ± 16.9. For Lp(a), baseline (IQR) was niacin 36.0 (13.4–126.3) vs placebo 32.6 (13.1–120.3); at year 1, niacin 27.1 (8.3–106.5) vs placebo 30.6 (10.9–121.1).

### Raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with niacin and fibrates: a comparative review [^ae7a9483]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

A growing number of trials that used fibrates and niacin alone or in combination with other lipid-altering agents have shown that both these drugs are effective for reducing total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides, and for increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. These lipid changes are associated with a reduction in events such as fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. In angiographic trials, they are associated with disease regression, increased minimal luminal diameter, and protection from risk of new lesions. In a head-to-head comparison study, niacin 2,000 mg/day increased HDL-C more than gemfibrozil 1,200 mg/day, and decreased the total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratio, lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]), and fibrinogen levels significantly more. Combination therapies of niacin plus a resin or statin are effective, well tolerated, and safe.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^d55c57aa]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Niacin

Niacin — or nicotinic acid — is a third-line oral agent used in patients with mild-to-moderate dyslipidemia. Niacin 2 to 3 g daily can lower plasma TG by up to 45%, raise plasma HDL-C by up to 25%, and reduce plasma LDL-C by up to 20%. After almost 6 decades of clinical use, niacin's mechanism of action remains unknown. Niacin often causes light-headedness, skin flushing, and pruritus. Other adverse effects include elevated liver enzymes, gastrointestinal upset, worsened glucose tolerance, and elevated uric acid. Adding extended-release niacin to statin therapy did not reduce ASCVD outcomes in 2 pivotal trials. Thus, niacin is no longer recommended in treatment guidelines and its use has declined.

Lomitapide

Lomitapide is a daily oral medication that was developed for the treatment of biallelic hypercholesterolemia (homozygous FH [HoFH]). Lomitapide lowers LDL-C and TG each by 40% to 50% by directly inhibiting assembly of apo B-containing lipoproteins in the liver and intestine. Fatty liver is a mechanism-based adverse effect. However, ~25% of patients in short-term studies developed transaminase elevations and accumulation of hepatic fat, although this became less severe with prolonged treatment. Fat-soluble vitamin supplements are often included with lomitapide treatment.

Extracorporeal LDL-C removal

Extracorporeal removal of lipoproteins is achieved through either weekly or biweekly nonspecific serial plasma exchange plasma exchange or plasmapheresis, or specific targeted approaches to remove LDL or Lp(a) such as size exclusion columns or antibody-based affinity columns (reviewed in. There are no randomized ASCVD outcomes trials with any of these methods, and their use varies widely, mainly to manage the lipid disturbances in severe hypercholesterolemia, especially biallelic hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) or elevated Lp(a). Untreated HoFH has been associated with premature mortality because patients have virtually no functional LDL receptors to upregulate, and statins have little to no effect. The mainstay of treatment in HoFH is one of several extracorporeal approaches to remove the accumulating LDL particles. Apheresis has prolonged the atherosclerosis-free survival of HoFH patients, who now live long enough to have manifestation of unexpected cardiovascular disease end points, specifically aortic root and valvular calcification, often requiring surgical replacement. Future use of apheresis may be reduced by some newer agents discussed in the following section.

### Effect of therapeutic interventions on oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B100 and lipoprotein (a) [^6952648c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL-apoB) reflect the biological activity of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) and predict cardiovascular disease events. However, studies with statins and low-fat diets show increases in OxPL-apoB and Lp(a).

Objective

This study evaluated changes in OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) with extended-release niacin (N), ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) and combination E/S/N. A systematic literature review of previously published trials, measuring both OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) after therapeutic interventions, was also performed.

Methods

OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) were measured in 591 patients at baseline and 24 weeks after therapy with N, E/S, or E/S/N in a previously completed randomized trial of hypercholesterolemic patients. The literature review included 12 trials and 3896 patients evaluating statins, low-fat diets, antisense to apolipoprotein(a) and lipid apheresis.

Results

Niacin decreased OxPL-apoB levels (median [interquartile range]; 3.5 [2.2–9.2] nM to 3.1 [1.8–7.2] nM, P < .01) and Lp(a) (10.9 [4.6–38.4] to 9.3 [3.1–32.9] mg/dL, P < .01). In contrast, E/S and E/S/N significantly increased OxPL-apoB (3.5 [2.1–7.8] to 4.9 [3.0–11.1] nM, P < .01) and (3.3 [1.9–9.3] to 4.3 [2.6–11.2] nM, P < .01), respectively and Lp(a) (11.5 [6.1–36.4] to 14.9 [6.6–54.6] mg/dL, P < .01) and (11.3 [5.4–43.8] to 11.6 [5.9–52.8] mg/dL, P < .01), respectively. The systematic review of statins and diet demonstrated 23.8% and 21.3% mean increases in OxPL-apoB and 10.6% and 19.4% increases in Lp(a), respectively. However 44.1% and 52.0% decreases in OxPL-apoB and Lp(a), respectively, were present with Lp(a)-lowering therapies.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates differential changes in OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) with various lipid-lowering approaches. These changes in OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) may provide insights into the results and interpretation of recent cardiovascular disease outcomes trials.

### Lipoprotein (a): perspectives from a lipid-referral program [^06d1af1c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] has a strong association with coronary disease (CHD). We evaluated the implications of implementing a niacin strategy in persons above low risk by the Framingham risk score (FRS).

Methods

Patients referred to a university lipid management program from January 2004 to June 2010 had an Lp(a) level measured at initial evaluation. Factors associated with an increase in Lp(a) and predictors of a high risk Lp(a) (≥ 50 mg/dL) were assessed. FRS and Lp(a) levels were used to assess eligibility for niacin with an Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL.

Results

A total of 692 patients (57% male, mean age 52 ± 14 years) had a mean Lp(a) of 32 ± 40 mg/dL. In a multiple logistic regression model, African-American race, female gender, presence of CHD, and lower triglyceride levels were significant predictors of high risk Lp(a). Ten percent were determined to be intermediate and 44% high risk by FRS. A total of 9% of intermediate- and 26% of high-risk patients had an Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL, and 84% were not taking niacin. A total of 19% of moderate- and high-risk patients were eligible for initiation of niacin based upon values ≥ 50 mg/dL. If niacin were also used for an high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≤ 40 mg/dL, only 5.1% additional patients would require niacin.

Conclusion

High-risk levels of Lp(a) are associated with female gender, African- American race, and CHD. 19% of moderate and high risk patients would be candidates for treatment with niacin if the indication is a cutpoint Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL.

### Niacin: another look at an underutilized lipid-lowering medication [^69bd3582]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

Niacin, or water-soluble vitamin B(3), when given at pharmacologic doses, is a powerful lipid-altering agent. This drug, which lowers the levels of atherogenic, apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins, is one of few medications that can raise the levels of atheroprotective HDL cholesterol. Niacin also has beneficial effects on other cardiovascular risk factors, including lipoprotein(a), C-reactive protein, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and fibrinogen. Many clinical trials have confirmed the lipid effects of niacin treatment; however, its effects on cardiovascular outcomes have been called into question owing to the AIM-HIGH trial, which showed no benefit of niacin therapy on cardiovascular endpoints. Furthermore, use of niacin has historically been limited by tolerability issues. In addition to flushing, worsened hyperglycaemia among patients with diabetes mellitus has also been a concern with niacin therapy. This article reviews the utility of niacin including its mechanism of action, clinical trial data regarding cardiovascular outcomes, adverse effect profile and strategies to address these effects and improve compliance.

Niacin has a variety of effects on lipids, including lowering LDL-C, apoB, and Lp(a) and raising HDL-C and apoA1, which might be expected to translate into reductions in vascular events. Over 25 000 people at high risk of vascular events were randomized in HPS2-THRIVE and three-quarters remained compliant with ERN/LRPT after 3.9 years' median follow-up. Based on this compliance and the lipid changes observed during the pre-randomization run-in, it was estimated prior to unblinding the trial that study average differences in LDL-C of ∼0.25 mmol/L and HDL-C of ∼0.13 mmol/L would have been achieved. Based on previous observational studies and randomized trials, it was anticipated that such lipid differences might translate into a 10–15% reduction in vascular events. At least 3400 of these high-risk participants were expected to have confirmed MVEs during an average of ∼4 years of follow-up, so HPS2-THRIVE has excellent statistical power to detect or exclude effects of this magnitude.

### Simvastatin and niacin (simcor) [^90af13fb]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Niacin

Niacin functions in the body after conversion to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the NAD coenzyme system. The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles is not completely understood and may involve several actions, including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity (which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma). Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL-C and LDL-C, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids.

Simvastatin

Simvastatin is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed to its active ß-hydroxyacid form, simvastatin acid, after administration. Simvastatin is a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. In addition, simvastatin reduces VLDL and TG and increases HDL-C.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of Total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of Total-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.

Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and their remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma TG are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

SIMCOR

SIMCOR reduces total-C, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, Apo B, TG, and Lp(a) levels and increases HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, or hypertriglyceridemia.

### Lipoprotein (a) and its significance in cardiovascular disease: a review [^de768117]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-like particle bound to apolipoprotein(a). This novel marker of cardiovascular disease acts through induction of vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, calcification, and thrombosis. While an absolute risk threshold remains to be universally accepted, an estimated 20% to 25% of the global population have Lp(a) levels of 50 mg/dL or higher, a level noted by the European Atherosclerosis Society to confer increased cardiovascular risk.

Observations

Compelling evidence from pathophysiological, observational, and genetic studies suggest a potentially causal association between high Lp(a) levels, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Additional evidence has demonstrated that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with a residual cardiovascular risk despite traditional risk factor optimization, including LDL cholesterol reduction. These findings have led to the formulation of the Lp(a) hypothesis, namely that Lp(a) lowering leads to cardiovascular risk reduction, intensifying the search for Lp(a)-reducing therapies. The ineffectiveness of lifestyle modification, statins, and ezetimibe to lower Lp(a); the modest Lp(a) reduction with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors; the adverse effect profile and unclear cardiovascular benefit of pharmacotherapies such as niacin and mipomersen; and the impracticality of regular lipoprotein apheresis represent major challenges to currently available therapies. Nevertheless, emerging nucleic acid-based therapies, such as the antisense oligonucleotide pelacarsen and the small interfering RNA olpasiran, are generating interest because of their potent Lp(a)-lowering effects. Assessment of new-onset diabetes in patients achieving very low Lp(a) levels will be important in future trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Epidemiologic and genetic studies suggest a potentially causal association between elevated Lp(a) levels, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and aortic valve stenosis. Emerging nucleic acid-based therapies have potent Lp(a)-lowering effects and appear safe; phase 3 trials will establish whether they improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Lipoprotein (a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^52b8fef6]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Compared with LDL, Lp(a) is relatively refractory to both lifestyle and drug intervention. The data on the effects of statins and fibrates on Lp(a) are limited and highly variable. Overall, statins have, however, been shown to consistently and modestly decrease elevated Lp(a) in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Other agents reported to decrease Lp(a) to a minor degree (< 10%) include aspirin,-carnitine, ascorbic acid combined with-lysine, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, androgens, oestrogen, and its replacements (e.g. tibolone), anti-estrogens (e.g. tamoxifen), and thyroxine replacement in hypothyroid subjects.

Larger studies of longer duration of Lp(a) lowering against background statin therapy in high-risk individuals including diabetics are needed. In the FATS angiographic trial, aggressive lowering of LDL and apolipoprotein B abrogated the risk due to Lp(a) in patients with established coronary disease. The ongoing AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE trials will further evaluate this notion, although the niacin employed in these trials is not selective for Lp(a) lowering as noted above.

It is clear that more detailed studies of the metabolism of Lp(a) are required to aid in the design and development of selective and potent therapies for lowering Lp(a). Given the critical role of Lp(a) synthesis in determining the plasma concentration of Lp(a), targeting either the synthesis of apolipoprotein(a) and/or the formation of Lp(a) would appear worthwhile. Antisense oligonucleotide and thyroid hormone analogue therapies directed at apolipoprotein(a) synthesis may hold particular promise for the future.

Finally, in young or middle-aged patients with evidence of progressive coronary disease and markedly elevated plasma Lp(a), serious consideration should be given to instituting LDL apheresis which removes Lp(a) efficaciously; however, this form of treatment is prohibitively expensive and impractical for most patients and most clinical centres.

Figure 2.
Percentage and absolute reductions in lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) with niacin–laropiprant by quintiles of baseline Lp(a) levels and kringle IV domains. Percentage reduction panels show adjusted Lp(a) reductions based on modeling log e Lp(a) (Methods) and are plotted with an x scale linear in the log e Lp(a) difference. Absolute reductions (with adjustment by stratification) are plotted on linear scales. Usual mean Lp(a) is the mean Lp(a) in the placebo arm at 1 y.

The overall absolute reduction in Lp(a) was 12.2 (95% confidence interval, 9.3–14.8) nmol/L (20% of the overall adjusted mean level in the placebo arm of 60 nmol/L: Figure 2) but increased with baseline Lp(a) level in a less than pro rata manner, such that in the top Lp(a) quintile, where the mean Lp(a) was ≈200 nmol/L, the reduction was 33.8 (95% confidence interval, 20.9–46.1) nmol/L.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^9fb215c8]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dependencies of Lp(a) reductions on apo(a) isoform size would not only affect assessment of the efficacy of Lp(a)-lowering therapies but could also provide insight into mechanisms determining Lp(a) levels, which are poorly understood. The wide variation in plasma Lp(a) levels has been attributed to variation in the rates of hepatic production of Lp(a) of different apo(a) isoform size. Apo(a) glycosylation affecting Lp(a) synthesis, and kidney function affecting Lp(a) excretion, have also been reported to have apo(a) isoform-dependent effects. Mounting evidence indicates that niacin acts by reducing Lp(a) production through inhibiting apo(a), and possibly Lp(a)-apoB-100, production. CETP inhibition has also been reported to reduce Lp(a) by decreasing the production of apo(a). ApoB antisense and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors block the production of Lp(a) and other apoB-containing lipoprotein particles by blocking apoB production.PCSK9 inhibition and APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 genotype have been demonstrated to affect clearance of Lp(a) via the LDL receptor, – but the importance of this route of clearance remains debated, and PCSK9 may also act by modifying apoB production. Confirmation that the suggested mechanisms of action for particular therapies can explain any observed trends in the therapeutic Lp(a) reductions with Lp(a) levels, and KIV domains would help consolidate the explanations.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^2e5c45d0]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Absolute reductions in Lp(a) with any of these therapies are likely to vary considerably between individuals with different Lp(a) levels. Proportional reductions may also vary with baseline Lp(a) level (as seen in the LAPLACE (LDL-C Assessment with PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibody Inhibition Combined With Statin Therapy) trial of PCSK9 inhibition where the percentage reduction with evolocumab varied from ≈40%– < 20% in the lowest-to-highest quartiles by Lp[a] level) or with the number of KIV domains. More detailed information on factors that influence the magnitude of reductions in Lp(a) is thus needed to assess the potential benefits of such therapies through Lp(a) lowering.

This report considers the Lp(a)- and LDL-lowering effects of extended release niacin plus laropiprant (niacin–laropiprant) in the HPS2-THRIVE randomized trial. It aims to evaluate the reduction in Lp(a) by baseline Lp(a) levels and numbers of KIV domains, to estimate by how much Lp(a) reduction with niacin–laropiprant might be expected to reduce coronary heart disease risk.

### Genetic variants associated with plasma lipids are associated with the lipid response to niacin [^acb031e7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Niacin is a broad‐spectrum lipid‐modulating drug, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Genome‐wide association studies have identified multiple loci associated with blood lipid levels and lipoprotein (a). It is unknown whether these loci modulate response to niacin.

Methods and Results

Using data from the‐(Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low/High Triglycerides and Impact on Global Health Outcomes) trial (n = 2054 genotyped participants), we determined whether genetic variations at validated loci were associated with a differential change in plasma lipids and lipoprotein (a) 1 year after randomization to either statin+placebo or statin+niacin in a variant‐treatment interaction model. Nominally significant interactions (P < 0.05) were found for genetic variants in,4,3 with change in high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol; 3 with change in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol; 1 with change in total cholesterol; 1 and 26A1 with change in triglycerides; and none for lipoprotein (a). We also investigated whether these loci were associated with cardiovascular events. The risk of coronary disease related death was higher in the minor allele carriers at thelocus in the placebo group (odds ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval 1.11‐3.90, P = 0.02) but not observed in the niacin group (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.48‐1.65, P = 0.7); P ‐interaction = 0.02. There was a greater risk for acute coronary syndrome (odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.16‐2.77, P = 0.02) and revascularization events (odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.2‐2.22, P = 0.002) in major allele carriers at the 26A1 locus in the placebo group not seen in the niacin group.

Conclusions

Genetic variation at loci previously associated with steady‐state lipid levels displays evidence for lipid response to niacin treatment.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^5bb50007]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Genetic studies have shown lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) to be an important causal risk factor for coronary disease. Apolipoprotein(a) isoform size is the chief determinant of Lp(a) levels, but its impact on the benefits of therapies that lower Lp(a) remains unclear.

Methods

HPS2-THRIVE (Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) is a randomized trial of niacin-laropiprant versus placebo on a background of simvastatin therapy. Plasma Lp(a) levels at baseline and 1 year post-randomization were measured in 3978 participants from the United Kingdom and China. Apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, estimated by the number of kringle IV domains, was measured by agarose gel electrophoresis and the predominantly expressed isoform identified.

Results

Allocation to niacin-laropiprant reduced mean Lp(a) by 12 (SE, 1) nmol/L overall and 34 (6) nmol/L in the top quintile by baseline Lp(a) level (Lp[a] ≥ 128 nmol/L). The mean proportional reduction in Lp(a) with niacin-laropiprant was 31% but varied strongly with predominant apolipoprotein(a) isoform size (P Trend = 4×10–29) and was only 18% in the quintile with the highest baseline Lp(a) level and low isoform size. Estimates from genetic studies suggest that these Lp(a) reductions during the short term of the trial might yield proportional reductions in coronary risk of ≈2% overall and 6% in the top quintile by Lp(a) levels.

Conclusions

Proportional reductions in Lp(a) were dependent on apolipoprotein(a) isoform size. Taking this into account, the likely benefits of niacin-laropiprant on coronary risk through Lp(a) lowering are small. Novel therapies that reduce high Lp(a) levels by at least 80 nmol/L (≈40%) may be needed to produce worthwhile benefits in people at the highest risk because of Lp(a).

### Lipoprotein (a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^087d2abd]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Promise of Lp(a) lowering in aortic valve disease

There is robust evidence that high Lp(a) concentrations are likely causal in the initiation of aortic valve disease and also associate with increased disease activity and progression (Table 2). Randomized controlled trial of Lp(a) lowering in AVS are now required. While tempting to speculate about the impact of Lp(a) lowering on AVS progression, defining the most appropriate patient population and selecting appropriate trial endpoint in aortic stenosis is a challenge.

Consensus panel recommendations for managing high Lp(a) concentration

In the absence of specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies, early risk factor management is recommended for individuals with elevated Lp(a), taking into account their absolute global cardiovascular risk and Lp(a) level.
Among patients with high Lp(a), all cardiovascular risk factors should be comprehensively addressed as per guideline recommendations.
Lipoprotein apheresis can be considered in patients with very high Lp(a) and progressive cardiovascular disease despite optimal management of risk factors.
Niacin is not recommended for Lp(a) lowering.

### Effects of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, alone or in combination, on lipoprotein (a) [^f9e70482]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are little evidences about the therapeutic efficacy of different lipid-lowering agents in the reduction of elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)].

Objective

testing the effect of different lipid-lowering agents on elevated Lp(a).

Methods

prospective interventional study performed in patients with CAD, or high CAD risk, with Lp(a), > 50 mg/dL. Lp(a), total cholesterol (C), HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides (TGs), apolipoprotein (Apo) A1, Apo B, enzymes of myocyte and hepatic injury were comparatively analyzed between 4 lipid-lowering strategies: rosuvastatin (R group) 40 mg, atorvastatin (A group) 80 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg add-on micronized fenofibrate (A+F group), and atorvastatin 40 mg add-on 1 g extended-release niacin (A+ERN group). Comparison was made for their therapeutic efficacy on Lp(a), and safety.

Results

87 patients with mean Lp(a) 94.6 ± 39.6 mg/dL were analyzed. Groups: 25 patients in the R, 22 in the A, 20 in the A+F and 20 in A+ERN group. Significant reduction in all lipid fractions in all treatment groups was reported after 6 months. The average reduction of Lp(a) was 15.9 ± 21.0 mg/dL, with: 18.2 ± 24.8 (P = 0.001) in the R group, 17.3 ± 10.4 (P = 0.001) in A+F, 19.5 ± 10.9 (P = 0.001) in A+ERN and the lowest in the A group (11.24 ± 22.91, P = 0.032). No adverse effects were observed in any of the treatment groups.

Conclusions

When compared with atorvastatin, it seems that rosuvastatin can achieve more significant decrease of Lp(a). The efficacy of the second one can be increased by adding fibrate or ERN.

### Cholesteryl ester transfer protein: at the heart of the action of lipid-modulating therapy with statins, fibrates, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors [^7ef9acb3]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Niacin

The broad spectrum action and efficacy of niacin (nicotinic acid; vitamin B3) in markedly lowering elevated concentrations of TG-rich lipoproteins, IDL, LDL, and Lp(a), together with its capacity to raise HDL-C, are especially notable. Indeed, niacin is presently the most effective agent available for raising HDL-C, typically increasing levels by up to 30% on a dose-dependent basis. The clinical benefits associated with niacin treatment, both as monotherapy or in combination with a statin, feature attenuation of atherosclerosis progression and/or induction of plaque regression in addition to reduction in cardiovascular risk, and have been reviewed elsewhere. The mechanisms underlying the action of niacin in reducing plasma VLDL, LDL, and apoB levels in vivo involve enhanced clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins containing either apoB100 or B48, although evidence is equally available to support decreased rates of VLDL production; such discrepancies may depend upon the metabolic background. Only recently has attention been focused on delineating the mechanisms which underlie the HDL-raising action of niacin. Four key processes are considered to contribute to niacin-mediated elevation in apoA-I and HDL-C levels: (i) up-regulation of apoA-I production rate (+24%) relative to placebo without change in fractional catabolic rate, with no change in either the concentration of or kinetic parameters for apoA-II; (ii) the ability of niacin to exert transient inhibition of hormone-sensitive TG lipase in adipose tissue and attenuate liberation of free fatty acids via TG lipolysis, with consequent reduction in hepatic VLDL-TG production, plasma VLDL levels, and thence in CETP-mediated depletion of HDL-CE; (iii) reduction in plasma CETP activity as a result of the combined effect of reduction in hepatic CETP gene expression, plasma CETP mass, and numbers of apoB-containing acceptor particles available for HDL-CE (see below);, and (iv) reduction in the hepatic uptake of HDL, potentially by the holo-particle uptake pathway. Considered together, these processes would feasibly increase the plasma residence time of HDL and apoA-I and thus increase HDL-C levels. Such action is entirely consistent with recent findings in low HDL-C human subjects with established CAD who were treated with a niacin/statin combination, and in whom abnormalities in the HDL proteome were partially reversed. Finally, the potential role of niacin in enhancing cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 from macrophages to HDL acceptors, with positive impact on HDL-C levels, cannot be excluded. The above observations concur to place CETP firmly at the centre of the processes mediated by niacin treatment which directly lead to efficacious elevation of both HDL-C and apoA-I.

### A dose-ranging study of a new, once-daily, dual-component drug product containing niacin extended-release and lovastatin [^df4b7208]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy for dyslipidemia holds promise as effective treatment for patients with multiple lipid disorders, especially those at high risk.

Hypothesis

This study evaluated dose-response relationships and safety of a new dual-component drug product containing niacin extended-release (niacin ER) and lovastatin.

Methods

The 28-week double-blind multicenter trial randomized 237 patients with type IIA or IIB hyperlipidemia to one of four escalating-dose treatment groups: niacin ER/lovastatin 1,000/20 mg, niacin ER/lovastatin 2,000/40 mg, niacin ER 2,000 mg, or lovastatin 40 mg.

Results

Niacin ER/lovastatin was more effective than each of its components for improving levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and exhibited a clear dose-response effect and additivity across the dosage range. The 2,000/40 dose achieved greater mean reductions in LDL-C (-42%) than 1,000/20 (-28%, p < 0.001), lovastatin 40 mg (-32%, p < 0.05), or niacin ER 2,000 mg (-14%, p < 0.05). The 2,000/40 dose was significantly more effective in increasing HDL-C levels (+30%) than the 1,000/20 dose (+21%, p = 0.016). The decrease in TG was greater with 2,000/40 (-43%) than with 1,000/20 (-26%, p = 0.009). All three niacin-containing treatments were more effective than lovastatin monotherapy in reducing lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels. Flushing caused 12 (11%) patients receiving niacin ER/lovastatin and I patient receiving lovastatin alone to withdraw. No drug-related myopathy was noted. One patient each in the 2,000/40 group and the lovastatin 40-mg group had reversible elevations in liver transaminases.

Conclusions

Niacin ER/lovastatin is well tolerated and effective for patients with multiple lipid disorders.

### Niacin plus statin to prevent vascular events… [^00302f76]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Even among patients entering the study with baseline low density lipoprotein cholesterol already near or at goal and who achieved a mean on-trial LDL-C of 70 mg/dL with simvastatin, the 5-year risk of an event was still 18%. Niacin is an even more effective agent for simultaneously raising HDL-C and lowering triglycerides and levels of small dense LDL, and holds the most promise among existing therapies for substantial risk reduction in this population when added to a statin. This was demonstrated in the HDL Atherosclerosis Treatment Study trial in which atherosclerosis progression was virtually halted and CV events were reduced by 60 to 90% using combined niacin plus statin therapy.

DESIGN NARRATIVE: AIM-HIGH is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial designed to test whether the drug combination of extended release niacin plus simvastatin is superior to simvastatin alone, at comparable levels of on-treatment LDL-C, for delaying the time to a first major CV disease outcome over a 4-year median follow-up in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. Prior clinical trials have found only 25 to 35% CV risk reduction using statin monotherapy. The study is needed to confirm whether statin-niacin combination therapy, designed to target a wider spectrum of dyslipidemic factors in addition to LDL-C, will provide a more substantial reduction of CV events.
- **For patients entering the trial on a statin**: the upper limit for LDL-C is adjusted according to the specific statin and statin dose; HDL-C of less than or equal to 42 mg/dL for men or less than or equal to 53 mg/dL for women; TG greater than or equal to 125 mg/dL and less than or equal to 400 mg/DL.

### Nicotinic acid (niacin) receptor agonists: will they be useful therapeutic agents? [^1b35581c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Nicotinic acid (niacin) favorably affects very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lipoprotein (a) (LP[a]) and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Emerging data indicates vascular anti-inflammatory properties to additionally account for niacin's proven effects in cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence indicates that niacin acts on GPR109A and GPR109B (HM74A and HM74, respectively), receptors expressed in adipocytes and immune cells. In adipocytes, GPR109A activation reduces triglyceride (TG) lipolysis, resulting in decreased free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization to the liver. In humans, this mechanism has yet to be confirmed because the plasma FFA decrease is transient and is followed by a rebound increase in FFA levels. New evidence indicates niacin directly inhibits diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) isolated from human hepatocytes, resulting in accelerated hepatic apolipoprotein (apo)B degradation and decreased apoB secretion, thus explaining reductions in VLDL and LDL. This raises important questions as to whether stimulation of GPR109A in adipocytes or inhibition of DGAT2 in liver by niacin best explain the reduction in VLDL and LDL in dyslipidemic patients. Kinetic and in vitro studies indicate that niacin retards the hepatic catabolism of apoA-I but not liver scavenger receptor B1-mediated cholesterol esters, suggesting that niacin inhibits hepatic holoparticle HDL removal. Indeed, recent preliminary evidence suggests that niacin decreases surface expression of hepatic beta-chain of adenosine triphosphate synthase, which has been implicated in apoA-I/HDL holoparticle catabolism. GPR109A-mediated production of prostaglandin D2 in macrophages and Langerhan cells causes skin capillary vasodilation and explains, in part, niacin's effect on flushing. Development of niacin receptor agonists would, theoretically, result in adipocyte TG accumulation (and clinical adiposity) and increased flushing. This raises questions about niacin receptor agonists as therapeutic agents. Several niacin receptor agonists have been developed and patented, but their clinical effects have not been described. Future research is needed to determine whether niacin receptor agonists will demonstrate all the beneficial properties of nicotinic acid on atherosclerosis and without significant adverse effects.

### Lipoprotein (a) interactions with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors in premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [^52e4eee1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Future trials targeting individuals with high Lp(a) using statins (to lower LDL‐C), niacin, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, 34, 35 or specific Lp(a)‐lowering antisense therapies 36 are clearly warranted to confirm the benefits of lipid‐lowering in individuals with high Lp(a), and should pay special attention to the subgroup with concomitant elevations of LDL‐C, who may be at highest cardiovascular risk. It is noteworthy that PCSK9 inhibitors have shown promising results with respect to significantly lowering both Lp(a) and LDL‐C and may serve as the future preferred treatment strategy for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia with combined elevations of Lp(a) and LDL‐C. 34, 35, 37 Anacetrapib, the only cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor currently under investigation, has also been suggested to effectively reduce both LDL‐C and Lp(a) levels. 38 In contrast, Lp(a)‐lowering agents such as tibolone, 39 as well as recent antisense therapies could potentially be used as the primary approach to treat individuals with isolated high Lp(a) levels. 36 A randomized trial with Lp(a)‐lowering antisense agents could also provide the final confirmatory test of causality for the role of Lp(a) in coronary artery disease and aortic valve disease. 40

### How Do lipoprotein (a) concentrations affect clinical outcomes for patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent different dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention? [^3e73fc1a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

However, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies that specifically target high Lp(a) levels. The commonly used statins have no Lp(a) lowering effect, and a close assessment of published studies has even indicated a slight Lp(a) increasing effect. Though having a 20% to 30% Lp(a)‐lowering effects, both niacin and mipomersen are associated with side effects, and mipomersen is only approved in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia caused by hepatotoxicity. A post hoc analysis of the evaluation of cardiovascular outcomes after an acute coronary syndrome during treatment with alirocumab trial indicated that Lp(a) lowering by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor contributed independently to cardiovascular event reduction in patients with ACS, yet each 5‐mg/dL reduction in Lp(a) only predicted a 2.5% relative reduction in cardiovascular events. However, several Mendelian randomization analyses speculated that ≈66 to 100 mg/dL reduction of Lp(a) may be required to achieve equivalent protective effects yielded from a 39‐mg/dL (or 1 mmol/L) reduction of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although Tsimikas et al found that a novel therapeutic agent, apoA‐L Rx, provides potent reductions in levels of Lp(a) in patients with cardiovascular disease by reducing the production of apoA, which offers greater specificity than proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor. Further trials are needed to assess the impact of Lp(a) lowering with apoA‐L Rx on ischemic events in patients with established CAD.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^64396482]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In the quintile with the lowest Lp(a) levels, Lp(a) may be subject to more measurement error, and Lp(a) lowering would be least relevant. When this quintile was excluded, the trends in the percentage reductions in Lp(a) with niacin–laropiprant across Lp(a) quintiles and across KIV quintiles were even stronger (P Trend = 2×10 −13 versus 2×10 −8 across Lp[a] quintiles and P Trend = 2×10 −32 versus 4×10 −29 across KIV quintiles; Table II in the), and the average percentage reduction in Lp(a) fell slightly (from 31% to 30%).

Further analyses (Table 2) showed that the trend in the percentage reductions in Lp(a) with KIV domains accounted for almost all of the trend in the percentage reductions in Lp(a) with baseline Lp(a) level and region (P for residual association, 0.01 and 0.30, respectively). In marked contrast to the highly significant association with KIV domains, no other baseline characteristics showed statistically significant (allowing for multiple testing of 15 factors) independent influence on the percentage reductions in Lp(a) with niacin–laropiprant (all P > 0.005 [Bonferroni corrected P > 0.05]; Table III in the). It is noteworthy that the number of KIV domains in the nonpredominant isoform did not show any independent influence on the Lp(a) reduction.

Table 2.
Comparison of the Relative Strengths of the Trends in the Percentage Reductions in Lp(a) With Niacin–Laropiprant by Baseline Lp(a), KIV Domains, and region*

In contrast to the varying percentage reductions in Lp(a) by baseline Lp(a) level, there was ≈20% reduction in LDL-C with niacin–laropiprant irrespective of baseline LDL-C level (in analyses based on 24 205 participants with LDL-C measured at both baseline and at a median of 1 year). Correspondingly, the absolute reductions increased from 0.21 to 0.40 mmol/L in proportion to the baseline level (Figure III in the).

### Prognostic impacts of diabetes status and lipoprotein (a) levels in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a prospective cohort study [^ca729aa0]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding Lp(a)-associated cardiovascular risk, how to manage patients with high Lp(a) levels is becoming a challenge for clinicians. Evidence suggests that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors could reduce Lp(a)-associated cardiovascular risk, and the benefit is likely related to the degree of Lp(a) reduction. Niacin, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, and antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA agents targeting apolipoprotein B and LPA, could reduce Lp(a) levels. However, it remains unclear whether they could provide cardiovascular benefits. Further investigation is needed to determine when to initiate Lp(a) lowering therapy and figure out to what level the reduction can lead to clinical benefits.

### Niacin, but not gemfibrozil, selectively increases LP-AI, a cardioprotective subfraction of HDL, in patients with low HDL cholesterol [^b1c776a0]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2001). Low credibility.

Evidence indicates that the high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfraction containing apolipoprotein A-I without apolipoprotein AII (LP-AI) is more antiatherogenic than HDL particles containing apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II (LP-AI+AII). This study examined the effect of extended-release niacin (niacin-ER) and gemfibrozil on LP-AI and LP-AI+AII particles in patients with low levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Mechanisms by which these agents modulate HDL particles were investigated by in vitro studies using human hepatoblastoma (Hep G2) cells. A total of 139 patients with low HDL-C (≤ 40 mg/dL) were randomized to niacin-ER or gemfibrozil in a multicenter double-blind trial. Patients were dose-escalated with once-nightly niacin-ER (1 to 2 g) or gemfibrozil (1.2 g) for 19 weeks. Niacin-ER had a greater effect in raising HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I levels than did gemfibrozil. Niacin-ER at 1- and 2-g doses increased LP-AI levels by 8.7 ± 4.0% (P = 0.033) and 24.0 ± 4.4% (P < 0.001), respectively. Gemfibrozil had no consistent effect on LP-AI levels. LP-AI+AII levels increased 5% to 8% by both agents. In vitro studies showed that niacin, but not gemfibrozil, selectively decreased the uptake of (125)I-labeled LP-AI holoparticles by Hep G2 cells. The uptake of [(3)H]cholesterol ester was approximately 75% greater from LP-AI versus LP-AI+AII particles, but neither niacin nor gemfibrozil affected cholesterol ester uptake. These data indicate that unlike gemfibrozil, niacin selectively increases LP-AI compared with LP-AI+AII particle concentration in patients with low HDL-C levels. The mechanism of action of increased LP-AI concentration appears to be mediated by decreased hepatic removal of LP-AI particles, which are more efficient in reverse cholesterol transport, thus suggesting an additional mechanism by which niacin mediates its antiatherogenic properties.

### Genetic variants associated with plasma lipids are associated with the lipid response to niacin [^4013e1cc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the lipid‐lowering effects of niacin are still unresolved. Niacin has been shown to increase HDL‐C via reduction of HDL‐apolipoprotein A‐I catabolism and possibly reduction in the expression of cholesteryl ester transfer protein. 9, 10 In vitro studies have suggested that niacin may directly inhibit TG synthesis by inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase in the liver, a key enzyme catalyzing the final step of TG synthesis. 9 Niacin stimulates the hydroxyl‐carboxylic acid receptor 2 (also known as the niacin receptor) on adipocytes, resulting in a reduction in free fatty acids returning to the liver and decreased assembly of very low‐density lipoproteins. 2 We previously reported that the coding variant HCAR2 M317I was not associated with the change in LDL‐C (percentage change −3.7 ± 39.1, −2.6 ± 37.4, −3.5 ± 35.2, P = 0.58, in the Met‐Met, Met‐Ile, and Ile‐Ile carriers, respectively), HDL‐C (28.2 ± 25.4, 27.6 ± 23.5, 26.1 ± 22.8, P = 0.62), and TG (−20.9 ± 38.4, −23.0 ± 38.6, −22.5 ± 36.2, P = 0.50) after 1 year of niacin+statin treatment. 11 This variant was, however, associated with Lp(a) lowering secondary to niacin (−22.7 ± 35.2, −15.2 ± 40.1, −15.8 ± 37.3, P = 0.005). 11

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^5d85e68e]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Sensitivity Analyses

Parallel analyses of the effect of niacin–laropiprant on reductions in Lp(a) measured in the 1-year samples by the monoclonal and polyclonal assays were conducted in the subset of 2641 participants with Lp(a) determined by both methods. The 2 methods gave similar results, with the trends in the percentage reductions by quintiles of KIV domains remaining highly significant (Table II in the). For both assays, the percentage reductions in Lp(a) were markedly higher in Lp(a) quintiles II and III than in quintiles IV and V. However, the polyclonal assay had more limited ability to measure low Lp(a), resulting in the exclusion of 332 participants with results below the limit of the assay. This distorted the observed reductions in the lowest quintile of baseline Lp(a) levels, reduced the overall percentage reduction in Lp(a) in the subset with the polyclonal measurements to ≈24% to 25% (compared with 31% in the whole study) and increased the absolute reduction slightly from 12 to 14 nmol/L, which demonstrates that limitations of assay range for Lp(a) may affect the results.

Blue circles denote United Kingdom, and red squares denote China. The 11 kringle IV domain groups shown are ≤ 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 to 21, 22 to 23, 24 to 25, 26 to 27, 28 to 30, and ≥ 31. Lp(a) indicates lipoprotein(a).

Reductions in Lp(a) With Niacin–Laropiprant

At the median 1-year visit, compliance with taking study niacin–laropiprant was 86% among participants in this substudy allocated active treatment. Figure 2 shows Lp(a) reductions with niacin–laropiprant at 1 year within quintiles by baseline Lp(a) level and quintiles by KIV domains (shown in reverse order) among the 3978 participants with Lp(a) measured at both time points (additional details of the estimation are given in Table I in the). The percentage reduction in Lp(a) was 31% (95% confidence interval, 28%–33%) overall but attenuated from 36% to 18% across quintiles by increasing baseline Lp(a) (P Trend = 2×10 −8) and attenuated even more strongly across quintiles by decreasing KIV domains, varying from 50% in the highest KIV quintile to 16% in the lowest KIV quintile (P Trend = 4×10 −29). Consistent with this, in China, where KIV domains tended to be higher than in the UK (Table 1), the percentage reduction in Lp(a) with niacin–laropiprant was also higher than in the UK (38% versus 25%; P Diff = 2×10 −5).

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^ce24ef93]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Systematic review PICO questions — six clinical questions were addressed in adults: benefits/harms of PCSK9 inhibitors compared with usual care; benefits/harms of BA compared with usual care; in hypertriglyceridemia, benefits and harms of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) compared with EPA plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); in hypertriglyceridemia, benefits/harms of extended release niacin compared with nonstatin treatments such as fibrates and EPA; benefits/harms of treating to a lower LDL-C goal (< 70 mg/dL) compared with a higher LDL-C goal (≥ 70 mg/dL); and in dyslipidemia without CVD, whether adding risk enhancers such as coronary artery calcification scoring, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), or lipoprotein a (Lp[a]) to traditional risk equations provides more accurate risk prediction of future cardiovascular events; the questions were developed into the PICO format (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes).

### Genetic variants associated with plasma lipids are associated with the lipid response to niacin [^dbd50977]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

We were able to replicate the association with known variants at the LPA locus with baseline Lp(a) concentrations in AIM‐HIGH. It was disappointing that none of these variants was associated with the change in Lp(a) in response to niacin. Thus, the mechanism by which niacin lowers Lp(a) is still unclear.

Previous GWAS studies have identified loci associated with statin response. 14, 15 A meta‐analysis has identified 4 genetic loci, APOE (rs445925), LPA (rs10455872), SORT1 (rs646776), and SLCO1B1 (rs2900478), associated with percentage LDL‐C reduction following statin therapy at a genome‐wide level. 14 Only CETP was identified with the change in HDL‐C in response to statins. 15 We did not find APOE, LPA, SORT1, or CETP to be associated with niacin response in our study. A candidate gene study found a SNP at the APOA1 (rs964184) locus associated with fenofibrate response. 16 This SNP was not genotyped in our cohort, so we were unable to determine whether it also mediated response to niacin. A pharmacogenetic analysis using a genome‐wide approach in the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial identified HSD17B3, SMAD3, and IPO11 as genetic markers of fenofibrate response. 17

### VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein)-apo E (apolipoprotein E) may influence Lp (a) (lipoprotein [a]) synthesis or assembly [^238d7569]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To clarify the association between PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) and Lp(a) (lipoprotein [a]), we studied Lp(a) kinetics in patients with loss-of-function and gain-of-function PCSK9 mutations and in patients in whom extended-release niacin reduced Lp(a) and PCSK9 concentrations. Approach and Results: Six healthy controls, 9 heterozygous patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (5 with low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR] mutations and 4 with PCSK9 gain-of-function mutations) and 3 patients with heterozygous dominant-negative PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations were included in the preliminary study. Eight patients were enrolled in a second study assessing the effects of 2 g/day extended-release niacin. Apolipoprotein kinetics in VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and Lp(a) were studied using stable isotope techniques. Plasma Lp(a) concentrations were increased in PCSK9 -gain-of-function and familial hypercholesterolemia- LDLR groups compared with controls and PCSK9 -loss-of-function groups (14 ± 12 versus 5 ± 4 mg/dL; P = 0.04), but no change was observed in Lp(a) fractional catabolic rate. Subjects with PCSK9 -loss-of-function mutations displayed reduced apoE (apolipoprotein E) concentrations associated with a VLDL-apoE absolute production rate reduction. Lp(a) and VLDL-apoE absolute production rates were correlated (r = 0.50; P < 0.05). ApoE-to-apolipoprotein (a) molar ratios in Lp(a) increased with plasma Lp(a) (r = 0.96; P < 0.001) but not with PCSK9 levels. Extended-release niacin-induced reductions in Lp(a) and VLDL-apoE absolute production rate were correlated (r = 0.83; P = 0.015). In contrast, PCSK9 reduction (-35%; P = 0.008) was only correlated with that of VLDL-apoE absolute production rate (r = 0.79; P = 0.028).

Conclusions

VLDL-apoE production could determine Lp(a) production and/or assembly. As PCSK9 inhibitors reduce plasma apoE and Lp(a) concentrations, apoE could be the link between PCSK9 and Lp(a).

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^ae1e158a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Statins — across guidelines, statins remain first-line therapy for mitigating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–driven atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; although statins do not lower Lp(a) and may slightly increase it, they reduce major adverse cardiovascular events by "approximately 22% for each 1-mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C". Median Lp(a) was not affected by rosuvastatin in JUPITER, and on-treatment Lp(a) increases with statins are minimal on average ("approximate 1.1-mg/dL increase or 0.1% relative increase"). Concerns about Lp(a) elevation "should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue statins".

### Efficacy and safety of combination therapy with niacin extended-release and simvastatin versus atorvastatin in patients with dyslipidemia: the SUPREME study [^aef701e5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Aggressive treatment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) fails to prevent most cardiovascular (CV) events. Concurrent treatment of LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) should be considered in patients with dyslipidemia.

Objective

The efficacy and safety of a proprietary niacin extended-release and simvastatin (NER/S) combination were compared to atorvastatin monotherapy in a multicenter, Prospective, Randomized (3:2), Open-label, Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) study.

Methods

Following ≥ 4 weeks without lipid-modifying therapies, 193 patients with dyslipidemia were treated with NER/S (n = 114; 1000/40 mg/day, weeks 1 to 4; 2000/40 mg/day weeks 5 to 12) or atorvastatin (n = 79; 40 mg/day, weeks 1 to 12).

Results

Compared to atorvastatin, NER/S had a larger beneficial effect on HDL-C (primary end point: 30.1 ± 2.3% and 9.4 ± 2.6%, respectively; P < .001), TG (P = 0.02), and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]; P < .001), and similar effects on LDL-C and non-HDL-C. Two-thirds of patients treated with NER/S concurrently attained LDL-C (CV risk-adjusted goals), HDL-C (≥ 40 mg/dL), and TG (< 150 mg/dL) targets, compared to one-third of patients treated with atorvastatin (P < .001). Flushing was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) (67.5% NER/S and 10.1% atorvastatin; P < .001). Seventy-five percent of flushing episodes were mild to moderate. More patients treated with NER/S discontinued due to TEAEs (21.1% and 3.8%; P < .001); the most common TEAE was flushing.

Conclusion

Compared to atorvastatin, NER/S provided superior improvements in HDL-C, TG, and Lp(a) and comparable improvements in non-HDL-C and LDL-C. Treatment with NER/S should be considered for patients with dyslipidemia requiring comprehensive lipid control.

### Lipoprotein (a) removal still a mystery [^7e545b32]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, familial hypercholesterolemia patients with partial or total loss of LDLR activity frequently also have elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations 11, 12 that may reflect partial dependence of lipoprotein(a) clearance through the LDLR and incidentally increase their risk of coronary heart disease. Interestingly, however, homozygous hypercholesterolemic patients without active LDLR did lower lipoprotein(a) concentration with PCSK9 treatment. 9 Lipoprotein kinetic studies in patients being treated with the PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab have been reported to show an increased fractional removal rate of lipoprotein(a) of ≈25% without appreciable change in production rate. 13 That may represent clearance by upregulated LDLR but may also reflect other processes, including direct clearance by the kidney of degraded apolipoprotein(a) particles. PCSK9 may also inhibit lipoprotein(a) production or assembly that probably requires availability of apolipoprotein B because patients with low levels of apolipoprotein B also have low levels of lipoprotein(a). 8 Although atorvastatin paradoxically increases lipoprotein(a) levels, niacin or nicotinic acid and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors both lower lipoprotein(a) by amounts similar to that of the PCSK9 inhibitors. 14 Yet, neither niacin nor torcetrapib is likely to have achieved this effect through increased LDLR activity. Thus, the question of mechanisms responsible for lipoprotein(a) removal remains largely unanswered. This uncertainty has led to approaches to inhibit production at the genomic level.

The article raises other issues of a more general nature, including the concentration of lipoprotein(a) at which increased risk becomes clinically significant. Both the level of the lipoprotein and the LPA gene show the risk to be linear, 15 although possibly log‐linear for LPA. A mendelian randomization study showed a doubling in risk for lipoprotein(a). 16 The levels suggested for lipoprotein(a) at which future treatment could be considered are 30 and 50 mg/dL, 5 both well above the median value among Western populations (< 15 mg/dL). The 90th percentile in the LIPID (Long‐Term Intervention With Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) secondary prevention trial 3 and in the primary prevention Copenhagen Heart Study 2 was ≈70 mg/dL, at which the inflection for risk becomes clear. In the recent meta‐analysis of 7 secondary prevention statin trials, the hazard ratio increased linearly at > 30 mg/dL and reached a hazard ratio of 1.31 at 50 mg/dL 5 (≈80th percentile in Western populations).

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^52d89295]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

In this meta-analysis of statin trials, Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were independent and additive cardiovascular risk factors, and potent LDL-C level reduction did not offset Lp(a)-mediated risk. Our findings emphasize the need for testing and incorporation of Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessment. Future trials will elucidate the role of targeted Lp(a) therapeutics for cardiovascular risk reduction in the context of LDL-C levels.

### Optimal pharmacologic approach to patients with hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol: randomized comparison of fenofibrate 160 mg and niacin 1500 mg [^b6947e31]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Atherogenic dyslipidemia is emerging as a target of lipid-modifying therapy. However, an optimal pharmacologic approach has not yet been established. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the typical doses of fenofibrate and niacin.

Methods

After an eight-week dietary run-in, 201 patients who had triglyceride (TG) levels of 150–499 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels of < 45 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of < 130 mg/dL were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for 16 weeks: fenofibrate 160 mg or niacin extended release 1500 mg (starting at 500 mg and up-titrated at the fifth and ninth weeks).

Results

One hundred forty patients completed the study. The percent reductions in apoB/A1 were not different between the two groups (-20% and -22% in the fenofibrate and niacin groups, respectively, p = 0.47). The effects of the two regimens on HDL-C were similar (24% and 20%, respectively, p = 0.22), while fenofibrate reduced TG more than did niacin (-53% and -48%, respectively, p = 0.045). Niacin was more effective at lowering LDL-C, Lp (a), and hs-CRP. However, niacin worsened the parameters of glycemic control, whereas fenofibrate improved them. Niacin showed more frequent adverse events including pruritus and skin flushing.

Conclusions

These two regimens have largely comparable lipid-modifying effects. However, their effects on glucose metabolism and inflammation, and their adverse events need to be considered additionally. Our results underscore more individualized pharmacologic approaches to patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^b16d6021]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Medications for managing hyperlipidemia — nicotinic acid (extended release) inhibits release of FFA from adipose tissue, decreases VLDL–C and LDL–C production and HDL–C degradation, lowers TG and LDL–C and raises HDL–C and can decrease Lp(a); the example listed is niacin, extended release; adverse effects include flushing, hepatic toxicity, and increases in fasting blood glucose and uric acid; use not recommended in children < 2 years of age.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^f483671a]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Impact of KIV Domains

The percentage reduction in Lp(a) varied strongly with both baseline Lp(a) level and the number of KIV domains in the predominant apo(a) isoform (Figure 2). The trend with predominant KIV domains (from 16% to 50% across quintiles; P = 4×10 −29) was statistically much stronger than the trend with Lp(a) level (from 18% to 36% across quintiles; P = 2×10 − 8) and remained highly statistically significant after adjustment for the trend with Lp(a) level (Table 2). This shows that niacin–laropiprant had a greater impact on larger apo(a) isoform Lp(a) particles. Similar percentage reductions in Lp(a) have been reported with the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab: a reduction in Lp(a) of 32% overall with the most effective regimen, and, as for niacin-laropiprant, there was a trend toward smaller percentage reductions at higher Lp(a) levels. This trend may also be due (at least in part) to a dependency on apo(a) isoform size, but such analyses have not been reported from any PCSK9 inhibitor trial. The CETP inhibitor anacetrapib lowered Lp(a) by 35% to 50% in 2 studies, but reductions by baseline Lp(a) level or apoa(a) isoform size have not been reported.

### Atheroprotective lipoprotein effects of a niacin-simvastatin combination compared to low-and high-dose simvastatin monotherapy [^603c2122]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Niacin has multiple lipoprotein effects that may provide cardiovascular benefit when added to statin monotherapy.

Methods

In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 75) of magnetic resonance imaging of carotid atherosclerosis, we performed a secondary comparison of combination niacin-statin (simvastatin 20 mg/Niacin-ER 2G [S20/N]) to monotherapy with moderate (20 mg [S20]) and high-dose (80 mg [S80]) simvastatin on lipids, apolipoproteins (apo), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle subclasses, and inflammatory markers.

Results

At baseline, average age was 71, 72% were male, 62.5% used statins, and average LDL-cholesterol was 111 mg/dL. At 12 months, S20/N, compared to S80, significantly reduced apoB (-36.6% vs -11.9%; P = 0.05) and lipoprotein(a) (-18% vs +3.5%; P = 0.001) and had at least an equivalent effect on LDL-cholesterol (-39.3% vs -24.3%; P = 0.24). The combination reduced the proportion of subjects with atherogenic LDL pattern-B (50% to 11.5%) compared to S80 (56% to 56%) (P = 0.01). Despite increases in plasma free fatty acids (+62.4%; F = 5.65, P = 0.005 vs S20 and S80), plasma triglycerides (-29.4%; F = 6.88, P = 0.002 vs S20 and S80), and very-low-density lipoprotein (-44.2%; F = 7.94, P < .001 vs S20 and S80), levels were reduced by S20/N. S20/N increased HDL-cholesterol levels (+18.1%) as compared to S20 (0%) and S80 (+5.9%) (P < .001 vs both statin arms), largely due to an increase in HDL particle size (+4.6%; P = 0.01 vs both statin arms).

Conclusions

We demonstrate that full-dose niacin/moderate-dose simvastatin combination has sustained benefits on atherogenic apoB lipoproteins, at least comparable to high-dose simvastatin, while also raising HDL-cholesterol. Results of large clinical trials will inform whether niacin-statin combinations reduce cardiovascular disease events.

### Is HPS2-THRIVE the death knell for niacin? [^6593cb71]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Niacin is a lipid-modifying therapy with proven efficacy for reducing cardiovascular events as monotherapy and when used in combination with other lipid-modifying medications impacts rates of atherosclerotic disease progression. Large outcome trials using niacin against a background of statin therapy with optimal control of atherogenic lipoprotein burden in serum were unable to demonstrate incremental benefit of niacin beyond statin therapy. We address 2 key questions: (1) Can the results from randomized clinical trials performed in stable ischemic heart disease populations (AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE) be applied to patients who sustain an acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction? (2) Are patients with very low baseline levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (< 30 mg/dL) at particularly high risk for subsequent cardiac events?

### Revisiting niacin: reviewing the evidence [^1f68d4d3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2007). Low credibility.

Atherogenic dyslipidemia, defined by a cluster of lipoprotein abnormalities, including low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated serum triglycerides, represents an important potential target for reducing cardiovascular risk. This has paved the way for revisiting niacin as a therapy in preventing progression of atherosclerosis. Niacin remains the safest and most effective agent for raising HDL-C and is a logical choice to target atherogenic dyslipidemia. While the clinical efficacy of niacin has been known for many years, it is only with development of newer formulations, which have lower side-effect profiles and improved compliance, that the potential for this agent been fully realized. In this review, we will examine some of the reasons that niacin can have important implications for reducing progression of atherosclerosis. We will first examine the different formulations and their variability, not only in side-effect profiles, but also in clinical efficacy. We will then consider the theoretical evidence for the benefit of HDL-raising produced by niacin on atherosclerotic progression. Finally, we will review clinical data suggesting the benefit of niacin on cardiovascular outcomes.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^42e79525]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical Methods

Patients were categorized by quintiles of their Lp(a) and LDL-C measurements at baseline (ie, while taking their background study statin-based LDL-lowering therapy but not their randomly allocated niacin–laropiprant or placebo treatment) and by quintiles of their predominant KIV domain number. Where Lp(a) at baseline was outside the analyzable range, it was imputed (Methods III in the). Lp(a) had an approximately log-normal distribution. Thus, analyses of percentage reductions were based on linear regressions of log e Lp(a) levels at 1 year (from the monoclonal assay) as the dependent variable, with adjustment terms for baseline Lp(a) parameters included as covariates to allow for chance differences between the arms and to remove sources of variation and thereby render the analyses more sensitive to identifying the effects of niacin–laropiprant. Baseline Lp(a) parameters included in the regression model were log e baseline Lp(a) (polyclonal assay), quintile of baseline Lp(a) (as a categorical variable, to allow for nonlinear effects), predominant KIV domain number, quintile of predominant KIV domain number (as a categorical variable), region (UK and China), and interactions between region and the 4 Lp(a) and KIV terms. In addition, parallel sensitivity analyses were run using 1-year Lp(a) levels measured by the polyclonal assay, which were available in a subset of 2641 of the 3978 participants (Methods II in the).

Percentage reduction in Lp(a) was estimated as 100×(1−exp[β]), where β denotes the estimated effect of niacin–laropiprant on log e Lp(a). Absolute reductions were estimated with adjustment for strata of quintile of baseline Lp(a) level within region, with bootstrapping (using 10 000 replications) to estimate SEs and confidence intervals. A parallel approach was used for analyses of LDL-C, with adjustment for quintile of baseline LDL-C and log e baseline LDL-C. Bootstrapping was not used for LDL-C because its distribution was adequately normal, given the sample size. Analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.2).

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^c1372567]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric dyslipidemia — elevated lipoprotein(a) and combined lipid abnormalities are addressed as follows: There is currently no medication therapy specific for elevated Lp(a), and in adults, niacin will lower Lp(a) approximately 15 percent, but this has not been studied in children; management may focus on addressing other risk factors and concomitant elevations of LDL–C, TG, and non–HDL–C. In obesity-associated combined dyslipidemia (low HDL–C, high TG, and a mild increase in LDL–C with smaller, denser particles), these patients do not meet the criteria for pharmacologic therapy and management focuses on reducing adiposity and changing diet composition, with the CHILD 2–TG diet referenced. When risk factors cluster, pharmacologic therapy may be selectively directed at elevations in non–HDL–C; treatment with statins, omega-3 fish oil, or fibrates might be considered, but evidence is very limited in children and there have been no RCTs. For primary dyslipidemias with elevated VLDL–C (often with elevated LDL–C and high TG), pharmacologic therapy is usually guided by non–HDL–C levels, and statins, omega-3 fish oil, or fibrates should be considered as first-line agents for patients who meet the criteria for medication therapy under the direction of a lipid specialist.

Nicotinic acid (niacin) has long been used for the treatment of lipid disorders and cardiovascular disease. Niacin favorably affects apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins (eg, very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], lipoprotein[a]) and increases apo A-I-containing lipoproteins (high-density lipoprotein [HDL]). Recently, new discoveries have enlarged our understanding of the mechanism of action of niacin and challenged older concepts. There are new data on (1) how niacin affects triglycerides (TGs) and apo B-containing lipoprotein metabolism in the liver, (2) how it affects apo A-I and HDL metabolism, (3) how it affects vascular anti-inflammatory events, (4) a specific niacin receptor in adipocytes and immune cells, (5) how niacin causes flushing, and (6) the characterization of a niacin transport system in liver and intestinal cells. New findings indicate that niacin directly and noncompetitively inhibits hepatocyte diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, a key enzyme for TG synthesis. The inhibition of TG synthesis by niacin results in accelerated intracellular hepatic apo B degradation and the decreased secretion of VLDL and LDL particles. Previous kinetic studies in humans and recent in vitro cell culture findings indicate that niacin retards mainly the hepatic catabolism of apo A-I (vs apo A-II) but not scavenger receptor BI-mediated cholesterol esters. Decreased HDL-apo A-I catabolism by niacin explains the increases in HDL half-life and concentrations of lipoprotein A-I HDL subfractions, which augment reverse cholesterol transport. Initial data suggest that niacin, by inhibiting the hepatocyte surface expression of beta-chain adenosine triphosphate synthase (a recently reported HDL-apo A-I holoparticle receptor), inhibits the removal of HDL-apo A-I. Recent studies indicate that niacin increases vascular endothelial cell redox state, resulting in the inhibition of oxidative stress and vascular inflammatory genes, key cytokines involved in atherosclerosis. The niacin flush results from the stimulation of prostaglandins D(2) and E(2) by subcutaneous Langerhans cells via the G protein-coupled receptor 109A niacin receptor. Although decreased free fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue via the G protein-coupled receptor 109A niacin receptor has been a widely suggested mechanism of niacin to decrease TGs, physiologically and clinically, this pathway may be only a minor factor in explaining the lipid effects of niacin.

### Effect of extended-release niacin on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality, lipoprotein metabolism, and mediators of vascular inflammation in statin-treated patients [^eb0d2279]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of extended-release niacin/laropiprant (ERN/LRP) versus placebo on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) antioxidant function, cholesterol efflux, apolipoprotein B100 (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, and mediators of vascular inflammation associated with 15% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Study patients had persistent dyslipidemia despite receiving high-dose statin treatment.

Methods and Results

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we compared the effect of ERN/LRP with placebo in 27 statin-treated dyslipidemic patients who had not achieved National Cholesterol Education Program-ATP III targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We measured fasting lipid profile, apolipoproteins, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity, small dense LDL apoB (sdLDL-apoB), oxidized LDL (oxLDL), glycated apoB (glyc-apoB), lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), lysophosphatidyl choline (lyso-PC), macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP1), serum amyloid A (SAA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). We also examined the capacity of HDL to protect LDL from in vitro oxidation and the percentage cholesterol efflux mediated by apoB depleted serum. ERN/LRP was associated with an 18% increase in HDL-C levels compared to placebo (1.55 versus 1.31 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). There were significant reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, total serum apoB, lipoprotein (a), CETP activity, oxLDL, Lp-PLA2, lyso-PC, MCP1, and SAA, but no significant changes in glyc-apoB or sdLDL-apoB concentration. There was a modest increase in cholesterol efflux function of HDL (19.5%, P = 0.045), but no change in the antioxidant capacity of HDL in vitro or PON1 activity.

Conclusions

ERN/LRP reduces LDL-associated mediators of vascular inflammation, but has varied effects on HDL functionality and LDL quality, which may counter its HDL-C-raising effect.

### Lipoprotein (a)-cholesterol levels estimated by vertical auto profile correlate poorly with Lp (a) mass in hyperlipidemic subjects: implications for clinical practice interpretation of Lp (a)-mediated risk [^3ee4cd02]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is generally measured as total mass of the entire particle or as apolipoprotein(a) particle number.

Objective

The cholesterol content of Lp(a) [Lp(a)-C)] can be estimated by the vertical auto profile (VAP) method. We assessed whether this is an accurate surrogate measurement of Lp(a) mass.

Methods

VAP-Lp(a)-C and VAP-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) estimated by the VAP technique, Lp(a) mass, oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL-apoB) that primarily reflect OxPL on Lp(a), and HDL-C measured by enzymatic methods were measured in 552 hypercholesterolemic patients at baseline and 24 weeks after therapy with niacin monotherapy (N = 118), ezetimibe/simvastatin monotherapy (n = 155), or ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 mg) + niacin (to 2 g) (N = 279) in a randomized, double-blind trial.

Results

VAP-Lp(a)-C correlated only modestly with Lp(a) mass at baseline (r = 0.56, P < .001) and 24 weeks (r = 0.56, P < .001), explaining only 31% of the association. VAP-Lp(a)-C correlated with HDL-C at baseline (r = 0.34, P < .001) and 24 weeks (r = 0.30, P < .001) and with VAP-HDL-C at baseline (r = 39, P < .001) and 24 weeks (r = 0.33, P < .001). In contrast, Lp(a) mass did not correlate with HDL-C at baseline (r = 0.06, P = 0.12) and 24 weeks (r = -0.01 P = 0.91). Lp(a) mass correlated strongly with oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 at baseline (r = 0.81, P < .001) and 24 weeks (r = 0.79, P < .001). VAP-Lp(a)-C levels increased linearly with HDL-C and VAP-HDL-C quartiles (P < .001 for both) but Lp(a) mass did not. Quantitating the percent of cholesterol present on Lp(a) by dividing VAP-Lp(a)-C by Lp(a) mass revealed that 25% of patients had a percentage > 100, which is not possible.

Conclusions

VAP-Lp(a)-C is a poor estimate for Lp(a) mass and likely reflects the content of HDL-C in the overlapping density spectrum of Lp(a) and HDL. These data suggest that patients with prior VAP-Lp(a)-C measurements may have misclassification of Lp(a)-related risk.

### Impact of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size on lipoprotein (a) lowering in the HPS2-THRIVE study [^44aa5d38]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the 3978 participants in this substudy (Table 1) were similar to those previously reported in the HPS2-THRIVE study overall. Baseline LDL-C and Lp(a) levels were higher in the UK than in China, and there was a marked difference in the KIV domains distribution between the 2 regions, with 27% of UK versus 7% of Chinese participants having KIV domains in the lowest quintile (KIV, ≤ 17).

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics of Participants With Median 1 Year Samples

As expected, there were strong inverse relationships between Lp(a) levels and the KIV domains of the predominant apo(a) isoform in both regions (Figure 1). For a given number of KIV domains, Lp(a) levels tended to be higher in Chinese than in UK participants. The KIV domains of the nonpredominant apo(a) isoform accounted for a much smaller amount of the Lp(a) (Methods IV in the, Figure II in the). Lp(a) levels at baseline and 1 year in the placebo arm were highly correlated (coefficients: Pearson for log e Lp[a], 0.95; Spearman, 0.97), and the baseline Lp(a) adjustment terms for the analysis of the percentage Lp(a) reduction (defined in the Methods) explained 92% of the variance of the 1-year Lp(a) levels in the placebo arm. The Pearson correlation coefficient between LDL-C levels at baseline and 1 year in the placebo arm was 0.58. There was little difference in mean baseline LDL-C between the 2 randomized arms (< 0.01 mmol/L, niacin–laropiprant minus placebo) because the randomized allocation was balanced for LDL-C (as well as for several other factors but not for Lp[a]). By chance, in the subset of the trial population with Lp(a) measured, the unadjusted mean baseline Lp(a) was 3.7 (SE, 2.7) nmol/L higher in the niacin–laropiprant arm than in the placebo arm.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein (a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^4ebfe270]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Importantly, LPA variants may impact the effectiveness of certain treatments in patients with CVD. Interestingly, a genome‐wide association study identified 7 SNPs within the LPA locus that were associated with CHD events during statin therapy, including rs10455872, which persisted in individuals with LDL‐C levels ≤ 70 mg/dL. Recent evidence suggests that aspirin treatment in carriers of rs3798220, which is associated with high lipoprotein(a) levels (136–138 nmol/L), may decrease the risk of CVD events compared with nonusers of aspirin. However, additional studies are needed to investigate further the mechanisms underlying the potential beneficial effects of aspirin use in carriers of rs3798220. A study of potential genetic loci that might impact the lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects of niacin, a lipid‐modulating drug with an unknown mechanism of action, was also conducted; however, no relevant loci were identified. Another study looked at the impact of apolipoprotein(a) isoform size on the efficacy of niacin–laropiprant in patients treated with statins. The results showed that in the overall population (N = 3978; UK [n = 2277], China [n = 1701]), niacin–laropiprant therapy led to a mean lipoprotein(a) reduction of 31%, which decreased to 18% in patients with baseline lipoprotein(a) levels ≥ 128 nmol/L and small apolipoprotein(a) isoforms (n = 797), indicating that proportional reductions in lipoprotein(a) levels may be dependent on apolipoprotein(a) isoform size in patients treated with niacin.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^c307be2a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Take‑home points for Lp(a) risk and measurement — The relationship between Lp(a) level and cardiovascular disease risk is continuous and log-linear, and rather than a single dichotomous cutoff, Lp(a) levels represent a continuum of risk; individuals with Lp(a) levels < 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) may be considered low risk, individuals with Lp(a) levels ≥ 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) may be considered high risk, and those in the "gray zone" 75 to 125 nmol/L (30–50 mg/dL) are at intermediate risk and may warrant repeat measurement; Lp(a) risk categories apply across races and ethnicities, Lp(a) should be measured at least once in every adult for cardiovascular risk assessment, should be reported in nmol/L with no conversion between mg/dL and nmol/L using a fixed factor, the previously proposed correction factor for Lp(a)-C used to adjust LDL-C calculation should not be used, concerns about Lp(a) elevation should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue a statin, and in high-risk patients with elevated Lp(a) who need additional LDL-C lowering after maximally tolerated statin therapy, a PCSK9 inhibitor may address residual risk from both LDL-C and Lp(a).

### Comparison of the effects of fibrates versus statins on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^c1f4e76b]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, results of this meta-analysis suggest that fibrates have a significantly greater effect in reducing plasma Lp(a) concentrations compared with statins. Likewise, addition of fibrates to statins can enhance the Lp(a)-lowering effect of statins. Thus, combination therapy with fibrates and statins can provide an additional beneficial effect in decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by reducing apo(a) expression and enhancing Lp(a) clearance, especially in the subgroup of patients with hyper-Lp(a). Future investigations are recommended to explore the impact of other conventional Lp(a)-lowering therapies as well as novel lipid-modifying agents in comparison with fibrates and statins. Moreover, further randomized head-to-head trials with different treatment durations could be helpful to clarify if prolongation of treatment could result in further reductions in plasma Lp(a) concentrations.
