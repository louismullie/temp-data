## Question

Carb hyd counting by Clini pharm in t1dm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about carbohydrate counting in type 1 diabetes, specifically the role of clinical pharmacists, the evidence base, implementation, and how to address common pitfalls and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why carbohydrate counting matters mechanistically in T1D. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and quantify expected benefits. Next, I will examine guideline positions and where pharmacists fit. After that, I need to check practical implementation, including ratios, tools, and education. I will then analyze the impact of counting errors and mitigation strategies. Finally, I should consider special populations, inpatient care, and synthesize a pharmacist-led action plan with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and mechanism. In T1D, absolute insulin deficiency mandates exogenous prandial insulin matched to carbohydrate intake; carbohydrates are the principal driver of postprandial hyperglycemia, so estimating carbs and dosing insulin accordingly is foundational to glycemic control and quality of life, and this is consistently endorsed by contemporary guidelines and reviews [^27b4d8c5] [^7bfd24e1] [^4333f905].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit from the evidence base. A 2014 meta-analysis of seven RCTs found no significant HbA1c reduction overall, but in the five adult parallel-design trials, carbohydrate counting reduced HbA1c by about 0.64% versus control, suggesting clinically meaningful benefit in adults; pediatric data remain limited and heterogeneous, so I should be cautious extrapolating to youth [^74707ec4]. Observational and pilot studies show improvements in A1c with structured education and real-world implementation, though quality varies and confounding is common, so I need to interpret these as supportive rather than definitive [^5aa05087] [^35146f34].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal superiority. A 12-month randomized trial comparing carbohydrate counting with a food-based approach and routine care found equivalent HbA1c outcomes at 12 months, indicating that multiple nutrition strategies can succeed when well delivered; this reinforces the need to individualize and match the method to patient preferences and context rather than assume carbohydrate counting is the only path [^2296e211] [^e9c0e8e4].

> I should confirm where pharmacists fit in guideline hierarchies. ADA 2025 and AACE 2022 emphasize comprehensive DSMES, insulin-to-carb matching, and MNT delivered by qualified professionals; while they do not name pharmacists exclusively, pharmacists with diabetes expertise are integral members of the care team who can provide education, adjust insulin, and support technology-enabled dosing, aligning with the medical home model and pharmacist-led diabetes programs [^27b4d8c5] [^7bfd24e1] [^29d01de7]. Let me reconsider: although pharmacists are not the only providers, their accessibility and medication expertise position them uniquely to implement and troubleshoot carbohydrate counting in routine care and follow-up [^29d01de7].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details. I need to ensure we teach insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios using validated rules of thumb: 500 divided by total daily insulin dose for rapid-acting insulin yields an approximate grams-per-unit ratio, with typical ranges from 1:20 in insulin-sensitive to 1:5 in insulin-resistant individuals; similarly, sensitivity factors can be estimated with 1800 divided by TDD for rapid-acting insulin, recognizing these are starting points that require iterative adjustment based on pre- and post-meal glucose data [^b98b9dee]. I should double-check that we also incorporate correction dosing, premeal glucose considerations, and activity adjustments into the same teaching session to avoid fragmented education [^33d60363].

> I will now examine tools and technology that can reduce burden and error. Automated bolus calculators and pump bolus wizards improve dose accuracy and treatment satisfaction, with randomized data showing greater HbA1c reductions when ABCs accompany advanced carbohydrate counting training; smartphone apps can assist estimation, though accuracy varies and independent evaluation is prudent before recommending specific tools [^747b5291] [^a01dbdc6] [^6d995d08]. But wait, what if the patient lacks numeracy or access to devices? Simplified, individualized low-tech tools have shown noninferior A1c outcomes to standard counting in RCTs and may be particularly helpful for older adults or those with limited health literacy, so I should tailor the approach rather than default to complex methods [^02590fb3] [^85a7dacc].

> Let me think about the impact of counting errors, because this is where pharmacists can intervene clinically. In silico modeling demonstrates that systematic underestimation increases time above range by up to about 5% while systematic overestimation increases time below range by up to about 0.8%, and these effects scale with the magnitude of error; clinically, a 5% TIR change is considered meaningful in T1D, underscoring why precision matters and why error mitigation is a high-yield target [^72c0d59a] [^b8d09bb0]. Observational pediatric data show that accuracy within 20% is common but not sufficient; precision and frequent glucose monitoring correlate with better A1c, reinforcing the need for skills reinforcement and feedback loops rather than one-time training [^b4de0b6f] [^0c0ced45].

> I should confirm practical mitigation strategies. Structured education with hands-on practice, label reading, and portion estimation improves accuracy; pairing CGM or frequent SMBG with retrospective review of pre- and post-meal data allows iterative refinement of ICRs and correction factors; and for mixed meals high in fat and protein, patients often need extended or split boluses because fat delays absorption and increases insulin requirements, so I need to counsel on these exceptions explicitly [^6a8673e3] [^e036d76e]. Hold on, I should verify that we also address literacy and numeracy barriers, as these predict poorer implementation; simplifying tools and using visual aids can reduce errors and improve adherence [^02590fb3] [^85a7dacc].

> Now, I need to consider special populations. In pediatrics, family engagement is essential; parental carbohydrate counting knowledge associates with better glycemic outcomes, and structured nutrition education should be repeated regularly to support growth and development while avoiding overly restrictive eating patterns that can harm quality of life [^cdf07d10] [^807a2fdb]. In older adults or those with limited education, simplified counting tools and slower-paced, repetitive training improve uptake and A1c, so I should avoid assuming one-size-fits-all curricula [^02590fb3] [^85a7dacc]. For hospitalized patients, guidelines allow either carbohydrate counting or fixed prandial dosing; if patients use ICRs as outpatients, continuing them with institutional policy support is reasonable, but I must coordinate meal delivery with insulin timing to reduce hypo- and hyperglycemia risk [^f63f27a0] [^5168191a].

> Let me synthesize a pharmacist-led action plan and make sure it aligns with evidence and guidelines. First, screen for prior education and current accuracy, then deliver structured DSMES that includes insulin-to-carb matching, correction dosing, and activity adjustments, using teach-back to confirm understanding; second, individualize the method to numeracy, access to technology, and preferences, integrating ABCs or simplified tools when appropriate; third, build in follow-up within 1–2 weeks to review logs, adjust ICRs/ISFs, and troubleshoot errors; fourth, provide booster sessions and connect patients with CGM or structured SMBG to close the feedback loop; finally, document competencies and coordinate with the care team to sustain behavior change and outcomes [^27b4d8c5] [^7bfd24e1] [^33d60363].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Carbohydrate counting remains a core, guideline-endorsed strategy for T1D that can yield clinically meaningful A1c improvements in adults when implemented with structured education and follow-up, while acknowledging that alternative nutrition approaches can be equally effective if well delivered; pharmacists are well positioned to lead or co-lead this work through education, dosing support, and technology integration, with explicit attention to error mitigation and individualized adaptation across diverse populations [^74707ec4] [^2296e211] [^27b4d8c5] [^7bfd24e1].

Carbohydrate counting is a **core skill** for type 1 diabetes management, enabling precise insulin dosing and improved glycemic control [^74707ec4]. Clinical pharmacists are **key educators** who teach patients to estimate carbs, calculate insulin-to-carb ratios, and adjust for fat/protein and activity, while addressing barriers like numeracy and food literacy [^27f6f8c3] [^33d60363]. Evidence shows modest HbA1c reductions and better quality of life with structured carb counting, and pharmacist-led programs enhance adherence and outcomes [^74707ec4] [^6bcfecb7] [^029d01de7]. Pharmacists also support technology use (apps, pumps, bolus calculators) and provide inpatient guidance, including fixed-dose or carb-counting options during hospitalization [^747b5291] [^f63f27a0] [^5168191a].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting carbohydrate counting

Multiple studies and reviews support carbohydrate counting for T1D:

- **Meta-analysis**: Seven RCTs (599 adults, 104 children) showed no overall HbA1c reduction, but adults on parallel-design trials had a 0.64% HbA1c reduction vs control (95% CI −0.91 to −0.37; p < 0.0001) [^74707ec4].
- **GIOCAR trial**: 24-week RCT in CSII adults showed improved diet-related quality of life and reduced BMI/waist; per-protocol analysis showed a 0.35% HbA1c reduction without more hypoglycemia [^6bcfecb7].
- **Systematic review**: Advanced carb counting improved HbA1c by 0.0–1.2% and reduced hypoglycemia in observational studies, though heterogeneity limited firm conclusions [^742fba6c].

## Clinical pharmacist's role in carbohydrate counting

Clinical pharmacists are **central to carb counting education and support**:

| **Role** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Education | Teach carb estimation, insulin-to-carb ratios, and dose adjustments for fat/protein and activity [^33d60363] [^7bfd24e1] |
| Individualization | Tailor plans to numeracy, literacy, culture, and preferences [^4333f905] [^27f6f8c3] |
| Technology | Support apps, pumps, and bolus calculators to improve accuracy and adherence [^747b5291] [^b75046e4] |
| Follow-up | Reinforce skills, troubleshoot errors, and adjust therapy over time [^33d60363] [^27f6f8c3] |
| Inpatient care | Guide fixed-dose or carb-counting prandial insulin during hospitalization [^f63f27a0] [^5168191a] |

## Benefits of pharmacist-led carbohydrate counting

Pharmacist involvement yields **meaningful benefits**:

- **Glycemic control**: Modest HbA1c improvements and reduced hypoglycemia in adults [^74707ec4] [^742fba6c].
- **Quality of life**: Better dietary flexibility and satisfaction with structured education [^6bcfecb7] [^b75046e4].
- **Adherence**: Improved insulin adherence and self-efficacy with pharmacist support [^notfound].
- **Safety**: Reduced errors and hypoglycemia via education and tech tools [^747b5291] [^b75046e4].

---

## Challenges and barriers

Despite benefits, **barriers persist**:

- **Numeracy/literacy**: Limited skills hinder accurate counting and dosing [^02f6e259] [^4333f905].
- **Burden**: Frequent monitoring and math can reduce adherence [^02f6e259] [^126cb237].
- **Accuracy**: Errors in carb estimation cause hypo/hyperglycemia [^b4de0b6f] [^72c0d59a].
- **Access**: Technology and trained staff are not universally available [^85a7dacc] [^74f60621].

---

## Strategies to overcome barriers

Pharmacists can **mitigate barriers** by:

- **Simplified tools**: Use low-tech, individualized methods (e.g. portion tables) for easier adoption [^02590fb3] [^85a7dacc].
- **Education**: Provide repeated, practical training with teach-back and visual aids [^027f6f8c3] [^2ff678da].
- **Technology**: Integrate apps and bolus calculators to reduce math burden [^747b5291] [^b75046e4].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate with dietitians, nurses, and physicians for comprehensive support [^7bfd24e1] [^b4a6f137].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatrics**: Family engagement and growth-appropriate nutrition are essential; parental knowledge correlates with better outcomes [^cdf07d10] [^807a2fdb].
- **Inpatients**: Fixed-dose or carb-counting prandial insulin can be used; align meal delivery with insulin timing to reduce hypo/hyperglycemia [^f63f27a0] [^5168191a].
- **Low-carb diets**: May reduce insulin needs but require careful ratio adjustments and monitoring [^7691a970] [^e8ea9905].

---

Carbohydrate counting is a **cornerstone of T1D care**, and clinical pharmacists are uniquely positioned to deliver, individualize, and sustain this intervention. With structured education, technology, and follow-up, pharmacist-led carb counting improves glycemic control, quality of life, and adherence while addressing real-world barriers.

Aim

Advanced carbohydrate counting, a systematic method for insulin bolus calculation, is recommended in the management of type 1 diabetes. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize all available evidence from randomized and observational studies of the effects of advanced carbohydrate counting on glycaemic control (HbA(1c)), psychosocial measures, weight and hypoglycaemic events in patients of all age groups with type 1 diabetes on a basal-bolus insulin regimen.

Methods

An electronic search of Scopus, MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library conducted in January 2013 identified 27 relevant articles. Six were randomized controlled trials and 21 were observational studies. Large heterogeneity existed across studies with regard to study design and patient populations. Reporting of statistical measures was insufficient to serve as a basis for a meta-analysis.

Results

Overall, the studies demonstrated a positive trend in change in HbA(1c) after introduction of advanced carbohydrate counting. Reductions in HbA(1c) ranged from 0.0 to 13 mmol/mol (0.0–1.2%). Most psychosocial measures improved; however, only few improvements were considered clinically relevant. Both weight gain and reduction were registered, but most studies found no significant weight changes. The majority of studies assessing the incidence of hypoglycaemic events found a significant reduction in the event rate and none reported an increase in the incidence.

Conclusions

In summary, the currently available literature does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively determine the effects of advanced carbohydrate counting on HbA(1c), psychosocial measures, weight or hypoglycaemic events. Nevertheless, the method still appears preferable to other insulin dosing procedures, which justifies continued use and inclusion of advanced carbohydrate counting in clinical guidelines.

Background

Although carbohydrate counting is the recommended dietary strategy for achieving glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes, the advice is based on narrative review and grading of the available evidence. We aimed to assess by systematic review and meta-analysis the efficacy of carbohydrate counting on glycaemic control in adults and children with type 1 diabetes.

Methods

We screened and assessed randomised controlled trials of interventions longer than 3 months that compared carbohydrate counting with general or alternate dietary advice in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. Change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration was the primary outcome. The results of clinically and statistically homogenous studies were pooled and meta-analysed using the random-effects model to provide estimates of the efficacy of carbohydrate counting.

Findings

We identified seven eligible trials, of 311 potentially relevant studies, comprising 599 adults and 104 children with type 1 diabetes. Study quality score averaged 7·6 out of 13. Overall there was no significant improvement in HbA1c concentration with carbohydrate counting versus the control or usual care (-0·35% [-3·9 mmol/mol], 95% CI -0·75 to 0·06; p = 0·096). We identified significant heterogeneity between studies, which was potentially related to differences in study design. In the five studies in adults with a parallel design, there was a 0·64% point (7·0 mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c with carbohydrate counting versus control (95% CI -0·91 to -0·37; p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

There is some evidence to support the recommendation of carbohydrate counting over alternate advice or usual care in adults with type 1 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to support promotion of carbohydrate counting over other methods of matching insulin dose to food intake.

In conclusion, our study shows that offering carbohydrate counting to patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII improves quality of life related to diet restrictions and obtains a modest, although significant, decrease in BMI and waist circumference. A reduction of HbA 1c, not accompanied by an increase in hypoglycemic events, may be expected when patients continuously use carbohydrate counting in the daily management of their diabetes.

Introduction

In the type 1 diabetes (T1D) therapy, blood glucose (BG) concentration is maintained within the safe range by exogenous insulin. The American Diabetes Association recommends carbohydrate-counting in order to compute the meal insulin bolus, whose beneficial effects on glycemic control, in terms of glycated hemoglobin, have been demonstrated by several studies. - This approach consists in estimating the meal carbohydrates (CHO) amount, called carb-counting, and then computing the size of the meal insulin bolus by dividing the estimated CHO amount by a patient-specific factor called carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio. However, many people living with T1D find carb-counting difficult, and despite receiving specific training about how to estimate the CHO content of different foods and meals, frequently under- or over-estimate carbohydrate content that can result in excess glucose excursions. - In a recent study, we demonstrated that carb-counting error depends on meal CHO amount and type. Recently, some smartphone applications - were designed to support T1D subjects with carb-counting, but such applications are at present used only by a minority of individuals.

1 INTRODUCTION

Achieving glycaemic control in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is vital in order to reduce diabetes‐related complications. Treatment recommendations include multiple daily injections of prandial and basal insulin, or continuous insulin infusion (CSII). As carbohydrates are the major nutrient affecting the post‐prandial response, it is important to educate individuals on matching prandial insulin doses to carbohydrate intake by means of carbohydrate counting (CC). The checking of pre‐meal blood glucose levels and co‐ordination of anticipated physical activityare also recommended for optimizing glucose control.

CC takes into account the carbohydrate intake per meal, and enables adjustment of the prandial insulin dosage necessary to achieve individual post‐prandial glucose targets. To manage CC, the patient has many variables to consider: (i) the personal insulin/carb ratio (I:C) – the amount of insulin the patient needs to overcome a 15‐gram portion of carbohydrates; (ii) the accurate assessment of the amount of carbohydrates consumed; (iii) the insulin sensitivity response (IS), that is, the decrease in blood glucose after injecting one unit of insulin to counter an elevated glucose level; (iv) the individual target glucose level pre‐ and post‐meal; and (v) the level of glucose prior to the meal. This means that in order to normalize post‐prandial glucose levels, individuals need to be highly motivated to maintain wellbeing through on‐going compliant conduct, and to be possessed of high mathematical and literacy skills. Studieshave shown the difficulties of successfully carrying out CC, especially concerning the over‐ and underestimation of carbohydrate content in various foods that can lead to post prandial hypo or hyperglycaemia respectively. In a systematic reviewof CC efficacy in managing T1DM, Bell et alfound only partial benefit in achieving glycaemic control through CC, notwithstanding the difficulty of complying with CC instructions. These difficulties are added to other barriers patients with T1DM cope with following dietary recommendations such as, frequent glucose measurements and importantly their feelings about having diabetes.

### A practical guide to delivering nutritional advice to people with diabetes [^27f6d8c3]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Dietary advice is fundamental to the management of diabetes. Although ideally such advice should be delivered by a state-registered dietitian, it is more usually delivered by other health professionals. The primary focus for those with type 1 diabetes is carbohydrate counting and insulin adjustment and for the majority of people with type 2 diabetes, weight management is key. Patient-centred care is emphasised for the delivery of dietary advice. It is widely recognised that knowledge alone is not sufficient to induce behaviour change and practical approaches to a variety of behavioural interventions are discussed.

Type 1 diabetes — insulin dosing calculations and ratios — Weight-based total daily insulin (TDD) starting doses range from 0.4 to 0.5 units/kg/day, while lower starting insulin doses of 0.2 to 0.3 units/kg/day are recommended for older adults, those with renal failure, malnutrition, or low BMI. In the ideal prandial/bolus regimen, dosing is based on carbohydrate counting using an insulin-to-carbohydrate (IC) ratio of 1 unit for 15 g carbohydrate, or calculated with 450/TDD for regular insulin or 500/TDD for rapid-acting insulin (example: 500/50 units = 1:10 IC ratio). Insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) estimates the glucose-lowering effect per unit and can be approximated with 1500/TDD for regular insulin or 1800/TDD for rapid-acting insulin; IC ratios usually range from 1:20 for very insulin-sensitive to 1:5 for insulin-resistant persons. Basal insulin doses are titrated to personalized target fasting glucose.

### The relationship between carbohydrate and the mealtime insulin dose in type 1 diabetes [^aebb4db0]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

A primary focus of the nutritional management of type 1 diabetes has been on matching prandial insulin therapy with carbohydrate amount consumed. Different methods exist to quantify carbohydrate including counting in one gram increments, 10g portions or 15g exchanges. Clinicians have assumed that counting in one gram increments is necessary to precisely dose insulin and optimize postprandial control. Carbohydrate estimations in portions or exchanges have been thought of as inadequate because they may result in less precise matching of insulin dose to carbohydrate amount. However, studies examining the impact of errors in carbohydrate quantification on postprandial glycemia challenge this commonly held view. In addition it has been found that a single mealtime bolus of insulin can cover a range of carbohydrate intake without deterioration in postprandial control. Furthermore, limitations exist in the accuracy of the nutrition information panel on a food label. This article reviews the relationship between carbohydrate quantity and insulin dose, highlighting limitations in the evidence for a linear association. These insights have significant implications for patient education and mealtime insulin dose calculations.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^6d604ebc]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

In this work, we use the T1D-PDS to perform a sensitivity analysis aimed at quantifying the impact that different levels of carb-counting error have on glucose control indexes. For sake of simplicity, we do not consider the possible role of specific closed-loop algorithms and limit the analysis to virtual T1D patients treated with a standard open-loop therapy. The simulation study is first made in a single-meal scenario, to evaluate in an ideal, disturbance-free setting the impact of the error on the post prandial glucose, and then in a multi-meal scenario, to quantify the impact of the error repeated in time on the overall glycemic control represented by time in ranges. From the latter analysis, mathematical formulas which describe how time in ranges change in response to carb-counting error variations are obtained. These formulas provide, for the first time, a mathematical quantification of the extent to which carb-counting error impact glycemic control in an open-loop scenario. Such evidence could be important to assist diabetologists in patients' therapy adjustments and to build an educational tool to help patients in understanding the detrimental effects of carb-counting error.

A second and significant limitation of this study is related to the fact that the monitoring of blood glucose was not carried out, so we had no data to characterize hypoglycemia, which is a common intercurrence in patients with multiple needle sticks and carbohydrate counting. Such data would certainly enrich our results.

### Effects of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a randomized, prospective clinical trial (GIOCAR) [^bcea7705]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Nutritional management is a cornerstone in the management of diabetes, and monitoring of carbohydrate intake, a major determinant of postprandial blood glucose, is a key strategy for achieving good glucose control.

Some studies have examined the contribution of quantity and type (i.e. simple vs. complex) of carbohydrates in patients with type 1 diabetes and showed that the daily insulin requirement is indeed associated with the amount rather than the type of daily carbohydrate intake.

Over the years, a number of methods have been proposed to help patients with diabetes to quantify the carbohydrate content of a meal in real life, for example, exchange lists, portion/servings, grams, glycemic index, and insulin:carbohydrate ratio (I:CHO). Among these, the I:CHO is considered the most advanced counting technique, consisting of estimating the grams of carbohydrates in a meal and then calculating the pre-meal insulin dose based on this estimation and an insulin sensitivity measure. Carbohydrate counting was devised in the 1960s, but it has become widely used as part of intensive diabetes management after the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).

Although carbohydrate counting is widely used by patients worldwide, few studies have validated its efficacy in type 1 diabetes, and none have validated its efficacy in adult patients receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). We designed the current study with the aim of testing the effect of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII.

### Effects of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a randomized, prospective clinical trial (GIOCAR) [^693f8b25]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In our study, the observed improvement in metabolic control among patients using carbohydrate counting in the daily management of their diabetes was achieved without the increase of body weight, waist circumference, or frequency of hypoglycemic events usually reported with intensive diabetes management. Indeed, in the carbohydrate counting group we unexpectedly observed a small, although significant, weight loss, for which we have no obvious explanation. At baseline, all randomized patients attended a group lesson with the dietitian about the recommended diet for patients with diabetes, with the only difference between the two groups being learning and using carbohydrate counting. A decrease in BMI with carbohydrate counting, although not significant, also was observed in the study by Trento et al. in which the control group had similar exposure to the diabetes care team. We suggest that carbohydrate counting may provide users with some additional benefits that facilitate weight loss, most likely through improved nutrition or increased physical activity.

Our study has several strengths. First the sample size is at least as large as that of previously published research involving patients with type 1 diabetes who receive multiple daily injections. Second, patients were provided training in carbohydrate counting that is feasible in the setting of a diabetes clinic. On the other hand, our study has some limitations. First, patients in the intervention group had more contact with the diabetes care team during the teaching of carbohydrate counting, thus preventing us from ruling out that the intervention group lost weight and improved metabolic control secondary to the extra attention, rather than the use of carbohydrate counting. However, several evidences support a direct effect of carbohydrate counting on the improvement of glucose control: 1) in our study a significant improvement in HbA 1c was observed only in the PP analysis, which included only those participants who indeed use carbohydrate counting to estimate their meal boluses; 2) a similar decrease in HbA 1c after learning carbohydrate counting was observed in a study with a control group with similar exposure to the diabetes care team; and 3) the study patients in the control group were long-term attendants of our CSII outpatient clinic, making it unlikely that a transient increase in contact with the diabetes care team could significantly affect their diet and diabetes management. Moreover, our study has a relatively short duration, not allowing the assessment of the effects of carbohydrate counting in the long-term, as it would be desirable for a lifetime intervention. Finally, we did not measure physical activity and food intake during the study, not allowing us to assess their contribution to weight loss and improved metabolic control.

### Effects of nutrition education using a food-based approach, carbohydrate counting or routine care in type 1 diabetes: 12 months prospective randomized trial [^2296e211]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The data show that CC, an FBA with low GI and RC give equivalent results in terms of HbA1c at 12 months, in persons with T1D with moderately impaired glycemic control. An FBA may, tentatively, have beneficial effects on food choices and nutrient quality. The results point toward several options in terms of nutrition programs to achieve health goals and quality of life and, thus, more ways to tailor the nutritional management of T1D to each individual's needs and preferences.

### Effects of advanced carbohydrate counting guided by an automated bolus calculator in type 1 diabetes mellitus (stenoABC): a 12-month, randomized clinical trial [^747b5291]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To test whether concomitant use of an automated bolus calculator for people with Type 1 diabetes carrying out advanced carbohydrate counting would induce further improvements in metabolic control.

Methods

We conducted a 12-month, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, single-centre, investigator-initiated clinical study. We enrolled advanced carbohydrate counting-naïve adults with Type 1 diabetes and HbA 1c levels 64–100 mmol/mol (8.0–11.3%), who were receiving multiple daily insulin injection therapy. In a 1:1-ratio, participants were randomized to receive training in either advanced carbohydrate counting using mental calculations (MC group) or advanced carbohydrate counting using an automated bolus calculator (ABC group) during a 3.5-h group training course. For 12 months after training, participants attended a specialized diabetes centre quarterly. The primary outcome was change in HbA 1c from baseline to 12 months.

Results

Between August 2012 and September 2013, 168 participants (96 men and 72 women) were recruited and randomly assigned to the MC group (n = 84) and the ABC group (n = 84). Drop-out rates were 23.8 and 21.4%, respectively (P = 0.712); 130 participants completed the study. The baseline HbA 1c was 75 ± 9 mmol/mol (9.0 ± 0.8%) in the MC group and 74 ± 8 mmol/mol (8.9 ± 0.7%) in the ABC group. At 12 months, change in HbA 1c was significant within both groups: MC group: -2 mmol/mol (95% CI -4 to -1) or -0.2% (95% CI -0.4 to -0.1; P = 0.017) and ABC group: -5 mmol/mol (95% CI -6 to -3) or -0.5% (95% CI -0.6 to -0.3; P < 0.0001), but HbA 1c reductions were significantly greater in the ABC group (P = 0.033). No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reported.

Conclusions

People with Type 1 diabetes initiating advanced carbohydrate counting obtained significantly greater HbA 1c reductions when guided by an automated bolus calculator (NCT02084498).

### Value of carbohydrate counting [^02c3b43e]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2023). High credibility.

Recently, Bawazeer et al reported on their study evaluating carbohydrate counting (CC) knowledge among adults with type 1 diabetes in Saudi Arabia (SA). Anyone working with persons who have diabetes and use CC, and especially readers of BMJ Prevention, Nutrition and Health (BMJ NPH) will appreciate this study, as it highlights the value of this important tool for diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES), while also emphasising the need to understand the type 1 diabetes epidemic SA and many other countries are currently facing. Those of us who work in the field of diabetes — whether it be research or patient care — have long recognised the global type 2 diabetes epidemic, but less attention has been devoted to the explosion in type 1 diagnoses.

The International Diabetes Federation's Diabetes (IDF) Atlas Reports 2022 recently published the 10 countries with the highest prevalence of type 1 diabetes for all ages: the USA (highest), India, Brazil, China, Germany, the UK, Russia, Canada, SA and Spain. Not only do we as a global nutrition and prevention community have a huge burden to mitigate, but we need more effective tools to help people living everyday with diabetes self-manage this chronic condition better. Since the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, we have known CC is beneficial, particularly for those with type 1 diabetes, and it is the currently recommended nutrition approach alongside continuous blood glucose monitoring or self-monitoring of blood glucose via finger stick, as it has the biggest effect on postprandial glucose excursions. Evaluating the implementation and accuracy of CC in daily life among persons living with type 1 diabetes adds some important information to this puzzle from a less-well studied area of our global community.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^4333f905]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Nutrition Therapy

Nutrition therapy is an important component of the treatment plan for all individuals with type 1 diabetes. Each patient should have an individualized food plan based on food preferences, schedule, and physical activity. Nutrition therapy aims to ensure that the patient and family understand the impact food has on blood glucose, how food interacts with exercise and insulin to prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia and to achieve glucose goals, and how to implement the food plan in a variety of situations. The food plan takes into consideration the patient's numeracy, literacy, engagement, and ability to adjust insulin.

General diabetes nutrition principles, as defined in the ADA Standards of Care, apply to people with type 1 diabetes, particularly in reference to normal growth and development in youth and the maintenance of a healthy body weight at all ages. Specifically, with regards to individuals with type 1 diabetes, topics such as carbohydrate counting and meal composition should be addressed. For selected individuals who have mastered carbohydrate counting, education on the impact of protein and fat on glycemic excursions should be incorporated into diabetes management. Those who are overweight or obese may benefit from weight reduction counseling.

Recommendations

Individualized medical nutrition therapy is recommended for all people with type 1 diabetes as an effective component of the overall treatment plan. (A)
Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. (B)
If adults with type 1 diabetes choose to drink alcohol, they should be advised to do so in moderation (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). Discussion with a health care provider is advised to explore potential interactions with medications. Adults should be advised that alcohol can lower blood glucose levels and that driving after drinking alcohol is contraindicated. (E)

There should be consistency in day-to-day carbohydrate intake for persons treated with fixed-dose insulin regimens, or adjustments of insulin doses to meals that vary in carbohydrate content (eg, use of carbohydrate counting). The timing of meals and distribution of ingested calories through the day should be individualized with reference to medical therapy and physical activity and to avoid hypoglycemia. A physician and/or an RDN should discuss meal plan recommendations in plain language with persons at the initial visit after DM diagnosis and then periodically during follow-up outpatient visits, and education should include specific foods/meal planning, grocery shopping, dining-out strategies, and diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) to build understanding of macronutrients and nutrition labels.

### Proposed practical guidelines to improve glycaemic management by reducing glycaemic variability in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^fe7caaf9]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Appropriate Balance of Nutrients in Each Meal

In the classical diet scenario in DM, a meal is supposed to consist of two constituents: carbohydrates and 'everything else', namely proteins, fibre and fat. However, the first concept to teach is that carbohydrates, although indeed playing a key role in daily glycaemic levels, are not the only elements influencing these. A correct nutrient balance is achieved when vegetables, wholegrain cereals, extra amount of fibre, lean protein and healthy fat are added to the daily carbohydrate portion. This practice will produce benefits, among which stabilisation of glucose levels after meals will be the main one: the classically observed increase in glucose levels will be delayed and peaks will be lower in intensity. Thus, GV will be lower, and interestingly, the feeling of satiety will increase.

Once people with T1D have been educated to acknowledge the importance of all dietary constituents, a series of specific guidelines can be proposed to optimise each meal balance.
Some Consistency amongst Meals Must Be Observed

Consuming not very different amounts of carbohydrates of similar origin in each meal may help in insulin dose calculation. However, this practice is not mandatory. In fact, it has been shown that appropriate training in insulin dose adjustment facilitates some dietary freedom. Thus, people with T1D should be educated to match insulin doses to their food choices. For this purpose, they should be familiar with the ratio between a given amount of carbohydrates and insulin dose.
Carbohydrate Intake Should Be Quantified

Reference guides agree in considering the counting of carbohydrates to be a necessary strategy to achieve a good control of GV. To improve glucose response, people with T1D should be encouraged to follow nutritional advice to achieve a controlled intake of carbohydrates. An excessive amount of carbohydrates may be prejudicial to control, but too few carbohydrates are not recommended either. Eating a consistent amount of carbohydrates makes insulin dosing easier, although this practice may result in monotonous diet patterns and is difficult to accomplish in everyday life situations such as parties or travel. Requirements may change according to individual hallmarks and the individual glycaemic management target. Importantly, a recent study found a direct association between the amount of carbohydrates per meal and GV in the following 3 h. Indeed, carbohydrate intake influences the level of post-prandial plasma glucose, which in turn contributes to GV and influences glucose excursions. This does not necessarily mean that carbohydrates have to be strictly avoided, since there is no agreement regarding suitability of diets based on very low carbohydrate intake.
Carbohydrate Suitability Is Largely Influenced by the Source

### Dietary strategies for adult type 1 diabetes in light of outcome evidence [^b85dce36]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals who have type 1 diabetes need individualised medical nutrition therapies whose goals are to improve overall health and metabolic outcomes. However, interventions in the field of nutrition are challenging, as diet-related correlations with disease remain difficult to detect and the certainty of outcome in this area is elusive. Currently, patients are not meeting recommended dietary guidelines. Several alternative approaches for teaching meal planning to people with diabetes have been proposed: basic nutrition guidelines, basic diabetes guidelines, menu approaches to meal planning, exchange lists for meal planning and carbohydrate counting. The review provides an overview of suggested strategies for achieving the proposed goals and summarises evidence of outcomes.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2274d963]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Carbohydrate counting (CC) for prandial insulin in hospitalized adults with noncritical illness — In adult patients with noninsulin-treated type 2 diabetes (T2D) who require prandial insulin therapy, we suggest not using CC for calculating prandial insulin doses; in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or insulin-treated T2D, we suggest either CC or no CC with fixed prandial insulin dosing. The systematic review identified 1 RCT and 2 non-RCTs, and most patients represented in these studies had T2D. Evidence from the RCT reported that mean daily blood glucose values may be lower by 8.3 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L) with CC compared to fixed meal dosing (95% CI −22.76 to 6.16; very low certainty), while a combined analysis of the 2 observational studies found little to no difference (very low certainty). Hypoglycemia results were conflicting: the RCT found 158 more hypoglycemia events per 1000 patients with CC [95% CI −4 to 444; RR 1.71 (95% CI 0.98 to 3.01)], whereas one observational study found fewer hypoglycemia events with CC [RR 0.04 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.72)]. Remarks note that patients who perform CC as outpatients may prefer to continue during hospitalization, a policy and expertise can support CC use in hospitals, either CC or fixed prandial insulin dosing can be implemented where resources allow, and adjustments to the ICR may be needed to address illness or treatment effects.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^8c1021a9]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

This quantification of the impact of different types of carb-counting errors can be valuable to clinicians, researchers and people with diabetes to explain some of the glycemic excursions that occur, as well in aiding decisions around therapy adjustments. For example, the diabetologists can use the formulas we derived to guess how much the glycemic control of a patient can improve if a specific training is programmed for limiting the subject's systematic or random error in carb-counting. In an equivalent way, the diabetologist can opt for adjusting the patient's carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio in order to compensate a systematic error in carb-counting by producing the same benefits in time in ranges estimated by our formulas. However, even if the quantification of the carb-counting error impact can be useful to clinicians for the reasons explained above, we do not provide any indication about how diabetologists must adjust therapy parameters based on our findings. Moreover, the obtained formulas can also be integrated in educational tools usable to help subjects in understanding the detrimental effects of some behavioral aspects, such as carb-counting error, on glycemic control.

It is important to remark that the quantitative results reported in this paper are valid in an open-loop scenario only. Indeed, we expect that the impact of the carb-counting error may be mitigated by the use of sophisticated closed-loop approaches and technologies. It is possible that these formulas can be used to stress-test the impact of carbohydrate counting errors in novel closed-loop algorithms.

Moreover, it must be emphasized that, in our study, we simulated rapidly absorbed meals completely made of CHO, since the T1D-PDS does not include a model of the absorption of more complex meals containing also proteins and fats, and thus it cannot simulate slow-absorption meals. Of course, the impact of the carb-counting error could be different if slow-absorption meals and/or the effect of other macronutrients are considered in the analysis. If an updated meal absorption model should become available and be included in the T1D-PDS, the analysis performed in this paper could be repeated considering different meal compositions.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^bf4ae3d5]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

In the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D), systematic and random errors in carb-counting can have an adverse effect on glycemic control. In this study, we performed an in silico trial aiming at quantifying the impact of different levels of carb-counting error on glycemic control.

Methods:

The T1D patient decision simulator was used to simulate 7-day glycemic profiles of 100 adults using open-loop therapy. The simulation was repeated for different values of systematic and random carb-counting errors, generated with Gaussian distribution varying the error mean from -10% to +10% and standard deviation (SD) from 0% to 50%. The effect of the error was evaluated by computing the difference of time inside (∆TIR), above (∆TAR) and below (∆TBR) the target glycemic range (70-180mg/dl) compared to the reference case, that is, absence of error. Finally, 3 linear regression models were developed to mathematically describe how error mean and SD variations result in ∆TIR, ∆TAR, and ∆TBR changes.

Results:

Random errors globally deteriorate the glycemic control; systematic underestimations lead to, on average, up to 5.2% more TAR than the reference case, while systematic overestimation results in up to 0.8% more TBR. The different time in range metrics were linearly related with error mean and SD (R 2 > 0.95), with slopes of, for ∆TIR, for ∆TAR, and, for ∆TBR.

Conclusions:

The quantification of carb-counting error impact performed in this work may be useful understanding causes of glycemic variability and the impact of possible therapy adjustments or behavior changes in different glucose metrics.

### Effects of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a randomized, prospective clinical trial (GIOCAR) [^126cb237]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study reports the results of the first randomized clinical trial testing the effects of carbohydrate counting in adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII. Carbohydrate counting improved the DSQOLS score related to diet restrictions and was associated with a modest, although significant, decrease in BMI and waist circumference. When patients who did not continuously use carbohydrate counting or CSII during the study were excluded from the analyses, carbohydrate counting was also associated with a significant reduction of HbA 1c not accompanied by an increase of hypoglycemic events.

Patients with type 1 diabetes must continuously match capillary glucose levels, food intake, and physical activity with the administration of the appropriate dose of exogenous insulin to maintain glucose levels within the recommended target. Dietary restrictions and the stress associated with the daily management of diabetes have a negative impact on the quality of life of these patients. Carbohydrate counting is a tool that helps patients to estimate in a systematic way the amount of the pre-meal insulin bolus to minimize the glucose increase after a meal, and if necessary, to correct an either inappropriately high or low pre-meal glucose level.

The improvement of the DSQOLS score related to diet restrictions that we observed in our study extends previous findings by Trento et al. to patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII, although we did not observe an improvement in HbA 1c with carbohydrate counting in our ITT analysis, possibly because our study was relatively short (6 months) or not all participants trained in carbohydrate counting used it. However, when only patients who continuously used carbohydrate counting for the daily management of their diabetes were included in the analyses, we observed a significant improvement in HbA 1c (−0.35%) compared with control subjects. The fact that one of five participants who learned carbohydrate counting did not use it to estimate their meal boluses suggests that, although relatively simple, this method may be difficult to implement for a non-negligible proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Efficacy and safety of fast-acting insulin aspart in people with type 1 diabetes using carbohydrate counting: a post hoc analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^29510bf4]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insulin dosing based on carbohydrate counting is the gold standard for improving glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D). This post hoc analysis aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) according to bolus dose adjustment method in people with T1D.

Methods

Post hoc analysis of two 26-week, treat-to-target, randomised trials investigating treatment with double-blind mealtime faster aspart, insulin aspart (IAsp), or open-label post-meal faster aspart (onset 1, n = 1143; onset 8, n = 1025). Participants with previous experience continued carbohydrate counting (onset 1, n = 669 [58.5%]; onset 8, n = 428 [41.8%]), while remaining participants used a bolus algorithm.

Results

In onset 1, HbA1c reduction was statistically significantly in favour of mealtime faster aspart versus IAsp with carbohydrate counting (estimated treatment difference [ETD 95% CI] - 0.19% [-0.30;-0.09]; - 2.08 mmol/mol [- 3.23; - 0.93]). In onset 8, there was no statistically significant difference in HbA1c reduction with either dose adjustment method, although a trend towards improved HbA1c was observed for mealtime faster aspart with carbohydrate counting (ETD - 0.14% [-0.28; 0.003]; - 1.53 mmol/mol [- 3.10; 0.04]). In both trials, bolus insulin doses and overall rates of severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemia were similar between treatments across dose adjustment methods.

Conclusion

For people with T1D using carbohydrate counting, mealtime faster aspart may offer improved glycaemic control versus IAsp, with similar insulin dose and weight gain and no increased risk of hypoglycaemia.

### Evaluation of carbohydrate counting knowledge among individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Saudi arabia: a cross-sectional study [^f56e050c]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease with hyperglycaemia due to insulin deficiency resulting from the loss of pancreatic islet β-cells. Approximately 10% of all diabetes mellitus (DM) cases are T1DM, which can affect individuals of all ages but usually develops in children or young adults. The causes of T1DM remain unclear but are linked to genetic and environmental factors. Over the past 30 years, the incidence of T1DM has increased in Saudi Arabia (SA). In 2017, more than 35 000 children and adolescents in SA had T1DM, with the highest incidence of 3900 cases.

Poor glycaemic management among patients with T1DM can lead to acute hypoglycaemia and long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications. Nutrition therapy is associated with improved glycaemic outcomes. One of the nutritional approaches to T1DM emphasises the connection between the number of consumed carbohydrates and insulin dosage. Carbohydrate counting (CC) is a meal planning strategy that aids in tracking carbohydrate intake and prandial glycaemiaand facilitates flexible food selection without adversely affecting the metabolic outcomes of patients. It is becoming a more widely accepted method after being used as one of four meal-planning approaches with intensive insulin therapy in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial in the early 1990s. Consequently, many diabetes centres in SA currently consider intensive insulin therapy part of the routine management of T1DM. Therefore, nutrition education programmes were tailored to train dieticians in the use of CC as an education modality for patients with diabetes.

Single-Meal Analysis

Sensitivity to carb-counting error on post-prandial glucose

Figure 1 shows the glycemic curves of a representative virtual subject for different carb-counting error levels up to 6hours after the mealtime. We can see that CHO overestimation mitigates the peak BG level compared to the case of absence of error (black line), but it leads to BG levels lower than 70mg/dl for errors larger than 10%. The larger the error, the sooner the hypoglycemic event happens. On the other hand, CHO underestimation leads to higher BG values in all the next 6hours.

Figure 1.
Glycemic profiles of a representative subject for different carb-counting error levels. The black curve (the one with error equal to 0%) represents the subject BG excursion in absence of carb-counting error. A meal of 60grams of CHO is given to the subject at 8:00.

The distributions of the postprandial glucose control metrics in the overall virtual population, expressed as differences compared to the reference case (= 0), are reported via boxplot representation in Figure 2. The higher the overestimation error, the lower the BG peak (panel A), the BG level at 120min after the mealtime (panel B) and the AUC in hyperglycemia (panel C) compared to the reference case, at the expense of the AUC in hypoglycemia (panel D) which increases for higher positive values of carb-counting error. Conversely, increasing the underestimation error, the BG peak (panel A), the BG level at 120min after the mealtime (panel B) and the AUC in hyperglycemia (panel C) decrease, while no hypoglycemic episodes occurs for any subjects. Indeed, the AUC in hypoglycemia (panel D) remains zero for subjects who do not experience hypoglycemia in absence of carb-counting error, while it assumes negative values for the others. Moreover, the BG peak time from mealtime (panel E) decreases with CHO underestimation while increasing with CHO underestimations with an approximately linear trend.

Sensitivity to carb-counting error in the multi-meal scenario

Firstly, the impact of the carb-counting error was evaluated via boxplot representation of the delta time in ranges distribution among the 100 subjects and by plotting the curve of the delta metrics for different values of M and SD. Secondly, mathematical formulas were derived to quantify the relationship between delta time in ranges and different values of the systematic error (M) and the random error (SD). Specifically, 3 multiple linear regression models were identified by using as output the mean of delta time in ranges among the 100 virtual subjects and as inputs both the error mean and the standard deviation, as follow:

The linearity of the relationship between inputs and each output was verified by computing the coefficient of determination R 2 of the models. The slope coefficients α and β are sensitivity indices, which permit quantification of the strength of the impact of the 2 factors under study on the time in ranges metrics.

Results

Initially, 55 patients aged 25.3 ± 1.55 years took part in the study. Four patients were excluded because they did not attend the follow-up. Fifty-one patients with DM1 completed the study, 37% males and 63% females, with duration of DM of 11.31 ± 1.09 years.

A significant decrease in A1c levels was observed from baseline to the three-month evaluation (10.40 ± 0.33% and 9.52 ± 0.32%, respectively, p = 0.0009). These data are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1
A1c values at baseline and after the intervention.

A significant reduction in A1c levels was observed in 38 (74%) patients. Conversely, 11 diabetics (21.5%) presented an increase in this value, whereas two patients (3.9%) maintained the same baseline values. The proportion of patients that presented A1c levels < 7% at the baseline and after the intervention did not differ [3 (5.9%) vs. 4 (7.5%) patients].

- Stay healthy longer.
- Feel better and improve their quality of life.
- Prevent or delay diabetes complications such as kidney disease, eye disease, heart disease, and stroke. How are carbs measured. Carbs are measured in grams. On packaged foods, you can find total carb grams on the Nutrition Facts label. You can also check this list or use a carb-counting app to find grams of carbs in foods and drinks. For diabetes meal planning, 1 carb serving is about 15 grams of carbs. This isn't always the same as what you think of as a serving of food. For example, most people would count a small baked potato as 1 serving. However, at about 30 grams of carbs, it counts as 2 carb servings.

Try to eat about the same amount of carbs at each meal to keep your blood sugar levels steady throughout the day. This sample menu has about 1, 800 calories, 200 grams of carbs, and about 13 carb servings. How many carbs should I eat. There's no "one size fits all" answer — everyone is different because everyone's body is different. The amount you can eat and stay in your target blood sugar range depends on your age, weight, activity level, and other factors. A dietitian or diabetes care and education specialist can help you create an eating plan that works for your unique needs and lifestyle. How can I find out more about carb counting.

Talk with your dietitian about the right amount of carbs for you, and be sure to update your meal plan if your needs change. Ask about tasty, healthy recipes that can help you stay on top of your carb intake — which will make it easier to manage your blood sugar levels, too.

### Effects of basic carbohydrate counting versus standard dietary care for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (the BCC study): a randomised, controlled trial [^bd9f3cfb]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition requiring continuous self-management, beyond regular healthcare visits. Consequently, evidence-based education with specific focus on diet and nutrition is crucial for empowering individuals to effectively manage their diabetes. Giving priority to dietary management is essential for preventing the onset of diabetes-related complications and improving quality of life. A variety of eating patterns have been recommended by the European and American diabetes associations. Additionally, a recent network meta-analysis found that several dietary approaches (including low-fat, vegetarian, Mediterranean, high-protein, moderate-carbohydrate, low-carbohydrate, low glycaemic index/loads, paleolithic diets) improve glycaemic control in T2D. Compared with various eating patterns, carbohydrate counting is an approach to manage carbohydrate amounts and balance carbohydrate intake at meals (i.e. basic carbohydrate counting [BCC]). Advanced carbohydrate counting has been recommended for several decades, primarily benefiting individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but also showing positive effects in T2D in combination with basal-bolus insulin regimes. Despite the impact of the total carbohydrate intake in a meal on the postprandial glucose response, there remains a scarcity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of BCC as a dietary approach for enhancing glycaemic control. Furthermore, accuracy in carbohydrate estimation is presumed an intermediate marker likely to have an impact on glycaemic control in individuals with diabetes. This has been found in some studies (mainly including individuals with T1D) but not others. There are multiple educational approaches to BCC including gram counting, exchanges, and experience-based estimation. None of which have been thoroughly described or examined in clinical trials. Thus, providing knowledge and practical skills in estimating carbohydrate portions more accurately and self-monitoring carbohydrate intake appears highly relevant. By improving carbohydrate estimation skills and encourage monitoring of carbohydrate intake, aiming at a high day-to-day and meal-to-meal consistency, individuals with T2D may improve their carbohydrate food choices and portion sizes. Ideally, this could result in clinical improvements such as a reduction in plasma glucose variability and time spent with hyperglycaemia thereby improving glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as seen in individuals with T1D. The aim of the current study was to examine the efficacy of a structured education program in BCC as add-on to standard dietary care on glycaemic control in individuals with T2D. Our hypothesis was that BCC is superior for improving glycaemia, assessed by HbA1c and mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE), when compared with standard dietary care.

### Effects of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a randomized, prospective clinical trial (GIOCAR) [^c997a3e8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The GIOCAR (contegGIO-CARboidrati) was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial with a duration of 24 weeks. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT01173991). After having received detailed information about the study and before any study procedure, participants signed a written informed consent.

We recruited adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII and followed at the CSII Outpatient Clinic of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan. We included patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 18–65 years, who had been treated with CSII for > 3 months. Exclusion criteria were serum creatinine > 124 μmol/L in women and > 150 μmol/L in men, previous training in carbohydrate counting, celiac disease, pregnancy, severe comorbidities, and any disability preventing compliance with study procedures. Three diabetologists with experience in managing patients on CSII and trained in carbohydrate counting and one dietitian certified in carbohydrate counting conducted the study. We used the Complete Guide to Carb Counting (2nd ed.) as a reference for carbohydrate counting. Learning carbohydrate counting involves several steps. The first step is keeping a food diary: complete food records include day of the week, meal time, amounts of food, carbohydrate grams for each food, total carbohydrate grams for the meal or snack, preprandial and postprandial (2 h after the start of the meal) blood glucose, short-acting insulin dose, and physical activity. The I:CHO tells how much insulin is needed to "cover" the amount of carbohydrates eaten and bring blood glucose level back to pre-meal target. This ratio is calculated on the basis of individual recorded diary data by dividing the total grams of carbohydrates of a meal by the number of units of short-acting insulin that were able to hold post-meal glucose excursions within 1.6 mmol/L. The sensitivity factor or correction factor is calculated by dividing 1,800 by the total daily insulin requirement and corresponds to the glucose lowering obtained with one unit of short-acting insulin. By combining the I:CHO and sensitivity factor, patients are instructed to estimate the preprandial insulin dose, taking into consideration preprandial blood glucose and the amount of carbohydrates they plan to eat.

Boxplot of the difference in time in ranges compared to the reference case for the 100 virtual subjects. The boxplots of the ΔTIR, ΔTAR, and ΔTBR for carb-counting error SD fixed to 0 and by varying the carb-counting error mean are reported in panels A, B and C, respectively. The boxplots of the ΔTIR, ΔTAR, and ΔTBR for carb-counting error mean fixed to 0 and by varying the carb-counting error SD are reported in panels D, E, and F, respectively. Red zones are the ones in which the metrics are worse than for the reference case, while the green zones are the ones in which the metrics are better than for the reference case.

Panels D, E and F of Figure 3 report the impact of the random error on the glycemic control metrics, in the absence of a systematic error. In fact, in this case, the boxplots represent the distribution of the delta time in ranges metrics (, and) for the 100 subjects for different values of the carb-counting error standard deviation, when the mean is fixed to 0. We can see that the increase of random error apparently results in a deterioration of glycemic control, that is, lower TIR (panel A) and higher TAR and TBR (panels B and C).

Figure 4 reports the bidimensional maps of the mean among the 100 subjects of the delta time in ranges metrics, for all the tested combinations of carb-counting error mean and SD. Systematic underestimation with high random error leads to up to 5.2% more of mean TAR and 5.3% less of mean TIR compared to the reference. Note that, according to the International Consensus on time in ranges, a difference of 5% in TIR is clinically significant for individuals with T1D. Regarding the cases with systematic overestimation, the presence of large random errors results in up to a 0.8% increase of TBR over the reference. Note that the virtual subjects intake of hypotreatments, which is enabled in this simulation scenario, probably mitigates the increase of TBR due to the carb-counting error.

### Sugars and starch in the nutritional management of diabetes mellitus [^ff57f03a]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Nutritional recommendations, long recognized as an important aspect of diabetes mellitus treatment, have also been an area of persistent controversy, particularly regarding the proportions and types of carbohydrate and fat. This review addresses the role of sugars within medical nutrition therapy for diabetes mellitus. Nutritional recommendations for diabetes mellitus treatment were revised recently. The new guidelines do not specifically restrict intake of sugars, although general recommendations are made for including fiber, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits within dietary selections containing starches. For carbohydrates, the principle focus is on overall caloric amounts. In type 1 diabetes the most effective approach to the control of postprandial hyperglycemia continues to be adjustment of premeal doses of insulin on the basis of carbohydrate counting. In type 2 diabetes, in addition to a focus on caloric content of carbohydrate, consideration continues to be given to the role of the glycemic index as a determinant of postprandial hyperglycemia and overall metabolic control. Nevertheless, consensus recommendations do not support widespread use of the glycemic index. An area of some change is a more clear endorsement of including monounsaturated fatty acids. Current recommendations are that monounsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates combined should provide 60–70% of daily energy intake, with individual flexibility in the respective proportions, whereas intake of saturated fats is limited to < 10% of energy intake. This new emphasis reflects greater awareness of the importance of responding to individual and cultural dietary preferences and the need to address treatment of both hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in diabetes mellitus.

Barriers — for individuals with T1D adhering to a VLCD or LCD

Challenges of the diet

Adjusting meal time insulin to carbohydrate ratio proved to be an initial challenge for many across the three studies due to unexpected variation in glycaemia i.e.g.oing too low due to too much insulin or going to high due to too little insulin. Participants reported needing to adjusted their insulin to carbohydrate ratio frequently at the beginning of the intervention due to the reduced carbohydrate intake to achieve optimal glycaemia as their usual ratio was inappropriate. The following participant reported:

"my ratio's had to change quite quickly" due to the reduction in dietary carbohydrate being consumed.

It was reported that reading information on food products can be confusing and burdensome for participants. In addition, one participant made the point that: "the low carb diet can be restrictive", highlighting the emotional burden patients with T1D face in daily living with the disease.

It was also acknowledged by some participants that the diet negatively impacted their mood when it changed from an unrestricted diet to a LCD and applying carbohydrate counting skills: "food from a pleasure to chemistry… suddenly enjoyment of meals went suddenly down".

Due to the nature of low carbohydrate eating, it can be a difficult regimen to maintain. From a social perspective this point was emphasised in the following reflection: "because our society is so high carb, you really need to be mindful… it (can be) quite restrictive when eating out with friends".

Having diabetes and managing the condition was described by one participant as like having: "another child… it was just something I looked after and I didn't put it in everybody's faces… but (this changed when) everybody started seeing me reading labels profusely and measuring things".

Limited information (participants knowledge, information sources) about the diet

While many participants acknowledged the value of following a LCD and carbohydrate counting there were some key concerns relating to insulin to carbohydrate ratio application when following such a diet. One participant stated that despite undertaking carbohydrate training felt there were still skills that needed to be developed stating "a lot of questions about carbohydrate counting and how it works because there's quite a few anomalies".

Participants reported a paucity of authoritative resources for individuals living with T1D who choose to follow a low carbohydrate eating regimen. One participant acknowledged that this prompted them to access a: " Facebook group called Type 1 Diabetes Quebec… On there some people posted an article that came from another website — 'Long Live Bacon'".

### The 2021–2022 position of Brazilian diabetes society on insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes: an evidence-based guideline to clinical practice [^aea5a487]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

R1

In PWT1D, it IS RECOMMENDED to start insulin treatment immediately after clinical diagnosis to prevent metabolic decompensation and DKA.

Summary of evidence

For ethical reasons, there are no studies comparing treating or not treating PWT1D with insulin. In situations of absolute insulin deficiency, such as T1D, DKA can be installed quickly, especially in the presence of infectious processes, and death can occur in a few hours, even after hospital admission. Therefore, to prevent DKA, insulin therapy should be instituted as soon as possible after the diagnosis of T1D. If DKA is already installed, insulin therapy must follow a protocol that prioritizes the correction of hydro electrolytic and acid-base disorders.

R2

It IS RECOMMENDED to use insulin therapy regimens that mimic insulin secretion, with the aim to achieve glycemic control goals established for the age group, comorbidities or frailty conditions.

Summary of evidence

This panel considers, based on expert opinion, that the therapeutic regimen should be individualized according to the availability of basal and prandial insulins and with age, body weight, pubertal stage, lifestyle, individual routine, the duration and stage of diabetes, the aspect of the insulin injection site, physical activity, complications and eating habits of each patient. Prescription involves knowledge about the types of insulin, sensitivity factor, insulin to carbohydrate ratio, carbohydrate counting, glycemic self-monitoring and insulin management during physical activity and stressful situations.

R3

In PWT1D, intensive treatment with basal-bolus insulin therapy, through MDI or CSII, IS RECOMMENDED.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^faebf602]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Therefore, 3 multiple linear regression models were fitted by using as outcome the delta time in ranges and as regressors M and SD. The resulting models are:

The coefficient of determination R 2 is equal to 0.982 for the model described by equation (10), 0.987 for the one described by equation (11) and 0.970 for the model with equation (12). The obtained R 2, very close to 1, confirm that a linear technique is appropriate for such data.

Such formulas permit us to quantify how much time in ranges change (compared to the reference case) in response to different levels of systematic and random carb-counting errors. For example, considering equation (10), we can deduce that a carb-counting error with mean of −5% and SD of 10% leads to a ∆TIR equal to −1.75%. This means that TIR decreases of 1.75% compared to the value of TIR which we would have in the reference case, that is, in absence of carb-counting error (M = 0, SD = 0). For the same value of error mean but increasing the SD to 50%, we obtain a ∆TIR of −4.55%, that is, a TIR deterioration of 4.55% compared to the reference case.

Bidimensional maps of the mean among the 100 virtual subjects of ΔTIR (at left), ΔTAR (in the middle) and ΔTBR (at right), for all combinations of carb-counting error mean and SD tested. In each map, the x-axis represents error SD, while the y-axis the error mean. Each color represents a different quantitative value of the metric, reported by the legends on the right of each map.

The mean among the 100 virtual subjects of the delta time in ranges is plotted in Figure 5 for different values of carb-counting error mean (panels A, B, and C) and SD (panels D, E, and F). Looking at the plots of Figure 5, we notice that while the starting point of each curve is different, depending either on the error mean or on its standard deviation, the plots present a similar linear trend, with a different rate of change for the different time in ranges.

Figure 5.
Plot of the mean difference in time in ranges among the 100 virtual subjects. The mean of ∆TIR, ∆TAR and ∆TBR by varying the carb-counting error SD and for different carb-counting error mean values is reported in panels A, B, and C, respectively (figures legend is reported in panel A). The mean of ∆TIR, ∆TAR, and ∆TBR by varying the carb-counting error mean and for different carb-counting error SD values is reported in panels D, E, and F, respectively (figures legend is reported in panel D).

This suggests that the use of a linear technique to model the relationship which links the carb-counting error mean M and standard deviation SD to variations of time in ranges may be appropriate.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting on glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes [^0c0ced45]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

To determine the unique contributions of carbohydrate counting accuracy and precision to glycemic control, we performed a multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, type 1 diabetes duration, and frequency of blood glucose monitoring. For this analysis, accuracy wasdefined by estimates within 20% of calculated intake and precision was defined by values less than the 75th percentile. In a significant model (R 2 = 0.25, P = 0.007), lower A1C was associated with precision (B = −0.77 [95% CI −0.10 to −1.44]; P = 0.02) and more frequent blood glucose monitoring (B = −0.24 [−0.01 to −0.48]; P = 0.04), but not accuracy (B = −0.04 [−0.63 to 0.55]; P = 0.9). Precision with carbohydrate counting explained 7% of the variance in A1C in the model.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to dietary modifications (eating patterns), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider reducing overall carbohydrate intake to improve glycemia in adult patients with diabetes, as this approach may be applied to different eating patterns meeting individual needs and preferences.

### Effects of carbohydrate counting on glucose control and quality of life over 24 weeks in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a randomized, prospective clinical trial (GIOCAR) [^6bcfecb7]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Few studies have assessed the efficacy of carbohydrate counting in type 1 diabetes, and none have validated its efficacy in patients who are treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The aim of our study was to test the effect of carbohydrate counting on glycemic control and quality of life in adult patients with type 1 diabetes who are receiving CSII.

Research Design and Methods

Sixty-one adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII were randomly assigned to either learning carbohydrate counting (intervention) or estimating pre-meal insulin dose in the usual empirical way (control). At baseline and 12 and 24 weeks, we measured HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose, BMI, waist circumference, recorded daily insulin dose, and capillary glucose data, and administered the Diabetes-Specific Quality-of-Life Scale (DSQOLS) questionnaire.

Results

Intention-to-treat analysis showed improvement of the DSQOLS score related to diet restrictions (week 24 - baseline difference, P = 0.008) and reduction of BMI (P = 0.003) and waist circumference (P = 0.002) in the intervention group compared with control subjects. No changes in HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose, daily insulin dose, and hypoglycemic episodes (< 2.8 mmol/L) were observed. Per-protocol analysis, including only patients who continuously used carbohydrate counting and CSII during the study, confirmed improvement of the DSQOLS score and reduction of BMI and waist circumference, and showed a significant reduction of HbA(1c) (-0.35% vs. control subjects, P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Among adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII, carbohydrate counting is safe and improves quality of life, reduces BMI and waist circumference, and, in per-protocol analysis, reduces HbA(1c).

### Type 1 diabetes structured education: what are the core self-management behaviours? [^2ff678da]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Study aims were to (1) describe and compare the way diabetes structured education courses have evolved in the UK, (2) identify and agree components of course curricula perceived as core across courses and (3) identify and classify self-care behaviours in order to develop a questionnaire assessment tool.

Methods

Structured education courses were selected through the Type 1 diabetes education network. Curricula from five courses were examined and nine educators from those courses were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed using framework analysis. Fourteen key stakeholders attended a consensus meeting, to identify and classify Type 1 diabetes self-care behaviours.

Results

Eighty-three courses were identified. Components of course curricula perceived as core by all diabetes educators were: carbohydrate counting and insulin dose adjustment, hypoglycaemia management, group work, goal setting and empowerment, confidence and control. The broad areas of self-management behaviour identified at the consensus meeting were carbohydrate counting and awareness, insulin dose adjustment, self-monitoring of blood glucose, managing hypoglycaemia, managing equipment and injection sites; and accessing health care. Specific self-care behaviours within each area were identified.

Conclusions

Planned future work will develop an updated questionnaire tool to access self-care behaviours. This will enable assessment of the effectiveness of existing structured education programmes at producing desired changes in behaviour. It will also help people with diabetes and their healthcare team identify areas where additional support is needed to initiate or maintain changes in behaviour. Provision of such support may improve glycaemia and reduce diabetes-related complications and severe hypoglycaemia.

In particular, the BG peak level (panel A), BG level at 120min after the mealtime (panel B), peak time from mealtime (panel E), AUC in hyperglycemia (panel C) and AUC in hypoglycemia (panel D) are reported. Red zones are the ones in which the metrics are worse than for the reference case, while the green zones are the ones in which the metrics are better than for the reference case. In each boxplot, the red horizontal line represents the median, the blue box marks the interquartile range, dashed lines are the whiskers, and red crosses indicate outliers. Whiskers are drawn from the ends of the interquartile range to the adjacent values, which are the most extreme data values that are not outliers. By default, an outlier is a value that is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range away from the top or bottom of the box.

Multi-Meal Analysis

Sensitivity to carb-counting error in the multi-meal scenario

Panels A, B and C of Figure 3 report the boxplots of the delta time in ranges metrics (∆, ∆and ∆) for the 100 virtual subjects, by varying the mean carb-counting error and fixing the standard deviation to 0. In this way, we can investigate the impact of a systematic error in carb-counting on the time in ranges metrics in the absence of random error. For the majority of subjects, systematic underestimations of meal CHO content (ie, error mean equal to −5% and −10%) lead to higher TAR and lower TIR than the reference case, as visible in panels B and A, respectively. Instead, systematic overestimations (ie, error mean equal to +5% and +10%) lead to more TIR (panel A) at the expense of an increase TBR (panel C) in most of subjects.

### Simplifying carb counting: a randomized controlled study-feasibility and efficacy of an individualized, simple, patient-centred carb counting tool [^85a7dacc]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

In large measure, the research into T1DM treatment is focused on advanced technologies including insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring, the artificial pancreas and various applications to support CC and diabetes management. Studies have shownthat although advanced applications are accessible and improve glycaemic control, only a small percentage of the population with T1DM chooses to use them. This may be explained by the human factor, that is, personal expectations, perceptions of the burden of new technologies, user‐friendliness and long‐term cost. The SCC tool tested in this study has the potential to apply to all diabetes patients, and in particular to those who are uncomfortable with the use of advanced technology, or who do not have access to such technology.

In conclusion this study presents a simple, feasible, low‐tech tool that simplifies carbohydrate counting and which promotes and enables accurate insulin dosing in people with T1DM. Additional studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

Carb-counting error generation

In the generated multi-meal scenario, 2 components of the carb-counting error were investigated: the systematic error and the random error. For this reason, the signed relative error, expressed as percentage of the CHO amount in the meal, was generated by using a Gaussian distribution:

where the mean M accounts for the systematic error committed by the subject, while the standard deviation SD reflects the random error.

Different signs and magnitudes of error were tested by using different mean and standard deviation values. In particular, we tested mean values of ± 10%, ± 5%, and 0%, where a negative error sign meant meal CHO underestimation, while a positive sign indicated meal CHO overestimation. For each of the mean values, we tested different values of the standard deviation, which were 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. Such values of error parameters have been suggested by the analysis of real data published by Brazeau et al, in which the error mean for the 50 subjects involved in the study (expressed as mean ± standard deviation) was −7.64% ± 10.18%, while the subjects error standard deviation was 18.10% ± 9.19%.

Moreover, each of the Gaussian distributions was truncated at −100%, which means a CHO estimate of 0g, and +100%, which means a CHO estimate of twice the real meal amount, in order to avoid unrealistic realizations of the carb-counting error.

The case of 0% mean, accounting for the absence of systematic error, and 0% standard deviation, which means that no random error is present, was considered as the reference value:

Glucose metrics

From the 100 subjects' glycemic profiles obtained, the following metrics were computed: Time In target Range (TIR), that is, the percentage of BG values between 70 and 180mg/dl; Time Above Range (TAR), that is, the percentage of BG values greater than 180mg/dl; Time Below Range (TBR), that is, the percentage of BG values lower than 70mg/dl.

Moreover, the delta time in ranges compared to the reference case, that is, ∆, ∆and ∆, were also computed. For example, the ∆when the carb-counting error mean M is equal to m and the carb-counting error standard deviation SD is equal to sd was defined as:

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^72c0d59a]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D), systematic and random errors in carb-counting can have an adverse effect on glycemic control. In this study, we performed an in silico trial aiming at quantifying the impact of different levels of carb-counting error on glycemic control.

Methods

The T1D patient decision simulator was used to simulate 7-day glycemic profiles of 100 adults using open-loop therapy. The simulation was repeated for different values of systematic and random carb-counting errors, generated with Gaussian distribution varying the error mean from -10% to +10% and standard deviation (SD) from 0% to 50%. The effect of the error was evaluated by computing the difference of time inside (∆TIR), above (∆TAR) and below (∆TBR) the target glycemic range (70-180mg/dl) compared to the reference case, that is, absence of error. Finally, 3 linear regression models were developed to mathematically describe how error mean and SD variations result in ∆TIR, ∆TAR, and ∆TBR changes.

Results

Random errors globally deteriorate the glycemic control; systematic underestimations lead to, on average, up to 5.2% more TAR than the reference case, while systematic overestimation results in up to 0.8% more TBR. The different time in range metrics were linearly related with error mean and SD (R 2 > 0.95), with slopes of < mml:math xmlns:mml = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" > < mml:mrow > < mml:msub > < mml:mi > β < /mml:mi > < mml:mrow > < mml:mi > M < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > E < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > A < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > N < /mml:mi > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:msub > < mml:mo ≥ < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 0 < /mml:mn > < mml:mo >. < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 21 < /mml:mn > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:math >, < mml:math xmlns:mml = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" > < mml:mrow > < mml:msub > < mml:mi > β < /mml:mi > < mml:mrow > < mml:mi > S < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > D < /mml:mi > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:msub > < mml:mo ≥ < /mml:mo > < mml:mo > - < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 0 < /mml:mn > < mml:mo >. < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 07 < /mml:mn > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:math > for ∆TIR, < mml:math xmlns:mml = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" > < mml:mrow > < mml:msub > < mml:mi > β < /mml:mi > < mml:mrow > < mml:mi > M < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > E < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > A < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > N < /mml:mi > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:msub > < mml:mo ≥ < /mml:mo > < mml:mo > - < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 0 < /mml:mn > < mml:mo >. < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 25 < /mml:mn > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:math >, < mml:math xmlns:mml = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" > < mml:mrow > < mml:msub > < mml:mi > β < /mml:mi > < mml:mrow > < mml:mi > S < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > D < /mml:mi > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:msub > < mml:mo ≥ < /mml:mo > < mml:mo > + < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 0 < /mml:mn > < mml:mo >. < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 06 < /mml:mn > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:math > for ∆TAR, and < mml:math xmlns:mml = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" > < mml:mrow > < mml:msub > < mml:mi > β < /mml:mi > < mml:mrow > < mml:mi > M < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > E < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > A < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > N < /mml:mi > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:msub > < mml:mo ≥ < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 0 < /mml:mn > < mml:mo >. < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 05 < /mml:mn > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:math >, < mml:math xmlns:mml = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" > < mml:mrow > < mml:msub > < mml:mi > β < /mml:mi > < mml:mrow > < mml:mi > S < /mml:mi > < mml:mi > D < /mml:mi > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:msub > < mml:mo ≥ < /mml:mo > < mml:mo > + < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 0 < /mml:mn > < mml:mo >. < /mml:mo > < mml:mn > 01 < /mml:mn > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:math > for ∆TBR.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^cdf07d10]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — nutrition therapy recommendations include that individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is recommended for youth with type 1 diabetes as an essential component of the overall treatment plan; monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, is a key component to optimizing glycemic management; advise youth and caregivers to strive for an eating pattern emphasizing nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, fish and other lean protein, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and low-fat dairy products, and minimize consumption of red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, refined grains, and processed foods; meal composition impacts postprandial glucose excursions and education on the impact of high-fat and high-protein meals and the adjustment of insulin dosing is necessary; and strongly advise comprehensive nutrition education at diagnosis, and at least annually as needed, by an experienced registered dietitian nutritionist to assess the eating pattern in relation to weight status, age-appropriate growth, and cardiovascular disease risk factors.

### Effect of the carbohydrate counting method on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes [^5aa05087]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The importance of achieving and maintaining an appropriate metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) has been established in many studies aiming to prevent the development of chronic complications. The carbohydrate counting method can be recommended as an additional tool in the nutritional treatment of diabetes, allowing patients with DM1 to have more flexible food choices. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of nutrition intervention and the use of multiple short-acting insulin according to the carbohydrate counting method on clinical and metabolic control in patients with DM1.

Methods

Our sample consisted of 51 patients with DM1, 32 females, aged 25.3 ± 1.55 years. A protocol of nutritional status evaluation was applied and laboratory analysis was performed at baseline and after a three-month intervention. After the analysis of the food records, a balanced diet was prescribed using the carbohydrate counting method, and short-acting insulin was prescribed based on the total amount of carbohydrate per meal (1 unit per 15 g of carbohydrate).

Results

A significant decrease in A1c levels was observed from baseline to the three-month evaluation after the intervention (10.40 ± 0.33% and 9.52 ± 0.32%, respectively, p = 0.000). It was observed an increase in daily insulin dose after the intervention (0.99 ± 0.65 IU/Kg and 1.05 ± 0.05 IU/Kg, respectively, p = 0.003). No significant differences were found regarding anthropometric evaluation (BMI, waist, hip or abdominal circumferences and waist to hip ratio) after the intervention period.

Conclusions

The use of short-acting insulin based on the carbohydrate counting method after a short period of time resulted in a significant improvement of the glycemic control in patients with DM1 with no changes in body weight despite increases in the total daily insulin doses.

### Pharmacists' role in improving diabetes medication management [^29d01de7]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Today there are significant gaps between reaching the goal of "optimal medication therapy" and the current state of medication use in the United States. Pharmacists are highly accessible and well-trained — yet often underutilized — key health care professionals who can move us closer toward achieving better medication therapy outcomes for patients. Diabetes medication management programs led by pharmacists are described. This is consistent with the "medical home" concept of care that promotes primary care providers working collaboratively to coordinate patient-centered care. Pharmacists utilize their clinical expertise in monitoring and managing diabetes medication plans to positively impact health outcomes and empower patients to actively manage their health. In addition, pharmacists can serve as a resource to other health care providers and payers to assure safe, appropriate, cost-effective diabetes medication use.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^38dd47bd]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

While errors in carbohydrate-counting are recognized as most common reasons for glycemic excursions in people with T1D, there are few data that can quantify their impact on glycemic indices. In this work, we filled this gap by analyzing the data of an in-silico trial performed by using the T1D-PDS. Firstly, the postprandial glucose excursions of 100 virtual subjects after a meal of 60-grams of CHO were simulated for different levels of the carb-counting error in an ideal, disturbance-free scenario, to focus on the impact of the carb-counting error without any other correction actions which could influence the profiles. Differently from other previous studies, in this work a wider range of variation of the error (from ± 10% to ± 50% of the meal CHO amount) were investigated. Then, the impact of different carb-counting error levels on time in ranges (TIR, TAR, TBR) was evaluated by simulating 100 subjects for 7-days, repeating the simulation with the same surrounding conditions for different levels of the systematic (from −10% to +10%) and the random (from 0% to 50%) carb-counting error. We found that random errors globally deteriorate the glycemic control; systematic underestimation leads to an increase of TAR of up to 5.2% compared to the reference case, while systematic overestimation increases the TBR of up to 0.8% compared to the reference case. Finally, by using the generated multi-meal simulated data, we developed 3 linear formulas which put the difference in TIR, TAR, and TBR compared to the reference case (which corresponds to the absence of carb-counting error) in relation with systematic and random carb-counting errors. These formulas permit, assuming an open-loop therapy scenario, quantification of the impact of different levels of systematic and random carb-counting error on the time in ranges.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^b15aa8de]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Some studies attempted to quantify the impact of carb-counting error on T1D patients glycemic control, showing that CHO underestimation can cause postprandial hyperglycemia, while CHO overestimation can lead to hypoglycemic episodes. - Moreover, Smart et alfound that an error of ± 10g per meal or snack on a meal size of 60g did not significantly deteriorate the postprandial control, while a ± 20g error had a significant impact on postprandial glycemia.

Although errors in carb-counting can be mitigated by the adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems, these systems are still used by only a fraction of people with T1D. A precise quantification of the impact of carb-counting errors on glycemic control in a real-life setting would be desirable. An intrinsic limitation of the existing studies lies in the difficulty to isolate the contribution of a single factor, the carb-counting error, from the contribution of many other factors that affect the daily glycemic profile of T1D subjects (eg, insulin sensitivity variability, amount and time of meals, physical activity and others). This limitation can be overcome by performing in silico trials, in which the impact of each factor can be isolated by performing multiple simulations in which a single factor is changed and all the other factors are fixed. A suitable tool for this purpose is the T1D patient decision simulator (T1D-PDS), based on the well-known FDA-approved UVA/Padova T1D physiological model, a simulation tool that allows performing in silico trials in T1D and was shown to reproduce realistic treatment scenarios.

4.1 Limitations

The intervention tool was introduced at a single diabetes clinic in a tertiary teaching hospital with one registered dietitian/diabetes care and education specialist. The method was not tested on paediatric patients, a population that has more difficulties with glycaemic control than others. A larger population of people from the lower socio‐economic and more culturally diverse backgrounds should be studied in order to corroborate the results and establish generalizability across populations.

### Impact of carbohydrate counting error on glycemic control in open-loop management of type 1 diabetes: quantitative assessment through an in silico trial [^3c12d10b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Single-Meal Analysis

Simulation scenario

The T1D-PDShas been used to simulate a population of 100 virtual adults undergoing multiple single-meal scenarios in a disturbance-free environment in which the meal insulin dose is calculated using the CGM value at mealtime, the therapy parameters (basal insulin injection rate in the pump, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio CR, correction factor CF) are set to their optimal value, post-prandial correction boluses and hypo-treatments as well as the time-variability of insulin sensitivity are switched-off.

In each single-meal scenario, for each virtual subject, the simulation starts at 6:00, a meal with 60g of CHO is generated at 8:00, and the respective meal insulin bolus dose is calculated as:

The carb-count, is defined as a perturbation of the true CHO amount:

whererepresents the signed relative carb-counting error. Different values forare tested, as described in the following section, while maintaining the same surrounding conditions. In the 2hours before the meal, BG levels, expressed as mean ± standard deviation, are 119.59 ± 6.68mg/dl.

This kind of scenario permits us to focus on the impact that the carb-counting error has on the post-prandial glucose control, eliminating any confounding factors.

Carb-counting error generation

In each simulation, a fixed value of the carb-counting error is simulated, equal for all the subjects. Based on the analysis of real data published in Brazeau et al, we tested values of the signed relative errorequal to ± 50%, ± 40%, ± 30%, ± 20%, ± 10% and 0%, which, for the meal of 60g considered, correspond to signed absolute errors of ± 30g, ± 24g, ± 18g, ± 12g, ± 6g, and 0g, respectively.

The absence of carb-counting error, that is, when the carb-count is exactly equal to the real meal CHO amount, represents the reference case for the problem under study.

### Prospective independent evaluation of the carbohydrate counting accuracy of two smartphone applications [^6d995d08]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The gold standard treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is intensified insulin therapy, whether by multiple daily injections (MDI) or by continuous subcutaneous insulin injection (CSII), and preferably using insulin analogs in order to reduce hypoglycemic events. In addition, T1D patients should be trained in how to match prandial insulin doses to carbohydrate intake, premeal blood glucose, and anticipated physical activity. These skills are taught to patients at the onset of their diabetes or later in the course of their disease. The term "carbohydrate counting" or "carb counting" is widely used for describing the educational meal-planning tool based on meal carbohydrate recognition and quantification. For patients using CSII, the bolus wizard — an advanced pump function — can be used to facilitate insulin dose tuning based on carb quantity and premeal blood glucose levels. However, even with such an integrated tool, realizing the high carb counting accuracy needed to achieve good postprandial glucose control remains a challenge. Despite several methods and reference booklets that have been developed by diabetes care teams, carb counting is often inaccurate, and can even be skipped by patients. Several smartphone applications to help patients with carb counting have been developed over the last decade. However, there is virtually no available literature evaluating the clinical impact of these smartphone applications and their accuracy in quantifying carbohydrates. Our aim in this study was to perform an independent bicentric evaluation of the accuracy of carb counting by two smartphone applications, one relying on the manual entry of carbohydrates with the help of a photo gallery (Glucicheck ®) and the other using automated photography recognition technology (Foodvisor ®).

### Accurate carbohydrate counting is an important determinant of postprandial glycemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy [^b4de0b6f]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Carbohydrate (CHO) counting is a key nutritional intervention utilized in the management of diabetes to optimize postprandial glycemia. The aim of the study was to examine the impact of accuracy of CHO counting on the postprandial glucose in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy.

Methods

Children/adolescents with type 1 diabetes who were on insulin pump therapy for a minimum of 6 months are enrolled in the study. Patients were instructed to record details of meals consumed, estimated CHO count per meal, and 2-hour postprandial glucose readings over 3–5 days. Meals' CHO contents were recounted by an experienced clinical dietician, and those within 20% of the dietician's counting were considered accurate.

Results

A total of 30 patients (21 females) were enrolled. Age range (median) was 8–18 (SD 13) years. Data of 247 meals were analyzed. A total of 165 (67%) meals' CHO contents were accurately counted. Of those, 90 meals (55%) had in-target postprandial glucose (P < .000). There was an inverse relationship between inaccurate CHO estimates and postprandial glucose. Of the 63 underestimated meals, 55 had above-target glucose, while 12 of the 19 overestimated meals were followed by low glucose. There was no association between accuracy and meal size (Spearman's rho = .019).

Conclusion

Accuracy of CHO counting is an important determining factor of postprandial glycemia. However, other factors should be considered when advising on prandial insulin calculation. Underestimation and overestimation of CHO result in postprandial hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively. Accuracy does not correlate with meal size.

### Use of an automated bolus calculator in MDI-treated type 1 diabetes: the bolusCal study, a randomized controlled pilot study [^a01dbdc6]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of flexible intensive insulin therapy (FIIT) and an automated bolus calculator (ABC) in a Danish type 1 diabetes population treated with multiple daily injections. Furthermore, to test the feasibility of teaching FIIT in a 3-h structured course.

Research Design and Methods

The BolusCal Study was a 16-week randomized, controlled, open-label, three-arm parallel, clinical study of 51 adults with type 1 diabetes. Patients aged 18–65 years in poor metabolic control (HbA(1c) 8.0–10.5%) were randomized to the Control (n = 8), CarbCount (n = 21), or CarbCountABC (n = 22) arm. During a 3-h group teaching, the Control arm received FIIT education excluding carbohydrate counting. CarbCount patients were taught FIIT and how to count carbohydrates. CarbCountABC group teaching included FIIT and carbohydrate counting and patients were provided with an ABC.

Results

At 16 weeks, the within-group change in HbA(1c) was -0.1% (95% CI -1.0 to 0.7%; P = 0.730) in the Control arm, -0.8% (-1.3 to -0.3%; P = 0.002) in the CarbCount arm, and -0.7% (-1.0 to -0.4%; P < 0.0001) in the CarbCountABC arm. The difference in change in HbA(1c) between CarbCount and CarbCountABC was insignificant. Adjusting for baseline HbA(1c) in a regression model, the relative change in HbA(1c) was -0.6% (-1.2 to 0.1%; P = 0.082) in CarbCount and -0.8% (-1.4 to -0.1%; P = 0.017) in CarbCountABC. Treatment satisfaction measured by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (status version) improved in all study arms, but the improvement was significantly greater in CarbCountABC.

Conclusions

FIIT and carbohydrate counting were successfully taught in 3 h and improved metabolic control and treatment satisfaction. Concurrent use of an ABC improved treatment satisfaction further.

### Rapid-acting and regular insulin are equal for high fat-protein meal in individuals with type 1 diabetes treated with multiple daily injections [^e036d76e]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Meal carbohydrate counting is widely used in individuals with type 1 diabetes on functional intensive insulin therapy treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen by means of multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by insulin pumps. Advanced carbohydrate counting is recommended by official guidelines for type 1 diabetes treatment. The prandial dose of rapid-acting insulin is based on the amount of carbohydrates in the meal to be consumed (in grams or carbohydrate exchangers) and an individualized insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR, units/g). In clinical practice, the meal carbohydrate amount is usually regarded as the most important determinant of the acute postprandial blood glucose level. Glycemia typically peaks within 60–90 min following a carbohydrate-based meal.

Recent studies have shown that the fat and/or protein content can impact late postprandial glycemia, and the effect of both nutrients is additive. After a meal high in protein and fat added to a constant amount of carbohydrate, the peak of glycemia is similar in time but accentuated, and prolonged glucose excursions are observed from 3 to 6 h after the meal. These findings point to the need for prolonging insulin delivery with or without an increase in total mealtime insulin dosage. The latest American Diabetes Association recommendations suggest that selected subjects with type 1 diabetes who have mastered carbohydrate counting should be educated on the impact of fat and protein on the glycemic profile.

All described strategies of combined carbohydrate, fat and protein counting and application of prolonged insulin boluses for mixed meals are appropriate for patients on CSII. Until now, there has been no attempt to solve the problem of adjustment of insulin for a meal with increased fat and protein content in patients treated with MDI who constitute the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes. The proposed but not verified methods for high-fat/high-protein meals in this group of patients are to inject an additional dose of rapid-acting insulin 1 h after the meal or to cover the meal with regular insulin.

The main aim of study was to check if regular human insulin, which has a slightly later peak but also a longer total duration of activity, administered before a high-fat-protein meal, would give lower and more stable glycemia than a rapid-acting insulin analog used routinely in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with flexible MDI therapy. The additional aim was to evaluate whether the ICRs calculated in real life (typically for mixed meals) may lead to hypo- or hyperglycemia when used for carbohydrate or high-fat/protein meals.

### Simplifying carb counting: a randomized controlled study-feasibility and efficacy of an individualized, simple, patient-centred carb counting tool [^02590fb3]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to introduce and test a simple, individualized carbohydrate counting tool designed for persons with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in order to determine whether the tool improved A1C levels for participants with age, education or language barriers.

Methods

In a randomized controlled trial, 85 participants were offered six diabetes instructional sessions free of charge over a six‐month period. Forty‐one received guidance using the regular carbohydrate counting (RCC) method. Forty‐four received guidance using an individualized 'Simple Carb Counting' (SCC), involving two customized tables prepared for participants.

Results

The simple, individualized SCC tool for carbohydrate counting was non‐inferior to the standard method of RCC. The SCC tool was more effective among participants aged 40 and older, while no differences were found when comparing participants by education level. Irrespective of intervention group, all participants improved their A1C level (9.9% = 13.2 mmol/L vs 8.6% = 11.1 mmol/L, p = .001). A greater improvement in A1C level was seen in newly diagnosed participants (−6.1 vs −0.7, p = .005, −3.4 vs 0.9, p = .032) in both the RCC and SCC groups. All participants expressed improved emotional level per their PAID5 questionnaires (Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale‐PAID), (10.6 (± 5.7) vs 9.5 (± 5.7), p = .023), with women reporting greater improvement than men.

Conclusions

SCC is a simple, individualized, feasible, low‐tech tool for carbohydrate counting, which promotes and enables accurate insulin dosing in people with T1DM. It was found more effective among participants aged 40 and older. Additional studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

### Effect of carbohydrate counting and medical nutritional therapy on glycaemic control in type 1 diabetic subjects: a pilot study [^35146f34]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The effect of a balanced, carbohydrate-counting diet on glycaemic control in Type 1 diabetic subjects is unclear. Our aim was to determine its effect in a small, pilot trial.

Methods

We randomized 256 Type 1 diabetic subjects to a Nutritional Education Programme (group A) or not (group B). Weight, body mass index, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, urate, creatinine, microalbuminuria and daily insulin requirements were measured at baseline and at the end of the study (9 months). During the study, the number of hypoglycaemic events (blood glucose < 3.9 mmol/l) was also measured.

Results

Compared with group B, group A showed: (i) a reduction in HbA1c (group A: 7.8 ± 1.3–7.4 ± 0.9%; group B: 7.5 ± 0.8–7.5 ± 1.1%; P < 0.01); (ii) less hypoglycaemic events (4% vs. 7%; P < 0.05); (iii) a reduction in dose of rapid insulin analogues (23.5 ± 10.9 vs. 27.7 ± 17.1 IU/24 h; P = 0.03). No other between-group changes were observed.

Conclusions

This study shows the importance of medical nutritional therapy on glycaemic control in Type 1 diabetic subjects.

### Effects of nutrition education using a food-based approach, carbohydrate counting or routine care in type 1 diabetes: 12 months prospective randomized trial [^e9c0e8e4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Evidence on the effects of structured nutrition education is weak in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) with moderately impaired glycemic control. Objective was to compare the effects of different types of nutrition education programs on glycemic control, cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life, diet quality and food choices in T1D.

Research Design and Methods

A 12 months randomized controlled study conducted at nine diabetes specialist centers with three parallel arms: (i) a food-based approach (FBA) including foods with low glycemic index or (ii) carbohydrate counting (CC) according to today's standard practice or (iii) individual sessions according to routine care (RC). The primary end point was difference in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between groups at 12 months.

Results

159 patients were randomized (FBA: 51; CC: 52; RC: 55). Mean (SD) age 48.6 (12.0) years, 57.9% females and mean (SD) HbA1c level 63.9 (7.9) mmol/mol, 8% (0.7%). After 3 months, HbA1c improved in both FBA and CC compared with RC. However, there were no significant differences at 12 months in HbA1c; FBA versus RC (-0.4 mmol/mol (1.3), 0.04% (0.1%)), CC versus RC (-0.8 mmol/mol (1.2), 0.1% (0.1%)), FBA versus CC (0.4 mmol/mol (0.3), 0.04% (0.01%)). At 12 months, intake of legumes, nuts and vegetables was improved in FBA versus CC and RC. FBA also reported higher intake of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats compared with RC, and dietary fiber, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats compared with CC (all p values < 0.05). There were no differences in blood pressure levels, lipids, body weight or quality of life.

Conclusions

Nutrition education using an FBA, CC or RC is equivalent in terms of HbA1c and cardiovascular risk factors in persons with T1D with moderately impaired glycemic control. An FBA had benefits regarding food choices compared with CC and RC.

### Use of an automated bolus calculator in MDI-treated type 1 diabetes: the bolusCal study, a randomized controlled pilot study [^0399e521]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To investigate the effect of flexible intensive insulin therapy (FIIT) and an automated bolus calculator (ABC) in a Danish type 1 diabetes population treated with multiple daily injections. Furthermore, to test the feasibility of teaching FIIT in a 3-h structured course.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The BolusCal Study was a 16-week randomized, controlled, open-label, three-arm parallel, clinical study of 51 adults with type 1 diabetes. Patients aged 18–65 years in poor metabolic control (HbA 1c 8.0–10.5%) were randomized to the Control (n = 8), CarbCount (n = 21), or CarbCountABC (n = 22) arm. During a 3-h group teaching, the Control arm received FIIT education excluding carbohydrate counting. CarbCount patients were taught FIIT and how to count carbohydrates. CarbCountABC group teaching included FIIT and carbohydrate counting and patients were provided with an ABC.

RESULTS

At 16 weeks, the within-group change in HbA 1c was −0.1% (95% CI −1.0 to 0.7%; P = 0.730) in the Control arm, −0.8% (−1.3 to −0.3%; P = 0.002) in the CarbCount arm, and −0.7% (−1.0 to −0.4%; P < 0.0001) in the CarbCountABC arm. The difference in change in HbA 1c between CarbCount and CarbCountABC was insignificant. Adjusting for baseline HbA 1c in a regression model, the relative change in HbA 1c was −0.6% (−1.2 to 0.1%; P = 0.082) in CarbCount and −0.8% (−1.4 to −0.1%; P = 0.017) in CarbCountABC. Treatment satisfaction measured by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (status version) improved in all study arms, but the improvement was significantly greater in CarbCountABC.

CONCLUSIONS

FIIT and carbohydrate counting were successfully taught in 3 h and improved metabolic control and treatment satisfaction. Concurrent use of an ABC improved treatment satisfaction further.

### Effects of nutrition education using a food-based approach, carbohydrate counting or routine care in type 1 diabetes: 12 months prospective randomized trial [^9e0f1579]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Subjects and methods

This randomized controlled multicenter study was conducted at nine Swedish specialist diabetes centers with two intervention groups and a control group and a follow-up time of 12 months. Enrollment took place between 2013 and 2014. The last subject completed the trial in 2015. Inclusion criteria were T1D diagnosis > 3 years, HbA1c 57–78 mmol/mol (7.4%–9.3%), body mass index (BMI) ≤ 35 kg/m 2, age 20–70 years. Subjects with serious diabetes complications, pregnancy/planning to become pregnant within the next 12 months, participation in CC education groups lasting > 4 hours within the last 2 years and subjects with gluten intolerance or nut allergy were excluded (online supplemental table 1). After having completed the screening process, each center returned the list of screening numbers to the Principal Research Office for a blocked randomization using an electronic generator. Blocked randomization was chosen to enable a balanced number of subjects in the three arms at each center, thereby minimizing risks of center effects. Subjects were allocated to one of three interventions: FBA, CC or RC. The assigned intervention was then placed in individually sealed envelopes, with each subject's screening number printed on the outside, and sent back to the center to be opened and shown to the subject after baseline measurements were finished. A number of subjects (n = 19, 10%) chose not to show up for the baseline measurements and, thus, did not receive their group allocation. These subjects are not included among the cohort of randomized subjects.

Group intervention models

A structured generic intervention model was constructed for both group education programs (CC and FBA). The number of participants was to be ≤ 8 subjects per group. Both interventions lasted 30 hours in total. There were 10 meetings of 3 hours each, which also contained practical home assignments to be conducted in between meetings. During the first 8 weeks, meetings were held weekly. Two follow-up meetings were then held, at 6 and 9 months. Meetings were held from 18:00 to 21:00 hours. Educational materials were provided to the centers by the Principal Research Office. Dietitians and diabetes specialist nurses from each site participated in a 2-day training workshop prior to the onset of the study.

In both the group programs (FBA and CC) and in the individual program (RC), the dietitians and nurses on each center were instructed to cooperate and exchange expertise with each other, as they normally would.

### Simplifying carb counting: a randomized controlled study-feasibility and efficacy of an individualized, simple, patient-centred carb counting tool [^04585ab1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to introduce and test a simple, individualized carbohydrate counting tool designed for persons with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in order to determine whether the tool improved A1C levels for participants with age, education or language barriers.

Methods

In a randomized controlled trial, 85 participants were offered six diabetes instructional sessions free of charge over a six-month period. Forty-one received guidance using the regular carbohydrate counting (RCC) method. Forty-four received guidance using an individualized 'Simple Carb Counting' (SCC), involving two customized tables prepared for participants.

Results

The simple, individualized SCC tool for carbohydrate counting was non-inferior to the standard method of RCC. The SCC tool was more effective among participants aged 40 and older, while no differences were found when comparing participants by education level. Irrespective of intervention group, all participants improved their A1C level (9.9% = 13.2mmol/L vs 8.6% = 11.1mmol/L, p = .001). A greater improvement in A1C level was seen in newly diagnosed participants (-6.1 vs -0.7, p = .005, -3.4 vs 0.9, p = .032) in both the RCC and SCC groups. All participants expressed improved emotional level per their PAID5 questionnaires (Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale-PAID), (10.6 (± 5.7) vs 9.5 (± 5.7), p = .023), with women reporting greater improvement than men.

Conclusions

SCC is a simple, individualized, feasible, low-tech tool for carbohydrate counting, which promotes and enables accurate insulin dosing in people with T1DM. It was found more effective among participants aged 40 and older. Additional studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

Insulin Management for the High Carbohydrate Diet Prevalent in SSA: Experts' Opinion

Dietary habits play an important role in initiating and achieving optimim insulin therapy. In this paper, we have classified the carbohydrate load in the meal as the percentage of the meal consisting of CMT. A very high carbohydrate load is when > 50% of the meal consists of CMT; a high carbohydrate load is when between 25 and 50% of the meal consists of CMT; and a moderate load is when < 25% of the meal consists of CMT. Alternate methods for quantifying total carbohydrate load (both starchy and non-starchy) include counting in 1-g increments, 10-g portions or 15-g exchanges. A meal is considered to be a "full meal" when the carbohydrate content is ≥ 30 g, whereas meals with a carbohydrate content of < 30 g are considered to be snacks.

The selection of the most appropriate insulin regimen (type and timing of the insulin) for an individual is central to efficient diabetes management because good glycaemic control early in the disease is associated with better microvascular outcomes. Guidelines recommend initiating insulin therapy with basal insulin (ADA; American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists) or premixed insulins (IDF) as per clinical judgement. Currently, insulin regimens for the initiation or intensification of therapy are based on subjective decisions as there are no specific guidelines on how to determine what the ideal regimen should be. This is the need of the hour. Based on our collective clinical experience and expertise, we have made some recommendations (Table 3) that will enable healthcare providers to choose the appropriate insulin therapy/regimen depending on the frequency of meals and the carbohydrate content of those meals. The different insulin regimens are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.

### Does sucrose intake affect antropometric variables, glycemia, lipemia and C-reactive protein in subjects with type 1 diabetes? a controlled-trial [^7f84d953]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sucrose is a very attractive source of carbohydrate. The preference for sucrose may be influenced by genetic factors, and others complex behaviors (such as craving, infant exposure, social habits, and personal dietary choices). The effect of sugars on lipid metabolism remains an extremely active area of inquiry because has been shown that high-sugar diets may increase triglycerides levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes, but they do not seem to affect the lipid profile in subjects with type 1 diabetes, if optimal glycemic control is preserved.

Carbohydrate is the major determinant of postprandial glucose levels. The carbohydrate counting is the best method for estimating the grams of carbohydrates in a meal and then calculating the pre-meal insulin dose based on the self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio.

The American Diabetes Association nutrition recommendations state that the meal plans based on carbohydrate counting remains a key strategy to achieve the glycemic control because the adjustment of pre-prandial insulin doses to the amounts of dietary carbohydrates ingested during the subsequent meal resulted in improved in glycemic control, self-management skills, quality of life, and dietary freedom.

However, the basic and advanced carbohydrate counting are the common methods used currently in clinical practice. In the basic method, the subjects are encouraged to eat constant amounts of carbohydrate at meals. This is useful to understand the effect of food, insulin and to identify the portion sizes, considering that one carbohydrate serving have an approximately 15 g of carbohydrates (these information are obtained from exchange lists, internet and from the nutrition facts). In the advanced method, the patients should have a good understanding of carbohydrate counting principles, as well as understanding pattern management and how to use insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios. According to described, the inclusion of sucrose in the dietary plan of individuals with type 1 diabetes is quite appealing and has been a focus of interest, especially after the introduction of the carbohydrate counting methods. However, previous studies suggested that sugar intake may active inflammation pathways and increase circulatory levels of the inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) both in health individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes. However, clinical trials in type 1 diabetes are still lacking.

The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of sucrose intake on anthropometric variables, body composition, lipemia, glycemic control and CRP levels in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

### Smartphone-based technology in diabetes management [^b75046e4]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetes Interactive Diary (DID)

The Diabetes Interactive Diary app incorporates multiple capabilities as an automatic carbohydrate and insulin bolus calculator, an information technology, as well as a telemedicine tool. It allows real-time communication between healthcare professionals and patients via short text messages. Furthermore, it provides a smart wizard for planning a flexible diet and calculating the matching insulin bolus for meals.

In an open-label, multinational, multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted by Rossi et al. in 2013, DID was compared with standard carbohydrate counting practice in terms of metabolic and weight control, quality of life, diabetes education requirements, and treatment satisfaction in a 6-month follow-up. The study included 127 patients with type 1 diabetes (age 36.9 ± 10.5 years; diabetes duration 16.3 ± 9.3 years). HbA1c levels decreased by 0.49 ± 0.11% in the intervention group and 0.48 ± 0.11% in the control group (p = 0.73). It is noteworthy that there was a 86% lower risk of grade 2 hypoglycemia (defined as hypoglycemia requiring third-person assistance) in the intervention group compared to the control group. DID was at least as effective as traditional carbohydrate counting education, allowing dietary freedom to a larger proportion of patients with T1DM. DID is safe, requires less time for education, and is associated with lower weight gain. DID also significantly improved treatment satisfaction and several quality of life aspects.

### Emphasis on carbohydrates may negatively influence dietary patterns in youth with type 1 diabetes [^d589c16e]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Medical nutrition therapy for youth with type 1 diabetes is designed to maintain normal growth and development while optimizing glycemic outcomes. Even the most intensive insulin regimens cannot be successful without careful attention to meal planning. Nutrition education for youth with type 1 diabetes focuses on carbohydrate counting and overall healthful eating. However, recent data demonstrate that youth with diabetes are not meeting established nutrition guidelines.

There remains a need to understand why youth with type 1 diabetes fail to achieve nutrition guidelines. In this study, we explored perceptions of healthful eating provided by youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents and assessed the influence of diabetes management on food choices. Findings could inform future interventions aimed at improving the nutrition of youth with type 1 diabetes.

### Development and validation of the type 1 diabetes nutrition knowledge survey [^40c703b1]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite modern approaches to intensive insulin therapy for the management of type 1 diabetes, dietary management remains at the cornerstone of diabetes treatment. Previous research supports the relevance of dietary adherence to diabetes outcomes. The NKS is a brief, reliable, and easy-to-use measure of nutrition knowledge for youth with type 1 diabetes and their families. The NKS was designed for clinical and research use as a measure of nutrition knowledge.

The NKS is one of the first measures specifically developed for youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents that assesses both general nutrition (e.g. healthful choices and label reading) and diabetes-specific (e.g. carbohydrate counting and glycemic response to foods) nutrition knowledge. Previous nutrition measures for youth with type 1 diabetes have focused primarily on carbohydrate counting. Those measures were used to inform the development of the current measure; however, the NKS was developed to be a broader measure that assesses various aspects of nutrition, which are important for optimal diabetes management. Notably, our findings indicate that both general and diabetes-specific dimensions of parents' nutrition knowledge were associated with glycemic control.

### Dietary fat acutely increases glucose concentrations and insulin requirements in patients with type 1 diabetes: implications for carbohydrate-based bolus dose calculation and intensive diabetes management [^6a8673e3]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Current guidelines for intensive treatment of type 1 diabetes base the mealtime insulin bolus calculation exclusively on carbohydrate counting. There is strong evidence that free fatty acids impair insulin sensitivity. We hypothesized that patients with type 1 diabetes would require more insulin coverage for higher-fat meals than lower-fat meals with identical carbohydrate content.

Research Design and Methods

We used a crossover design comparing two 18-h periods of closed-loop glucose control after high-fat (HF) dinner compared with low-fat (LF) dinner. Each dinner had identical carbohydrate and protein content, but different fat content (60 vs. 10 g).

Results

Seven patients with type 1 diabetes (age, 55 ± 12 years; A1C 7.2 ± 0.8%) successfully completed the protocol. HF dinner required more insulin than LF dinner (12.6 ± 1.9 units vs. 9.0 ± 1.3 units; P = 0.01) and, despite the additional insulin, caused more hyperglycemia (area under the curve > 120 mg/dL = 16,967 ± 2,778 vs. 8,350 ± 1,907 mg/dL⋅min; P < 0001). Carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio for HF dinner was significantly lower (9 ± 2 vs. 13 ± 3 g/unit; P = 0.01). There were marked interindividual differences in the effect of dietary fat on insulin requirements (percent increase significantly correlated with daily insulin requirement; R(2) = 0.64; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

This evidence that dietary fat increases glucose levels and insulin requirements highlights the limitations of the current carbohydrate-based approach to bolus dose calculation. These findings point to the need for alternative insulin dosing algorithms for higher-fat meals and suggest that dietary fat intake is an important nutritional consideration for glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes.

### Reducing the need for carbohydrate counting in type 1 diabetes using closed-loop automated insulin delivery (artificial pancreas) and empagliflozin: a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority, crossover pilot trial [^7ac3fa97]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess whether adding empagliflozin to closed-loop automated insulin delivery could reduce the need for carbohydrate counting in type 1 diabetes (T1D) without worsening glucose control.

Materials and Methods

In an open-label, crossover, non-inferiority trial, 30 adult participants with T1D underwent outpatient automated insulin delivery interventions with three random sequences of prandial insulin strategy days: carbohydrate counting, simple meal announcement (no carbohydrate counting) and no meal announcement. During each sequence of prandial insulin strategies, participants were randomly assigned empagliflozin (25mg/day) or not, and crossed over to the comparator. Mean glucose for carbohydrate counting without empagliflozin (control) was compared with no meal announcement with empagliflozin (in the primary non-inferiority comparison) and simple meal announcement with empagliflozin (in the conditional primary non-inferiority comparison).

Results

Participants were aged 40 ± 15years, had 27 ± 15years diabetes duration and HbA1c of 7.6% ± 0.7% (59 ± 8mmol/mol). The system with no meal announcement and empagliflozin was not non-inferior (and thus reasonably considered inferior) to the control arm (mean glucose 10.0 ± 1.6 vs. 8.5 ± 1.5mmol/L; non-inferiority p = .94), while simple meal announcement and empagliflozin was non-inferior (8.5 ± 1.4mmol/L; non-inferiority p = .003). Use of empagliflozin on the background of automated insulin delivery with carbohydrate counting was associated with lower mean glucose, corresponding to a 14% greater time in the target range. While no ketoacidosis was observed, mean fasting ketones levels were higher on empagliflozin (0.22 ± 0.18 vs. 0.13 ± 0.11mmol/L; p < .001).

Conclusions

Empagliflozin added to automated insulin delivery has the potential to eliminate the need for carbohydrate counting and improves glycaemic control in conjunction with carbohydrate counting, but does not allow for the elimination of meal announcement.

Theme 5: Carbohydrate and carb counting

Carbohydrates are the staple food in Chinese cuisine. Although cooking methods and ingredients are more diversified and harder to predict compared to western food culture, consensus was still reached that, along with insulin, identifying carbohydrates, knowing carb counting and carb-insulin ratio, are fundamental.

'Through understanding how carbohydrates and other ingredients affect blood glucose levels, patients can learn to inject boluses before meals or snacks. If they want to live a less restricted life while keeping stable blood glucose levels, carb counting is a basic skill'.
[H9].

'I heard from other patients about reading food labels, but I still have no idea what to look at. Energy? Carbohydrates? What's the meaning of reading these numbers anyway? I am so afraid of being in the supermarket now, dare not to buy anything'.
[P9].

Theme 6: Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemic events occur to every T1D patients, but not everyone knows the right procedure to handle it. All basic dimensions of hypoglycaemia need to be elucidated.

'In fact, quite a few patients don't realize that they are correcting hypoglycaemia in a wrong way. They need to learn how to treat and prevent hypoglycaemia correctly'.
[H3].

'Besides, we need to let them understand what causes low blood glucose levels'.
[H9].

'I want to know how to reduce hypoglycaemic events'.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^5168191a]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes care in the hospital — medical nutrition therapy emphasizes individualized meal planning and coordination with insulin: The ADA does not endorse any single meal plan or percent of macronutrients, and current nutrition recommendations advise individualization based on treatment goals, physiological parameters, and medication use. Controlled carbohydrate meal plans, where the amount of carbohydrate on each meal tray is calculated, are preferred by many hospitals as they facilitate matching the prandial insulin dose to the amount of carbohydrate given. Orders should indicate coordination of meal delivery with nutritional insulin coverage, as variability creates the possibility of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events. Some hospitals offer "meals on demand", where individuals may order meals from the menu at any time during the day. If the hospital food service supports carbohydrate counting, the option should be made available to people with diabetes counting carbohydrates at home, especially people wearing insulin pumps.
