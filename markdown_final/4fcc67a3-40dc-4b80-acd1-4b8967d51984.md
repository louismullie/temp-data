## Question

what lab precautions are taken when a patient is on ertapenem?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what lab precautions to take when a patient is on ertapenem. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled requirement for periodic organ system monitoring. Then, I should verify which laboratory parameters are most critical to track and how often. Next, I will examine drug–drug interactions that necessitate laboratory monitoring, especially valproic acid. After that, I need to check microbiology stewardship and susceptibility testing considerations. Finally, I will integrate special populations, pediatric nuances, and a practical monitoring cadence, making sure each assertion is supported by labeling or guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the core regulatory guidance. The FDA labeling advises periodic assessment of renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic function during prolonged ertapenem therapy, reflecting a beta-lactam class toxicity profile and the potential for organ-related adverse effects, so baseline and periodic labs are prudent even if the duration is short but especially if therapy extends beyond several days [^113dmseV] [^115atV1c].

> I need to check which laboratory abnormalities are most commonly observed in trials to prioritize what to monitor. Drug-related laboratory adverse experiences reported in at least 2% of adults include ALT increased (6.0%), AST increased (5.2%), alkaline phosphatase increased (3.4%), and platelet count increased (2.8%), with additional signals for increases in serum creatinine, BUN, glucose, bilirubin, PT/PTT, and decreases in potassium, albumin, WBC, and platelets, so a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver panel, CBC with differential, and renal function tests are reasonable to track during therapy [^11474w5J] [^113RcvNc] [^115fro9W].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric-specific lab signals because dosing and clearance differ. In pediatric trials, neutrophil count decreased (3%), ALT increased (2.2%), and AST increased (2.1%) were the most frequent drug-related laboratory adverse experiences, so I need to ensure CBC with differential and liver enzymes are included in pediatric monitoring plans and consider age-related pharmacokinetics when interpreting results [^115fro9W] [^111LxCv7].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions that mandate laboratory surveillance. Ertapenem can markedly reduce valproic acid concentrations, risking breakthrough seizures; therefore, if a patient on valproate requires ertapenem, I should obtain a baseline valproic acid level and recheck within 24–48 hours of initiation, with close clinical seizure surveillance and consideration of alternative antibiotics when feasible [^116oCxyH] [^112t1sCP] [^111aBCHw].

> Wait, let me verify renal considerations because ertapenem is renally cleared and dosing changes with kidney dysfunction. For creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or end-stage renal disease, the dose is reduced to 500 mg once daily, with a supplemental 150 mg dose if administered within 6 hours prior to hemodialysis; for peritoneal dialysis or intermittent hemodialysis, a 50% dose reduction is advised, so I should confirm baseline and serial renal function and align dosing with eGFR and dialysis timing to avoid accumulation and toxicity [^116V6dHf] [^116czsJV] [^1141vV6z] [^114pxJe8] [^112fixNZ].

> I will now examine microbiology stewardship and susceptibility testing, since ertapenem is often used for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. I should confirm that cultures are obtained before starting therapy when clinically feasible and that susceptibility testing is performed using current CLSI breakpoints; importantly, ertapenem is a sensitive screen for some carbapenemases, but definitive carbapenemase detection may require phenotypic (e.g., mCIM/eCIM, Carba NP) or molecular methods, and laboratories may cascade or selectively report based on local policy and stewardship input [^114vcFBh] [^114L58pu] [^116so6eF] [^114MHDBx].

> But wait, what if the isolate is Pseudomonas or another non-fermenter where ertapenem lacks reliable activity. I should double-check organism identification and local antibiograms because ertapenem is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has limited utility against other non-fermenters; in such cases, therapy should be adjusted based on culture and susceptibility results rather than persisting with ertapenem, and rapid organism identification can expedite appropriate narrowing or escalation [^114514dk] [^112TsY6t].

> Let me consider superinfection risks and how labs can support early detection. Prolonged ertapenem therapy can lead to overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms such as Candida or Clostridioides difficile, so I should maintain vigilance for new fever, leukocytosis, or diarrhea and send appropriate cultures or C. difficile testing if symptoms arise, integrating results with clinical context to avoid overcalling colonization as infection [^113dmseV] [^115atV1c] [^112yvqFv].

> Next, I should review a practical monitoring cadence. Baseline labs should include CMP, LFTs, CBC with differential, and renal function; during therapy, reassess at least every 3–5 days in stable patients and more frequently in those with renal impairment, critical illness, or prolonged courses; if valproic acid is co-prescribed, check a valproate level within 24–48 hours of starting ertapenem; at the end of therapy, repeat organ function tests to ensure no delayed toxicity, adjusting for clinical trajectory and comorbidities [^113dmseV] [^115atV1c] [^116oCxyH].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating any test requirement. The FDA label does not mandate a rigid laboratory schedule but advises periodic assessment during prolonged therapy; therefore, the exact cadence should be individualized by severity of illness, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and duration of therapy, with closer monitoring in high-risk patients and those with changing clinical status [^113dmseV] [^115atV1c].

> In summary, I need to ensure a coordinated approach: obtain baseline organ function and hematology, tailor the frequency of lab reassessment to patient risk and treatment duration, proactively monitor valproic acid if applicable, align dosing with renal function and dialysis, and leverage microbiology stewardship to obtain cultures, apply current breakpoints, and pursue carbapenemase testing when indicated, all while watching for superinfection signals that warrant additional diagnostics and therapy modification [^11474w5J] [^116V6dHf] [^114wTf5y] [^113dmseV].

During ertapenem therapy, **monitor renal function (serum creatinine/BUN) at baseline and periodically** [^113dmseV] to detect nephrotoxicity, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving nephrotoxic drugs [^11474w5J]. Check **liver enzymes (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase)** at baseline and during treatment to detect hepatotoxicity [^113RcvNc], and monitor CBC for hematologic changes (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) [^11474w5J]. Given the risk of C. difficile infection, **test for C. difficile if the patient develops diarrhea** [^113a7jpH]. For patients on valproic acid, monitor valproic acid levels because ertapenem can significantly reduce them, increasing seizure risk [^116oCxyH]. These precautions align with FDA guidance to periodically assess renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic function during prolonged therapy [^115atV1c].

---

## Renal function monitoring

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain baseline serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) prior to initiating ertapenem therapy [^114fKY2C].

- **Periodic monitoring**: Monitor renal function periodically during treatment, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications [^113dmseV].

- **Dose adjustment**: Ertapenem is primarily eliminated via renal excretion; dose adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment [^116V6dHf]. For creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², the recommended dose is 500 mg once daily [^116V6dHf]. For patients on hemodialysis, a supplementary dose of 150 mg is recommended if ertapenem is administered within 6 hours prior to dialysis [^116V6dHf].

---

## Hepatic function monitoring

- **Baseline liver function tests**: Obtain baseline liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase) before starting therapy [^notfound].

- **Periodic monitoring**: Monitor liver enzymes periodically during treatment, as elevated liver enzymes have been reported in clinical trials [^11474w5J].

- **Clinical significance**: Elevations in liver enzymes are generally mild to moderate but warrant monitoring, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver conditions [^113dmseV].

---

## Hematologic monitoring

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Monitor CBC regularly to detect hematologic abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia [^113dmseV].

- **Clinical significance**: Hematologic changes are uncommon but have been reported; regular monitoring ensures early detection and management [^113dmseV].

---

## Clostridioides difficile infection monitoring

Maintain a high level of suspicion for **C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD)** during and after treatment with ertapenem [^113NUR1q]. If the patient develops diarrhea, **test for C. difficile** using enzyme immunoassays or molecular methods [^113NUR1q]. CDAD can be severe and life-threatening; prompt detection and management are critical [^notfound].

---

## Drug interaction monitoring

- **Valproic acid interaction**: Ertapenem significantly reduces serum valproic acid concentrations, increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures [^116oCxyH]. Monitor valproic acid levels closely and consider alternative anticonvulsants if necessary [^notfound].

- **Probenecid interaction**: Co-administration with probenecid is not recommended as it increases ertapenem plasma concentrations [^116oCxyH].

---

## Summary of recommended laboratory monitoring

| **Laboratory test** | **Frequency** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum creatinine, BUN | Baseline and periodic | Monitor renal function; adjust dose in renal impairment [^113dmseV] |
| ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase | Baseline and periodic | Monitor hepatotoxicity [^113RcvNc] |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Baseline and periodic | Monitor hematologic abnormalities [^11474w5J] |
| C. difficile test | If diarrhea occurs | Detect CDAD [^113a7jpH] |
| Valproic acid levels | Baseline and periodic if co-administered | Monitor drug interaction; prevent seizures [^116oCxyH] |

---

Laboratory precautions during ertapenem therapy include **monitoring renal and hepatic function**, hematologic parameters, and screening for C. difficile infection. Additionally, **monitor valproic acid levels** due to significant drug interactions. These precautions align with FDA guidance to periodically assess organ system function during prolonged therapy [^115atV1c].

5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of Ertapenem for injection may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Prescribing Ertapenem for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

5.7 Laboratory Tests

While Ertapenem for injection possesses toxicity similar to the beta-lactam group of antibiotics, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, is advisable during prolonged therapy.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adults Receiving Ertapenem for Injection as a Treatment Regimen

Clinical trials enrolled 1954 patients treated with Ertapenem for Injection; in some of the clinical trials, parenteral therapy was followed by a switch to an appropriate oral antimicrobial [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Most adverse experiences reported in these clinical trials were described as mild to moderate in severity. Ertapenem for Injection was discontinued due to adverse experiences in 4.7% of patients. Table 3 shows the incidence of adverse experiences reported in ≥ 2% of patients in these trials. The most common drug-related adverse experiences in patients treated with Ertapenem for Injection, including those who were switched to therapy with an oral antimicrobial, were diarrhea (5.5%), infused vein complication (3.7%), nausea (3.1%), headache (2.2%), and vaginitis in females (2.1%).

In patients treated for complicated intra-abdominal infections, death occurred in 4.7% (15/316) of patients receiving Ertapenem for Injection and 2.6% (8/307) of patients receiving comparator drug. These deaths occurred in patients with significant co-morbidity and/or severe baseline infections. Deaths were considered unrelated to study drugs by investigators.

1.7 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ertapenem for injection and other antibacterial drugs, Ertapenem for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Establishing clinical and laboratory standards institute M45 antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods and breakpoints forother than [^114514dk]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

POPA are intrinsically resistant to several beta-lactam agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and ertapenem) and may develop multidrug-resistant phenotypes that contribute to difficulty in effectively managing infections caused by these pathogens. As such, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is required to guide successful treatment of infections. Furthermore, the acquisition of carbapenemases, more specifically metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), among these organisms indicates its role as a potential reservoir and contributor to further spread of carbapenem-resistance among gram-negative organisms if left undetected.

Currently, the CLSI non-Enterobacterales (nE) breakpoints (BPs) are used to interpret AST results for non-fastidious, glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli without specific BPs, including POPA. There are numerous limitations to using the CLSI nE BPs, including the following: (i) these breakpoints have not been revised since their initial publication, (ii) only minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) BPs are available, and (iii) agents with BPs in the table may be inappropriate for treatment of POPA infections (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Furthermore, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recognize any CLSI nE BPs. Thus, most U.S. laboratories must rely on laboratory-developed tests when performing AST for POPA clinical management. Data supporting the use of commercial or automated AST systems for POPA are limited. Altogether, the limitations of available BPs and AST methodologies present significant uncertainty with regard to the clinical validity of AST results for POPA and raise patient safety concerns. In contrast to the CLSI, The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) has established BPs for Pseudomonas species, which can be applied to both P. aeruginosa and non- aeruginosa species, with the exception of novel beta-lactam combination agents and meropenem meningitis BPs that are limited to P. aeruginosa.

The primary objective of this study was to establish tentative MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for POPA for inclusion in the forthcoming 4th Edition of the CLSI M45 document. The secondary objective was to determine genomic correlates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to evaluate the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) for detection of carbapenemase production among POPA.

(T.E. A. study: three days ertapenem vs three days ampicillin-sulbactam) [^114fKY2C]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Data Collection

Patient data sheets are generated containing demographic figures as well as preoperative, operative, and postoperative information.

Upon enrollment, all patients undergo physical examinations and laboratory tests, (including a CBC with a WBC, differential analysis, platelet count, serum glucose assessment, BUN, and serum creatinine test). The same procedure is performed on the third day of the treatment regimen, at the end of the treatment cycle following the resolution of pathology, and during the post-treatment follow-up analysis (or more frequently as clinically relevant). Liver function studies, serum electrolytes, and urinalysis are performed upon the discontinuation of the intravenously administered antibiotic as well as periodically throughout the treatment process as clinically indicated. When clinically indicated during the course of antibiotic therapy, blood, urine and tissue specimens from clinically relevant intra-abdominal sites are obtained for culture and susceptibility testing. Such cultures are also performed at the end of antibiotic therapy, unless there is no material available for cultures and/or no clinical evidence of infection.

The clinical outcomes of eligible patients are classified in three groups: successful (no signs or symptoms of infection and no further need for antimicrobial therapy); failure (indicating no improvement, infection progression, or death due to infection); or late failure (indicating recurrence between cessation of antibiotic therapy and follow-up). Microbiological reports are recorded for each baseline pathogen. Favorable microbiological responses involve eradication of the pathogen(s), assessed on either a documented or presumptive basis (the latter occurring when there is no material available for culture in clinically recovered patients). By contrast, unfavorable microbiologic responses involve a chronic persistence of the pathogen(s), either on a documented or presumptive basis.

Any and all adverse events (AEs) that occur during the course of the study, beginning from the time of randomization, are carefully documented. These AEs are identified and described by the primary investigators.

Informed Consent or Information Sheet

In the informed consent document, the patient will review all relevant information about the study protocol and the confidentiality of personal data. After signing the informed consent form, the patient will fill out a questionnaire. The patients will experience minimal bureaucratic inconveniences during the enrollment procedure. No incentives are planned for the patients regarding the surgical operation or the follow-up analysis. All of the patients' medical information will remain confidential and will only be accessed by the research scientists conducting the study. The patients are permitted to withdraw from the study at any time without any further commitments or obligations.

### CIM city: the game continues for a better carbapenemase test [^112QA5yM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing agree that carbapenemase testing is not necessary for clinical care, provided that the laboratory is up to date with current breakpoints. Nonetheless, publication on the development and modification of carbapenemase tests continues, as is the case in this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology (R. W. Beresford and M. Maley, J Clin Microbiol 57:e01852–18, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01852-18). This commentary explores modifications to the carbapenem inactivation method-but is this the right focus for clinical laboratories?

### Diagnosis and treatment of extended-spectrum and ampC β-lactamase-producing organisms [^113amgsE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the laboratory diagnosis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and evaluate potential treatment options.

Data Sources

A PubMed search, restricted to English-language articles, was conducted (1966-May 2007) using the search terms ESBL, AmpC, diagnosis, detection, carbapenem, ertapenem, fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin, cefepime, tigecycline, and colistin. Additional references were identified through review of bibliographies of identified articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that evaluated laboratory methods for the detection of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases and/or the treatment of these organisms were reviewed. All articles that were deemed to be clinically pertinent were included and critically evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Numerous laboratory techniques are available for the detection of ESBLs. In contrast, laboratory techniques for detection of AmpC beta-lactamases are limited, particularly for plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Routine microbiologic testing may not detect ESBLs or AmpC beta-lactamases. Optimal antibiotic treatment options are derived from limited observational studies and case reports. Randomized clinical trials evaluating appropriate antibiotic treatment options are lacking. In vitro susceptibility does not always correlate with clinical outcomes. The use of imipenem was associated with the lowest incidence of mortality in patients with bacteremia due to ESBL-producing organisms.

Conclusions

Laboratory detection of ESBLs for most organisms is possible with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-recommended testing. However, these tests can be associated with both false negative and false positive results, particularly with organisms that harbor both ESBL- and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. No established guidelines exist for the detection of AmpC beta-lactamases. Imipenem and meropenem are superior to other antibiotics for the treatment of serious infections due to ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. While in vitro data demonstrate that tigecycline, ertapenem, and colistin might be potential choices, clinical experience is lacking.

Laboratory adverse experiences that were reported during therapy in ≥ 2.0% of adult patients treated with ertapenem for injection in clinical trials are presented in Table 6. Drug-related laboratory adverse experiences that were reported during therapy in ≥ 2.0% of adult patients treated with ertapenem for injection, including those who were switched to therapy with an oral antimicrobial, in clinical trials were ALT increased (6.0%), AST increased (5.2%), serum alkaline phosphatase increased (3.4%), and platelet count increased (2.8%). Ertapenem for injection was discontinued due to laboratory adverse experiences in 0.3% of patients.

Additional laboratory adverse experiences that were reported during therapy in > 0.1% of patients treated with ertapenem for injection in clinical trials include: increases in serum creatinine, serum glucose, BUN, total, direct and indirect serum bilirubin, serum sodium and potassium, PT and PTT; decreases in serum potassium, serum albumin, WBC, platelet count, and segmented neutrophils.

In a clinical trial for the treatment of diabetic foot infections in which 289 adult diabetic patients were treated with ertapenem for injection, the laboratory adverse experience profile was generally similar to that seen in previous clinical trials.

### Is this the carbapenemase test we' ve been waiting for? A multicenter evaluation of the modified carbapenem inactivation method [^116so6eF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

A plethora of phenotypic methods exist for the detection of carbapenemases; however, clinical laboratories have struggled for years with accurate, objective phenotypic detection of carbapenemase activity in Enterobacteriaceae In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, V. M. Pierce et al. (J Clin Microbiol 55:2321–2333, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.00193-17) report on a multicenter evaluation of the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM). The high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and ease of interpretation associated with the mCIM for Enterobacteriaceae will likely lead to its adoption by clinical laboratories.

### Overview of changes in the clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: M100 32nd and 33rd editions [^114wTf5y]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2010, CLSI lowered the Enterobacterales cephalosporin and carbapenem breakpoints, eliminating the requirement to perform specific resistance mechanism identification for ESBLs or carbapenemase producers for laboratories that adopted the lower breakpoints. At the time, the lower breakpoints were considered sufficient to accurately detect wild-type organisms lacking acquired resistance mechanisms. However, with the publication of the MERINO trial data that focused on infections caused by ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacterales and the development of new antimicrobials that target specific mechanisms of resistance, the need to identify the mechanism of certain types of resistance has resurfaced. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated its treatment guidelines to reflect these newer developments and made therapeutic recommendations based on the known presence of a specific resistance mechanism. The M100 33rd edition provides a comment in Table 2A, pointing the laboratory user to consult with ASP when deciding whether to perform phenotypic or genotypic testing for ESBLs to guide therapeutic management. Laboratories may still choose to report ESBLs for infection control or epidemiological purposes but may also report for therapeutic decisions. A similar comment concerning carbapenemase producers was also added to the carbapenem section of M100 Table 2A.

There are several factors that need to be taken into consideration before implementing these new testing and reporting recommendations. One such consideration is whether the laboratory has the workflow and methodology capabilities to assess ESBL and carbapenem resistance mechanisms — either by phenotypic or genotypic methods. False-negative results of phenotypic ESBL testing have been observed due to the coproduction of AmpC beta-lactamases, and false-positive results have occurred among isolates with multiple mechanisms of resistance. Phenotypic testing may require additional setup and incubation times and lead to a longer time to results compared to genotypic testing. Certain tests are limited to select species of Enterobacterales, and laboratories using commercial systems may have additional reporting limitations. One must also consider how to report the resistance mechanism accurately and clearly in the laboratory report so that it conveys the correct message to the clinician treating the patient. It is important to note that CLSI M100 does not include specific treatment recommendations. The IDSA treatment guidelines recommend that piperacillin-tazobactam should not be used for ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacterales, even if the antimicrobial tests are susceptible; however, there is no guidance in the M100 33rd edition that recommends hiding susceptible piperacillin-tazobactam results or changing the interpretation to resistant when an ESBL is detected. These decisions are institution-specific and are to be discussed in collaboration with the laboratory and relevant stakeholders.

### Background and rationale for revised clinical and laboratory standards institute interpretive criteria (breakpoints) for enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa: I. cephalosporins and aztreonam [^1155TXPe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Widespread resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cephalosporin and monobactam antibiotics due to extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) has resulted in the need for reassessment of the interpretative criteria (breakpoints) established for these agents more than 2 decades ago. Following extensive evaluation, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recently adopted and published new breakpoints for these agents for use in clinical laboratories and provided updated recommendations for use of the ESBL screening test. This paper summarizes the background and supportive rationale for new interpretative criteria for cephalosporins and aztreonam for testing Enterobacteriaceae.

### Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae detection practices in California: what are we missing? [^117PMFf8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) revised the carbapenem breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae in 2010. The number of hospitals that adopted revised breakpoints and the clinical impact of delayed adoption has not been explored.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional, voluntary survey of microbiology laboratories from California acute care hospitals and long-term acute care hospitals (LTAC) to determine use of revised CLSI breakpoints. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) clinical isolates from a single tertiary-care hospital from 2013 to 2017 were examined. All isolates with an elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; ≥ 2 µg/mL) to imipenem or meropenem were tested for the presence of carbapenemase genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Results

We received responses from 128 laboratories that serve 264/393 (67%) of hospitals and LTACs. Current CLSI carbapenem breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae were used by 92/128 (72%) laboratories. Among laboratories that used current breakpoints, time to implementation varied from 0 to 68 months (mean, 41 months; median, 55 months). Application of historical breakpoints to isolates with a carbapenemase gene detected by PCR resulted in susceptibility rates of 8.9%, 18.6%, and 18.6% to ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem, respectively. By current breakpoints, < 1% of these isolates were susceptible to ertapenem or imipenem and 2.6% to meropenem.

Conclusion

Clinicians and epidemiologists should be aware that use of outdated MIC breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae remains common and can result in reports of false susceptibility to carbapenems and missed identification of carbapenemase producers. This misclassification could have consequences for patient care and infection control efforts to address carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

### Evaluation of expert rules for carbapenemase class identification inisolates using the VITEK2 susceptibility testing platform [^114QhCGv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

A significant advantage of the AES and bioART rules is that CP-CRE detection and carbapenemase class predictions can be made without incurring additional costs or hands-on testing. The VITEK2 AST system can deliver AST results within 8–12 h and is widely used by clinical laboratories around the world. The only testing requirement for carbapenemase characterization by the AES and bioART rules is to perform AST using routine VITEK2 cards. In this study, the N802 and XN15 cards were tested, as both include antibiotics required for rule predictions. Following customization, the bioART rules may be applied to other card configurations; however, bioMérieux recommends testing ceftazidime-avibactam and either meropenem-vaborbactam or imipenem-relebactam for optimal performance. Depending on card availability, the AST results for temocillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, aztreonam, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, imipenem-relebactam, and meropenem-vaborbactam can potentially be used by the bioART rules for carbapenemase detection. For species with claimed indications, the AES and bioART results are reported with the AST results. However, the utility of these tools for CP-CRE detection and carbapenemase class predictions is limited to laboratories that use multiple VITEK2 cards as part of their workflows. Laboratories may choose to run both cards in parallel or reflex to the XN15 Advanced MDRO Panel or a similar card if resistance is observed. Interpretation of the combined AES and bioART rule reports is a manual process, as they function separately. If implemented, procedures for manual interpretation of the AES and bioART results, along with the calculation and interpretation of MEM/MEV MIC ratios for optimal performance, are necessary (Table S3). The manual process for interpreting the AES and bioART results may pose challenges for routine implementation. Laboratories should also be aware that the bioART rules do not have claimed indications for all Enterobacterales species, including Proteus, Providencia, Morganella, and Citrobacter spp. other than C. freundii complex. Finally, the AES and bioART rules are only designed to detect KPC, MBL, OXA-48-like, and SME carbapenemases. Less common carbapenemase genes may go undetected or be misclassified.

Performance of the VITEK REVEAL assay compared to the reference BMD assay for 200 Gram-negative bacterial organisms from positive blood cultures

Among the Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa isolates showing categorical errors with the VITEK REVEAL assay (see below for details), the corresponding organism/antibiotic combinations included MIC values that were either in EA or not in EA with the reference BMD MIC values. Figure 2a and b illustrate the distribution and direction of MIC deviations for the various organism/antibiotic combinations, emphasizing the proportion and magnitude of non-EA results and their contribution to the observed bias. Most non-EA results clustered in the pink circular area, which includes MIC values that were higher than the corresponding BMD values, with deviations ranging from +1 to +8 log 2 dilutions. The overall upward shift of these deviations suggests a systematic MIC overestimation for certain antibiotics or organisms.

### Epidemiology and diagnostics of carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative bacteria [^114L58pu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTICS

Both the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) annually define the susceptibility breakpoints to commercially available carbapenems, including doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem for gram-negative species, although EUCAST no longer provides doripenem breakpoints. When a strain is found to be nonsusceptible to carbapenems (ie, intermediate or resistant), the mechanism of resistance is still unknown. Thus, to confirm the production of carbapenemases and/or presence of other mechanisms, further biochemical assays and/or gene-based tests must be performed. Determining the mechanism of carbapenem resistance can help in the selection of the most appropriate antibiotic therapy early in the treatment of gram-negative infections. For therapeutic decision making, the rapid turnaround time (defined as 1 day or as short as < 2 hours) would be particularly beneficial in reducing length of hospitalization and/or time spent in the intensive care unit. Both biochemical and molecular technologies are widely available, with endorsement from CLSI, EUCAST, and/or the US Food and Drug Administration.

The biochemical assays include the Carba NP, its derivative Blue Carba, and β Carba tests, which are inexpensive and confirm phenotypically carbapenemase-producing organisms (but not other resistance mechanisms). These methods are based on the expression of any carbapenemase enzyme during bacterial growth in culture (ie, up to 24–48 hours), and use imipenem or meropenem as a substrate, which is then hydrolyzed by the carbapenemase. The colorimetric positive signal may be obtained in < 1 hour (eg, Carba NP) and can be used directly from clinical samples (blood cultures, infected urine). Furthermore, specific inhibitors of carbapenemase activity can be included, such as avibactam, vaborbactam, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Further biochemical assays include the carbapenemase inactivation method, which is also inexpensive, and the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) technology, which may be cost-effective in large centers and hospitals. However, all of these methods described above, besides having some specificity or sensitivity issues, are also unable to identify the exact carbapenemase enzyme and require growth of bacteria.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infection — carbapenem preference and extrapolation: In those with clinical isolates available for retesting, 30-day mortality occurred in 9% vs 4% in the piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem arms, respectively, and although the 95% confidence interval ranged from −1% to 11%, the panel still suggests carbapenem therapy as the preferred treatment of ESBL-producing bloodstream infections. Comparable clinical trial data are not available for ESBL-E infections from other body sites, but the panel suggests extrapolating evidence for ESBL-E bloodstream infections to other common sites of infection, and suggests extending the findings to imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem, with the latter limited to patients with normal serum albumin and patients who are not critically ill.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria include the following: adulthood (> 18 years of age), surgical intervention within 24 hours of diagnosis, localized intra-abdominal infection, acute appendicitis, acute perforated diverticulitis (perforated diverticulitis without fluid collection addressed surgically by means of primary anastomosis), acute cholecystitis, acute gastric and duodenal perforation (> 24 hours), traumatic perforation of the intestine (> 12 hours), secondary peritonitis due to perforated viscera, and intra-abdominal abscesses.

Exclusion criteria include the following: traumatic bowel perforation requiring surgery within 12 hours, perforation of gastrointestinal ulcer requiring surgery within 24 hours, other intra-abdominal diseases in which the primary etiology was unlikely to be infectious, lactation or pregnancy, rapidly progressive or terminal illness, history or presence of severe hepatic or renal disease, concomitant infections that would interfere with the evaluation of responses to the study antibiotics, and history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or any other severe reaction to study antibiotics.

Upon patient enrolment, the severity of disease was evaluated by means of an APACHE II score prior to the operation.

Diagnosis was based on the patient's clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and CT imaging: thereafter it was confirmed by microbial cultures and other intra-operative findings.

Upon enrolment, all patients underwent physical examinations and laboratory tests, which were repeated identically on the third day of the treatment regimen, at the end of the treatment cycle following the resolution of pathology, and during the post-treatment follow-up analysis.

Preoperative percutaneous drainage was not performed, as this procedure is not conducted in emergency settings at our institution.

In all cases, treatment began with a laparoscopic approach and transitioned to open surgery if deemed necessary.

Question 2.2 — Selecting antibiotics for organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: The suggested approach states that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes and that both induction potential and stability to AmpC β-lactamase hydrolysis should be considered when selecting therapy. The rationale notes a spectrum of induction among β-lactams; aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin), narrow-spectrum first-generation cephalosporins, and cephamycins are potent ampC inducers, and both low-risk (S. marcescens) and moderate-risk (E. cloacae) organisms hydrolyze these drugs even at basal ampC expression levels, so such AmpC-E isolates will generally test as resistant. Imipenem is also a potent ampC inducer but generally remains stable to AmpC-E hydrolysis; the induction potential of ertapenem and meropenem has not been formally investigated but, similar to imipenem, they are generally stable to AmpC hydrolysis. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and aztreonam are relatively weak ampC inducers, yet available evidence indicates that their susceptibility to hydrolysis makes them less likely to be effective for infections by organisms at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production.

### Overview of changes in the clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: M100 32nd and 33rd editions [^114vcFBh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Selective reporting refers to the reporting of results for specific antimicrobial agents based on defined criteria that are unrelated to the overall susceptibility profile of the organism. In other words, results are reported based on organism identification, body site source, clinical setting, or patient demographics. An example of selective reporting is withholding aminoglycoside results on Salmonella spp. or Shigella spp. due to their inability to achieve clinical efficacy in vivo. Unlike selective reporting, cascade reporting is based on the results of the overall antimicrobial susceptibility profile of an isolate. When applying cascade reporting, results for secondary or broader spectrum agents are only reported if the isolate is resistant to primary or narrow-spectrum agents in the same or similar antimicrobial class. Cascade reporting can be either within the same tier (e.g. for Tier 2 Table 1A Enterobacterales: if cefepime tests resistant, then the carbapenems would be reported) or between tiers (e.g. for Tier 2 to Tier 3 Table 1A Enterobacterales: if both cefepime and the carbapenems test resistant, then a newer beta-lactam combination agent would be reported). The layout of the tables has changed from a vertical format to a horizontal format. Antimicrobial agents are arranged left to right corresponding to their tiered definitions 1 through 4. The horizontal presentation helps facilitate cascade reporting across the tiers from a narrow-spectrum agent in Tier 1 to a broad-spectrum agent in Tier 3.

Testing and reporting recommendations for multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli

The M100 contains comments throughout the tables, which are mainly intended for clinical laboratorians. These comments highlight potential AST problems and/or add clarification to specific testing issues. The M100 32nd edition included a revision to the beta-lactam combination agent comment for Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacte r spp. Non-Enterobacterales, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and anaerobes. The new comment states, "Organisms that test susceptible to the beta-lactam agent alone are also considered susceptible to the beta-lactam combination agent. However, organisms that test susceptible to the beta-lactam combination agent cannot be assumed to be susceptible to the beta-lactam agent alone". This comment replaced the previous imipenem-relebactam surrogate testing comment that was specific to this agent. The intention of this new comment is to emphasize that predicting susceptibility to the beta-lactam combination agent from the susceptible beta-lactam agent alone applies to all beta-lactam combination agents — not just imipenem-relebactam.

Test result reporting and interpretation

Accurate result interpretation relies on the specialized knowledge of clinical indications for testing and assay performance characteristics, which must be conveyed to the providers who receive the results. Interpretative judgment and reporting strategies are particularly important in infectious disease testing and require oversight by an experienced clinical microbiologist, with input from ID or AS experts, to incorporate the interpretative guidance for the results into clinical care. When an organism with pathogenic potential is detected by a molecular microbiology test, it must be determined if the organism represents active infection, colonization, asymptomatic infection, reactivation in the setting of acute infection, chromosomal integration, prolonged shedding after infection, or other clinical scenarios. The following are methods to support accurate interpretation of molecular microbiology test results:

The report should be clear and the significance of the results should be easy for providers to understand
To aid correct interpretation, report comments may be employed (e.g. when bla CTX-M gene results, the report should include the interpretation that an ESBL-producing organism was detected and that resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins is predicted)
Consider including a link in the report to further guide result utilization (e.g. linking institutional therapy recommendations when a report indicates a carbapenemase-producing organism was detected)
Add report comments to alert providers to critically assess the result when an organism could be a false positive detection or analytically true positive detection but clinically insignificant (e.g. HHV-6 detected in CSF could indicate infection or non-infectious chromosomal integration in white blood cells depending on the clinical presentation and risk factors)
For broad-range molecular microbiology tests (e.g. metagenomic next-generation sequencing or 16S rRNA PCR with sequencing), add comments to guide cautious interpretation when nucleic acids are detected from common commensal or contaminating organisms. Comments encouraging correlating the molecular results with other clinical results may also help
For some molecular test results, additional consultation may be necessary. For example, if there is a discrepancy between molecular and phenotypic tests (e.g. molecular test detects S. aureus and mec A gene, but antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrates oxacillin and cefoxitin susceptibility) Discussion with providers often provides mutually beneficial information to arrive at an accurate determination of an organism's clinical significance Consultation may also support test interpretation of send-out testing for which the local laboratory has limited ability to alter the reports or add interpretative comments

### Point-counterpoint: differences between the European committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing and clinical and laboratory standards institute recommendations for reporting antimicrobial susceptibility results [^115fkFCv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTIONAntibiotic susceptibility test results are among the most important results issued by clinical microbiology laboratories because they routinely guide critical treatment decisions. Interpretations of MIC or disk diffusion test results, such as "susceptible" or "resistant", are easily understood. Clinical laboratories also need to determine whether and how their reports will reflect more complex situations. Such situations include, first, whether there is need to administer higher or more frequent doses of antibiotic than usual for clinical efficacy; second, whether an antimicrobial is likely to be effective at a body site where it concentrates; and third, whether there is some uncertainty in the test results due to technical variability that cannot be eliminated. Two leading organizations that set standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), have taken different strategies to deal with these challenges. In this Point-Counterpoint, Gunnar Kahlmeter and Christian Giske discuss how EUCAST is addressing these issues, and Thomas Kirn and Susan Sharp discuss the CLSI approach.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^112yvqFv]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — test ordering through clinician interpretation — includes interventions in the electronic health record for test ordering, optimization of specimen collection and transport, laboratory processing strategies, postanalytic reporting optimization, and clinician test interpretation requirements. Test ordering in the electronic health record allows informational alerts, required indications, and limiting orders based on clinical data. Specimen collection and transport affect accuracy, and hospitals can optimize by providing instructions and training. Within the laboratory, activities include implementing new diagnostic methods to improve time to therapy or sensitivity and using sequential, conditional, or reflexive testing (for example, only performing urine cultures when the urinalysis is abnormal); selective susceptibility testing is applied in inappropriate situations, and contamination policies may mean "no further work-up is routinely provided (eg, 1 of 2 blood-culture sets with coagulase-negative staphylococci)". Test reporting — the postanalytic phase — can be optimized with comments, selective species reporting (for example, reporting yeast rather than "Candida" in respiratory cultures), interpretive statements, and antimicrobial stewardship team guidance such as dosing recommendations based on susceptibility breakpoints. Clinician interpretation requires assessing how tests identify those with and without disease, recognizing that test characteristics can vary by patient population, and using online diagnosis calculators such as QxMD and MDcalc.com to estimate posttest probabilities and disease risk.

The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenem (KPC) beta-lactamase occurs in Enterobacteriaceae and can confer resistance to all beta-lactam agents including carbapenems. The enzyme may confer low-level carbapenem resistance, and the failure of susceptibility methods to identify this resistance has been reported. Automated and nonautomated methods for carbapenem susceptibility were evaluated for identification of KPC-mediated resistance. Ertapenem was a more sensitive indicator of KPC resistance than meropenem and imipenem independently of the method used. Carbapenemase production could be confirmed with the modified Hodge test.

2.1 Instructions for Use in All Patients

For Intravenous or Intramuscular Use DO NOT MIX OR CO-INFUSE ERTAPENEM FOR INJECTION WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS. DO NOT USE DILUENTS CONTAINING DEXTROSE (α -D-GLUCOSE).

Ertapenem for injection may be administered by intravenous infusion for up to 14 days or intramuscular injection for up to 7 days. When administered intravenously, Ertapenem for injection should be infused over a period of 30 minutes. Intramuscular administration of Ertapenem for injection may be used as an alternative to intravenous administration in the treatment of those infections for which intramuscular therapy is appropriate.

2.2 Treatment Regimen

13 years of age and older

The dose of Ertapenem for injection in patients 13 years of age and older is 1 gram (g) given once a day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

3 months to 12 years of age

The dose of Ertapenem for injection in patients 3 months to 12 years of age is 15 mg/kg twice daily (not to exceed 1 g/day). Table 1 presents treatment guidelines for Ertapenem for injection.

2.3 Prophylactic Regimen in Adults

Table 2 presents prophylaxis guidelines for Ertapenem for injection.

2.4 Patients with Renal Impairment

Ertapenem for injection may be used for the treatment of infections in adult patients with renal impairment. In patients whose creatinine clearance is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², no dosage adjustment is necessary. Adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance ≤ 10 mL/min/1.73 m²) should receive 500 mg daily. A supplementary dose of 150 mg is recommended if ertapenem is administered within 6 hours prior to hemodialysis. There are no data in pediatric patients with renal impairment.

2.5 Patients on Hemodialysis

When adult patients on hemodialysis are given the recommended daily dose of 500 mg of Ertapenem for injection within 6 hours prior to hemodialysis, a supplementary dose of 150 mg is recommended following the hemodialysis session. If Ertapenem for injection is given at least 6 hours prior to hemodialysis, no supplementary dose is needed. There are no data in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration. There are no data in pediatric patients on hemodialysis.

When only the serum creatinine is available, the following formula1may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Case definition and epidemiological classification

We defined a CRE case as the first isolation, in a 30-day period, from a catchment area resident, meeting the phenotypic case definition of carbapenem non-susceptible and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. aerogenes (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes), Enterobacter cloacae complex, or Escherichia coli from a normally sterile body site or urine specimen. Antimicrobial resistance was defined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results from the local clinical laboratory's primary testing method were used to identify isolates with carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ≥ 2 μ g/mL to imipenem, meropenem, or doripenem (ertapenem was excluded) and with MICs indicating resistance to any third-generation cephalosporin tested (ceftazidime MIC ≥ 16 μ g/mL; ceftriaxone or cefotaxime MIC ≥ 4 μ g/mL). Although this surveillance program is ongoing, the phenotypic case definition was changed in 2016, therefore our analysis is limited to data collected before 2016.

A case was defined as health care-associated (HCA) if it occurred in a patient with any of the following risk factors: (1) collection of the case-defining culture on or after day 3 of admission to a short stay acute care hospital (ACH); (2) admission to an ACH or long-term acute care hospital (LTACH), residence in a long-term care facility (LTCF) (including nursing home, skilled nursing facility, inpatient hospice or physical rehabilitation facility), or inpatient or outpatient surgery in the year prior to the date of culture; (3) undergoing chronic dialysis at time of culture; or (4) presence of a urinary catheter or another type of indwelling device at the time of or in the 2 calendar days before the date of incident culture. Cases in patients without any of these health care risk factors were classified as CA.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### The role of rapid multiplex molecular syndromic panels in the clinical management of infections in critically ill patients: an experts-opinion document [^112TsY6t]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Commercially available RMMSP typically offer turnaround times of 1–4.5 h. Overall, they enhance microbial detection compared to standard procedures like bacterial culture, potentially speeding up pathogen identification and treatment initiation. RMMSP, when combined with antimicrobial stewardship efforts, play a crucial role in clinical decision-making, however, although some recent publications have shown promising results, their impact on patient clinical and economical outcomes requires further investigation through studies with large sample sizes and preferably clinical trial designs.

RMMSP offer mainly qualitative results, though some provide (semi)quantitative values for specific bacterial targets, and some are suitable for point-of-care testing.

Proper interpretation of PCR detection results is challenging due to the test's ultra sensitivity. This precision enables detection of pathogens or resistance mechanisms, even when present only as colonizers, which may lead to unnecessary treatments. Literature reports overdiagnosis rates of 49% for the mecA gene, 27% for ESBL, and 15–38% for carbapenem resistance genes unrelated to clinical conditions.

Careful interpretation of positive results from RMMSP is crucial, as they may detect colonization or molecular remnants rather than active infection, particularly in non-sterile fluids. This highlights the importance of diagnostic stewardship to differentiate between infection and colonization. Commercial RMMSPs are standardized, encompassing nucleic acid extraction, amplification, detection, and reporting, which minimizes the need for direct specimen handling.

Effective use of these results demands specialized training, encompassing test interpretation, result integration, and patient management. Collaborative protocols and strong partnerships between microbiologists and intensivists are essential. Crucially, PCR findings must be contextualized with pretest probabilities, culture results, and the patient's clinical status.

Table 1 outlines clinical situations where the interpretation of molecular test results may be limited due to insufficient data or clinical biases.

### Innovative approaches in phenotypic β-lactamase detection for personalised infection management [^111AgPVY]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Quantifying the absolute amount of beta-lactamase enzyme produced by bacterial isolates and its level of activity on specific antibiotics is more challenging than measuring gene expression or gene abundance. These enzymes are often present in small quantities, and their activity can be influenced by various factors, including type of beta-lactamase, site of infection and bacterial species. There are a few indirect methods to estimate beta-lactamase enzyme activity, including colourimetric assaysand western blot, but these methods only provide a relative measure of enzyme activity rather than absolute quantification.

The MERINO trial and post-hoc analysis highlighted a need for better data on enzyme activity in relation to minimal inhibitory concentration in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The trial failed to demonstrate that piperacillin-tazobactam was non-inferior to meropenem, with the former associated with a higher mortality rate (12.3% vs. 3.7%). Concerns about the trial methodology, particularly the determination of MIC and susceptibility reporting, were raised. The post-hoc analysis revealed a higher nonsusceptibility rate to piperacillin-tazobactam using broth microdilution compared to gradient MIC test strips, demonstrating the need for accurate and consistent susceptibility testing approaches. The trial also found that 30-day mortality was significantly higher for patients with piperacillin-tazobactam MICs > 16 mg/L. Further analysis found that genotypic factors, such as the presence of AmpC and OXA-1 genes with CTX-M, could be associated with elevated MICs and increased mortality.

We developed a carbapenemase test based on the ability of imipenem to inhibit noncarbapenemase β-lactamases. The test uses bacterial isolates with a fluorescent β-lactamase substrate, producing objective results with 100% sensitivity and specificity in 10 minutes. The assay is inexpensive and consists of only 1 mixing step.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration with probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of ertapenem and is therefore not recommended. (7.1)
The concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Anti-bacterials other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. (5.2, 7.2)

7.1 Probenecid

Probenecid interferes with the active tubular secretion of ertapenem, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of ertapenem [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with ertapenem is not recommended.

7.2 Valproic Acid

Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including ertapenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction of valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Phenotypic detection of carbapenemase-producing organisms from clinical isolates [^116ByC4Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms constitutes one of the greatest challenges to global health. While Gram-negative organisms have developed several mechanisms to avert the bactericidal effects of commonly prescribed antibiotic agents, the increasing prevalence of carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) is particularly concerning given the rapid spread of mobile genetic elements containing carbapenemase genes, the limited treatment options for infections caused by these organisms, and the high mortality rates associated with CPO infections. Understanding if an organism is carbapenemase producing and, if so, the class of carbapenemase(s) produced has treatment implications, as some agents preferentially have activity against specific carbapenemases. Furthermore, CPO disseminate between patients with greater ease than non-CP-carbapenem-resistant organisms and warrant more intensive infection control measures than would be employed in the absence of carbapenemase production. Phenotypic assays currently used in clinical practice to detect CPO consist of the following: (i) growth-based assays which measure carbapenem resistance based on organism growth in the presence of a carbapenem antibiotic (e.g., modified Hodge test and modified carbapenem inactivation method), (ii) hydrolysis methods which detect carbapenem degradation products (e.g. Carba NP test and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry), and (iii) lateral flow immunoassays which detect carbapenemase enzymes through the use of specific antibodies. Although there is no single phenotypic test that meets all specifications of the ideal test, as we describe in this review, there are a number of tests that are user-friendly, affordable, accurate, and feasible for implementation in clinical microbiology laboratories of all sizes.

Diagnostic stewardship — follow-up testing and de-escalation (Moment 4) — follow-up diagnostic testing can be considered to assess clinical response or ensure source control, and in some cases biomarkers may be used to help determine when antimicrobial therapy may be stopped. Clinicians should be guided away from using certain laboratory tests as tests of cure or course-of-therapy imaging in patients who displayed favorable clinical response, and additional diagnostic questions during Moment 4 include whether test results confirm infection, the final diagnosis and treatment, and whether any follow-up diagnostic tests should or should not be performed.

DTR P. aeruginosa — percent activity of newer β-lactams and AST/testing guidance — notes that differences in DTR P. aeruginosa isolates susceptibility percentages to newer β-lactams exist, and United States surveillance data indicate ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, and cefiderocol are active against approximately 90%, 85%, 86%, and 99% of carbapenem-non-susceptible isolates; the panel suggests always obtaining AST results for the four newer β-lactam agents for DTR P. aeruginosa infections to guide treatment decisions. The panel does not suggest testing meropenem-vaborbactam activity against DTR P. aeruginosa isolates, as vaborbactam only marginally restores meropenem's activity and there are no CLSI or FDA breakpoints for meropenem-vaborbactam against P. aeruginosa. Apparent susceptibility can occur if applying the CLSI meropenem-vaborbactam Enterobacterales susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 4 µg/mL to P. aeruginosa; meropenem breakpoints (ie, ≤ 2 µg/mL) are based on 1 gram IV administered every 8 hours, as a 30-minute infusion, whereas infusing meropenem as 2 grams IV every 8 hours over 3 hours would likely achieve a similar likelihood of target attainment as meropenem-vaborbactam (ie, approximately 8 µg/mL). Surveillance combining 1500 carbapenem-non susceptible isolates found over 97% susceptibility to cefiderocol with MICs ≤ 4 µg/mL.

Diagnostic stewardship — rationale and risks of misapplied testing — emphasizes that diagnostic test utilization is a complex process that begins, in theory, with the clinician's decision to order a test and ends with actions based on the interpretation of test results, that no diagnostic test is 100% accurate, and that not all "positive" tests represent infection; some represent false positives and others represent colonization rather than active infection. When clinicians do not consider test and patient characteristics, this leads to reflexive ordering of unnecessary, low-value tests, and reflexive antibiotic treatment when those tests return positive, so diagnostic test overuse frequently results in antibiotic overuse and misuse; therefore, diagnostic stewardship strategies are critical to improving test utilization, reducing diagnostic anchoring, and preventing downstream antibiotic overuse.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^113tfi3L]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship objectives and diagnostic pathway — The primary objectives of diagnostic stewardship are to improve patient care by promoting accurate and timely diagnosis and thereby increasing appropriate antimicrobial use while reducing antimicrobial resistance, with figure-listed aims to improve patient care and outcomes, optimize antimicrobial use, improve efficiency of care, and improve institutional costs and metrics. Additional secondary benefits may include improving efficiency of care, reducing costs, and improving institutional metrics related to hospital-acquired infections. The diagnostic pathway is a process that starts and ends with clinicians who order a diagnostic test and make patient-care decisions based on their interpretation of the test result; key steps include collection of a specimen for testing, processing the specimen, performing the test, and providing a result, all within the context of the institutional systems in place, and to ensure appropriate diagnostic test orders, clinicians must understand test performance.

### Ertapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: risk factors for acquisition and outcomes [^1173qUMB]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is of concern because of increasing prevalence and limited therapeutic options. Limited research has been focused on understanding ertapenem resistance as a more sensitive marker for resistance to other carbapenems. We sought to determine risk factors for acquisition of ertapenem-resistant, meropenem-susceptible, or intermediate Enterobacteriaceae and to assess associated patient outcomes.

Design

Retrospective case-control study among adult hospitalized inpatients.

Setting

A 902-bed quaternary care urban hospital.

Results

Sixty-two cases of ertapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were identified from March 14, 2006, through October 31, 2007, and 62 unmatched control patients were randomly selected from other inpatients with cultures positive for ertapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Thirty-seven (60%) of case patient isolates were Enterobacter cloacae, 20 (32%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 5 (8%) were other species of Enterobacteriaceae. Risk factors for ertapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection included intensive care unit stay (odds ratio [OR], 4.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.0–10.3]), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonization (OR, 7.1 [95% CI, 2.4–21.4]), prior central venous catheter use (OR, 10.0 [95% CI, 3.0–33.1]), prior receipt of mechanical ventilation (OR, 5.8 [95% CI, 2.1–16.2]), exposure to any antibiotic during the 30 days prior to a positive culture result (OR, 18.5 [95% CI, 4.9–69.9]), use of a β-lactam during the 30 days prior to a positive culture result (OR, 6.9 [95% CI, 3.0–16.0], and use of a carbapenem during the 30 days prior to a positive culture result (OR, 18.2 [95% CI, 2.6–130.0]). For the 62 case patients, 30-day outcomes from the time of positive culture result were 24 discharges (39%), 10 deaths (16%), and 28 continued hospitalizations (44%). The final end point of the hospitalization was discharge for 44 patients (71%) and death for 18 patients (29%).

Conclusions

Ertapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are important nosocomial pathogens. Multiple mechanisms of resistance may be in operation. Additional study of ertapenem resistance is needed.

### Perioperative prophylaxis with ertapenem reduced infections caused by extended-spectrum betalactamase-producting enterobacteriaceae after kidney transplantation [^112kJF1P]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years we have observed in our kidney transplant unit an increase in the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, especially ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and similar data has published in other centres worldwide. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens caused an increasing number of healthcare-associated infections, causing a significant increment in costs and morbidity and mortality and are often associated with ICU admission and prior antibiotic use.

Reducing Enterobacteriaceae infections, especially ESBL-producing strains could mean reducing hospitalization and costs. However, in a long-term analysis, there was no statistical difference in 2-year graft loss neither 2-year mortality between the groups of prophylaxis. To avoid infection and especially colonization due to drug-resistant organisms some strategies have been described. First of all, shortening antibiotic regimens so as to decrease antibiotic-related selective pressures could be important prophylactic steps. Specifically, European guidelines recommend educational programmes based on hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, contact precautions and antimicrobial stewardship to reduce the horizontal spread of multidrug-resistant organisms during hospitalisation.

Our study had several limitations. First, as it was conducted in a single hospital ward, the results may not be applicable to other centres with different epidemiological backgrounds. Second, we did not perform a study of faecal carriage at the time of transplantation and, thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that the differences in the incidence of infections with Enterobacteriaceae between groups were due to different rates of pre-transplant bowel colonization. Furthermore, the combination of retrospective and prospective assessments limits the ability to truly compare the groups as it fails to consider the potential for local confounders in practices and epidemiologic changes. Moreover, we have no information about prior antibiotic exposure before transplantation. Although there were no changes in infection control protocol neither in surgical techniques or pre-transplant management during the study period, there could be potential pitfalls inherent in a comparison of two different eras. So, this data should be used to inform future more rigorous studies, including randomized ones.

### Paradoxical carbapenemase activity detected by modified carbapenemase inactivation (mCIM) method in… [^1146zKvh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales is a necessity for hospitals serving high-risk patient populations. Detection methods often incorporate the modified carbapenemase inactivation method (mCIM) test to verify carbapenemase production in suspect isolates. Here, we demonstrate the case of a Citrobacter sedlakii isolate recovered from carbapenemase-surveillance culture that was strongly mCIM positive for carbapenemase production, but phenotypically nonresistant to carbapenems. The modified carbapenemase inactivation method with EDTA (eCIM) test, which suggests the presence of a metallo-β-lactamase, was positive as well. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry additionally confirmed the loss of meropenem during the mCIM test. Whole-genome sequencing detected only the presence of the chromosomal class A serine β-lactamase SED-1 but did not identify any known carbapenemase or additional β-lactamases. Further characterization suggested that the large inoculum utilized in mCIM tests can give the impression of carbapenemase production in non-resistant isolates. Additionally, the large inoculum, combined with weak carbapenemase activity, can mimic the phenotype expected for metallo-β-lactamase in the eCIM test. These results suggest that utilization of the mCIM and eCIM tests without appropriate susceptibility testing can lead to erroneous detection of carbapenemase production. IMPORTANCEPhenotypic tests including the mCIM are often used for detection of carbapenemase production in Enterobacterales. The presence of a carbapenemase gene is confirmed by PCR assays and, while rarely seen, a positive mCIM assay and negative PCR can alert the laboratory to the presence of rare carbapenemases (such as GES and IMI). We report a false-positive mCIM test, which we demonstrate is due to the heavy inoculum of the organism used in the assay. Whole-genome sequencing showed that a class A β-lactamase (blaSED-1) was present, and mass spectrometry demonstrated degradation of meropenem during the mCIM assay. The inoculum effect should be considered when interpreting mCIM and eCIM assays where a carbapenemase gene is not detected.

### Ertapenem sodium (ertapenem) [^116M4j7m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Following the 20 mg/kg dose (up to a maximum dose of 1 g), the pharmacokinetic parameter values in patients 13 to 17 years of age (N = 6) were generally comparable to those in healthy young adults.

Plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval following a single 15 mg/kg IV dose of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of age are comparable to plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval following a 1 g once daily IV dose in adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The plasma clearance (mL/min/kg) of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of age is approximately 2-fold higher as compared to that in adults. At the 15 mg/kg dose, the AUC value (doubled to model a twice daily dosing regimen, i.e., 30 mg/kg/day exposure) in patients 3 months to 12 years of age was comparable to the AUC value in young healthy adults receiving a 1 g IV dose of ertapenem.

Drug Interactions

When ertapenem is co-administered with probenecid (500 mg p.o. every 6 hours), probenecid competes for active tubular secretion and reduces the renal clearance of ertapenem. Based on total ertapenem concentrations, probenecid increased the AUC of ertapenem by 25%, and reduced the plasma and renal clearance of ertapenem by 20% and 35%, respectively. The half-life of ertapenem was increased from 4.0 to 4.8 hours.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following cytochrome p450 (CYP) isoforms: 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4.

In vitro studies indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin or vinblastine and that ertapenem is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.

Mechanism of Action

Ertapenem has in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of ertapenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ertapenem binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). In Escherichia coli, it has strong affinity toward PBPs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with preference for PBPs 2 and 3.

### Notes from the field: carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae with mcr-1 gene identified in a hospitalized patient-Wyoming, January 2019 [^111wtcM6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

In mid-December 2018, an adult with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections was admitted to a Wyoming hospital with acute confusion. Because of a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, the patient was placed on contact precautions in a private room. Admission urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing identified carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. Susceptibility to colistin, an antibiotic of last resort, was not tested. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are reportable to the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH), and the isolate was sent to the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory (WPHL), where ertapenem resistance was confirmed. Further testing identified resistance to 16 antibiotics * and susceptibility to amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, and tigecycline. Using the Carba NP assay, carbapenemase production was not found. WPHL sent the isolate to the Texas Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Laboratory Network regional laboratory for further characterization. Because of known sensitivity issues with the Carba NP assay, repeat testing used the modified carbapenem inactivation method. Texas AR Laboratory Network confirmed WPHL results. Colistin susceptibility testing by broth microdilution found that the minimum inhibitory concentration was > 4 μ g/mL, which was above the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's epidemiologic cutoff value for wild type Enterobacteriaceae (≤ 2 μ g/mL). The plasmid-mediated mcr-1 colistin resistance gene was detected using a CDC-developed multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. In early January 2019, Texas AR Laboratory Network alerted WDH that the isolate carried the mcr-1 gene.

### Increased risk for carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae colonization in intensive care units after hospitalization in emergency department [^115SeP84]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Setting

Hospital das Clinicas is a 2,200-bed public tertiary-care hospital in São Paulo and is the largest hospital complex in Latin America. The main building has ≈1,000 beds and is the location of the ED and most of the hospital's ICU beds (10 ICUs and 109 intensive care beds).

The ED is a very busy unit. In 2018, 69,000 emergency consultations were performed. The average hospitalization rate in the ED is 150 patients/week, and median length of stay is 6 days. The ED has 50 beds for hospitalization, but occupancy often exceeds 90 beds, with patients on stretchers and often in corridors (Figure 1).

Figure 1
A corridor in the emergency department of Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo, Brazil, showing patients on stretchers, December 2016.

Approximately 60% of ICU patients are admitted from the ED. To monitor and control CRE colonization, CRE surveillance cultures are performed on all patients admitted to ICUs at the time of admission and placed under contact precautions until the return of results. Colonized patients with CRE remain under contact precautions for their entire stay in the unit.

Microbiology

Surveillance cultures are performed at the clinical microbiology laboratory in accordance with the institution's standard methodology. Rectal swab specimens from patients are incubated overnight in thioglycolate broth. Positive growth samples are plated on MacConkey agar with ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem discs. If there are colonies suggestive of Enterobacteriaceae growth within the carbapenems' disk halo, these colonies are isolated and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.

### New delhi metallo-β-lactamase from traveler returning to Canada [^115aDpzT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The Study

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the medical ward of a hospital in Mysore, southwestern India, during 2010, with hyperglycemia and upper urinary tract infection (UTI). His underlying diabetes mellitus was stabilized, but his UTI did not improve after 5 days of ciprofloxacin. He was transferred to a hospital in Alberta, Canada. Prostatitis with pyelonephritis was diagnosed, and the patient was treated with ertapenem, 2 g/day. Culture of a clean-catch urine sample taken before the ertapenem was started yielded E. coli MH01 at > 10⁵ CFU/mL urine. The patient improved clinically, and a urine culture taken after 7 days of therapy showed no bacterial growth. The patient received 1 dose of 3 g fosfomycin after completing the ertapenem.

Antimicrobial drug susceptibility was determined with the VITEK 2 instrument (Vitek AMS; bioMérieux Vitek Systems, Hazelwood, MO, USA). MICs of the following drugs were determined: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, meropenem, ertapenem, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Additional susceptibility tests for imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, tigecycline, and colistin were performed by using Etest (AB BioDisk, Solna, Sweden) according to the manufacture's instructions. Results were interpreted by using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for broth dilution. Fosfomycin susceptibility was determined by using CLSI disk methods.

### Innovative approaches in phenotypic β-lactamase detection for personalised infection management [^116o568a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae present a significant therapeutic challenge. Current developments in phenotypic diagnostics focus primarily on rapid minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. There is a requirement for rapid phenotypic diagnostics to improve antimicrobial susceptibility tests (AST) and aid prescribing decisions. Phenotypic AST are limited in their ability to characterise beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in detail. Despite advances in rapid AST, gaps and opportunities remain for developing additional diagnostic approaches that facilitate personalised antimicrobial prescribing. In this perspective, we highlight the state-of-the-art in beta-lactamase detection, identify gaps in current practice, and discuss barriers for innovation within this field.

### Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry-based functional assay for rapid detection of resistance against β-lactam antibiotics [^111TUTtX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Resistance against β-lactam antibiotics is a growing challenge for managing severe bacterial infections. The rapid and cost-efficient determination of β-lactam resistance is an important prerequisite for the choice of an adequate antibiotic therapy. β-Lactam resistance is based mainly on the expression/overexpression of β-lactamases, which destroy the central β-lactam ring of these drugs by hydrolysis. Hydrolysis corresponds to a mass shift of +18 Da, which can be easily detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Therefore, a MALDI-TOF MS-based assay was set up to investigate different enterobacteria for resistance against different β-lactam antibiotics: ampicillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem. β-Lactamases are enzymes that have a high turnover rate. Therefore, hydrolysis can be detected by MALDI-TOF MS already after a few hours of incubation of the bacteria to be tested with the given antibiotic. The comparison of the MS-derived data with the data from the routine procedure revealed identical classification of the bacteria according to sensitivity and resistance. The MALDI-TOF MS-based assay delivers the results on the same day. The approved routine procedures require at least an additional overnight incubation.

### Duration of contact precautions for acute-care settings [^113hB2fL]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Duration of contact precautions — scope and definitions — clarifies that the document does not provide recommendations regarding indications for the use of contact precautions (CP) and is intended for acute-care hospitals that already use CP, addressing when and under what circumstances CP may be discontinued; colonization is defined as the isolation of the organism from a nonsterile site in the absence of symptoms of infection. For multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDR-E), MDR-E is considered ESBL-producing (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant (CRE), or MDR-E defined by resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, and the guidance does not address Pseudomonas aeruginosa or members of the Acinetobacter baumannii complex. For microbiology and testing, FDA-cleared tests were reviewed; routine culture methods have varying sensitivity and may not detect all phenotypes of MRSA, VRE, and MDR-E, and molecular testing for C. difficile is not addressed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial strains.

From June 2018 to March 2019, we collected a total of 74 nonduplicate clinical isolates of CRKP from six hospitals in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China. The CRKP strains were defined as having a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 4 µg/mL for imipenem and meropenem or greater than 2 µg/mL for ertapenem. The isolates were obtained from various clinical specimens, including sputum, urine, blood, secretion, and drainage. Three of the hospitals were tertiary hospitals, including Wuhan No. 1 Hospital (31 isolates), Hubei Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital (18 isolates), and Wuhan Fourth Hospital (4 isolates). The remaining three hospitals were secondary hospitals, including Huangpi People's Hospital (13 isolates), Wuhan Hankou Hospital (5 isolates), and the First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District (3 isolates). Isolate identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed by laboratory personnel of the respective hospitals, and bioinformation of all strains was reviewed by using the Vitek 2 Compact System (bioMérieux, Lyons, France) in the laboratory of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The CRKP strains were stored in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 20% glycerol at −20°C for further analysis. Escherichia coli ATCC25922 and Salmonella H9812 were taken as quality control strains for susceptibility testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), respectively.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (WHCDCIRB-K-2021038).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Antimicrobial susceptibilities for all isolates were initially detected by using gram-negative susceptibility cards on the Vitek 2 Compact System. We evaluated the susceptibility of 18 antibiotics, including ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, aztreonam, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Susceptibility testing results were interpreted according to the criteria recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.

### Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of single-dose intravenous ertapenem in infants, children, and adolescents [^111LxCv7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Ertapenem is a carbapenem antibiotic with broad spectrum activity and a pharmacokinetic profile that favors once-daily administration in adults.

Objectives

This investigation was designed to evaluate the dose-exposure profile of ertapenem in children from infancy through adolescence.

Methods

Eighty-four children (3 months-16 years) requiring antibiotic therapy were enrolled in this multicenter trial. Children received a single intravenous dose of ertapenem at 15, 20, or 40 mg/kg followed by repeated blood sampling for 24 hours. Free and total plasma ertapenem concentrations were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the pharmacokinetics were determined using a model-independent approach.

Results

Ertapenem exposure increased proportionally with increasing dose; however, achievable concentrations were influenced by age. Children older than 12 years attained higher dose-normalized concentrations at the end of the infusion (concentration at the end of the infusion [Ceoi]: 8.7 ± 1.9 mg/L per mg/kg dose) and total body exposure (area under the curve area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC]0-∞: 34.7 ± 14.7 mg hr/L per mg/kg dose) as compared with children 2 to 12 years (Ceoi: 6.9 ± 2.4 mg/L per mg/kg dose, AUC0-∞: 18.4 ± 8.0 mg hr/L per mg/kg dose) and children younger than 2 years (Ceoi: 6.1 ± 2.2 mg/L per mg/kg dose, AUC0-∞: 17.0 ± 5.4 mg hr/L per mg/kg dose). These findings were accounted for by age-dependent changes in ertapenem clearance and distribution volume. In 3 children adverse events (nausea, n = 2; injection site reaction, n = 1) were considered related to study drug administration.

Conclusions

Children younger than 12 years require dosing more frequently than once daily to achieve optimal efficacy when treating organisms with a minimum inhibitory concentration near the susceptibility breakpoint.

### Parenteral carbapenems [^112TsG2j]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Among the many different structurally distinct classes of beta-lactams, the carbapenem class is regarded as that which is most potent and which has the widest spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Rapidly bactericidal, and demonstrating time-dependent killing, carbapenemes have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity that includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Their in-vitro activity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens and carbapenems are currently considered to be the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. However, isolates acquiring resistance under treatment have been reported. Imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem are licensed in the European Community and panipenem and biapenem are also available in Japan and South Korea. Other carbapenemes are under development.

For example, if anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams are suppressed for Enterobacterales that are susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, a clinician might assume that a ceftriaxone-susceptible E. coli is susceptible to piperacillin–tazobactam when in fact it harbors an inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase and is piperacillin–tazobactam resistant. Other examples include suppressing daptomycin in vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus isolates or suppressing gentamicin and only reporting tobramycin where assumptions about susceptibility are made. Without having the 'full picture', it can be difficult to phenotypically guess resistance mechanisms in gram-negative organisms. Providers might also make incorrect assumptions about the susceptibility of antimicrobials and antimicrobial classes that have not been tested at all by the lab. Additionally, there are circumstances when patient factors (e.g. allergies) may dictate use of a less-favorable suppressed agent. Finally, in the case of polymicrobial infections where organisms of varying resistance profiles are co-isolated within one sample, clinicians want to be assured that the appropriate antimicrobial selected for the more resistant organism has been tested and is susceptible for the less resistant organism. It is common practice for clinicians to call the lab to request the release of suppressed antimicrobials, which takes an unacknowledged toll on the laboratory, especially in the current era of severe laboratory short staffing.

The impact of cascade reporting on the completeness of the patient's electronic medical record (EMR) must also be considered. Patients are followed longitudinally and often progress through different institutions whether within the same system, from inpatient to outpatient settings, or between different institutions served by the same or different laboratories. Unless the full susceptibility panel results are available for patients and their providers, if cascade rules result in truncated reports into the EMR, the clinical microbiology laboratory is limiting tested information. The 21st Century Cures Act requires that all results tested be released to patients, and that an individual has the right to request and receive a copy of their protected health information. Exceptions to this rule include the "Preventing Harm Exception" (45 CFR Part 171). Prior to implementing cascade rules, the regulatory framework for allowing suppression may need to be established by each institution to include whether the suppression of these rules falls under the "Preventing Harm Exception" clause of the Cures act.

This article familiarizes the clinician with the principles of bacterial susceptibility testing and reporting to facilitate communication with the clinical microbiology laboratory. The emergence of resistance in nearly all commonly isolated bacterial organisms has highlighted the need for ongoing dialogue between the laboratory and those who use its services.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa multidrug-resistant infections — suggested treatment and rationale — When isolates test susceptible to both traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam agents and carbapenems, the former are preferred over carbapenem therapy; for infections caused by isolates not susceptible to any carbapenem but susceptible to traditional β-lactams, administration of a traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam as high-dose extended-infusion therapy is suggested, and for critically ill patients or those with poor source control in this scenario, use of newer β-lactam agents to which P. aeruginosa test susceptible is also a reasonable treatment approach. Phenotypically, isolates not susceptible to a carbapenem agent (eg, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin MICs ≥ 4 µg/mL) but susceptible to other traditional β-lactams constitute approximately 20% to 60% of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, and the panel's preferred approach is high-dose extended-infusion therapy (eg, cefepime 2 g IV every 8 hours, infused over at least 3 hours). Patients infected with P. aeruginosa should be closely monitored to ensure clinical improvement given on-therapy resistance risks, exemplified by an analysis of 767 episodes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia showing emergence of resistance within 30 days with the following likelihood: piperacillin-tazobactam (8%), ceftazidime (12%), meropenem (14%), and imipenem (27%).

### Ertapenem [^117AwuRM]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Ertapenem, sold under the brand name Invanz, is a carbapenem antibiotic medication used for the treatment of infections of the abdomen, the lungs, the upper part of the female reproductive system, and the diabetic foot. The most common side effects include diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and problems around the area where the medicine is infused. It can significantly reduce the concentrations of valproic acid, an anti-seizure medication, in the blood to the point where it loses its effectiveness. Medical uses Ertapenem is indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections, and diabetic foot infections, with bacteria that are susceptible to this drug, or expected to be so. It can also be used to prevent infections after colorectal surgery. In the United States it is also indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis.

It is a potential effective alternative treatment for ceftriaxone-resistant gonorrhoea. It is given as an intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection. The drug is not approved for children under three months of age. Contraindications The drug is contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity to ertapenem or other carbapenem type antibiotics, or with severe hypersensitivity reactions to other beta-lactam antibiotics in the past. Side effects Common side effects are diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, reactions at the injection site, and headache. Uncommon but possibly serious side effects include candida infections, seizures, skin reactions such as rashes, and anaphylaxis. Hypersensitivity cross-reactions with penicillins are rare.

Ertapenem also can have an effect on some blood tests such as liver enzymes and platelet count. Overdose Overdosing is unlikely. In adults receiving the threefold therapeutic dose over eight days, no significant toxicity was observed. Interactions Ertapenem can reduce the concentrations of valproic acid, an epilepsy medication, by 70% and perhaps up to 95% within 24 hours; this can result in inadequate control of seizures. The effect is described for other carbapenem antibiotics as well, but seems to be most pronounced for ertapenem and meropenem. This is likely caused by several mechanisms: carbapenems inhibit transport of valproic acid from the gut into the body; they may increase metabolization of valproic acid to its glucuronide; they may reduce enterohepatic circulation and recycling of valproic acid glucuronide by acting against gut bacteria; and they may block transporter proteins that pump valproic acid out of red blood cells into the blood plasma.

The effect is also seen in reverse: in cases where ertapenem has been withdrawn blood concentrations of valproate have been reported to rise. Drug interactions via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system or the P-glycoprotein transporter are considered unlikely, as these proteins are not involved in the metabolism of ertapenem. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, ertapenem is bactericidal. It inhibits cross-linking of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls by blocking a type of enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins. When a bacterial cell tries to synthesize new cell wall in order to grow and divide, the attempt fails, rendering the cell vulnerable to osmotic disruption. Additionally, the surplus of peptidoglycan precursors triggers autolytic enzymes of the bacterium, which disintegrate the existing wall. Susceptible bacteria Bacteria that are normally susceptible to ertapenem treatment include:
