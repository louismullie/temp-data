## Question

Should I give fluids to a patient who has sepsis and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to give fluids to a patient with sepsis and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, how much to give, and how to monitor and adjust therapy safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the competing pathophysiology of septic vasodilation versus cardiogenic constraints. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines actually recommend and how strong those recommendations are. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence, including observational cohorts and randomized trials, to see if there is a mortality signal for restrictive versus liberal fluids in HFrEF. After that, I need to synthesize a practical, individualized approach with concrete dosing, timing, and reassessment triggers. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like mixed shock and outline a monitoring and deresuscitation plan with explicit safety checks and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic conflict. Sepsis causes vasodilation and relative hypovolemia that can improve with fluids early, but HFrEF limits the ability to increase stroke volume with volume loading and predisposes to pulmonary edema, so the same fluid bolus can both restore perfusion and precipitate respiratory failure depending on timing and volume, which is why we need a cautious, individualized strategy rather than a fixed 30 mL/kg for everyone [^112HKtz6] [^1164Az2o].

> I should confirm guideline positions before jumping to conclusions. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests at least 30 mL/kg crystalloids within 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but this is a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence and explicitly calls for dynamic assessment and frequent reassessment; importantly, it does not mandate 30 mL/kg for all comers and emphasizes tailoring to response and context, which is exactly the situation in HFrEF [^113ohx4k] [^1164Az2o]. The ESICM 2025 guidance similarly allows up to 30 mL/kg initially but stresses adjustments based on clinical context and frequent reassessments, reinforcing an individualized approach rather than a rigid bolus [^1145gRY3] [^112JaomB].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality observational data in HFrEF. The multicenter JAMA Network Open cohort of 5,278 sepsis patients, including 884 with preexisting HFrEF, found that patients with HFrEF received less fluid (about 25% vs 37% got 30 mL/kg within 6 hours), yet in-hospital mortality was similar and there was no interaction between fluid volume and mortality, suggesting that more cautious fluid administration did not worsen outcomes in this subgroup, which supports a lower initial volume with close monitoring rather than withholding fluids entirely [^113Nifbr] [^111jjjrK] [^115vFG2z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from observational data alone; I need to check randomized evidence. CLOVERS randomized 1,563 adults with sepsis-induced hypotension to restrictive (early vasopressors with rescue fluids) versus liberal fluids (2,000 mL then boluses) and found no difference in 90-day mortality, ventilator days, or organ support, indicating equipoise between strategies and supporting the notion that a more restrictive, vasopressor-early approach is reasonable when fluid responsiveness is uncertain or fluid overload risk is high, as in HFrEF [^112ib99X]. But wait, what if I'm overgeneralizing? CLOVERS did not specifically enrich for HFrEF, so while the principle of individualized, response-guided resuscitation applies, I should still be cautious and integrate HFrEF-specific risk into decisions and monitoring [^112ib99X].

> I will now examine HFrEF-specific dosing signals. A 2024 retrospective cohort of 598 septic patients with heart failure identified a U-shaped relationship between early fluid volume and mortality, with the lowest risk at 10–15 mL/kg in the first 3 hours; both less than 10 mL/kg and more than 20 mL/kg were associated with higher mortality, and volumes above 15 mL/kg increased intubation risk, which aligns with physiologic expectations in decompensated HFrEF and supports a moderate initial bolus with early reassessment [^1148gF7X] [^117DWYTJ] [^1111uMeL]. Let me double-check consistency: these findings persisted in subgroup analyses of NYHA III–IV and BNP > 4,000, strengthening external plausibility even though the study is observational [^1148gF7X].

> But wait, what if fluids are withheld too aggressively? A meta-analysis of sepsis patients with heart failure suggested that failing to meet the 30 mL/kg by 3 hours target was associated with higher in-hospital mortality, which seems contradictory at first glance; however, this analysis pooled heterogeneous observational studies and may reflect confounding by severity and care processes rather than a causal benefit of larger boluses in HFrEF, so I should interpret it as a caution against under-resuscitation rather than an endorsement of fixed high-volume boluses in HFrEF [^111VPttT]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this meant I should target 30 mL/kg in HFrEF too, but given the U-shaped mortality curve and the lack of RCT confirmation, the safer synthesis is to start with 10–15 mL/kg and escalate based on dynamic response rather than a predetermined large bolus [^1148gF7X] [^112ib99X].

> Let me consider the practical bedside approach. I should confirm hypoperfusion with objective signs such as hypotension, MAP less than 65 mmHg, lactate greater than 2 mmol/L, or altered mentation, and then give a moderate initial crystalloid bolus of about 10–15 mL/kg using balanced crystalloid when available, while planning frequent reassessment every 1–2 hours for blood pressure, heart rate, lactate clearance, urine output, oxygenation, and signs of congestion like crackles, JVD, or edema; if there is no meaningful hemodynamic improvement after 500–1,000 mL, I should pivot early to vasopressors rather than continuing large-volume fluids, consistent with SSC and CLOVERS principles [^1164Az2o] [^112ib99X] [^111Fo3yV].

> Next, I should review how to individualize using dynamic measures. Passive leg raise with real-time stroke volume or cardiac output assessment, ultrasound of the IVC with respiratory variation (recognizing limitations in mechanically ventilated or patients with high intra-abdominal pressure), and small fluid challenges of 100–250 mL to track stroke volume changes are preferred over static parameters like CVP alone; if dynamic responsiveness is absent, I should avoid further fluids and prioritize vasopressors, and if responsiveness is present, I can cautiously give additional small boluses while watching for pulmonary congestion [^115fLWoS] [^116XQTiT] [^112HKtz6].

> I need to ensure I address mixed septic–cardiogenic shock physiology. If there is persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume and blood pressure, adding inotropy is reasonable; SSC suggests either adding dobutamine to norepinephrine or using epinephrine alone in septic shock with cardiac dysfunction, recognizing the weak, low-quality evidence and the need to titrate carefully to avoid hypotension or arrhythmias in HFrEF [^112JGk5n] [^112jEMH2]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not substituting inotropes for fluids too early; inotropes should follow, not replace, appropriate initial resuscitation and dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness [^1164Az2o].

> I should double-check fluid balance targets after initial stabilization. Once perfusion improves, I will transition to a deresuscitation phase with careful net negative fluid balance using diuretics and judicious fluid restriction to mitigate pulmonary edema and ventilator needs, aligning with the broader sepsis phase-based fluid strategy and HF congestion management principles, while monitoring renal function and electrolytes closely to avoid precipitating kidney injury [^112HKtz6] [^111xdtrT]. Let me reconsider the timing: early conservative management after initial stabilization is supported by observational links between positive fluid balance and worse outcomes, though causality is uncertain, so I will individualize and avoid overly aggressive diuresis that could compromise perfusion [^112HKtz6].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases. In decompensated HFrEF with overt pulmonary edema, I should minimize or avoid fluids and prioritize vasopressors and inotropy while treating congestion; conversely, in frank septic shock with clear hypovolemia and no congestion, a cautious 10–15 mL/kg bolus is still reasonable with immediate dynamic reassessment, and I should escalate to norepinephrine early if MAP remains below 65 mmHg despite modest fluids [^112JaomB] [^1148gF7X]. If the patient is on chronic HF therapies, I should continue guideline-directed medical therapy as tolerated and reintroduce or uptitrate disease-modifying drugs once hemodynamics and congestion allow, consistent with contemporary HF guidance [^111xdtrT] [^115EuzNh].

> Next, I should review documentation and quality metrics. I need to record the rationale for a modified initial volume in HFrEF, the dynamic assessments used, and the reassessment intervals, noting that SEP-1 allows for clinical judgment and documentation when 30 mL/kg is not appropriate; this helps reconcile quality reporting with individualized care in high-risk subgroups [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify that my note captures both sepsis severity and HF status; explicit documentation of perfusion targets, fluid responsiveness testing, and the timing of vasopressor initiation strengthens the medical record and supports appropriate exception handling where applicable [^notfound].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is to give fluids to septic patients with HFrEF, but to individualize the dose and timing: start with a moderate crystalloid bolus of 10–15 mL/kg over the first 3 hours using balanced crystalloids when feasible, reassess dynamically after each 500–1,000 mL for clinical, hemodynamic, and ultrasound response, and pivot early to norepinephrine if MAP remains below 65 mmHg or lactate fails to clear; avoid exceeding 20 mL/kg in the early phase given the higher risk of intubation and mortality, and transition promptly to deresuscitation once perfusion improves to prevent fluid overload, with the understanding that both under-resuscitation and over-resuscitation can be harmful in HFrEF and require vigilant, iterative bedside reassessment [^1148gF7X] [^117DWYTJ] [^1164Az2o] [^112ib99X] [^112HKtz6].

Yes, **give fluids cautiously** to patients with sepsis and HFrEF. Use **small boluses (250–500 mL)** of balanced crystalloids with frequent reassessment of MAP, lactate, urine output, JVP, lungs, and edema [^112HKtz6]. Avoid **large boluses** because of the risk of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure [^1147aP1p]. If MAP remains < 65 mmHg or lactate is not clearing, **start vasopressors early** (norepinephrine first-line) [^112JGk5n]. Individualize to volume status and response, and consider **inotropes** if persistent hypoperfusion persists despite fluids and vasopressors [^112JGk5n] [^112HKtz6].

---

## Pathophysiological considerations

- **Sepsis**: Vasodilation, relative hypovolemia, and capillary leak reduce preload and cardiac output, causing hypotension and organ dysfunction [^1112W2Lu].

- **HFrEF**: Reduced contractility limits cardiac output; excess fluids increase preload and afterload, precipitating pulmonary edema and respiratory failure [^1147aP1p].

- **Balance**: Fluids can improve perfusion but worsen congestion; careful titration is essential [^112HKtz6].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **SSC 2021**: Recommends 30 mL/kg crystalloids within 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but acknowledges low-quality evidence and the need for individualized assessment [^113ohx4k] [^1164Az2o].

- **ESICM 2025**: Suggests up to 30 mL/kg initially, but emphasizes frequent reassessment and individualized adjustment [^1145gRY3] [^112JaomB].

- **Observational data**: Patients with HFrEF often receive less fluid, and mortality is comparable, suggesting cautious fluid administration is reasonable [^113Cojpi] [^115vFG2z].

## Risks and benefits of fluid administration

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Improved preload and cardiac output | Pulmonary edema and respiratory failure |
| Enhanced organ perfusion | Worsening heart failure symptoms |
| Stabilization of hemodynamics | Increased length of stay and ICU admission |

---

## Practical approach to fluid administration

### Initial assessment

During the initial assessment, **evaluate MAP, lactate, urine output, JVP, lung exam, and edema** to determine volume status and perfusion. Use **point-of-care ultrasound** (IVC, lungs, cardiac function) to guide decisions [^1164Az2o].

---

### Fluid administration strategy

- **Small boluses**: 250–500 mL balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's) over 15–30 minutes [^116XQTiT].

- **Frequent reassessment**: After each bolus, reassess MAP, lactate, urine output, JVP, lungs, and edema.

- **Limit total volume**: Avoid exceeding 1–1.5 liters without clear benefit.

---

### Indications to stop or limit fluids

- **Pulmonary edema**: New or worsening crackles, oxygen requirement, or respiratory distress.

- **Elevated JVP**: Suggests volume overload.

- **Worsening edema**: Peripheral or pulmonary.

- **No hemodynamic improvement**: After 1–1.5 liters.

---

## Role of vasopressors and inotropes

Start **vasopressors** when MAP remains < 65 mmHg despite cautious fluids; norepinephrine is first-line [^112HKtz6]. Consider **inotropes** such as dobutamine or epinephrine if persistent hypoperfusion occurs despite adequate volume and vasopressors [^112JGk5n] [^112jEMH2].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Continuous monitoring should include **MAP, heart rate, oxygen saturation, urine output, and lactate** [^1164Az2o]. Reassess frequently — after each bolus and at least every 1–2 hours initially — and adjust therapy based on clinical response, organ function, and fluid balance [^112JaomB].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Give fluids cautiously**: Small boluses (250–500 mL) with frequent reassessment.

- **Stop fluids**: If signs of overload or no response.

- **Start vasopressors**: Early if MAP < 65 mmHg despite fluids.

- **Consider inotropes**: If persistent hypoperfusion.

- **Individualize**: Tailor to volume status and response [^1164Az2o].

---

Patients with sepsis and HFrEF **benefit from cautious, individualized fluid resuscitation**, with early vasopressor support and close monitoring to balance perfusion and congestion.

Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and more than 1 in 5 patients admitted with sepsis die during their hospital stay. Intravenous fluid administration is a key component of clinical practice guidelines and federally mandated performance benchmarks for the management of sepsis and septic shock. However, there is little evidence from randomized clinical trials to support a strategy of aggressive intravenous fluid administration, and there is increasing concern about the downstream harms of fluid overload.

Guidelines recently downgraded the recommendation for a 30-mL/kg intravenous fluid bolus among all patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion from a strong to a weak recommendation. However, controversy remains because aggressive intravenous fluid administration is a component of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) SEP-1 bundle and is widely used in clinical practice. Clinicians are particularly concerned about the potential harms of empirical fluid administration to patients with underlying heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), who may be at higher risk of complications. A greater understanding of the epidemiology of preexisting HFrEF prior to sepsis and its association with outcomes is needed to balance the pros and cons of fluid resuscitation for these patients at high risk. To address these knowledge gaps, in a multicenter cohort study, we explored the epidemiology of HFrEF diagnosed prior to hospitalization for sepsis and its risk-adjusted association with guideline-recommended intravenous fluid administration and outcome during emergency care of septic shock.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1125qQDd]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection, continues to be a significant global health concern. Timely and appropriate fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of sepsis management. According to the latest guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), it is still recommended to administer an initial intravenous (IV) 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus within 3 h for septic patients with hypotension, indiscriminate of comorbidities. However, it is important to note that this recommendation is primarily based on several early observational studies. Despite being endorsed in the SSC guidelines, it is considered a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence.

The lack of consideration in this standard fluid resuscitation dose for the heterogeneity among patient populations, particularly those with heart failure (HF), is a significant concern. This one-size-fits-all fluid resuscitation strategy fails to acknowledge the complexities associated with specific comorbidities. Patients with HF may respond differently to excessive fluid resuscitation due to compromised cardiac function, potentially leading to an increased risk of further deterioration.

Limited literature exists regarding fluid resuscitation in septic patients with comorbid HF. However, the available evidence tends to support guideline recommendations. Despite the inclination to align with the recommended 30 mL/kg resuscitation volume in sepsis guidelines, there is still a critical gap in understanding whether this approach is suitable for the heterogeneous population of patients with varying degrees of HF. Real-world clinical practice shows that septic patients with HF often receive less fluid resuscitation or experience delays in achieving the recommended 30 mL/kg target. These deviations from guidelines may have different impacts on patient outcomes, highlighting clinicians' concerns regarding fluid resuscitation in this population.

In the case of a septic patient with HF, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the appropriate amount of fluid resuscitation and its tolerability. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation volumes and mortality rates in septic patients with HF. Our study specifically examines the impact of early fluid dosing in septic patients with ADHF, a scenario that presents unique challenges compared to stable chronic HF. While the overall prevalence of HF in sepsis is well-documented, the acute decompensation superimposed on sepsis is less studied, and our work aims to fill this gap. By focusing on this distinct subset of patients, we aim to provide more nuanced insights into fluid management strategies that could potentially improve clinical outcomes.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and appropriate fluid resuscitation among patients with sepsis?

Findings

In this cohort study of 5278 patients with community-onset sepsis, 884 (17%) had preexisting HFrEF, which was associated with a lower risk-adjusted odds of receiving 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids within 6 hours of sepsis onset. However, there was no association between HFrEF and in-hospital mortality.

Meaning

The results of this study suggest that preexisting HFrEF is common among patients with septic shock and is associated with reduced odds of receiving guideline-recommended intravenous fluids.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^1175kCGq]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Clinical equipoise exists surrounding the appropriate management of patients with sepsis and preexisting HFrEF. Physicians likely administer less fluid for these patients owing to concerns for adverse outcomes, such as increased pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and mortality. Nonetheless, our study found that HFrEF was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality and that the volume of fluid administered does not modify this association. One possible explanation is that, while fluid administration differed, the true treatment effect of intravenous fluid is small relative to other interventions. A focus on timely administration of appropriate antibiotics may be more critical. In addition, the use of point-of-care ultrasonography in making clinical assessments of volume status may augment clinical decision-making. It is also possible that our findings were underpowered to detect a meaningful difference in outcome between groups.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. First, as with all observational studies, unmeasured confounders may be present. These additional confounders are unlikely to alter the study conclusions, however, as the E-value was larger than the effect size of any of the typical measured confounding variables. Second, clinical practice guidelines for intravenous fluid administration in sepsis were evolving during our study period. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign has recommended a 30-mL/kg intravenous fluid bolus for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion since the 2012 guidelines, but the CMS SEP-1 performance metric was not implemented until the end of our study period. Although the changes in clinician practice after the implementation of the CMS SEP-1 metric were modest, the effect on patients with HFrEF is unknown. Third, the health care system we studied provides care in a specific geographic region, and the external validity of these results may be different outside the US. Fourth, we used transthoracic echocardiogram data obtained within 1 year of sepsis hospitalization, but these data may not account for the temporal changes in systolic function during that time frame. Fifth, the targets (eg, bedside assessment of volume status and volume responsiveness) guiding a clinician's resuscitation decisions for each patient may not be fully represented by the clinical data available in the electronic health record. Sixth, we used the AHA criteria to define HFrEF based on a binary EF cutoff. However, many other factors may play a role in patient outcomes, such as the trajectory of EF changes, the cause of heart failure, and the presence of diastolic dysfunction. Given potential inaccuracies in quantifying these additional factors using electronic health record data alone, we have not examined these features in this study.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^113Nifbr]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Intravenous fluid administration is recommended to improve outcomes for patients with septic shock. However, there are few data on fluid administration for patients with preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Objective

To evaluate the association between preexisting HFrEF, guideline-recommended intravenous fluid resuscitation, and mortality among patients with community-acquired sepsis and septic shock.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cohort study was conducted of adult patients hospitalized in an integrated health care system from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, with community-acquired sepsis and preexisting assessment of cardiac function. Follow-up occurred through July 1, 2016. Data analyses were performed from November 1, 2020, to August 8, 2022.

Exposures

Preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%) measured by transthoracic echocardiogram within 1 year prior to hospitalization for sepsis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multivariable models were adjusted for patient factors and sepsis severity and clustered at the hospital level to generate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs. The primary outcome was the administration of 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluid within 6 hours of sepsis onset. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, and administration of vasoactive medications.

Results

Of 5278 patients with sepsis (2673 men [51%]; median age, 70 years [IQR, 60–81 years]; 4349 White patients [82%]; median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 4 [IQR, 3–5]), 884 (17%) had preexisting HFrEF, and 2291 (43%) met criteria for septic shock. Patients with septic shock and HFrEF were less likely to receive guideline-recommended intravenous fluid than those with septic shock without HFrEF (96 of 380 [25%] vs 699 of 1911 [37%]; P < .001), but in-hospital mortality was similar (47 of 380 [12%] vs 244 of 1911 [13%]; p = 0.83). In multivariable models, HFrEF was associated with a decreased risk-adjusted odds of receiving 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluid within the first 6 hours of sepsis onset (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.85; p = 0.002). The risk-adjusted mortality was not significantly different among patients with HFrEF (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.69–1.24; p = 0.59) compared with those without, and there was no interaction with intravenous fluid volume (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.03; p = 0.72).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study of patients with community-acquired septic shock suggest that preexisting HFrEF was common and was associated with reduced odds of receiving guideline-recommended intravenous fluids.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^115vFG2z]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In an integrated multicenter health care system of community and academic hospitals, preexisting HFrEF was common and associated with a reduced risk-adjusted odds of receiving guideline-recommended intravenous fluids among patients with community-acquired septic shock. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was not associated with in-hospital mortality, and intravenous fluid administration did not modify the association between preexisting HFrEF and outcome.

Aggressive, early intravenous fluid administration for septic shock is controversial. Some observational studies show a potential benefit associated with the administration of fluids early in sepsis. However, to our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials demonstrate a specific fluid volume or resuscitation strategy that improves outcomes. Furthermore, excess fluid administration can lead to adverse outcomes, including mechanical ventilation and mortality. Patients with preexisting HFrEF are a particularly challenging subgroup of patients with sepsis, for whom the evidence is even more inconsistent. Our study expands on existing knowledge by showing that patients with preexisting HFrEF are less likely to receive guideline-recommended intravenous fluids, despite showing no differences in markers of illness severity or completion rates of other guideline-recommended care (eg, prompt antibiotics and measurement of serum lactate level).

These results also show that differences in fluid administration practice patterns are not associated with different clinical outcomes, even among patients with preexisting HFrEF. Prior studies have reached variable conclusions about the association of HFrEF with mortality among patients with sepsis, with some studies showing no association and others showing increased mortality among patients with HFrEF. One potential explanation for these variable findings is the inconsistency in how heart failure is defined. Many groups rely on administrative billing codes to define HFrEF; these codes may have poor sensitivity and positive predictive value. To more accurately classify patients, we included only patients with a transthoracic echocardiogram within 1 year of incident sepsis to characterize the presence or absence of preexisting HFrEF by the AHA definition. In addition, our echocardiographic data included other cardiac traits, such as RV and valvular dysfunction.

### Do septic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction require a low-volume resuscitative strategy? [^116BPyq3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Many clinicians are wary of administering 30 cc/kg of intravenous fluid (IVF) to septic patients with reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (rLVEF), fearing volume overload. Prior studies have used history of heart failure, rather than LVEF measured at presentation, thereby potentially distorting the relationship between rLVEF, IVF, and adverse outcomes. Our goal was to assess the relationship between IVF volume and outcomes in patients with, versus without, rLVEF.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study performed at an urban Emergency Department (ED). Included patients were adults with suspected sepsis, defined as being treated for infection plus either systolic blood pressure < 90 mm/Hg or lactate > 2 mmol/L. All patients had LVEF assessed by ED echocardiogram, prior to receipt of > 1 l IVF.

Measurements and Main Results

We enrolled 73 patients, of whom 33 had rLVEF, defined as < 40%. Patients with rLVEF were older, had greater initial lactate, more ICU admission, and more vasopressor use. IVF volume was similar between LVEF groups at 3-h (2.2 (IQR 0.8) vs 2.0 (IQR 2.4) liters) while patients with rLVEF were more likely to achieve 30 cc/kg (61% (CI 44–75) vs 45% (CI 31–60). In the reduced versus not-reduced LVEF groups, hospital days, ICU days, and ventilator days were similar: 8 (IQR 7) vs 6.5 (8.5) days, 7 (IQR 7) vs 5 (4) days, and 4 (IQR 8) vs. 5 (10) days, respectively.

Conclusions

Septic patients with rLVEF at presentation received similar volume of IVF as those without rLVEF, without an increase in adverse outcomes attributable to volume overload. While validation is needed, our results suggest that limiting IVF administration in the setting of rLVEF is not necessary.

### Therapeutic dilemmas in mixed septic-cardiogenic shock [^1174yjZH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is an increasing cause of decompensation in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Sepsis and decompensated heart failure results in a mixed septic-cardiogenic shock that poses several therapeutic dilemmas: Rapid fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of sepsis management, while loop diuretics are the main stay of decompensated heart failure treatment. Whether inotropic therapy with dobutamine or inodilators improves microvascular alterations remains unsettled in sepsis. When to resume loop diuretic therapy in patients with sepsis and decompensated heart failure is unclear. In the absence of relevant guidelines, we review vasopressor therapy, the timing and volume of fluid resuscitation, and the need for inotropic therapy in patients who, with sepsis and decompensated heart failure, present with a mixed septic-cardiogenic shock.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^116Aw6WB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this cohort study of patients with community-acquired septic shock suggest that preexisting HFrEF was common and associated with reduced odds of receiving guideline-recommended intravenous fluids. However, HFrEF was not associated with in-hospital mortality, and intravenous fluid administration did not modify the association between HFrEF and outcome.

### Association between fluid balance and mortality for heart failure and sepsis: a propensity score-matching analysis [^111DkebB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

As is well-known, limiting fluid intake and increasing fluid output is the principle of heart failure treatment, which is paradoxical with medical treatment for sepsis. Koell et al. noted that fluid overload was associated with adverse prognosis in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. Fluid accumulation and redistribution result in the expansion of interstitial and intravascular space in organs. Right heart hemodynamic data lack reliability for precise fluid management because of its provided limited information, although commonly utilized for the evaluation of fluid balance status in ICU. Regarding studies on heart failure with sepsis, it has been reported that almost 25% of heart failure patients died of sepsis. The survivors accepted more fluid intake within the first 6 h for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and septic shock.

On the basis of current researches combined with our results, early fluid resuscitation can correct hypotension and increase cardiac output, while late fluid overload by continuous volume intake is harmful. We resume that FB status should be paid attention and the strategy of limited fluid intake should be adopted as long as vital signs have been corrected and reached stability. The cut-off value of FB, instead of positive or negative FB, may provide guidance for the assessment of patients' states and prognosis, and timely adjust the treatment strategy. The speed and amount of fluid intake should be cautiously treated in patients with heart failure and sepsis.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1111uMeL]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, based on the available evidence, it seems that an initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg within the first 3 h is considered to be the optimal range for early resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypoperfusion patients with HF, especially in individuals with deteriorated cardiac function. However, it is important to note that further large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to validate and reinforce these findings.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^111pJoDu]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Design and Patients

We evaluated patients with community-onset sepsis. Inclusion criteria were (1) adults (aged ≥ 18 years) hospitalized for more than 24 hours, (2) meeting Sepsis-3criteria within the first 6 hours of presentation, and (3) with transthoracic echocardiography performed at UPMC between 1 and 365 days prior to their presentation with sepsis.

To identify patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria in the electronic health record, patients had to have met the following criteria within 6 hours of arrival to the emergency department: (1) evidence of suspected infection and (2) presence of organ dysfunction. Evidence of suspected infection was defined as the combination of administration of antibiotics (oral or parenteral) and a body fluid culture specimen obtained. The presence of organ dysfunction was defined as a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoreof 2 or higher. To understand the performance of guideline-recommended care, we identified patients as having septic shock based on the CMS SEP-1 criteria for hypoperfusion: (1) mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or lower within the first 6 hours, (2) serum lactate level of 4 mmol/L or higher (to convert to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 0.111) within the first 6 hours, or (3) requirement of vasopressors within the first 48 hours. Patients were excluded if they were transferred from non-UPMC institutions.

The primary exposure was HFrEF. Patients were classified as having HFrEF if they met the 2013 American Heart Association (AHA) criterion of ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less on transthoracic echocardiogram prior to hospitalization for sepsis. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was not examined owing to concerns about inaccurate patient classification using electronic health record data alone.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome was the administration of 30 mL/kg or more of intravenous fluids within the first 6 hours of presentation, as recommended by the CMS SEP-1 bundle. Intravenous fluids included any crystalloid solution (eg, 0.9%, sodium chloride; lactated Ringer solution; and commercial balanced crystalloid solution [Plasma-Lyte; Baxter International Inc]). Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, and administration of vasoactive medications.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed from November 1, 2020, to August 8, 2022. We addressed 3 knowledge gaps in this study: (1) the epidemiology of preexisting HFrEF among patients hospitalized for sepsis, (2) the risk-adjusted association between preexisting HFrEF and guideline-recommended intravenous fluid administration during emergency care, and (3) whether preexisting HFrEF modified the risk-adjusted association between guideline-recommended intravenous fluid administration and in-hospital mortality. The first descriptive analysis was conducted among all patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria. The risk-adjusted analyses were restricted to patients with septic shock, the target population of the CMS SEP-1 bundle.

We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with or without HFrEF. Categorical data were presented as number and percentage and compared with χ² testing. Normally distributed continuous data were presented as mean (SD) values and compared using t testing, while nonnormally distributed continuous data were presented as median (IQR) values and were compared using Kruskal-Wallis testing.

Risk-Adjusted Association Between Preexisting HFrEF and Guideline-Recommended Intravenous Fluid Administration

After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, preexisting HFrEF was associated with a reduced risk-adjusted odds of receiving 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids within the first 6 hours among patients with septic shock (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.85; p = 0.002) (Table 2; Figure 2) compared with those without HFrEF. Higher presenting SOFA score (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01–1.18; p = 0.03), lower age (aOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98–0.99; P < .001), lower Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (aOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87–0.95; P < .001), and female sex (aOR for male sex, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58–0.87; p = 0.001) were also associated with increased odds of receiving guideline-recommended intravenous fluids. For secondary outcomes, HFrEF was not associated with greater in-hospital mortality (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.69–1.24; p = 0.59) (eTable 2 in the Supplement; Figure 3), and there was no interaction between HFrEF and the volume of intravenous fluid administered within the first 6 hours (Wald test of interaction; aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.03; p = 0.72; Figure 3).

Conclusion

In conclusion, for critically ill patients with heart failure and sepsis, high FB within the first 24 h after ICU admission could serve as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality. The avoidance of fluid overload exerts important effects on reducing mortality in such patients. Future studies are needed to further establish the optimal strategy on fluid status management for patients with heart failure and sepsis.

### Guideline-based and restricted fluid resuscitation strategy in sepsis patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VPttT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether a fluid resuscitation strategy based on guidelines (at least 30 mL/kg IV crystalloids) vs. a restrictive approach with < 30 mL/kg within three hours affects in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis and a history of heart failure (HF).

Data Sources

On 03/07/2023, we searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus for peer-reviewed papers and abstracts using the PRISMA guidelines.

Study Selection

The language was limited to English. Studies published since 2016 included if they had sepsis patients with a history of HF, or a subgroup of patients with HF, and in-hospital mortality data on these patients that did or did not meet the 30 mL/kg by 3 h (30 × 3) goal. Duplicate studies, studies that focused on a broader period than 3 h from the diagnosis of sepsis or without mortality breakdown for HF patients or with unrelated title/abstract, or without an IRB approval were excluded.

Data Extraction

In-hospital mortality data was taken from the final studies for HF patients with sepsis who did or did not meet the 30 × 3 goal.

Data Synthesis

The meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.4 program with ORs as the effect measure. The ProMeta program version 3.0 was used to evaluate the publication bias. Egger's linear regression and Berg and Mazumdar's rank correlation was used to evaluate the publication bias. The result was visually represented by a funnel plot. To estimate the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity, the I² statistic was calculated.

Results

The search yielded 26,069 records, which were narrowed down to 4 studies. Compared to those who met the 30 × 3 goal, the < 30 × 3 group had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.13–2.89, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Restrictive fluid resuscitation increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in HF patients with sepsis. More rigorous research is required to determine the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy for this population.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^113VuqhT]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Several limitations should be acknowledged in this study. Firstly, being a retrospective study, there is a possibility of unrecorded data in medical records, making it challenging to fully account for potential biases that could affect the analysis. Secondly, despite our efforts to consider all possible factors, there may still be unadjusted variables that could impact the results. Thirdly, it is difficult to assess the specific reasons behind patients not receiving fluids, whether due to concerns about fluid overload or other valid reasons. Fourthly, our patient population includes individuals from both the emergency department and the wards, and the timing of sepsis recognition by different physicians or the duration of pre-admission sepsis may vary, potentially influencing patient outcomes. Fifthly, when collecting data on fluid volumes, we solely focused on crystalloid solutions administered for resuscitation purposes, excluding maintenance fluids intended for hypoperfusion correction. Sixth, we recognize that the distinction between chronic and acute HF is not always clear-cut, and our study's findings should be interpreted in the context of a patient population that is likely experiencing an acute exacerbation of their HF. Future research should continue to explore the nuances of fluid management in this complex patient population, with the goal of developing evidence-based guidelines that can improve outcomes for patients with sepsis and HF. Another limitation of our study is the sample size constraint, which limited our ability to perform subgroup analyses for HF categories with EF < 50% as recommended by ACC/AHA guidelines, potentially affecting the generalizability of our findings to more diverse HF populations. Seventh, we have acknowledged the limitations related to the lack of more detailed clinical indicators of acute HF (i.e. pulmonary edema, echo showing cardiogenic shock, peripheral edema/JVP). We recognize that the absence of such data may limit our ability to fully characterize the acute decompensation status of our patients. Finally, our study is its conduct within a single tertiary care center, which may constrain the generalizability of our findings to other healthcare settings or diverse patient populations.

Fluid resuscitation volume and in-hospital mortality

Additional file 1: Table S2 and Table 1 provide a comprehensive overview of the demographic and clinical profiles of septic patients and those with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, respectively, in relation to hospital survival outcomes. In general, individuals in the mortality group exhibited a higher NYHA functional class, a lower EF, and elevated BNP levels. However, when stratified by mortality alone, the initial volume of fluid resuscitation was comparable between the two groups.

Additional file 1: Fig. S1 presents an S-shaped curve illustrating the correlation between fluid resuscitation volume and in-hospital mortality among the overall septic patients (P < 0.001). In contrast, among sepsis-induced hypoperfusion patients, a U-shaped relationship (P < 0.001) is evident, with the lowest mortality rates observed when fluid resuscitation volumes range from 10 to 15 mL/kg (500–1000 mL) within the initial 3 h (Fig. 2). It is worth noting that among patients experiencing hypoperfusion, 64 individuals (15.8%) did not receive fluid resuscitation within the initial 3 h, and 32 patients (7.9%) still had not received fluid therapy within the first 6 h.

Results

Patient characteristic

Following a rigorous selection process, 598 septic patients who had a well-documented history of HF were included as participants (Fig. 1). The majority of patients (494, 83.9%) were classified as NYHA functional class III, with a smaller cohort in class IV (22, 3.74%). Approximately 38.4% of patients exhibited an EF less than 50%. Sepsis-induced hypoperfusion was prevalent in 405 (68.8%) patients, primarily originating from pulmonary infections, which accounted for 269 (45.7%) cases. Fluid resuscitation was administered with an average volume of 7.3 ± 7.9 mL/kg (431 ± 462 mL) within the first 3 h, 9.1 ± 8.9 mL/kg (533 ± 518 mL) within the initial 6 h, and 10.7 ± 10.6 mL/kg (624 ± 614 mL) within the first 12 h. Notably, 247 (41.9%) patients did not receive fluid therapy during the initial 3 h, 215 (36.5%) during the first 6 h, and 196 (33.3%) within the first 12 h. Among the entire cohort, 153 (26.0%) patients required mechanical ventilation support. The in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality were 147 (25.0%), 129 (21.9%), and 157 (26.7%), respectively. Detailed baseline characteristics are presented in Additional file 1: Table S1.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1133QL6E]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Individualized fluid management in sepsis improves outcomes in patients with septic shock. The recommendation of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation originates from the early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) trial conducted by Rivers et al. in 2001. Subsequently, both the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) and Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) have endorsed this approach. From 2014 to 2015, three independent, government-funded, multicenter randomized controlled trials were conducted: early septic shock in the United States (ProCESS), sepsis resuscitation assessment in Australia (ARISE), and sepsis programmed management in the UK (ProMISe). The average fluid volume administered to patients prior to randomization in these studies was also around 30 mL/kg, which led to the adoption of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume in routine clinical practice. However, there has been significant debate regarding the optimal fluid volume for sepsis management. Increasing evidence suggests that the fluid administration during the EGDT era, which followed a permissive intravenous fluid strategy, resulted in suboptimal treatment outcomes. This has raised persistent questions about the appropriateness of the 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume. Additionally, the guidelines do not mention a specific rehydration scheme for septic patients at risk of volume overload, and there is no randomized controlled study for reference. Individualized fluid resuscitation may be necessary for patients at risk of volume overload, as the fixed fluid rehydration amount of 30 mL/kg may not be suitable for all sepsis subgroups. The CLOVERS trial demonstrated that early administration of vasopressors to reduce fluid resuscitation volumes did not decrease the 90-day mortality rate in patients with septic hypotension. In line with these findings, our study emphasizes the importance of tailored fluid management strategies in sepsis, particularly for patients with comorbid heart failure, where the optimal initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg within the first 3 h may offer the best clinical outcomes.

### Prevalence and predictors of sepsis death in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^1165wJt7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Sepsis accounts for almost a quarter of deaths in people with HF‐REF receiving contemporary care, suggesting that ongoing efforts to improve survival will need to carefully consider sepsis prevention and management. Sepsis death is associated with a risk marker profile distinct from other important modes of death, suggesting that it may be amenable to prediction and prevention.

### Comparison of outcomes from sepsis between patients with and without pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction: a case-control analysis [^114bXFUD]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid management in critically ill patients with sepsis is complex, in part because the clinical endpoints for fluid administration change during the course of the septic episode. Initially, there is a general consensus that fluid administration should be liberal and aggressive. Clinical management during the initial 24 hours of therapy emphasize the use of resuscitation goals that implicate sufficient tissue delivery of oxygen and include not only traditional hemodynamic measurements and urine output but also variables related to oxygen delivery and consumption, such as hemoglobin and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Subsequently, however, patient outcomes are improved in critically ill septic patients by observing conservative fluid management strategies. The supporting rationale for the application of conservative fluid management strategies during the late stages of sepsis stem from observations of improved patient outcomes from the use of such strategies for the treatment of acute lung injury. Complex patients with both pre-existing LVD and sepsis might be perceived as being more susceptible than other septic patients to developing respiratory complications from aggressive initial fluid resuscitation because pulmonary edema is a component of the congestive heart failure syndrome. Although patients with an LVEF below 35% did not have a different severity of illness nor different outcomes than patients with LVD but with higher LVEF, they did receive statistically less intravenous fluid during this resuscitation. We speculate that this may reflect practice patterns directed by the assumption just noted. We observed that patients with both sepsis and pre-existing LVD were no more likely to be intubated and require mechanical ventilation than case-matched controls, although the need for intubation was a mortality risk factor in these patients. Additionally, we found no correlation between the amount of resuscitative fluid administered over the first 24 hours and oxygenation in that group of cases and controls for whom data were available. We suggest that patients with sepsis and pre-existing LVD may be no more likely than other patients to develop respiratory compromise from goal-directed volume resuscitation in early sepsis.

Sensitivity Analyses

Model results were robust to sensitivity analysis. First, the E-value indicated that unmeasured confounders would require an aOR of at least 1.83 (lower limit of 95% CI, 1.39) to negate the association between HFrEF and administration of 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids. Second, when the primary model included all patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria, preexisting HFrEF remained associated with decreased odds of receiving 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids (aOR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48–0.87; p = 0.004) (eTable 3 in the Supplement; Figure 2). When we included all patients with Sepsis-3 criteria in mortality models, preexisting HFrEF still had no association with in-hospital mortality (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82–1.22; p = 0.99) (eTable 4 in the Supplement; Figure 3). Third, when patients with transthoracic echocardiograms obtained within 1 month of incident sepsis were excluded (n = 814), models for fluid administration (aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51–0.90; p = 0.008) and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.83–1.41; p = 0.56) were consistent. Fourth, the addition of RV dysfunction as a potential confounder did not change the association between HFrEF and fluid administration (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50–0.96; p = 0.03) or mortality (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.60–1.26; p = 0.45). Fifth, with the use of continuous LVEF as the exposure of interest, a 10-point increase in LVEF was associated with increased odds of receiving 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.09–1.26; P < .001; Figure 2) but was not associated with mortality (aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96–1.07; p = 0.57).

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^113y6bRC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We performed multiple sensitivity analyses to understand the robustness of the results. First, we quantified the strength required for a hypothetical unmeasured confounder to negate the primary analysis association between HFrEF and fluid administration using the E-value. Second, because intravenous fluids are administered not just to patients with septic shock, we evaluated models that included patients with less severe sepsis who did not meet CMS SEP-1 criteria for septic shock. Third, because of the uncertainty of the timing of incident sepsis causing sepsis-associated myocardial dysfunction, we evaluated models using only patients with echocardiographic studies more than 1 month prior to hospitalization. Fourth, because RV dysfunction could potentially confound the associations between HFrEF and intravenous fluid administration or mortality, we included RV dysfunction as a covariate in our primary and secondary models. Fifth, we repeated our primary and secondary analyses using continuous LVEF as the primary exposure of interest instead of HFrEF, and we used a fractional polynomial assessment for nonlinear associations.

Clinical Vignettes and Randomized Factors

Cases 1 to 6 assessed resuscitation practices and vasopressor initiation route. In each case, respondents were asked whether they would give additional fluid, start vasopressors, both, or neither. Respondents who chose to start vasopressors were asked what route they would use: PIV only, PIV as a bridge to a central venous catheter (CVC), or central access only (new CVC or preexisting central access, if applicable). Respondents were also asked to rate the difficulty of each case on a 5-point Likert scale.

Among cases 1 to 6, each set of 2 cases were paired (1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6). Baseline vascular access was set in the question stem with each case pair having 1 case where the patient had only peripheral access (2 PIVs) and 1 case where the patient already had central access (temporary CVC, port, or peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC]). For all 6 cases, the amount of fluid the patient had already received (1 L, 2 L, or 5 L) and current mean arterial pressure (MAP; 52 mm Hg, 58 mm Hg, or 64 mm Hg) were randomized. Cases 1 and 2 included additional randomized factors related to an assessment of the patient's volume status by clinical examination (dry, euvolemic, or wet) and past medical history (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], or kidney failure and receiving dialysis). Cases 3 and 4 included randomized supplemental oxygen support (room air, 6-L nasal cannula, or 50% face mask) and respiratory rate (20 breaths per minute, 30 breaths per minute, or 40 breaths per minute). Cases 5 and 6 included randomized laboratory-based factors: lactate trend after fluids (increasing, decreasing, or repeat pending) and acute kidney injury (AKI; no AKI, nonoliguric AKI, or oliguric AKI). Factors were individually randomized, so respondents could have theoretically seen the same conditions across cases (eg, 1 L of fluid in all cases 1–6, or dry examination in cases 1 and 2).

### Identification of intraoperative management strategies that have a differential effect on patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction: a retrospective cohort study [^1171Z1zh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The exploration of the relationship between reduced LVEF and fluid balance also revealed interesting results. While less positive fluid balance was associated with a decreased incidence of AKI in patients with a normal LVEF, those with reduced LVEF who received less fluid experienced more AKI. The association between reduced fluid and reduced AKI in the normal ejection fraction population is at odds with prospective studies comparing restrictive and liberal fluid resuscitation in patients undergoing general anesthesia, which may be secondary to differences in our study population and/or residual confounding. Since this confounding would likely be present in patients with reduced LVEF and normal ejection fraction, the difference we found in the way these two populations respond to resuscitation is of interest, particularly since restrictive fluid administration in patients with reduced LVEF if thought to be beneficial. Overall, this supports future studies aimed at improving our ability to guide administration of fluid to patients with reduced LVEF, particularly given the association of AKI with increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and worse patient outcomes. While careful monitoring of salt and fluid intake, along with the prescription of diuretics, have well established roles in the care of patients with heart failure, different strategies may be needed during times of acute stress. It is possible that patients with reduced LVEF require more aggressive volume resuscitation during surgery to overcome pre-existing diastolic dysfunction and benefit from diuretics to speed the removal of volume given for resuscitation once the inflammatory response abates. This will need to be evaluated by prospective studies to control for the many confounding factors.

Clinical assessment of a patient's volume status also had significant associations with fluid and vasopressor decisions. When a patient was assessed as having dry volume status, an adjusted 66.9% (95% CI, 62.5%-71.2%) of respondents prescribed additional fluid and an adjusted 70.8% (95% CI, 66.2%–75.3%) initiated vasopressors. Conversely, when the patient was assessed as having wet volume status (ie, overload), an adjusted 26.5% (95% CI, 22.3%-30.6%) of respondents prescribed additional fluid while an adjusted 89.3% (95% CI, 86.3%-92.2%) initiated vasopressors (Figure 1 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1).

The figure shows respondents recommendations for cases 1 and 2 (A), cases 3 and 4 (B), and cases 5 and 6 (C). Error bars indicate 95% CIs. In panel A, examination findings include dry (ie, dry mucus membranes), euvolemic (ie, moist mucous membranes and normal jugular venous pressure), and wet (elevated jugular venous pressure and bilateral pitting edema [grade +1]). In panel C, lactate findings include lactate decreasing (ie, initial lactate level of 36.94 mg/dL decreased to 24.32 mg/dL with fluids [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111]), lactate repeat pending (ie, initial lactate level of 36.94 mg/dL with repeat pending), and lactate increasing (ie, initial lactate level of 36.94 mg/dL increased to 48.65 mg/dL despite fluids). COPD indicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CVC, central venous catheter; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; MAP, mean arterial pressure; PICC, peripherally inserted central catheter; and PIV, peripheral venous catheter.

Epidemiology of Preexisting HFrEF and Intravenous Fluid Administration

Among 5278 eligible patients with sepsis, those with HFrEF were more commonly male (567 of 884 [64.1%] vs 2106 of 4394 [47.9%]; P < .001), Black (177 of 884 [20.0%] vs 656 of 4394 [14.9%]; P < .001), and presented with elevated serum creatinine levels (median, 1.7 mg/dL [IQR 1.2–2.9 mg/dL] vs 1.4 mg/dL [IQR, 0.9–2.3 mg/dL] [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]; P < .001) compared with those with normal EF (Table 1). There were no significant differences between patients with HFrEF and those with normal EF in maximum SOFA score within 6 hours (median, 4 [IQR, 3–5] vs 4 [IQR, 2–5]; p = 0.44) or serum lactate level (median, 2.0 mmol/L [IQR, 1.3–2.8 mmol/L] vs 1.8 mmol/L [IQR, 1.2–2.9 mmol/L]; p = 0.26).

Methods

Study design and population

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary urban medical center with approximately 175,000 annual hospital admissions. The study spanned from June 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022. This study followed the guidelines outlined in the Reporting of studies Conducted using observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) statement and received approval from the Institutional Review Board.

Participants

Participants who met the following eligibility criteria were selected: (1) ≥ 18 years old, (2) diagnosed with sepsis, and (3) had a documented history of pre-existing HF. The definition of sepsis was based on the criteria set forth by the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) as the presence of infection or suspected infection, accompanied by an acute increase in the total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of at least 2 points. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification was ascertained through medical record review within the last year prior to the onset of sepsis, allowing for an assessment of heart function that is proximate to the patient's condition at the time of sepsis diagnosis. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients (1) with age < 18 years, (2) without signs of infection, (3) had multiple hospitalizations, (4) whose hospital length of stay < 1 day, (5) without a documented HF diagnosis, (6) with indeterminate NYHA classification, (7) who were diagnosed with HF only during the current hospitalization, (8) diagnosed with sepsis after being hospitalized for more than 7 days, (9) transferred from other medical facilities who had already undergone fluid resuscitation, (10) requiring endotracheal intubation prior to fluid resuscitation, and (11) for whom height and weight measurements were unavailable. All included patients were hospitalized; for patients with multiple hospital admissions for sepsis, only their initial admission was considered for analysis.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^116Jq6KJ]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our optimal liquid volume range was 10–15 mL/kg, which is inconsistent with previous studies. This discrepancy may be attributed to the predominantly severe HF patients in our study cohort. As the severity of HF escalates, the volume of fluid resuscitation required tends to decrease. Therefore, our recommended fluid volume ranges are particularly applicable to patients with severe HF. For patients with milder HF, fluid requirements may exceed 15 mL/kg. Unfortunately, a precise estimate for this subgroup could not be determined due to the limited sample size. Although the 15–20 mL/kg fluid resuscitation range did not statistically differentiate in-hospital mortality in the NYHA III and IV subgroups and the BNP > 4000 subgroup, it significantly increased the rate of tracheal intubation. In the HFrEF < 50 subgroup, our study did not find a correlation between fluid volume and intubation, which may be due to the inherently high intubation rate within this subgroup and the limited sample size that did not show statistical significance.

This study has several strengths. Firstly, we utilized a generalized additive model, which takes into account the nonlinear relationship between fluid volume and outcomes, allowing for exploration of the optimal fluid volume range. Secondly, we gathered comprehensive data for all outcome events. Thirdly, although this study is retrospective, the inclusion criteria for septic patients strictly adhered to the Sepsis 3.0 definition. This means that even patients treated before 2016 were classified according to the latest definition. The diagnosis of HF was also based on clearly documented NYHA classifications in EMR, with all ambiguous cases excluded. Finally, our study exclusively focused on patients who were considered for standard care and fluid resuscitation management. Patients who were under comfort care or hospice care protocols were not included in this analysis to ensure that our findings reflect the impact of fluid resuscitation in patients who are candidates for aggressive treatment measures, and this research is based on real-world data.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1148gF7X]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

To determine the optimal fluid resuscitation volume in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

Methods

Septic patients with ADHF were identified from a tertiary urban medical center. The generalized additive models were used to explore the association between fluid resuscitation volume and endpoints, and the initial 3 h fluid resuscitation volume was divided into four groups according to this model: < 10 mL/kg group, ≥ 10 to ≤ 15 mL/kg group, > 15 to ≤ 20 mL/kg group, and > 20 mL/kg group. Logistic and Cox regression models were employed to explore the association between resuscitation volume and primary endpoint, in-hospital mortality, as well as secondary endpoints including 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, invasive ventilation, and ICU admission.

Results

A total of 598 septic patients with a well-documented history of HF were enrolled in the study; 405 patients (68.8%) had sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. Patients with NYHA functional class III and IV were 494 (83.9%) and 22 (3.74%), respectively. Resuscitation volumes above 20 mL/kg (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.31–8.15) or below 10 mL/kg (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.14–5.20) significantly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in septic patients, while resuscitation volumes between 15 and 20 mL/kg were not associated with the risk of in-hospital death in septic patients (OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.68–4.81). In the multivariable Cox models, the effect of resuscitation volume on 30-day and 1-year mortality in septic patients was similar to the effect on in-hospital mortality. Resuscitation volume exceeds 15 mL/kg significantly increased the risk of tracheal intubation, while fluid resuscitation volume was not associated with ICU admission in the septic patients. In septic patients with hypoperfusion, these fluid resuscitation volumes have similar effects on patient outcomes. This association was consistent across the three subgroups with worsened cardiac function, as well as in sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

Our study observed that an initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg in the first 3 h was optimal for early resuscitation in septic patients with ADHF, particularly those with worsened cardiac function. These results need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111xdtrT]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — most patients admitted with heart failure (HF) have clinical evidence of congestion without apparent hypoperfusion, and although right- and left-sided cardiac filling pressures are usually proportional in decompensation of chronic HF with low EF, up to 1 in 4 patients have a mismatch between right- and left-sided filling pressures. Elevated natriuretic peptides can help identify HF in the urgent care setting but with less utility in certain situations, including decreased sensitivity with obesity and HFpEF and decreased specificity in the setting of sepsis. Elevated serum lactate levels may indicate hypoperfusion and impending cardiogenic shock.

### Identification of intraoperative management strategies that have a differential effect on patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction: a retrospective cohort study [^113srS6L]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure is a devastating syndrome that often has a prognosis worse than many types of cancer. Management focuses on slowing progression, management of symptoms, and the appropriate use of mechanical support. Given its association with postoperative adverse events, surgery can be avoided when possible. However, with the consistent incidence and increasing survival, the number of patients with heart failure presenting for surgery continues to increase making it vital that we continue to improve our ability to care for these patients perioperatively.

Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) accounts for approximately half of heart failure diagnoses. The presence of reduced LVEF confirms at least stage B heart failure (structural heart disease without signs or symptoms) according to the latest ACC/AHA guidelines. This has been shown to be an important and independent risk factor for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, even if symptoms of heart failure are absent. Since there are no high-grade recommendations for how to manage patients with reduced LVEF undergoing non-cardiac surgery, anesthesiologists must extrapolate data from non-surgical studies to care for these patients.

Given differences between acute physiologic stress and long-term disease progression, extrapolating data from studies of the long-term management of heart failure to the perioperative period may lead to unintended consequences. Therefore, studies are needed to define the optimal perioperative management of these patients. The objective of this study was to identify any intraoperative medications or fluid administration strategies that affect patients with reduced ejection fraction differently than other patients. We accomplished this by finding management strategies that had a significant interaction with reduced LVEF after adjusting for other patient and surgical characteristics. We hypothesized that the use of certain medications or fluid management strategies are associated with a different level of risk for patients with reduced LVEF compared to those with a normal LVEF.

Materials and methods

Data source

All the data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III version 1.4) database, a free-available database containing more than 40,000 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. All the information in this database was anonymized to protect patients' privacy so the ethical approval statement and informed consent were not required. One author (certification number 38,653,219 for author Zhang) gained access to the database and extracted the data using PostgreSQL tools version 10.

Study population and outcome

Sepsis patients were retrieved in terms of sepsis-3 criteria: (1) patients were confirmed with infection by positive results of microbial culture; (2) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2. Heart failure patients were identified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 code, including 398.91, 402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 404.01, 404.03, 404.11, 404.13, 404.91, 404.93, 428.XX. We classified heart failure as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%), heart failure with mildly-reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 40 − 50%), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 50%) according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). For this study, only the first ICU admission was included in this study if patients were admitted in ICU more than once. Patients younger than 18 years or without sufficient data to calculate fluid balance were excluded. In addition, patients who spent less than 24 h in ICU, or underwent renal replacement therapy or cardiac surgery were excluded.

The outcomes were also extracted, including in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, as well as length of stay (LOS) in ICU and hospital. In-hospital mortality was defined as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, as well as LOS in ICU and hospital.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^115rZTMg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should vasopressor agent selection be personalized based on patient characteristics (e.g. home medicines and chronic disease conditions)? A decisional process to determine how to individualize vasopressor therapies does not currently exist. Identifying patient-specific factors affecting organ perfusion and vasopressor response in order to adjust perfusion targets is not commonly used in clinical practice. There is recognition that underlying chronic disease states may affect organ perfusion, yet there is a lack of evidence as to how to guide vasopressor selection based on patient-specific factors in the clinical setting.
2) What should the starting dose of norepinephrine be?
3) Is norepinephrine always the appropriate choice as a first-line vasopressor in sepsis? The data surrounding this recommendation are relatively scant. Is there a potential benefit to use vasopressin as a first-line therapy in select patients with septic shock in the broader population or in a select group of patients (e.g. atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease)?
4) Which agent should be considered as second-line therapy, and does this change based upon patient characteristics?
5) What are appropriate thresholds for adding a second vasopressor agent? Trials comparing adjunctive vasopressor strategies have evaluated different endpoints. Whether adding adjunctive therapies to norepinephrine improves safety and survival is largely unknown. Meaningful clinical endpoints aside from survival may potentially include (but are not limited to) need for renal replacement therapy, new arrhythmias, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, digit necrosis, and quality of life. This is vital to understand since adding an adjunctive agent to reduce the dose of norepinephrine without improving survival or reducing adverse events would result in increased costs, possibly without improving patient-centric clinical outcomes.
6) When should patients receive fluid resuscitation versus vasopressor initiation versus both?
7) When should angiotensin II be initiated? Although the ATHOS-3 trial established the efficacy of angiotensin II as a vasopressor agent to raise blood pressure, important questions remain regarding angiotensin II's role in clinical practice, primarily due to the lack of comparative data and potential safety concerns related to the higher rate of thromboembolism observed in clinical trials to date. Although an argument can be made for the benefits of multimodal vasopressor therapy, more outcome and comparative data are necessary both to determine if angiotensin II is clearly beneficial in subpopulations (such as potentially in patients requiring renal replacement therapy) or is potentially harmful when compared with a strategy that does not use this agent.
8) What is the role of phenylephrine, if any, in the management of sepsis?
9) What is the ideal target MAP in septic patients?
10) How do chronic comorbidities (hypertension, CKD), and baseline medications, impact both goal MAP and vasopressor response?
11) What is the cost effectiveness of different vasopressor strategies? Although cost of care has traditionally not been prioritized, it is a significant factor in the clinical environment where utility and efficiency are measured by stakeholders. Understanding that healthcare economics vary widely between countries, in an environment where healthcare costs are rapidly increasing, evaluations of vasopressors need to factor in costs.
12) How should vasopressor therapies be weaned?

### Pharmacological management of fluid overload [^11172Z4g]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment practice for the hypotensive patient with poor tissue perfusion is rapid volume resuscitation; in some scenarios, such as septic shock, this is performed with targeted goal-directed endpoints within 6 h of presentation. As a result, patients often develop significant positive fluid accumulation, which has been associated with poor outcomes above certain thresholds.

Methods

The aim of the current paper is to provide guidance for active pharmacological fluid management in the patient with, or at risk for, clinically significant positive fluid balance from either resuscitation for hypovolaemic shock or acute decompensated heart failure.

Results

We develop rationale for pharmacological fluid management targets (prevention of worsening fluid accumulation, achievement of slow vs rapid net negative fluid balance) in the context of phases of critical illness provided in the earlier Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 12 papers.

Fig. 2
Association between fluid resuscitation volume and in-hospital mortality among hypotensive patients with HF. A, C, E, and G represent the relationship between the resuscitation volume (in mL) at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively, and in-hospital. B, D, F, and H represent the relationship between the resuscitation volume (in mL/kg) at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively, and in-hospital mortality

Subsequently, patient fluid volumes ranged from < 10 mL/kg, ≥ 10 to ≤ 15 mL/kg, > 15 to ≤ 20 mL/kg, and > 20 mL/kg based on 3-h resuscitation volume and in-hospital mortality curves. Among these four groups, the in-hospital mortality rates for hypoperfusion patients were 94 (23.6%), 11 (13.9%), 16 (30.8%), and 26 (43.3%), respectively (Table 2).

Table 2
Demographics and clinical characteristics based on initial 3 h fluid resuscitation volumes (n = 405)

a Restricted to patients who survive more than 48 h

b Restricted to patients who survive more than 72 h

In unadjusted models, resuscitation volumes above 15 mL/kg was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to 10–15 mL/kg resuscitation volumes, for all septic patients and specifically within the hypotensive patient subset. Resuscitation volumes below 10 mL/kg in hypotensive patients were also linked to an elevated risk of in-hospital mortality. In the multivariable adjusted logistic regression models, fluid resuscitation between 15 and 20 mL/kg is no longer associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.81), while above 20 mL/kg (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.31 to 8.15) or below 10 mL/kg (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.20) still increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in all septic patients after adjusting for APACHE-II, age, gender, Charlson index, vasopressor use, antibiotic initiation time, lactate, and BNP. Similar results were observed in the hypotensive patient subset (Table 3).

P007 Increased rate of mechanical ventilation in septic patients with left ventricular dysfunction

A Newsome, S Smith, T Jones

The University of Georgia College of Pharmacy, Pharmacy, North Augusta, United States

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to characterize differences in sepsis management in patients with and without left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Septic patients with LV dysfunction have higher mortality, and limited guidance exists for sepsis management of patients with LV dysfunction. The possibility exists that the cornerstones of sepsis management may contribute to these poor outcomes.

Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted from May 2016 - January 2018 at two centers. Adult patients who had a diagnosis of sepsis, were treated with vasopressors for > 3 hours, and had an echocardiogram within 12 months were included. Patients were divided into two groups: reduced ejection fraction (EF) of < 40% and preserved EF defined as EF ≥ 40%. Information about patient outcomes and sepsis management were collected. The primary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation (MV). Categorical and continuous data were analyzed using the Chi-Squared and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively. The IRB has approved this project.

Results: A total of 37 patients with EF < 40% and 42 patients with EF ≥ 40% were included. No significant differences in fluid management, vasoactive agent maximum rate or duration, or steroid use were observed. Net fluid balance between low and preserved EF was positive 4.6 liters vs. 5.1 liters (p = 0.814), respectively. The number of patients that needed MV was higher in the low EF cohort (86% vs. 57%, p = 0.004), and this cohort had fewer MV-free days (20, IQR 0–25 vs. 24 (IQR 0–28), p = 0.064.

Conclusions: No significant differences were observed with regard to sepsis management, reflecting current guidelines. The significantly increased need for MV is a provocative result. A potential mechanism is the inability of a patient with reduced LV dysfunction to maintain appropriate cardiac and respiratory function in the face of fluid overload. Prospective analysis of the role of fluid balance in septic patients with LV dysfunction is warranted.

### Prevalence and predictors of sepsis death in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^114MNSgr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis as a Distinct Mode of Death

A key finding of our study is the distinct contribution of baseline patient characteristics to the prediction of sepsis, other noncardiovascular, progressive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. This implies that sepsis is a distinct mode of death and not simply a misclassification of other modes of death. Perhaps more importantly, by showing unique/specific risk markers for each mode of death, our observations suggest that more nuanced risk prediction could guide targeted interventions to improve survival. However, the primary aim of these analyses was to define whether mode‐specific risk marker profiles exist, so further work will be required to understand whether this knowledge can improve care. Importantly, our data do not imply that heart failure–directed care is unimportant to improving outcomes of people most at risk of sepsis death, or vice versa; indeed, heart failure status is likely to be a critical factor in survival from severe sepsis. Instead, our observations highlight prevention and/or treatment priorities to further improve outcomes of patient groups already established on contemporary evidence‐based heart failure therapy. It is also important to clarify that our data cannot be used to infer specific subtypes of sepsis death, such as those related primarily to respiratory failure versus multiorgan failure, but it is likely that sepsis deaths are heterogeneous.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study provides entirely novel insights regarding the prevalence, nature, and predictors of sepsis in people with CHF, with potentially important implications for how we can continue to improve survival. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of our study that will need to be addressed by future research. First, we cannot comment on whether increased sepsis incidence or case fatality underpins the association of our identified risk markers with sepsis death. This differentiation is important because it could inform us about the potential value of better sepsis prevention versus sepsis care. Second, the observational nature of our study prevents us from reaching causal inferences about the identified associations of risk markers. Third, it is possible that our data are not generalizable to all heart failure populations, particularly those with preserved ejection fraction, but the existing data from mixed CHF populations across the world provide some support for the high prevalence of sepsis death. Fourth, we do not have data on specific pathogens in most of our patients, reflecting the challenge in establishing this in many cases of respiratory tract infection. Finally, it remains unclear how preventing sepsis death would impact on other outcomes important to people with CHF, and valuable insights may be gained by studying changes in the quality of life of people with CHF surviving severe sepsis.

### Prevalence and predictors of sepsis death in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^114bDHo4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Advances in the management of cardiovascular disease have been associated with a progressive rise in the prevalence of chronic heart failure (CHF). 1 Similar advances in heart failure care have been associated with greater survival of people who develop heart failure. 2, 3, 4 Importantly, the reduced mortality of people with heart failure has also been associated with an increasing contribution of noncardiovascular modes of death. 2, 5, 6 Sepsis has been identified as a contributor to noncardiovascular death 6, 7 and hospitalization 8, 9 in mixed heart‐failure populations including people with preserved and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, which people are at greatest risk of sepsis death and whether a sepsis‐specific risk marker profile exists remain uncertain. We aimed to define the prevalence of sepsis death in ambulant CHF patients with reduced LVEF, define risk markers for sepsis death, and then contrast the risk marker profile of sepsis death with those of other competing modes.

### Fluid balance and cardiac function in septic shock as predictors of hospital mortality [^115vtBjs]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study location and patients

The study was conducted at Barnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University Medical Center (1,300 beds) in St. Louis, MO and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Washington University. Patients with septic shock having a transthoracic echocardiographic examination performed within 24 hours of the onset of septic shock between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2011 were eligible for this investigation. Patients were excluded if they had known pre-existing non-sepsis related cardiovascular compromise as defined by acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock or a history of congestive heart failure with a left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%; had a requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a ventricular assist device; or developed septic shock at an outside hospital requiring vasopressor and fluid management prior to transfer.

Study design

A retrospective cohort study was performed with the primary outcome being hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, total quantity of intravenous and enteral fluids administered and the prescription of appropriate initial antimicrobial treatment. For the purposes of determining compliance with early, goal-directed treatment guidelines and the timing of antibiotic administration, the time of septic shock onset was defined as the time that a vasopressor agent was first administered. All pertinent data were then collected relative to this time.

Data collection

Patients with septic shock were identified electronically by ICD9 codes for acute organ dysfunction and acute infection and by an active order for a vasopressor through the pharmacy database at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Data were collected retrospectively from automated patient medical records and pharmacy databases at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (MM, STM). Pertinent demographic, laboratory and clinical data were gathered including: age, gender, race, patient location at the time of septic shock onset, severity of illness based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, co-morbidities, Charlson co-morbidity score, site of the infection and positive cultures with sensitivities. Patient-specific factors starting at the time of septic shock onset were also collected including vital signs, central venous pressure (CVP), central venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (S CV O 2) and laboratory data. Information regarding the management of septic shock was recorded including adequate initial fluid resuscitation (AIFR), appropriate antimicrobial administration, corticosteroid administration and daily fluid balance.

### Assessment of outcomes in patients with heart failure and end-stage kidney disease after fluid resuscitation for sepsis and septic shock [^1169Qj74]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis fluid resuscitation is controversial, especially for patients with volume overload risk. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends a 30-mL/kg crystalloid fluid bolus for patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. Criticism of this approach includes excessive fluid resuscitation in certain patients.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of guideline-concordant fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis and heart failure (HF) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with sepsis who qualified for guideline-directed fluid resuscitation and concomitant HF or ESKD. Those receiving crystalloid fluid boluses of at least 30 mL/kg within 3 h of sepsis diagnosis were placed in the concordant group and all others in the nonconcordant group. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS); vasoactive medications and net volume over 24 h; new mechanical ventilation, new or increased volume removal, and acute kidney injury within 48 h; and shock-free survival at 7 days.

Results

One hundred twenty-five patients were included in each group. In-hospital mortality was 34.4% in the concordant group and 44.8% in the nonconcordant group (p = 0.1205). The concordant group had a shorter ICU LOS (7.6 vs. 10.5 days; p = 0.0214) and hospital LOS (12.9 vs. 18.3 days; p = 0.0163), but increased new mechanical ventilation (37.6 vs. 20.8%; p = 0.0052). No differences in other outcomes were observed.

Conclusions

Receipt of a 30-mL/kg fluid bolus did not affect outcomes in a cohort of patients with mixed types of HF and sepsis-induced hypoperfusion.

### Prevalence and predictors of sepsis death in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^117FDPgd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis of a large well‐characterized cohort with CHF and reduced LVEF shows that sepsis accounts for almost a quarter of deaths, making this the second most common mode of death after progressive heart failure. We also present the first‐ever analysis of sepsis death risk markers and show that this risk marker profile is distinct from other common modes of death. Importantly, our major observations were unchanged in sensitivity analyses restricted to people with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HF‐REF) defined using the most contemporary definitions (ie, LVEF < 40%). This may have major implications for strategies to further improve the outcomes of people with CHF and poses important questions about whether sepsis can be prevented or mitigated to improve net survival. More broadly, our analyses highlight the heterogeneous mortality of people with CHF, further emphasizing that more nuanced risk stratification and intervention may offer a more effective approach to improve overall survival.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1147aP1p]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Fluid resuscitation volume and invasive ventilation

Additional file 1: Figs. S5 and S6 demonstrate a clear linear correlation between the volume of fluid resuscitation and the need for invasive ventilation in septic patients as well as in the subgroup of hypotensive patients (P < 0.05). In the hypotensive subgroup, invasive ventilation accounted for 128 cases, which is equivalent to 31.6% of the total. Both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models consistently showed that resuscitation volumes above 20 mL/kg significantly increased the risk of endotracheal intubation (Additional file 1: Table S4).

Fluid resuscitation volume and ICU admission

In the unadjusted logistic regression model, there appears to be a correlation between fluid resuscitation volume and ICU admission. However, after adjusting for multiple variables, the initial fluid resuscitation volume is no longer associated with ICU admission, either in all septic patients or the hypotensive subgroup (Additional file 1: Table S5).

Subgroup analyses

Subsequently, subgroup analysis was conducted on sepsis-induced hypotensive patients based on NYHA classification, HFrEF, and BNP levels. The subgroups consisted of NYHA class III and IV, HFrEF (< 50%), and BNP > 4000. The results consistently supported the previously drawn conclusions regarding the effect of initial fluid resuscitation volume on various outcomes in these subgroups (Table 5). The Kaplan–Meier curves for each subgroup showed that the optimal resuscitation group had the lowest mortality rate, which was significantly different from the other resuscitation volume groups (Fig. 3). It is important to note that there was no significant difference in fluid resuscitation volume related to mechanical ventilation in the HFrEF < 50% subgroup (Table 5). However, the rate of mechanical ventilation in this specific subgroup was 39%.

Sensitivity analyses

In the sensitivity analysis, the impact of various initial fluid resuscitation volumes on in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission remained consistently in line with the previous findings. Additionally, the results within the subgroup of patients showed similar trends (Additional file 1: Tables S6–S11).

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — fluid bolus strategy beyond initial resuscitation: If fluid therapy beyond the initial 30 mL/kg administration is required, clinicians may use repeated small boluses guided by objective measures of stroke volume (SV) and/or cardiac output (CO). In post-cardiac surgery patients, fluid challenges of 4 mL/kg compared to 1 to 3 mL/kg increased sensitivity for detecting fluid responsiveness based on CO measurement. In resource-limited regions where CO or SV cannot be measured, a > 15% increase in pulse pressure during a passive leg-raise test for 60–90 seconds could indicate fluid responsiveness.

### Outcomes of CMS-mandated fluid administration among fluid-overloaded patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113sfvkK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The outcomes of large-volume IVF administration to septic shock patients with comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are uncertain and widely debated in the existing literature. Despite this uncertainty, CMS continues to recommend that 30 ml/kg of an intravenous crystalloid solution be administered to patients in septic shock starting within 3 h of presentation. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between adherence to this guideline and outcomes among patients whose underlying comorbidities present a risk of fluid overload.

Methods

Our search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus through November 5, 2021 to identify studies that evaluated clinical outcomes among septic patients with CHF/ESRD based on volume of fluid administered. The primary outcome measured was mortality at 30 days post-hospital discharge. Other outcomes included the rates of vasopressor requirements, invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, as well as length of stay in the intensive care unit and/or hospital. We used random effects meta-analysis when two or more studies reported the same outcome.

Results

We included five studies in the final meta-analysis, which comprised 5804 patients, 5260 (91%) of whom received non-aggressive fluid resuscitation, as defined by the studies' authors. Random-effects meta-analysis for all-cause mortality showed that aggressive fluid resuscitation was associated with statistically non-significant increased odds of mortality (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.88–2.3, P = 0.15, I² = 35%). There was no statistical association between volume of IVF administration and other outcomes evaluated.

Conclusion

Among septic shock patients with CHF and/or ESRD, administration of greater than or equal to 30 ml/kg IVF was associated with a non-significant increase in odds of mortality. All other outcomes measured were found to be non-significant, although there was a trend toward better outcomes among patients in the restricted-volume compared to the standard-volume IVF groups. Since this meta-analysis only included five observational studies, more studies are needed to guide an optimal volume and rate of fluid administration in this patient population.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — post-hospital follow-up after sepsis: For adults with sepsis or septic shock who developed new impairments, we recommend hospital discharge plans include follow-up with clinicians able to support and manage new and long-term sequelae (best practice statement), while There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on early post-hospital discharge follow-up compared to routine post-hospital discharge follow-up. The rationale notes that Hospital readmission within 90 days of discharge occurs in approximately 40% of sepsis survivors, and observational data from other populations associate early follow-up — early (within 7–14 days) after discharge in congestive heart failure or within 7 days with a primary care physician among older adults — with reduced or lower 30-day readmission; however, Three studies, one RCT and two observational studies in critical illness did not specifically evaluate sepsis, and the panel recommends follow-up with a provider after hospital discharge but is unable to make a recommendation for early (7–14 days) provider follow-up versus routine follow-up.

An international panel of experts developed the guideline, focusing on fluid resuscitation volume in adult critically ill patients with circulatory failure. Using the PICO format, questions were formulated, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

In adults with sepsis or septic shock, the guideline suggests administering up to 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloids in the initial phase, with adjustments based on clinical context and frequent reassessments (very low certainty of evidence). We suggest using an individualized approach in the optimization phase (very low certainty of evidence). No recommendation could be made for or against restrictive or liberal fluid strategies in the optimization phase (moderate certainty of no effect). For hemorrhagic shock, a restrictive fluid strategy is suggested after blunt trauma (moderate certainty) and penetrating trauma (low certainty), with fluid administration for non-traumatic hemorrhagic shock guided by hemodynamic and biochemical parameters (ungraded best practice). For circulatory failure due to left-sided cardiogenic shock, fluid resuscitation as the primary treatment is not recommended. Fluids should be administered cautiously for cardiac tamponade until definitive treatment and guided by surrogate markers of right heart congestion in acute pulmonary embolism (ungraded best practice). No recommendation could be made for circulatory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Conclusions

The panel made four conditional recommendations and four ungraded best practice statements. No recommendations were made for two questions. Knowledge gaps were identified, and suggestions for future research were provided.

### Sepsis, the administration of IV fluids, and respiratory failure: a retrospective analysis-SAIFR study [^11215eq2]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although resuscitation with IV fluids is the cornerstone of sepsis management, consensus regarding their association with improvement in clinical outcomes is lacking.

Research Question

Is there a difference in the incidence of respiratory failure in patients with sepsis who received guideline-recommended initial IV fluid bolus of 30 mL/kg or more conservative resuscitation of less than 30 mL/kg?

Study Design and Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical data conducted at an academic medical center in Omaha, Nebraska. We abstracted data from 214 patients with sepsis admitted to a single academic medical center between June 2017 and June 2018. Patients were stratified by receipt of guideline-recommended fluid bolus. The primary outcome was respiratory failure defined as an increase in oxygen flow rate or more intense oxygenation and ventilation support; oxygen requirement and volume were measured at admission, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and at discharge. Subgroup analyses were conducted in high-risk patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) as well as those with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Results

A total of 62 patients (29.0%) received appropriate bolus treatment. The overall rate of respiratory failure was not statistically different between patients who received appropriate bolus or did not (40.3% vs 36.8%; p = 0.634). Likewise, no differences were observed in time to respiratory failure (P = 0.645) or risk of respiratory failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7–1.7]; p = 0.774). Results were similar within the high-risk CHF and CKD subgroups.

Interpretation

In this single-center retrospective study, we found that by broadly defining respiratory failure as an increase in oxygen requirements, a conservative initial IV fluid resuscitation strategy did not correlate with decreased rates of hypoxemic respiratory failure.

### Early restrictive or liberal fluid management for sepsis-induced hypotension [^112ib99X]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study CLOVERS (original research) was published by National Heart and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the CLOVERS (original research) study, the trial question was: is restrictive fluid strategy superior to liberal fluid strategy in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension? In the CLOVERS (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CLOVERS (original research) study, the population was: 1563 patients (737 female, 826 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients within 4 hours of a suspected or confirmed infection and sepsis-induced hypotension. The key exclusion criteria were relapse of > 4 hours of meeting the criteria for sepsis-induced hypotension; elapse of > 24 hours since presentation at the hospital; previous receipt of > 3,000 mL of intravenous fluid during this episode; presence of fluid overload; severe volume depletion from nonseptic causes. In the CLOVERS (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 782 restrictive fluid strategy (early vasopressors, rescue fluids permitted for prespecified indications) n = 781 liberal fluid strategy (initial 2,000 mL intravenous infusion of isotonic crystalloid, followed by fluid boluses administered on the basis of clinical triggers). In the CLOVERS (original research) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from any causes before discharge home at day 90 (14% vs. 14.9%; ARD -0.9, 95% CI -4.4 to 2.6). In the CLOVERS (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the number of days free from organ-support therapy at 28 days (24 days vs. 23.6 days; AD 0.3 days, 95% CI -0.5 to 1.2) No significant difference in the number of days free from ventilator use at 28 days (23.4 days vs. 22.8 days; AD 0.6 days, 95% CI -0.4 to 1.6) No significant difference in the number of days free from RRT at 28 days (24.1 days vs. 23.9 days; AD 0.2 days, 95% CI -0.8 to 1.2). In the CLOVERS (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the CLOVERS (original research) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients within 4 hours of a suspected or confirmed infection and sepsis-induced hypotension, restrictive fluid strategy was not superior to liberal fluid strategy with respect to death from any causes before discharge home at day 90.

### Understanding how clinicians personalize fluid and vasopressor decisions in early sepsis management [^11379hZ4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our results suggest that these fluid volumes are ingrained in practice and guide resuscitation decisions, while other clinical factors appear to play a much smaller role in personalizing resuscitation decisions, at least on average. For example, history of heart failure and kidney failure have historically been associated with increased risk for fluid overload. However, in our study, history of kidney failure and receiving dialysis had a small association with fluid administration decisions while history of HFrEF had no association. This finding may reflect the fact that clinicians are willing to give fluids to patients with these comorbidities, which is potentially beneficial, given evidence that suggests fluids may decrease mortality in these patients. In contrast, respiratory failure has been associated with harm from fluid resuscitation in sepsis trials in lower-resource settings. Additionally, in the CLASSIC trial, there was a signal for potential harm among patients on respiratory support in the fluid-liberal group. Yet, in our survey, oxygen requirement and respiratory rate only had small associations with resuscitation decisions, outweighed by fluid volume. Finally, there is some evidence to support guiding fluid resuscitation by lactate clearance, as suggested in the SSC guidelines. Despite this guideline, we found that lactate trend was not associated with changes in clinical decision-making.

These findings may suggest that apart from fluid volume received, clinicians are not using clinical factors to personalize resuscitation decisions. However, there are several potential alternative explanations for this apparent lack of personalization (Table 2). Importantly, our study only provides an average measure of personalization, measuring effects in the same direction. However, clinicians may be using clinical factors to personalize care in more nuanced ways. Indeed, we observed a range of responses across cases, even in cases where respondents saw the same fluid volume received (eg, all 1 L), which suggests potential unmeasured personalization was occurring.

Table 2.
Limitations and Possible Explanations for the Finding of Lack of Personalization

There are also other tools besides clinical factors that can be used to personalize resuscitation. For example, dynamic measures of fluid-responsiveness may help determine when patients need more fluids vs vasopressors. While these tools have been validated to assess fluid-responsiveness, their role in improving patient outcomes in sepsis has not been well studied. Yet, in free-text responses, many respondents requested dynamic fluid-responsiveness measures (eg, point-of-care ultrasonography or noninvasive cardiac output monitoring), suggesting that clinicians are using these bedside tools. More work is needed to understand how dynamic tools are used in practice and to determine their association with patient outcomes.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^115fLWoS]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy: Heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP) and systolic blood pressure alone are poor indicators of fluid status, and dynamic measures have demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy at predicting fluid responsiveness, including passive leg raising with cardiac output (CO) measurement and stroke volume (SV)–based fluid challenges. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy was associated with reduced mortality (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.83), ICU length of stay (MD -1.16 days; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.36), and duration of mechanical ventilation (-2.98 hours; 95% CI, -5.08 to -0.89), although another meta-analysis found no significant difference in mortality versus standard resuscitative strategies. An RCT in Zambia using protocolized IV fluids guided by jugular venous pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial oxygen saturation only led to more fluids in the first 6 hours (median 3.5 L [IQR, 2.7–4.0] versus 2.0 L [IQR, 1.0–2.5]) and higher hospital mortality (48.1% versus 33%) than standard care.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

### Effect of an early resuscitation protocol on in-hospital mortality among adults with sepsis and hypotension: a randomized clinical trial [^11462DQo]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study SSSP-2 was published by Ben Andrews and colleagues in 2017 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the SSSP-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of an early resuscitation protocol in adults with sepsis and hypotension in resource-limited settings? In the SSSP-2 study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the SSSP-2 study, the population was: 209 patients (92 female, 117 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with sepsis and hypotension presenting to the emergency department in resource-limited settings. The key exclusion criteria were hypoxemia or severe tachypnea; gastrointestinal bleeding in the absence of fever; congestive HF exacerbation; ESRD; elevated jugular venous pressure; incarceration; indications for immediate surgery. In the SSSP-2 study, the interventions were: n = 106 early sepsis protocol (an early aggressive fluid strategy; blood transfusion and titratable dopamine when appropriate) n = 103 usual care (hemodynamic management determined by treating clinicians). In the SSSP-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in death in the hospital (48.1% vs. 33%; RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.05). In the SSSP-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in IV fluid in the 6 hours after presentation (3.5 L vs. 2 L; AD 1.2 L, 95% CI 1 to 1.5) Significant increase in vasopressor use (14.2% vs. 1.9%; AD 12.3%, 95% CI 5.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in death at day 28 (67% vs. 45.3%; RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.91). In the SSSP-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant difference in length of hospital stay (5 days vs. 7 days). In the SSSP-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with sepsis and hypotension presenting to the emergency department in resource-limited settings, early sepsis protocol was inferior to usual care with respect to death in the hospital.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^111Fo3yV]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Hemodynamic management — fluid management recommendations specify crystalloid preference and colloid avoidance as follows: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline for resuscitation (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using albumin in patients who received large volumes of crystalloids over using crystalloids alone (Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend against using starches for resuscitation (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis and septic shock, we suggest against using gelatin for resuscitation (Weak recommendation, moderate quality).

### Time course of fluid responsiveness in sepsis: the fluid challenge revisiting (FCREV) study [^114pqBy3]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Moreover, in the present study, we used crystalloids for FC according to international guidelines. Several studies suggest that in normo- or slightly hypovolemic patients, the volume efficacy of crystalloids is closed to 20–25% after 30 min of fluid infusion, due to a temporal shift of fluid toward interstitial compartment. This can explain the drop of VTI over time observed in TR that, in our hypothesis, are likely to be normovolemic. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, even non-significant, the E/E′ ratio is more elevated in NR and TR (7.9 and 6.6) as compared to PR (5.7) (Table 4).

Conversely to previous studies focusing on the time course of fluid effects, we observed that some patients exhibited a sustained response to fluid therapy that we called "persistent response to fluid therapy". In these patients, the hemodynamic values did not return to baseline 30 min after the start of the infusion. In PR, we could hypothesize that the efficacy of fluid is probably increased because of a significant drop in blood volume leading to very low values of hydrostatic pressure. Hahn and coworkers have nicely demonstrated that the volume efficacy of crystalloids was directly affected by blood volume status. In healthy volunteers undergoing blood removal, the elimination rate of a Ringer's solution from the blood compartment was 4-fold higher in volunteers with no blood removal as compared to the same volunteers experiencing a 900-ml blood withdrawal. This suggests that the fluid efficacy of crystalloids may be as high as 80 to 100% in case of absolute blood volume reduction. As these results were mainly observed in a model of controlled hemorrhage in healthy volunteers, we cannot extrapolate to ICU patients, in whom a 80–100% fluid efficacy of crystalloids is unlikely to be observed.

It is unlikely that vasopressors can influence the type of fluid response, transient or persistent, in the present study as no difference was observed between TR and PR in terms of vasopressor doses.

Finally, in the present population with a majority of patients with normal LVEF (Table 2), the absolute VTI value at baseline is probably of particular importance for explaining the differences between TR, PR, and NR groups in terms of fluid responsiveness status. Figure 4 shows a significant difference at baseline VTI between the three groups. In the PR group, baseline VTI value is significantly lower (14 cm) than in TR and NR, suggesting that absolute VTI could help to detect PR.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: diagnosis and management [^113V7kVs]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, also referred to as diastolic heart failure, causes almost one-half of the 5 million cases of heart failure in the United States. It is more common among older patients and women, and results from abnormalities of active ventricular relaxation and passive ventricular compliance, leading to a decline in stroke volume and cardiac output. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction should be suspected in patients with typical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, weakness, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema) and signs (S3 heart sound, displaced apical pulse, and jugular venous distension) of chronic heart failure. Echocardiographic findings of normal ejection fraction with impaired diastolic function confirm the diagnosis. Measurement of natriuretic peptides is useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the ambulatory setting. Multiple trials have not found medications to be an effective treatment, except for diuretics. Patients with congestive symptoms should be treated with a diuretic. If hypertension is present, it should be treated according to evidence-based guidelines. Exercise and treatment by multidisciplinary teams may be helpful. Atrial fibrillation should be treated using a rate-control strategy and appropriate anticoagulation. Revascularization should be considered for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and coronary artery disease. The prognosis is comparable to that of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and is worsened by higher levels of brain natriuretic peptide, older age, a history of myocardial infarction, and reduced diastolic function.

### Misconceptions and facts about heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^11544xUj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a significant driver of morbidity and mortality. There are common misconceptions regarding the disease processes underlying heart failure and best practices for therapy. The terms heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are not interchangeable terms. Key therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction target the underlying disease processes, not the left ventricular ejection fraction alone. The absence of congestion does not rule out heart failure. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis can also present with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A rise in serum creatinine in acute heart failure exacerbation is not associated with tubular injury. Guideline directed medical therapy should be continued during acute exacerbations of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and should be started in the same hospitalization in new diagnoses. Marginal blood pressure is not a relative contraindication to optimal guideline directed medical therapy. Guideline directed medical therapy should be continued even if ejection fraction improves. There are other therapies that provide significant benefit besides the four key medications in guideline directed medical therapy.

Epinephrine has been suggested as second or third-line vasopressor for patients with septic shock, and in an indirect comparison a network meta-analysis did not find any significant difference between epinephrine and vasopressin in terms of mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.47–1.88). Epinephrine might be useful in refractory septic shock patients with myocardial dysfunction.

### Flexible diuretic titration in chronic heart failure: where is the evidence? [^115S2ogt]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Several sets of heart failure (HF) consensus/guideline statements support the use of a flexible diuretic dosing regimen for HF outpatient management of fluid overload-related signs and symptoms. However, despite the widespread acceptance of such an approach, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach in improving clinical outcomes is unknown. The primary objective of this manuscript was to summarize and review the evidence supporting the use of a flexible diuretic regimen in the management of outpatient heart failure patients.

Methods and Results

A systematic review was performed, and 9 studies were identified relevant to the question of flexible diuretic titration in the setting of chronic heart failure. Among the 9 studies, 5 were randomized. Three of the randomized trials included flexible diuretic titration as part of a broader multifaceted disease management program, and only 2 were designed to specifically evaluate the sole contribution of flexible diuretic titration. Collectively, data from all of the studies reviewed supported the idea that flexible and individualized diuretic dosing is potentially associated with reduced emergency room visits, reduced rehospitalization, and improved quality of life in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction.

Conclusions

To date, only 2 randomized clinical studies were identified that were designed to determine the effects of a flexible diuretic dosing regimen in outpatient HF patients with reduced ejection fraction. Data are lacking in HF patients with preserved ejection fraction. There is a critical need to test this strategy in well designed prospective randomized clinical trials.

### Association of positive fluid balance at discharge after sepsis management with 30-day readmission [^112MoL79]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Although early fluid administration has been shown to lower sepsis mortality, positive fluid balance has been associated with adverse outcomes. Little is known about associations in non-intensive care unit settings, with growing concern about readmission from excess fluid accumulation in patients with sepsis.

Objective

To evaluate whether positive fluid balance among non-critically ill patients with sepsis was associated with increased readmission risk, including readmission for heart failure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, among 57 032 non-critically ill adults hospitalized for sepsis at 21 hospitals across Northern California. Kaiser Permanente Northern California is an integrated health care system with a community-based population of more than 4.4 million members. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1 to December 31, 2019.

Exposures

Intake and output net fluid balance (I/O) measured daily and cumulatively at discharge (positive vs negative).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 30-day readmission. The secondary outcomes were readmission stratified by category and mortality after living discharge.

Results

The cohort included 57 032 patients who were hospitalized for sepsis (28 779 women [50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 73.7 [15.5] years). Compared with patients with positive I/O (40 940 [71.8%]), those with negative I/O (16 092 [28.2%]) were older, with increased comorbidity, acute illness severity, preexisting heart failure or chronic kidney disease, diuretic use, and decreased fluid administration volume. During 30-day follow-up, 8719 patients (15.3%) were readmitted and 3639 patients (6.4%) died. There was no difference in readmission between patients with positive vs negative I/O (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95–1.05). No association was detected between readmission and I/O using continuous, splined, and quadratic function transformations. Positive I/O was associated with decreased heart failure-related readmission (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.71–0.91]) and increased 30-day mortality (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.15–1.31]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this large observational study of non-critically ill patients hospitalized with sepsis, there was no association between positive fluid balance at the time of discharge and readmission. However, these findings may have been limited by variable recording and documentation of fluid intake and output; additional studies are needed to examine the association of fluid status with outcomes in patients with sepsis to reduce readmission risk.

### Utilizing left ventricular outflow tract velocity changes to predict fluid responsiveness in septic patients: a case report [^1112W2Lu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Toxin-mediated vasodilation in the sepsis syndrome can lead to end-organ dysfunction and shock. Assessing for fluid responsiveness and preload optimization with intravenous fluids is a central tenet in the management of sepsis. Aggressive fluid administration can lead to pulmonary edema and heart failure, whereas premature inotropic or vasopressor support can worsen organ perfusion. Inferior vena cava ultrasonography is commonly used to assess for fluid responsiveness but has multiple limitations.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^111pLVtd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Early liberal fluid therapy for sepsis patients is not harmful: hydrophobia is unwarranted but drink responsibly [^115prosF]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

TITRATION OF FLUIDS — A WORK IN PROGRESS

Titration of fluid therapy is performed with numerous methodologies. Frequently, more than one method is required to make an accurate assessment. History, physical examination, dynamic, static and volumetric devices, and ultrasound and metabolic variables can be used, each with certain limitations. Inherent in measuring intravascular pressures is the inference that pressure equals volume. There are many instances for which the pressure within an intracardiac chamber may be elevated and the intravascular volume status may be diminished. The goal is to infuse "adequate" volume to restore perfusion before the onset of irreversible tissue damage without raising cardiac filling pressure to a level that produces hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Hemodynamic monitoring used to accomplish these goals can vary and have not been shown to have outcomes superiority. Although much maligned as a predictor of fluid responsiveness, the general use of CVP in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock has been associated with improved outcomes.

For example, a patient with a CVP of 30 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70 mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats/min, lactate of 5 mM/L, and normal hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation and Sc 2 of 44% would get an inotrope. Interestingly, this scenario is associated with increased fluid administration because the CVP is lowered with improved ventricular compliance. A patient with a CVP of 4 mm Hg, MAP of 70 mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats/min, lactate of 5 mM/L, and normal hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation and Sc 2 of 44% would get fluid therapy. If CVP was taken in isolation in the first scenario, one would not assume fluid therapy is indicated and some may mistakenly use a diuretic. An elevated CVP has been associated with increased mortality as an interpretation of volume overload when in reality it may be myocardial suppression. Thus, using all endpoints in an algorithmic approach is the foundation of a comprehensive resuscitation. The discussion regarding CVP is best summarized by Sondergaard et al who stated:

"Knowledge of the CVP is essential for the measurement of the volume state, the performance of the heart and the SVR. It enters considerations of heart, volume and power efficiency. The CVP provides a floating ground for the differential measurement of intravascular pressures. It does not inherently measure preload or the volume state but its measurement is essential to their calculation. Once the above principles are understood, precise control of the circulation becomes a straightforward mathematically predictable process".

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^117XB13Z]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Step 1. Simultaneous initiation of a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor

Based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials, which of the foundational agents should be initiated as the first step? In our view, the most serious and unexpected complication of heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction is sudden cardiac death, and the most effective and rapidly‐acting means of preventing such death is beta‐adrenergic blockade, presumably because beta‐blockers interfere with catecholamine‐related ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Additionally, among the four foundational drug classes, beta‐blockers are most likely to exert favourable effects on left ventricular remodelling during long‐term treatment, yielding important recovery of a depressed ejection fraction. However, for beta‐blockers to be initiated safely (regardless of their position in the sequence), physicians should ensure that patients are clinically euvolaemic before the start of treatment and that concurrently administered diuretics are promptly intensified if fluid retention (as evidenced by weight gain) occurs. Failure to do so may explain why initiation of beta‐blockade can result in early worsening of heart failure, which can be avoided (even in patients with severe symptoms) if clinical euvolaemia is achieved and maintained.

Because of the predilection of beta‐blockers to cause fluid retention, we favour a strategy where beta‐blockers are combined with an SGLT2 inhibitor as the first step in drug sequencing. As a result of their actions on sodium and glucose transport in the proximal renal tubule, SGLT2 inhibitors promote a short‐term osmotic diuresis, which may contribute to the established ability of this drug class to reduce worsening heart failure events, a benefit that is seen rapidly following initiation of treatment. This early effect may help to minimize the risks of fluid retention that can be seen following initiation of treatment with a beta‐blocker. SGLT2 inhibitors also exert a striking nephroprotective effect, as evidenced by a slowing of the decline in glomerular filtration rate during long‐term therapy. This favourable effect on kidney function is especially important since several other foundational drugs (e.g. angiotensin receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) often act to worsen renal function in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Importantly, treatment with a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor does not require specialized safety monitoring or laboratory testing. As a result, the ability of patients to tolerate a combination of a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor can generally be fully established within 2 weeks of starting outpatient treatment with both classes of drugs.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc 2). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

### Management and outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with sepsis [^1164V9UN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and right heart failure. Sepsis is the second most common cause of in-hospital death in PAH patients. Recent data suggests that about 25% of patients with PAH who present for sepsis will die while in the hospital. Prompt recognition and treatment of sepsis is vital in the management of this high-risk condition.

Sepsis causes numerous systemic changes with adverse effects on the cardiac and pulmonary systems. These changes include decreased right ventricular preload, increased right ventricular afterload, and reduced contractility, all in the setting of increased myocardial oxygen demand. Each of these factors are further exacerbated in patients with PAH, with unique implications for management. Current management of sepsis in PAH patients is based on expert opinion rather than clinical data, and includes treating the underlying etiology, optimizing preload, reducing right ventricular afterload, and supporting myocardial function to achieve adequate systemic perfusion. Decisions around fluid management are particularly challenging in PAH patients with sepsis. Fluid resuscitation is recommended as part of initial resuscitation to restore preload in septic patients. However, differentiating sepsis from other causes of acute on chronic right ventricular dysfunction is challenging given the often non-specific signs in early sepsis in patients with PAH. Furthermore, administering fluids to increase preload risks worsening right ventricular dilatation, ventricular interdependence, and coronary perfusion in the setting of sepsis-induced increased PVR. This presents a major challenge in the management of sepsis in PAH patients as right ventricular volume overload can lead to impaired cardiac output, with catastrophic implications for the pulmonary and systemic circulations.

Currently, there is little data describing clinical characteristics or treatment strategies for sepsis in this acutely ill population. Current treatment recommendations for PAH patients presenting with sepsis are based on expert opinion rooted in clinical practice or the results of registry or administrative database studies with incompletely characterized cohorts, and so the recommendations are frequently vague or lack supporting data. This retrospective study investigates the treatment approaches and outcomes in a well-characterized cohort of patients with PAH verified by right heart catheterization who presented with sepsis between 2013 and 2022, with a particular focus on initial fluid resuscitation. We hypothesized that PAH patients would receive less fluids and that increased fluid resuscitation would be associated with worse outcomes.

Initial resuscitation — timing, volume, and assessment approach: Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and "we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately" (Best practice statement). For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, "we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation" (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, "we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone" (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with dynamic parameters including response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography. A retrospective analysis "showed that failure to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution of hypotension and increased length of stay in ICU".

Data Availability

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made freely available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure because the complete study data set contains potentially identifying data; however, data will be made available by the corresponding author to other researchers who have appropriate ethical approval and data protection arrangements.

Study Design

As described in our earlier publications, we conducted a prospective cohort study with the predefined aim of identifying prognostic markers in patients with CHF and LVEF, receiving contemporary evidence‐based therapy 10, 11; the aim of this analysis of the cohort study was to specifically focus on sepsis‐related death. Inclusion in the study required the presence of stable signs and symptoms of CHF for at least 3 months, age ≥ 18 years, and LVEF ≤ 45% on transthoracic echocardiography. Between June 2006 and December 2014, consecutive patients attending specialist cardiology clinics (secondary and tertiary referral) in 4 UK hospitals were approached, and 1802 patients provided written informed consent. The Leeds West Research Ethics Committee gave ethical approval, and the investigation conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

As described previously, 11 details of medical history were collected at recruitment, and symptomatic status was defined using the New York Heart Association classification. Venous blood was collected at study recruitment for measurement of electrolyte concentrations and assessment of renal function and hematological parameters; these tests were performed in the local hospital chemical pathology laboratories. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease method, as detailed in our earlier description of this cohort study. 11 Two‐dimensional echocardiography was performed according to The American Society of Echocardiography recommendations. Resting heart rate was measured using 12‐lead ECGs. Prescribed doses of loop diuretics, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and β‐blockers were collected at study recruitment. Total daily doses of β‐blocker, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blocker if used instead of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors), and loop diuretic were expressed relative to the maximal licensed dose of bisoprolol, ramipril, and furosemide, respectively, as previously published. 11 Receipt of cardiac resynchronization therapy or an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator was assessed during the 6‐month period after recruitment.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

Nonpharmacological management — fluid restriction for hyponatremia in advanced heart failure carries a Class of Recommendation 2b and Level of Evidence C-LD: For patients with advanced HF and hyponatremia, the benefit of fluid restriction to reduce congestive symptoms is uncertain. Supportive text notes that in a registry study of hyponatremia in acute decompensated HF, fluid restriction only improved hyponatremia marginally; a registered dietitian–guided fluid and sodium restriction intervention improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were not in stage D HF, and fluid restriction improved quality of life (QOL) in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with HFrEF and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (NYHA class I to IV); however, in a meta-analysis of RCTs, restricted fluid intake compared with free fluid consumption did not result in reduced hospitalization or mortality rates, changes in thirst, the duration of intravenous diuretic use, serum creatinine, or serum sodium levels, and the validity of a prior trial supporting clinical benefits of fluid restriction is in serious question.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^113zjDpi]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Current research suggests equipoise between a tightly restrictive or more liberal resuscitation strategy for patients with sepsis but data is lacking on a wider range of resuscitative practices.

Findings: In this retrospective analysis of 190,682 ICU patients with sepsis and septic shock, we found that being resuscitated by a physician who on average uses a moderate amount of IV fluid on the first day of care is associated with reduced mortality (2.5% lower) compared with patients resuscitated with either a very low or very high volume of IV fluid.

Meaning: A moderate approach to IV fluid is associated with decreased sepsis mortality and should be tested in future randomized controlled trials.

Since IV hypotonic saline mixed with sodium bicarbonate was first administered during the 1832 London cholera pandemic, physicians have sought to use IV fluids to restore intravascular circulating volume, improve organ perfusion, and resuscitate critically ill patients. Fluid administration practices used to resuscitate patients with sepsis have evolved over time, with significant changes in clinical practice occurring over the last three decades. Following the publication of the Rivers trial in 2001, the apparent benefit of early goal-directed therapy made high-volume IV fluid resuscitation widely popular for patients with sepsis and septic shock. The evolution in the resuscitation culture from a relatively low-volume to a high-volume strategy was swift. Throughout the 2000s, it was not uncommon for patients with sepsis to receive more than 10 L of IV fluid within the first 24 hours of care. Not long thereafter observational studies associated positive fluid balances with increased rates of respiratory failure and mortality. In the early 2010s, with growing concern that high-volume resuscitation was causing harm, there was a reevaluation of what had become accepted dogma. Clinical uncertainty surrounding the optimal IV fluid resuscitation strategy lead to large practice variation between physicians and hospitals. This phenomena is observed both in sepsis and in a variety of medical conditions across specialties. Some physicians continued to employ high-volume fluid resuscitation while others adopted a more restrictive approach, giving less than the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's recommended 30 mL/kg fluid bolus. Two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2022 and 2023 compared a restrictive vs. liberal IV fluid management strategy for patients with sepsis associated hypotension. Neither study demonstrated a benefit in mortality, use of vasopressors, or mechanical ventilation for either approach.

Fluid balance in sepsis and septic shock — restrictive versus liberal strategies after initial resuscitation: Recommendation 45 states "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock who still have signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after initial resuscitation", with the remark that "Fluid resuscitation should be given only if patients present with signs of hypoperfusion". The rationale notes that "The four largest clinical trials in sepsis resuscitation used moderate to large amounts of fluids in the first 72 hours", with Rivers administering "over 13 L of fluids" and ProCESS, ARISE and ProMISe "approximately 7 to 8 L in the usual care groups"; recent evidence "suggests that IV fluids used to restore organ perfusion may damage vascular integrity and lead to organ dysfunction", and observational and African data have shown an "association of high-volume fluid resuscitation and increased mortality", though generalizability is limited by comorbidities and resource constraints.

### Fluid therapy for critically ill adults with sepsis: a review… [^112HKtz6]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance Approximately 20% to 30% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit have sepsis. While fluid therapy typically begins in the emergency department, intravenous fluids in the intensive care unit are an essential component of therapy for sepsis. Observations. For patients with sepsis, intravenous fluid can increase cardiac output and blood pressure, maintain or increase intravascular fluid volume, and deliver medications. Fluid therapy can be conceptualized as 4 overlapping phases from early illness through resolution of sepsis: resuscitation; optimization; stabilization; and evacuation.

Among 3723 patients with sepsis who received 1 to 2 L of fluid, 3 randomized clinical trials reported that goal-directed therapy administering fluid boluses to attain a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, vasopressors to attain a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 to 90 mm Hg, and red blood cell transfusions or inotropes to attain a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70% did not decrease mortality compared with unstructured clinical care. Among 1563 patients with sepsis and hypotension who received 1 L of fluid, an RCT reported that favoring vasopressor treatment did not improve mortality compared with further fluid administration. Another RCT reported that among 1554 patients in the intensive care unit with septic shock treated with at least 1 L of fluid compared with more liberal fluid administration, restricting fluid administration in the absence of severe hypoperfusion did not reduce mortality. An RCT of 1000 patients with acute respiratory distress during the evacuation phase reported that limiting fluid administration and administering diuretics improved the number of days alive without mechanical ventilation compared with fluid treatment to attain higher intracardiac pressure, and it reported that hydroxyethyl starch significantly increased the incidence of kidney replacement therapy compared with saline, Ringer lactate, or Ringer acetate. Conclusions and Relevance Fluids are an important component of treating patients who are critically ill with sepsis. Although optimal fluid management in patients with sepsis remains uncertain, clinicians should consider the risks and benefits of fluid administration in each phase of critical illness, avoid use of hydroxyethyl starch, and facilitate fluid removal for patients recovering from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Positive fluid balance after sepsis management and 30-day readmission… [^114aAwjN]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Meaning No association was found between positive fluid balance and readmission in this large observational study of non–critically ill patients with sepsis, but further investigation is needed. Importance Although early fluid administration has been shown to lower sepsis mortality, positive fluid balance has been associated with adverse outcomes. Little is known about associations in non–intensive care unit settings, with growing concern about readmission from excess fluid accumulation in patients with sepsis. Objective To evaluate whether positive fluid balance among non–critically ill patients with sepsis was associated with increased readmission risk, including readmission for heart failure. Design, Setting, and Participants. No association was detected between readmission and I/O using continuous, splined, and quadratic function transformations. Positive I/O was associated with decreased heart failure–related readmission and increased 30-day mortality. Sepsis is a leading cause of hospital death and readmission in the United States. 1–6 Prior work has suggested that early intravenous fluid administration during sepsis hospitalization is associated with lower mortality, even among patients considered to be at risk for fluid overload, such as those with chronic kidney disease or heart failure. 7 Thus, adequate fluid administration during the early phase of sepsis care is recommended in current guidelines.
8. At the same time, a growing body of evidence suggests that excess fluid accumulation is harmful for hospitalized patients, with many concerned about positive fluid balance in sepsis being associated with adverse in-hospital and postsepsis sequelae. 9–21 Positive fluid balance in critically ill patients has been associated with increased mortality, 9–14 and fluid-restrictive strategies have resulted in improved outcomes for this population.

15–18 However, positive fluid balance during hospitalization for sepsis is widely recognized as a surrogate measure of illness severity and thus may be less amenable to practice change. 19–21. In addition, many are concerned about the potential that aggressive fluid resuscitation among patients with sepsis is associated with subsequent rehospitalization. 23, 24 For example, heart failure is a leading diagnosis among patients with sepsis who are readmitted, 25 yet the association of interventions such as diuretics with net fluid balance and readmission risk in patients with sepsis remains poorly understood. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the association between fluid balance and readmission, yet it is plausible that conservative fluid management may be associated with considerable postdischarge benefit.

We therefore undertook this study to evaluate whether positive fluid balance among non–critically ill patients with sepsis was associated with increased readmission risk, including readmission for heart failure. We sought to test the association between net fluid balance at discharge and 30-day readmission and additionally to evaluate if readmission characteristics differ by net fluid balance during the preceding hospitalization for sepsis. To test the hypothesis that negative I/O at discharge primarily reduces the likelihood of heart failure–related readmission, we performed multivariable competing risk survival analysis, with death and reasons for readmission as competing risks. We adjusted for the same covariates identified in the final model that were used for the primary outcome.

### Treatment of heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction… [^117SJUbN]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In this network meta-analysis, 19 randomized clinical trials enrolling 20 633 patients with HFpEF or HFmrEF were included. Compared with placebo, no included drug classes were associated with a reduced risk of death, but sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were associated with a significant decrease in hospital admission for HF; SGLT2 inhibitors were the optimal drug class for decreasing the risk of admission for HF. Meaning The results of this study suggest that the incremental use of combinations of SGLT2 inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors–angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers was associated with accumulative benefits in HF hospitalization rather than all-cause death among patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF.

Importance In recent years, significant progress has been made in the pharmacologic treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but there is still insufficient evidence for drug therapy for HF with preserved ejection fraction and mildly reduced ejection fraction. Results In this analysis, 19 randomized clinical trials, including 20 633 patients with HF and an ejection fraction of 40% or more, without a remarkable risk of bias were included. Compared with placebo, no treatments were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause death or cardiovascular death. SGLT2 inhibitors, ARNIs, and MRAs were associated with a significant decrease in the risk of HF hospitalization compared with placebo, and SGLT2 inhibitors were the optimal drug class in terms of reducing the risk for HF admission.

Sensitivity analysis results demonstrated a progressive decrease in the risk of HF admission and an advance in mean rank associated with the increasing use of drug classes. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this study suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors were the optimal drug class for HFpEF and HFmrEF, consistent with the most recent guideline recommendation. The incremental use of combinations of SGLT2 inhibitors, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and β-blockers may be associated with accumulative benefits in HF hospitalization rather than all-cause death among patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF. by US guidelines because of their marginal benefits regarding HF hospitalization. 4 Recently, a large clinical trial found that, for patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF, empagliflozin significantly improved the primary composite end point of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death compared with placebo, which was attributed to a decrease in HF hospitalizations. without a significant decrease in mortality.

7 Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors have been recommended for patients with HFpEF or HFmrEF in preference to other drug classes in the latest US guideline. 4 To our knowledge, there have been no head-to-head studies comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with other HF drug classes for this population. In eFigure 4 in the Supplement, the ranking probabilities for all interventions for 3 outcomes are demonstrated. The rankogram plot for HF hospitalization showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were most likely the optimal treatment, followed by ARNIs and MRAs, which was consistent with the rank of estimated points. This trend was not observed for all-cause mortality. As shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement, ASIs plus β-blockers plus SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of HF hospitalization compared with ASIs, β-blockers.
