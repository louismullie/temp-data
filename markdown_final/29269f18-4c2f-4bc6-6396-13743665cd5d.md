## Question

Hyperammonia cause mental status change

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hyperammonemia causes mental status changes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic plausibility of ammonia as a neurotoxin. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence across populations and etiologies. Next, I will examine dose-response and severity thresholds. After that, I need to consider confounders and exceptions where ammonia may not correlate with encephalopathy. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline diagnostic and therapeutic implications with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic plausibility. Ammonia is a diffusible neurotoxin that crosses the blood–brain barrier and is normally detoxified in the brain primarily by astrocytes via glutamine synthetase; when overwhelmed, glutamine accumulates, driving osmotic swelling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and excitotoxicity, which together produce encephalopathy and cerebral edema, so the biological rationale is strong [^5925391b] [^7e572a9e] [^f2d3fd0b].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence across settings. In urea cycle disorders, hyperammonemia is the direct driver of acute encephalopathy with lethargy, vomiting, seizures, and coma, and outcomes correlate with peak ammonia and duration of hyperammonemic coma, underscoring causality rather than mere association [^baa37a16] [^bfcf23ef]. In hepatic encephalopathy, while inflammation and other factors modulate severity, hyperammonemia remains central to pathogenesis and is consistently elevated in overt HE, with guidelines recommending ammonia measurement in encephalopathy with liver disease to support diagnosis and exclude alternatives when low [^a2338d78] [^5925391b]. In drug-induced cases, valproate and topiramate can precipitate hyperammonemic encephalopathy even without liver failure, and symptoms resolve with drug withdrawal and ammonia reduction, reinforcing a causal link in those contexts [^4cc6684d] [^5c8a73c8].

> I should confirm dose-response and severity thresholds. Symptoms generally scale with ammonia concentration, with early neuropsychiatric changes appearing around 60–100 µmol/L and severe encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and herniation risk rising as levels exceed 200–300 µmol/L, particularly in acute liver failure and UCD crises; this pattern supports a graded neurotoxic effect rather than an all-or-none phenomenon [^8c237043] [^9e4fc5cf] [^19a5abc2]. Hold on, I should verify that these thresholds are supported by guidelines and observational data; yes, pediatric and critical care guidance consistently cite > 150–200 µmol/L as high risk and > 300–400 µmol/L as an indication for urgent extracorporeal clearance, aligning with clinical experience of rapid deterioration at higher levels [^baa37a16] [^05098c40].

> But wait, what if ammonia is high and the patient is not encephalopathic, or vice versa. I need to check for exceptions and confounders. In acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, initial ammonia correlates poorly with encephalopathy, likely due to alternative mechanisms of brain injury, so a normal or mildly elevated ammonia does not exclude severe encephalopathy in that specific context [^883976f4]. In chronic liver disease, inflammation, infection, and portosystemic shunting modulate susceptibility, and a normal ammonia can argue against HE when the pretest probability is uncertain, so I should not overinterpret a single value without clinical context [^a2338d78] [^6a6dbffc]. Additionally, transient postictal hyperammonemia can occur after seizures and may not reflect a primary encephalopathic process, so timing and history matter [^5078c5d0].

> Let me synthesize. Yes, hyperammonemia causes mental status changes via direct neurotoxic effects on astrocytes and neuronal networks, with clinical manifestations ranging from subtle cognitive slowing to coma, and the severity correlates with the height and duration of ammonia elevation; however, the relationship is modified by host factors, comorbidities, and the underlying etiology, so ammonia is necessary but not always sufficient to explain encephalopathy in every scenario [^5925391b] [^7e572a9e] [^a2338d78].

> I should double-check the practical implications for diagnosis and management. In any patient with unexplained encephalopathy, obtundation, or seizures — especially with risk factors such as liver disease, UCD, valproate or topiramate use, high protein load, or postoperative states — measuring ammonia is indicated, using proper pre-analytical handling to avoid spurious elevations, and interpreting results in clinical context rather than in isolation [^e5a4a2bc] [^7abf36e4]. If hyperammonemia is confirmed, urgent ammonia-lowering therapy is warranted, including stopping protein intake, providing glucose and insulin to suppress catabolism, using nitrogen scavengers, and escalating to hemodialysis or CRRT when levels are severely elevated or neurologic status is deteriorating, because rapid reduction mitigates cerebral edema and improves outcomes [^baa37a16] [^05098c40] [^ed20ef26].

---

Hyperammonemia causes mental status changes through **astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema** [^5925391b] from glutamine accumulation, and by **disrupting neurotransmission** via altered glutamate, GABA, and serotonin signaling [^f2d3fd0b]. Clinically, this presents as confusion, lethargy, and coma, with severity correlating to ammonia levels and duration of exposure [^8c237043] [^baa37a16]. Early recognition and rapid ammonia reduction are critical to prevent irreversible brain injury [^bfcf23ef] [^ed20ef26].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hyperammonemia to mental status changes

### Astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema

- **Glutamine accumulation**: Ammonia is detoxified in astrocytes by glutamine synthetase, forming glutamine; excess glutamine increases intracellular osmolarity, causing astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema [^5925391b] [^7e572a9e].
- **Osmotic gliopathy**: Swollen astrocytes disrupt the blood-brain barrier and cerebral blood flow, contributing to encephalopathy [^5925391b] [^2281cbd2].
- **Cerebral edema**: Edema compresses microvessels, reducing perfusion and worsening neurodysfunction [^notfound].

---

### Neurotransmitter dysregulation

- **Glutamatergic excitotoxicity**: Elevated ammonia increases extracellular glutamate, causing excitotoxicity and neuronal injury [^f2d3fd0b].
- **GABAergic inhibition**: Ammonia enhances GABAergic tone, contributing to lethargy and coma [^notfound].
- **Serotonin and dopamine**: Ammonia alters serotonin and dopamine metabolism, causing mood, cognition, and motor disturbances [^notfound].

---

### Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress

Mitochondrial impairment from ammonia disrupts ATP production, causing **energy failure** in neurons and astrocytes [^5925391b]. Ammonia also induces **oxidative stress**, damaging cellular structures and worsening neurodysfunction [^5925391b].

---

## Clinical manifestations of hyperammonemia-related mental status changes

Hyperammonemia presents with a **spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms**, correlating with ammonia levels and duration:

| **Severity** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Irritability <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Difficulty concentrating <br/> - Behavioral changes [^8c237043] [^baa37a16] |
| Moderate | - Lethargy <br/> - Disorientation <br/> - Asterixis <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Seizures [^8c237043] [^baa37a16] |
| Severe | - Coma <br/> - Cerebral edema <br/> - Decerebrate posturing <br/> - Respiratory failure <br/> - Death [^8c237043] [^baa37a16] |

---

## Factors influencing severity and reversibility

Several factors modulate the **severity and reversibility** of hyperammonemia-related encephalopathy:

- **Ammonia level and duration**: Higher levels and longer exposure increase the risk of permanent brain injury [^bfcf23ef] [^baa37a16].
- **Age and developmental stage**: Neonates and infants are more vulnerable to brain injury [^notfound].
- **Underlying liver function**: Hepatic dysfunction worsens encephalopathy and reduces reversibility [^5925391b] [^2281cbd2].
- **Precipitating factors**: Infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and drugs (e.g. valproate, topiramate) can precipitate or worsen encephalopathy [^c18bb97f] [^4cc6684d] [^5c8a73c8].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Prompt diagnosis relies on:

- **Ammonia measurement**: Obtain blood ammonia in patients with altered mental status, especially with liver disease or risk factors [^e5a4a2bc] [^a2338d78].
- **Liver function tests**: Assess hepatic dysfunction as a cause or contributor [^notfound].
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI may show cerebral edema or white matter changes in severe cases [^dacc8b0a].
- **EEG**: Diffuse slowing or triphasic waves may be seen in encephalopathy [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **rapid ammonia reduction** and supportive care:

- **Ammonia-lowering therapies**: Lactulose, rifaximin, and sodium phenylbutyrate reduce ammonia absorption and enhance excretion [^2281cbd2] [^1bf63b26].
- **Dialysis**: Hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy is indicated for severe hyperammonemia (> 150–200 µmol/L) or refractory cases [^05098c40] [^ed20ef26].
- **Supportive care**: Airway protection, seizure control, and management of precipitating factors are essential [^bfcf23ef].
- **Dietary modifications**: Protein restriction and nutritional support reduce ammonia production [^bfcf23ef] [^db36c909].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis depends on the **severity and duration** of hyperammonemia. Prolonged hyperammonemic coma (> 3 days) or levels > 1,000 µmol/L are associated with high mortality and severe neurologic sequelae [^bfcf23ef]. Early recognition and treatment improve outcomes, but many survivors have cognitive impairment, seizures, or developmental delay [^bfcf23ef] [^c8eae546].

### Hyperammonemia in the pediatric emergency department [^d1b1772d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyperammonemia is a serious clinical condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the pediatric population, this is often caused by urea cycle disorders, acute liver failure, or other less common underlying etiologies. Children and teens with hyperammonemia can have a broad range of clinical findings, including vomiting, respiratory distress, and changes in mental status. As ammonia levels worsen, this presentation can progress to respiratory failure, encephalopathy, cerebral edema, seizures, and death. Given the risk of neurologic damage, timely identification and management of hyperammonemia is critical and includes initial resuscitation, early consultation with subspecialists, and initiation of appropriate therapies. It is important for pediatric emergency medicine providers to understand the clinical findings, causes, diagnosis, and management of hyperammonemia because they play a key role in the provision of effective, multidisciplinary care of these patients.

### Hyperammonemia encephalopathy: an important cause of neurological deterioration following chemotherapy [^12e36407]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2007). Low credibility.

Idiopathic hyperammonemic encephalopathy is an uncommon but frequently fatal complication of chemotherapy. It is characterised by abrupt alteration in mental status with markedly elevated plasma ammonia levels in the absence of obvious liver disease or any other identifiable cause, and frequently results in intractable coma and death. It usually occurs in patients with haematologic malignancies during the period of neutropenia following cytoreductive therapy or bone marrow transplantation, and in solid organ malignancies treated with 5-fluorouracil. Although the aetiology of this syndrome is yet to be determined, it appears to be multi-factorial in nature. Optimal management remains to be formally established, and the critical step is increased awareness of the syndrome by measurement of plasma ammonium levels in patients with neurological symptoms, leading to early diagnosis and the prompt implementation of therapy.

### Hyperammonemia, bane of the brain [^8c237043]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Ammonia, normally produced from catabolism of amino acids, is a deadly neurotoxin. As such, the concentration of free ammonia in the blood is very tightly regulated and is exceeded by two orders of magnitude by its physiologic derivative, urea. The normal capacity for urea production far exceeds the rate of free ammonia production by protein catabolism under normal circumstances, such that any increase in free blood ammonia concentration is a reflection of either biochemical or pharmacologic impairment of urea cycle function or fairly extensive hepatic damage. Clinical signs of hyperammonemia occur at concentrations > 60 micromol/L and include anorexia, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, somnolence, disorientation, asterixis, cerebral edema, coma, and death; appearance of these findings is generally proportional to free ammonia concentration, is progressive, and is independent of the primary etiology. Causes of hyperammonemia include genetic defects in the urea cycle ("primary") or organic acidemias ("secondary"), as well as genetic or acquired disorders resulting in significant hepatic dysfunction. Thus, because of the neurotoxic implications of hyperammonemia and the typical absence of other specific laboratory abnormalities, appearance of the clinical signs should trigger an emergent search for elevated blood ammonia concentration.

### Hyperammonemia in the ICU [^212bf7d1]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing acute elevations of ammonia present to the ICU with encephalopathy, which may progress quickly to cerebral herniation. Patient survival requires immediate treatment of intracerebral hypertension and the reduction of ammonia levels. When hyperammonemia is not thought to be the result of liver failure, treatment for an occult disorder of metabolism must begin prior to the confirmation of an etiology. This article reviews ammonia metabolism, the effects of ammonia on the brain, the causes of hyperammonemia, and the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in adult patients.

5.12 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy (Without and With Concomitant Valproic Acid Use)

Topiramate treatment can cause hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The risk for hyperammonemia with topiramate appears dose-related. Hyperammonemia has been reported more frequently when topiramate is used concomitantly with valproic acid. Postmarketing cases of hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy have been reported with topiramate and valproic acid in patients who previously tolerated either drug alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy and/or vomiting. In most cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy abated with discontinuation of treatment.

The incidence of hyperammonemia in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in the preventive treatement of migraine trials was 26% in patients taking topiramate monotherapy at 100 mg/day, and 14% in patients taking topiramate at 50 mg/day, compared to 9% in patients taking placebo. There was also an increased incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia at the 100 mg dose.

Dose-related hyperammonemia was also seen in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age treated with topiramate and concomitant valproic acid for partial-onset epilepsy and this was not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.

In some patients, hyperammonemia can be asymptomatic.

Monitoring for Hyperammonemia

Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, topiramate treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.

In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting or changes in mental status associated with any topiramate treatment, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.

### Hyperammonemic encephalopathy caused by carnitine deficiency [^4d9a24dd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Carnitine is an essential co-factor in fatty acid metabolism. Carnitine deficiency can impair fatty acid oxidation, rarely leading to hyperammonemia and encephalopathy. We present the case of a 35-year-old woman who developed acute mental status changes, asterixis, and diffuse muscle weakness. Her ammonia level was elevated at 276 microg/dL. Traditional ammonia-reducing therapies were initiated, but proved ineffective. Pharmacologic, microbial, and autoimmune causes for the hyperammonemia were excluded. The patient was severely malnourished and her carnitine level was found to be extremely low. After carnitine supplementation, ammonia levels normalized and the patient's mental status returned to baseline. In the setting of refractory hyperammonemia, this case illustrates how careful investigation may reveal a treatable condition.

### Zonisamide [^90d3769d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy:

Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy have been reported with the postmarketing use of zonisamide. Zonisamide treatment inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity, which may cause metabolic acidosis that is associated with an increased risk for developing hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia resulting from zonisamide can also be asymptomatic.

The risks of hyperammonemia and various manifestations of encephalopathy may be increased in patients treated with zonisamide and concomitantly taking other medications that can cause hyperammonemia, including valproic acid or topiramate (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy and this risk may be increased by zonisamide use.

Measure serum ammonia concentration if signs or symptoms (e.g., unexplained change in mental status, vomiting, or lethargy) of encephalopathy occur. Hyperammonemia resulting from zonisamide resolves when zonisamide is discontinued. Hyperammonemia from zonisamide may resolve or decrease in severity with a decrease of the daily dose.

### Fatal hyperammonemia after repeat renal transplantation [^59cb66d9]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

A 35-year-old man had symptomatic hyperammonemia and normal liver function after repeat kidney transplantation. He presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, which quickly progressed to altered mental status. Therapy was instituted to clear the ammonia, but the ammonia level continued to rise. Eventually, the patient became unresponsive, and an emergent computed tomographic scan showed cerebral herniation. Urine acids and serum organic acids were not diagnostic of any urea cycle disorder. Histology did not reveal a clear etiology for the hyperammonemia.

### Toxic benzyl alcohol inhalation: altered mental status with metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia [^28b65bd9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This report presents the case of a patient whose inhalation exposure to benzyl alcohol led to clinical manifestations similar to toluene intoxication, including sudden altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperammonemia. Toxicity from benzyl alcohol inhalation is quite rare, and hyperammonemia associated with renal tubular dysfunction in poisoning cases has not been reported in the past.

### Valproate-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy [^016ede6c]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of valproic acid (VPA) (also known as Depakote, Depakene, and others) frequently results in elevated plasma ammonia. In some people, hyperammonemia may be clinically significant, resulting in hyperammonemic encephalopathy, which may be severe. Valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy may occur in people with normal liver function, despite normal doses and serum levels of VPA. We describe 2 cases of valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients with supratherapeutic VPA levels, although the condition has been described in people with normal VPA levels. With the increasing indications and off-label uses of VPA, family physicians should be aware of this potential complication of VPA and check ammonia levels in patients taking VPA who present with alterations in mental status. Treatment with L-carnitine may be beneficial in reducing ammonia levels.

### Seizures as a cause of altered mental status [^0daa7183]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis and empiric management of altered mental status and seizures often overlap. Altered mental status may accompany seizures or simply be the manifestation of a postictal state. This article provides an overview of the numerous causes of altered mental status and seizures: metabolic, toxic, malignant, infectious, and endocrine causes. The article focuses on those agents that should prompt the emergency physician to initiate unique therapy to abate the seizure and correct the underlying cause.

### Brain MRS glutamine as a biomarker to guide therapy of hyperammonemic coma [^dde62272]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Acute idiopathic hyperammonemia in an adult patient is a life-threatening condition often resulting in a rapid progression to irreversible cerebral edema and death. While ammonia-scavenging therapies lower blood ammonia levels, in comparison, clearance of waste nitrogen from the brain may be delayed. Therefore, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor cerebral glutamine levels, the major reservoir of ammonia, in a gastric bypass patient with hyperammonemic coma undergoing therapy with N-carbamoyl glutamate and the ammonia-scavenging agents, sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate. Improvement in mental status mirrored brain glutamine levels, as coma persisted for 48h after plasma ammonia normalized. We hypothesize that the slower clearance for brain glutamine levels accounts for the delay in improvement following initiation of treatment in cases of chronic hyperammonemia. We propose MRS to monitor brain glutamine as a noninvasive approach to be utilized for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring purposes in adult patients presenting with idiopathic hyperammonemia.

### Inborn errors of metabolism with hyperammonemia: urea cycle defects and related disorders [^0e9ac0da]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The urea cycle disorders are a group of inherited biochemical diseases caused by a complete or partial deficiency of any one of the enzymes or transport proteins required to convert toxic ammonia into urea and to produce arginine and citrulline. The clinical manifestations of these disorders are mostly the result of acute or chronic hyperammonemia, which affects the central nervous system. Affected individuals can also develop hepatic dysfunction. These disorders can present at any age from the immediate newborn to later in life. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to improving outcomes.

### Consensus-based recommendations on management of acetaminophen poisoning… [^0df73356]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The physical examination should evaluate signs consistent with acetaminophen poisoning. Single-dose activated charcoal should be considered in patients with acute ingestion of a potentially liver-toxic amount of acetaminophen unless the patient is unable to control airway or has contraindications to its use. Differences from current US practice include defining acute ingestion as an ingestion presentation from 4 to 24 hours after overdose was initiated. A revised form of the Rumack-Matthew nomogram was developed. The term massive ingestion was replaced with the term high-risk ingestion and denoted by a specific nomogram line.

Other recommendations include specific criteria for emergency department triage, laboratory evaluation and monitoring parameters, defining the role of gastrointestinal decontamination, detailed management of acetylcysteine treatment, associated adverse effects, and stopping criteria for acetylcysteine treatment, as well as criteria for consultation with a clinical toxicologist. Therefore, acute ingestion includes any ingestion period of less than 24 hours regardless of the ingestion pattern. In contrast, a repeated supratherapeutic ingestion occurs during a period of greater than 24 hours. The panel chose to revise the Rumack-Matthew nomogram by including only lines that guide clinical action. The blood concentration of acetaminophen is simply plotted on the nomogram, and acetylcysteine is administered to patients whose concentration is above the treatment line.

Additional laboratory testing is indicated if the patient has developed signs of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as altered level of consciousness, metabolic acidosis, or hyperlactatemia. Assessment should include evaluation of other causes of altered level of consciousness. Finally, increased dosage of acetylcysteine may be warranted in consultation with a PC or clinical toxicologist. Enhanced elimination is recommended when a very large ingestion has occurred. The consensus panel concurred with the extracorporeal treatment of poisoning. 14 Hemodialysis is recommended in addition to treatment with acetylcysteine in a patient with an acetaminophen concentration of 900 μg/mL or greater with acidosis or altered consciousness due to acetaminophen toxic effects. If the intravenous route is used, the rate of acetylcysteine infusion should be at least 12. 5 mg/kg per hour during hemodialysis. The oral acetylcysteine regimen does not require adjustment during hemodialysis.

### Neurological implications of urea cycle disorders [^f2d3fd0b]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2007). Low credibility.

The urea cycle disorders constitute a group of rare congenital disorders caused by a deficiency of the enzymes or transport proteins required to remove ammonia from the body. Via a series of biochemical steps, nitrogen, the waste product of protein metabolism, is removed from the blood and converted into urea. A consequence of these disorders is hyperammonaemia, resulting in central nervous system dysfunction with mental status changes, brain oedema, seizures, coma, and potentially death. Both acute and chronic hyperammonaemia result in alterations of neurotransmitter systems. In acute hyperammonaemia, activation of the NMDA receptor leads to excitotoxic cell death, changes in energy metabolism and alterations in protein expression of the astrocyte that affect volume regulation and contribute to oedema. Neuropathological evaluation demonstrates alterations in the astrocyte morphology. Imaging studies, in particular (1)H MRS, can reveal markers of impaired metabolism such as elevations of glutamine and reduction of myoinositol. In contrast, chronic hyperammonaemia leads to adaptive responses in the NMDA receptor and impairments in the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway, leading to alterations in cognition and learning. Therapy of acute hyperammonaemia has relied on ammonia-lowering agents but in recent years there has been considerable interest in neuroprotective strategies. Recent studies have suggested restoration of learning abilities by pharmacological manipulation of brain cGMP with phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Thus, both strategies are intriguing areas for potential investigation in human urea cycle disorders.

### Hyperammonemia and coma without hepatic dysfunction induced by valproate therapy [^33ca71b3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The authors report a case of a 41-year-old mentally disabled man with bipolar disorder who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was found to have a significantly elevated ammonia level (377 microM/L) with no signs of hepatic insufficiency. His coma and hyperammonemia were attributed to his chronic valproate therapy. This patient had the highest serum ammonia level ever reported with a therapeutic valproate level in the absence of any other anticonvulsant therapy, metabolic abnormality, or hepatic dysfunction. The authors discuss this case and review the current literature on hyperammonemia in valproic acid therapy and the use of L-carnitine in these patients.

### Unusual causes of hyperammonemia in the ED [^123959d1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Plasma ammonia measurement is a simple yet important screening in the ED for patients with unexplained stupor or delirium. Acute hyperammonemia is a medical emergency for which immediate steps must be taken to minimize permanent brain damage. Although the most common causes of hyperammonemia are severe abnormal liver function, the absence of liver disease in some cases has been observed. This brief report describes four hyperammonemia cases with normal liver function in the ED. On careful history and speculated examinations, ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) deficiency, hematologic malignancy, and the side effects of valproic acid and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were considered. Therapy was first aimed at correcting the hyperammonemia. Once a specific diagnosis was reached, protein restriction, essential amino acid supplementation, efficient chemotherapy, and valproic acid and 5-FU level discontinuance were instituted. In this report, the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and diagnostic workup for various hyperammonemia causes are discussed. Every EP should understand that the clinical symptoms for hyperammonemia and prognosis are related to early diagnosis.

### Quo vadis ureagenesis disorders? A journey from 90 years ago into the future [^d8ca7940]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The pathway of ammonia disposal in the mammalian organism has been described in 1932 as a metabolic cycle present in the liver in different compartments. In 1958, the first human disorder affecting this pathway was described as a genetic condition leading to cognitive impairment and constant abnormalities of amino acid metabolism. Since then, defects in all enzymes and transporters of the urea cycle have been described, referring to them as primary urea cycle disorders causing primary hyperammonemia. In addition, there is a still increasing list of conditions that impact on the function of the urea cycle by various mechanisms, hereby leading to secondary hyperammonemia. Despite great advances in understanding the molecular background and the biochemical specificities of both primary and secondary hyperammonemias, there remain many open questions: we do not fully understand the pathophysiology in many of the conditions; we do not always understand the highly variable clinical course of affected patients; we clearly appreciate the need for novel and improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This study does look back to the beginning of the urea cycle (hi)story, briefly describes the journey through past decades, hereby illustrating advancements and knowledge gaps, and gives examples for the extremely broad perspective imminent to some of the defects of ureagenesis and allied conditions.

### Adult nonhepatic hyperammonemia: a case report and differential diagnosis [^9148b96e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This article presents a case report of nonhepatic hyperammonemia, i.e., elevated serum ammonia secondary to a nonhepatic etiology. It then discusses the importance of broadening one's differential diagnosis to include such nonhepatic causes of elevated ammonia levels, and provides a short review of rarer causes of hyperammonemia in the adult population. Treating the underlying condition is the best way to prevent recurrence of hyperammonemia. However, symptomatic treatment should not be delayed while investigating the underlying source.

5.10 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use

Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.9)].

5.11 Hypothermia

Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to < 35°C (95°F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.

### Defining incidence and complications of fibrolamellar liver cancer through tiered computational analysis of clinical data [^b5cc53b3]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case reports have described extreme hyperammonemia in FLC, but it is not always suspected in FLC patients with altered mental status. Thus, prospective analysis of ammonia levels was performed in two recent FLC clinical trials, showing 14.3–50% of tested patients with advanced FLC have elevated serum ammonia at baseline, with 27.3–71.3% having hyperammonemia at the end of treatment (Fig. 2A). Within the Komodo dataset, 372 or 8% of patients coded with LC without inflammatory liver disease also had a diagnosis code for high ammonia levels suggesting underdiagnosis (Fig. 2B).

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and hyperammonemia in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF): All children with PALF should be clinically evaluated for evidence and severity of HE; HE is challenging to assess and may not be clinically apparent, particularly in infants and young children; altered mental status due to severe illness, metabolic decompensation, electrolyte abnormality, cardiovascular instability, or fear may confound assessment, yet determining HE remains critical as its presence and severity guide clinical assessment and often drive additional cardiovascular and respiratory support; amongst potential causative agents, ammonia assumes an essential role; while arterial ammonia measurement is ideal, it is not practical in children with stage 0–III HE, and venous ammonia obtained from a free- flowing catheter placed on ice and transported to the laboratory may be a suitable substitute.

### A woman with confusion | NEJM resident 360… [^7abf36e4]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pearls Q: How is ammonia primarily excreted by the body. A: All tissues produce ammonia as a byproduct of amino acid metabolism. The primary route of ammonia excretion is through the urea cycle, with urinary excretion of ammonia as urea. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur when perturbations in ammonia metabolism lead to an elevated ammonia level. When measuring the serum ammonia level, the specimen must be obtained from a free-flowing venipuncture without the use of a tourniquet, stored on ice, and sent immediately to the laboratory; deviations from this process may lead to falsely elevated results. A: Hyperammonemia can be caused by an increased protein load from an oral or parenteral source or from gastrointestinal bleeding. Hyperammonemia can also be caused by a catabolic state, such as severe malnutrition. Muscle is an important extrahepatic site of ammonia metabolism, and severe sarcopenia can lead to hyperammonemia.

Certain drugs and toxins, including antiepileptic agents such as valproate, can cause urea-cycle dysfunction and hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia can also be due to infections with urease-producing bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae. A: There is an increasingly recognized association between noncirrhotic hyperammonemia and a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and some experts have proposed naming this phenomenon the "gastric bypass hyperammonemia syndrome. " Case reports describe patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy who are typically middle-aged and female and do not have clinically significant liver disease. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy may develop at various points after bypass surgery, with hallmark findings including hypoalbuminemia, nutritional deficiencies, an elevated plasma glutamine level, and a low zinc level.

It has been hypothesized that undiagnosed hemizygous pathogenic variants in the gene that encodes ornithine transcarbamylase in women could contribute to an elevated risk of urea-cycle dysfunction. A role for zinc deficiency in urea-cycle enzymatic dysfunction has also been hypothesized. Increased production of ammonia, portosystemic shunting, an altered intestinal microbiome, and a profound catabolic state after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may all contribute to the pathogenesis of this syndrome, although more investigation is needed to understand this rare and unique disease.

### Toxic and metabolic leukoencephalopathies in emergency department patients: a primer for the radiologist [^dacc8b0a]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most common chief complaints in the emergency department (ED) is altered mental status (AMS). Imaging plays a critical role in triaging patients and identifying the etiology of AMS. Toxic and metabolic etiologies are one of the primary differential categories for AMS, leading to toxic leukoencephalopathies. Toxic leukoencephalopathies are white matter disorders that result from either exogenous or endogenous sources. Common exogeneous causes of toxic leukoencephalopathy include drugs of abuse (heroin and cocaine), alcohol, inhaled gases (carbon monoxide), industrial agents (pesticides, toluene, ethylene glycol), and neurotoxic medications (methotrexate, metronidazole, vigabatrine, etc.); endogenous causes include hyper- and hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, hyponatremia, and uremia. The imaging findings of toxic leukoencephalopathies manifest through a combination of vasogenic and cytotoxic edema, resulting in white matter patterns. These white matter patterns have been found to be pathognomonic. In the ED setting, it is imperative to develop a diagnosis based off of the imaging due to the lack of history and context that is typically provided with a chief complaint of altered mental status (AMS). To offer expeditious and accurate diagnosis, we present the classic imaging features of toxic leukoencephalopathies and correlate these imaging findings with pathophysiology.

### Pathophysiology and management of hyperammonemia in organ transplant patients [^2e39a491]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurologic complications are common after solid-organ transplantation, occurring in one-third of patients. Immunosuppression-related neurotoxicity (involving calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids), opportunistic central nervous system infections, seizures, and delirium are some of the causes of neurologic symptoms following solid-organ transplantation. An uncommon often missed complication posttransplantation involves buildup of ammonia levels that can lead to rapid clinical deterioration even when treated. Ammonia levels are not routinely checked due to the myriad of other explanations for encephalopathy in a transplant recipient. A treatment of choice for severe hyperammonemia involves renal replacement therapy (RRT), but there are no guidelines on the mode or parameters of RRT for reducing ammonia levels. Hyperammonemia in a transplant recipient poses specific challenges beyond the actual condition because the treatment (RRT) involves significant hemodynamic fluctuations that may affect the graft. In this review, we describe a patient with posttransplantation hyperammonemia and discuss the pathways of ammonia metabolism, potential factors underlying the development of hyperammonemia posttransplantation, and choice of appropriate therapeutic options in these patients.

### Hyperammonemic coma caused by Providencia rettgeri infection in a child with prune belly syndrome [^e086583f]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in the absence of liver disease caused by a urinary tract infection with a previously unreported organism. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit. Patient: Critically ill child who presented with hyperammonemic coma. INTERVENTION: Bladder drainage and antimicrobial therapy for the urinary tract infection. Measurements: Rapid resolution of the hyperammonemia. MAIN RESULTS: Rapid improvement in the patient's neurologic status and a return to his baseline function without neurologic deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with abnormal urinary collecting systems who present with altered mental status should have a serum ammonia concentration sent as part of the initial evaluation. We have added Providencia species to the list of documented causative organisms in this rare association between urinary tract infections and hyperammonemia.

### Ammonia: what adult neurologists need to know [^40635e13]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperammonaemia is often encountered in acute neurology and can be the cause of acute or chronic neurological symptoms. Patients with hyperammonaemia may present with seizures or encephalopathy, or may be entirely asymptomatic. The underlying causes are diverse but often straightforward to diagnose, although sometimes require specialist investigations. Haemodialysis or haemo(dia)filtration is the first-line treatment for acute severe hyperammonaemia (of any cause) in an adult. Here we discuss our approach to adult patients with hyperammonaemia identified by a neurologist.

### Reversing hyperammonemia in neuroendocrine tumors [^15fb2594]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Ammonia is a neurotoxin that is normally cleared by the intact liver and if not, hyperammonemia results in hepatic encephalopathy. Hyperammonemia may be owing to primary or secondary causes. Early diagnosis is important to prevent permanent brain damage. Advanced malignancy involving the liver is associated with hyperammonemia as a result of abnormality of the portal venous system or massive hepatic tumor burdon. Neuroendocrine tumors are an example of a malignant process that frequently involves the liver but despite this, may still have a relatively good prognosis, and are often characterized by chronic manageable symptoms and slow progression. Hyperammonemia in neuroendocrine tumor would represent a potentially reversible but ongoing process associated with an indolent malignancy. We present 2 cases that are examples of this diagnosis and discuss the diagnostic and management issues that may arise.

### Use of meropenem to treat valproic acid overdose [^764746c3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Overdose of valproic acid (VPA) or its derivatives can cause significant toxicities such as hyperammonemia or altered mental status. While levocarnitine has been used historically to manage VPA-associated hyperammonemia, no standard of therapy exists to manage VPA toxicity. We present a case of VPA overdose managed with meropenem in addition to levocarnitine. A 38-year old female presented to the emergency department after intentionally ingesting 20 tablets of extended release divalproex sodium. She received a 4-gram loading dose of levocarnitine. She developed altered mental status, and a repeat VPA level yielded a result of 278 μg/mL. She was given 1 g of meropenem and her subsequent VPA level was 193 μg/mL. Approximately 8 h after the initial dose, another 1 g of meropenem was administered. Additionally, she received 1 g of levocarnitine every 4 h for a total of six doses. A repeat VPA level returned at 62 μg/mL. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management. Carbapenem antibiotics inhibit acylpeptide hydrolase in the gastrointestinal tract. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the reabsorption of metabolized VPA and therefore causes increased elimination. Our patient demonstrated a rapid lowering of VPA levels after administration of meropenem.

### Hyperammonemia in urea cycle disorders: role of the nephrologist [^b55e8de4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia associated with inherited disorders of amino acid and organic acid metabolism is usually manifested by irritability, somnolence, vomiting, seizures, and coma. Although the majority of these patients present in the newborn period, they may also present in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood with failure to thrive, persistent vomiting, developmental delay, or behavioral changes. Persistent hyperammonemia, if not treated rapidly, may cause irreversible neuronal damage. After the diagnosis of hyperammonemia is established in an acutely ill patient, certain diagnostic tests should be performed to differentiate between urea cycle defects and other causes of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. In a patient with a presumed inherited metabolic disorder, the aim of therapy should be to normalize blood ammonia levels. Recent experience has provided treatment guidelines that include minimizing endogenous ammonia production and protein catabolism, restricting nitrogen intake, administering substrates of the urea cycle, administering compounds that facilitate the removal of ammonia through alternative pathways, and, in severe cases, dialysis therapy. Initiation of dialysis in the encephalopathic patient with hyperammonemia is indicated if the ammonia blood level is greater than three to four times the upper limit of normal. Hemodialysis is the most effective treatment for rapidly reducing blood ammonia levels. Continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis are also effective modalities for reducing blood ammonia levels. An improved understanding of the metabolism of ammonia and neurological consequences of hyperammonemia will assist the nephrologist in providing optimal care for this high-risk patient population.

### Acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy masquerading as postoperative delirium in a patient who underwent lung surgery: a case report [^3aaa9941]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The limitation of this case is that hyperammonemia was not detected before the operation or immediately after neuropsychiatric symptoms emerged, resulting in a scheduled operation and misdiagnosis as postoperative delirium; unfortunately, the start of specific treatment was delayed. With the exception of terminal liver insufficiency, there is an immediate need to initiate nitrogen detoxification treatments in any case of AHE. Prompt and rigorous intervention at symptom onset by a multidisciplinary team, including an expert experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with inborn errors of metabolism, may save the patient.

### Acute postpartum mental status change and coma caused by previously undiagnosed ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency [^a87d22e9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Acute postpartum mental status change usually represents postpartum blues or depression. Psychosis and coma are rare. This is a case report of a patient with previously undiagnosed ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency presenting as postpartum acute mental status change and coma.

Case

A 28-year-old multipara developed acute mental status change and coma 3 days after cesarean delivery. A metabolic profile and neurologic workup were unrevealing. An electroencephalogram revealed diffusely slow brain activity. She developed hyperammonemia and hyperglutaminemia and was diagnosed with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Her newborn son was diagnosed with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency on the previous day. Treatment with oral lactulose resulted in normalization of her ammonia level and resolution of her coma within 48 hours. She suffers no long-term sequelae. Dietary avoidance of protein was advised; outpatient treatment with sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, and lactulose was initiated. A pedigree analysis is ongoing.

Conclusion

Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute postpartum coma. Hyperammonemia, hyperglutaminemia, and orotic aciduria are diagnostic, facilitate early treatment, and mitigate the risk of permanent neurologic impairment or death.

### Acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy in adult onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency [^5fcfc5cf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report the clinical manifestations of acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy in adult onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD).

Design

Case report.

Setting

Intensive care unit of a tertiary medical centre.

Patient

A 48-year-old Caucasian male body builder who developed acute loss of consciousness after a febrile illness.

Interventions

The patient was immediately started on hemodia-filtration, protein elimination and ammonia scavenging medications.

Measurements and Results

Serum ammonium was elevated and plasma and urine amino acids had a pattern indicative of a urea cycle defect. DNA studies revealed a mutation of the urea cycle enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase. The encephalopathy resolved and the patient slowly recovered though with some cognitive impairment.

Conclusions

Adult presentation of OTCD is rare and the mortality and morbidity rates are high. However, survival is possible with rapid correction of hyperammonemia. As the clinical manifestations are non-specific, a high index of suspicion is necessary for the correct diagnosis and management.

### Ammonia and autophagy: an emerging relationship with implications for disorders with hyperammonemia [^76c82009]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

(Macro)autophagy/autophagy is a highly regulated lysosomal degradative process by which cells recycle their own nutrients, such as amino acids and other metabolites, to be reused in different biosynthetic pathways. Ammonia is a diffusible compound generated daily from catabolism of nitrogen-containing molecules and from gastrointestinal microbiome. Ammonia homeostasis is tightly controlled in humans and ammonia is efficiently converted by the healthy liver into non-toxic urea (through ureagenesis) and glutamine (through glutamine synthetase). Impaired ammonia detoxification leads to systemic hyperammonemia, a life-threatening condition resulting in detrimental effects on central nervous system. Here, we review current understanding on the role of ammonia in modulation of autophagy and the potential implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of disorders with hyperammonemia.

### Hyperammonemia in acetaminophen toxicity [^883976f4]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity can result in hyperammonemia, but it is not clear if elevated ammonia concentrations predict encephalopathy.

Methods

We retrospectively studied patients with acetaminophen toxicity at a liver transplant center over 8years (January 1, 2010-December 31, 2017), who developed hepatotoxicity (AST and/or ALT > 1000IU/L) or hyperammonemia (ammonia > 40µmol/L). We recorded baseline characteristics, laboratory data, documented grade of encephalopathy, and treatments administered. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for varying ammonia concentrations.

Results

A total of 102 patient encounters were included with 75 having ammonia concentrations. On presentation, 40% (30/75) of patients had concentrations greater than 100µmol/L. However, an [ammonia] > 100µmol/L was neither sensitive (46% [95% CI: 26–67%]) nor specific (63% [48–76%]) for encephalopathy. Only an increasing ammonia concentration had a significant, but small (1.53 (95% CI: 1.06–2.20)) positive likelihood ratio for the development of hepatic encephalopathy.

Discussion

Animal models have suggested that in acetaminophen toxicity, encephalopathy may be secondary to an alternative mechanism other than hyperammonemia which may explain the lack of correlation between initial hyperammonemia and encephalopathy in this cohort. Additionally, a lack of empiric treatment for hyperammonemia did not appear to alter the course of any of the patients. None of these patients developed encephalopathy.

Conclusion

In cases of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, ammonia concentrations do not correlate with encephalopathy and empiric treatment for hyperammonemia does not appear to be beneficial.

### Hyperammonemic coma in an ornithine transcarbamylase mutation carrier following antepartum corticosteroids [^35cd318c]. Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Women who are carriers of the ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) mutation are at risk for developing hyperammonemia during the postpartum period and at times of metabolic stress. We present a unique case of hyperammonemic coma occurring in an OTC mutation carrier during the antepartum period. Multiple factors, including the administration of antenatal corticosteroids, likely precipitated this critical condition. Clinicians should be aware of this life-threatening clinical presentation and be prepared to identify, treat, and prevent hyperammonemia in affected individuals.

### Hyperammonemia in a pregnant woman with citrullinemia type I: a case report and literature review [^a1f8dd95]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This report aims to raise clinical awareness in considering mental abnormalities as a presenting symptom of UCDs in pregnant women. Nausea and vomiting are easily overlooked as accompanying symptoms in early pregnancy. When associated with behavioral symptoms, they need to be taken seriously. These patients can develop acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy incidentally by various triggers in adulthood, especially pregnancy. When we encounter patients with unusual hyperammonemia, CTNL1 should be considered so that fatal outcomes can be avoided through prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment. Molecular analysis is the method of choice in making a differential UCD diagnosis.

Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy

Warn patients about the possible development of hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although hyperammonemia may be asymptomatic, clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. This hyperammonemia and encephalopathy can develop with topiramate treatment alone or with topiramate treatment with concomitant valproic acid (VPA). Patients should be instructed to contact their physician if they develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Kidney Stones

Instruct patients, particularly those with predisposing factors, to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to minimize the risk of kidney stone formation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

Hypothermia

Counsel patients that TROKENDI XR®can cause a reduction in body temperature, which can lead to alterations in mental status. If they note such changes, they should call their health care professional and measure their body temperature. Patients taking concomitant valproic acid should be specifically counseled on this potential adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

### Astrocyte glutamine synthetase: importance in hyperammonemic syndromes and potential target for therapy [^ea976f4c]. Neurotherapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Many theories have been advanced to explain the encephalopathy associated with chronic liver disease and with the less common acute form. A major factor contributing to hepatic encephalopathy is hyperammonemia resulting from portacaval shunting and/or liver damage. However, an increasing number of causes of hyperammonemic encephalopathy have been discovered that present with the same clinical and laboratory features found in acute liver failure, but without liver failure. Here, we critically review the physiology, pathology, and biochemistry of ammonia (i.e. NH3 plus NH4+) and show how these elements interact to constitute a syndrome that clinicians refer to as hyperammonemic encephalopathy (i.e., acute liver failure, fulminant hepatic failure, chronic liver disease). Included will be a brief history of the status of ammonia and the centrality of the astrocyte in brain nitrogen metabolism. Ammonia is normally detoxified in the liver and extrahepatic tissues by conversion to urea and glutamine, respectively. In the brain, glutamine synthesis is largely confined to astrocytes, and it is generally accepted that in hyperammonemia excess glutamine compromises astrocyte morphology and function. Mechanisms postulated to account for this toxicity will be examined with emphasis on the osmotic effects of excess glutamine (the osmotic gliopathy theory). Because hyperammonemia causes osmotic stress and encephalopathy in patients with normal or abnormal liver function alike, the term "hyperammonemic encephalopathy" can be broadly applied to encephalopathy resulting from liver disease and from various other diseases that produce hyperammonemia. Finally, the possibility that a brain glutamine synthetase inhibitor may be of therapeutic benefit, especially in the acute form of liver disease, is discussed.

### Early-onset hyperargininaemia: a severe disorder? [^6cd57667]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hyperargininaemia is a rare inborn error of metabolism due to a defect in the final step of the urea cycle. Infantile onset is the most common presentation with recurrent vomiting and psychomotor delay associated with spastic paraparesis; chronic hyperammonaemia is often overlooked. Neonatal and early-onset presentations are very uncommon and their clinical course not well-described. We report on a 3-week-old hyperargininaemic girl who presented with neurological deterioration associated with liver failure and 47-day ammonia intoxication before diagnosis could be made and treatment started. Despite appropriate but delayed treatment, our patient exhibited severe psychomotor delay at age 1 year.

Conclusion

Early identification and management of this rare but potentially treatable affection is crucial as delayed management may result in poor neurological outcome.

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^baa37a16]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Hyperammonaemia is defined as > 100 µmol/l (170 µg/dl) in neonates or50 µmol/l (85 µg/dl) in term infants, children and adolescents. Individual laboratory reference intervals vary and some age dependency of ammonia levels is evident (that is, levels are higher in premature neonates). Early onset hyperammonaemia presents in neonates within the first few days of life after they start to feed and can no longer rely on maternal (placental) transport to appropriately eliminate the accumulating ammonia. Symptoms in preterm neonates typically result from transient hyperammonaemia of the newborn, which is characterized by the absence of organic acidurias and normal activity of urea cycle enzymes. This subtype is usually associated with complete recovery, usually without needing treatment.

In hyperammonaemia, the acute rise in ammonia levels in the brain leads to increased levels of extracellular potassium and metabolism of ammonia to glutamine by astrocytes. These changes result in increased intracellular osmolality, cerebral oedema and the release of inflammatory cytokines. High levels of extracellular potassium and glutamate released by astrocytes lead to neuronal damage. Elevated levels of glutamine, which is the end product of ammonia detoxification, is a key factor in both hepatic encephalopathy and ammonia-related neurotoxicity. Apart from hyperammonaemia, adverse effects on the nitric oxide pathway are also thought to lead to brain damage in patients with UCDs. The clinical abnormalities observed vary for each specific UCD, but most patients tend to have similar symptoms. The clinical features of an acute hyperammonaemic episode depend on the age of the patient and the cause of the elevation in plasma ammonia levels. Early symptoms include lethargy, loss of appetite and vomiting. As ammonia levels rise, symptoms can progress to hyperventilation resulting in respiratory alkalosis, hypotonia, ataxia, disorientation, seizures and, if untreated, coma and death. Late-onset hyperammonaemia in children, adolescents or adults can result from a partial or mild deficiency in a urea cycle enzyme that is exacerbated by certain stressors. Such children or adolescents present with failure to thrive, irritability, seizures, vomiting, ataxia and intellectual disabilities. Management of hyperammonaemia is challenging in paediatric populations given the non-specific clinical symptoms, the age-specific aetiologies and the lack of consensus in the treatment plan. Historically, the prognosis in neonates with hyperammonaemia was poor, but current treatments, along with prompt identification of hyperammonaemia, have considerably improved the survival of affected neonates(Fig. 2), although updated survival data are not available.

### Acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy masquerading as postoperative delirium in a patient who underwent lung surgery: a case report [^19a5abc2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Owing to the lack of characteristic clinical features, OTCD can be easily overlooked or misdiagnosed. In acute attacks in adults, neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main manifestations, whereas in children, the predominant presentation is a reduced level of consciousness and coma, which may be accompanied by digestive system symptoms, acute liver failure, or even sudden death in severe cases. Although UCDs can lead to respiratory alkalosis and low blood urea nitrogen levels in the context of hyperammonemia crises, exceptionally elevated blood ammonia levels are among the main indicators. Biochemical laboratory values, including plasma amino acids and urinary lactate, help to identify defects in UCDs.

The causes of death in OTCD patients include hyperammonemic encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, brain herniation, and status epilepticus. A blood ammonia concentration exceeding 200 µmol/L is associated with cerebral edema and cerebral herniation. Treatment involves reducing blood ammonia concentrations, reversing protein catabolism, and administering nitrogen scavengers. Protein intake should be stopped if the blood ammonia level exceeds the upper limit of normal, and glucose and insulin infusions should be used to prevent catabolism. If conventional treatment fails to control blood ammonia levels, hemodialysis is recommended for patients whose ammonia levels exceed 200 µg/dL.

In the present case, hyperammonemia was not detected in time due to the unavailability of the patient's familial medical history, combined with the symptoms occurring on the day of surgery. Consequently, the patient was misdiagnosed and treated for delirium for the first 2 days. Hyperammonemia was not observed until the patient experienced convulsion postoperative day 3, when severe brain swelling and neurological intoxication may have already occurred.

Hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis, and encephalopathy are hallmarks of UCDs. UCDs can also lead to low blood urea nitrogen levels. Upon reviewing the patient's medical history, we found that he had low blood urea nitrogen level before surgery and respiratory alkalosis at onset. These abnormalities led physicians to consider AHE, which was ultimately confirmed by genetic testing. Based on the current case, we suggest that if patients experience postoperative mental changes and respiratory alkalosis with low urea nitrogen levels, physicians should consider the possibility of AHE. Immediate treatment for AHE should be initiated after the diagnosis is established. This case helps in proposing a differential diagnosis for patients with postoperative delirium.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^6590dfdb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of HE may be straightforward when a patient with cirrhosis presents with obvious neurological deficits such as altered consciousness, but it is much more challenging in the presence of more subtle neuropsychological or personality changes that are not uncommon in an outpatient population of cirrhotics (up to 62% in a recent report). In fact, it is recommended to search for minimal HE in patients who complain of cognitive alterations, a disturbed sleep, or are exposed to an accident risk while driving or at their work-place. As neurological deficits associated with minimal HE are clinically subtle, this complication may be underdiagnosed and may negatively impact patients' management. Accordingly, minimal HE can be accessible to medical therapy that may improve quality of life and prevent the development of clinical episodes of overt HE.

In clinical practice, the available tools for the diagnosis of HE include clinical scales to assess the mental status, such as the West-Haven scale, and a number of psychometric tests to assess the presence of congnitive deficits. Neuroradiological imaging is mostly directed at excluding other neurological disorders. Blood ammonia concentration in the context of HE is difficult to interpret, as the correlation between neurological symptoms and ammonia blood levels is variable, with a wide overlap across different stages of HE. Some, but not all studies report a closer correlation with arterial as compared to venous ammonia blood levels. The diagnosis of minimal HE is therefore challenging for the clinician who has to choose between a suboptimal biological test or a number of neuropsychological tests that may be time consuming, need to be adjusted for several parameters, and are subject to learning biases.

To improve the performance of blood ammonia for the diagnosis of minimal HE, we hypothesized that measuring ammonia in arterialized blood following oral glutamine-induced hyperammonemia and consecutive cognitive deterioration would increase the diagnostic yield of this biological test. Therefore, we explored the value of capillary blood ammonia measured at bedside following an oral glutamine challenge to unmask HE in patients with cirrhosis.

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^bfcf23ef]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Consensus panel recommendations

Prompt identification and treatment of hyperammonaemia are imperative to optimize the outcome of a hyperammonaemic crisis and to avoid irreversible brain damage.

Initial medical management guidelines

In the initial medical management of acute hyperammonaemia, the patient should be immediately stabilized (circulation, airway and breathing), vital signs should be addressed, blood glucose levels monitored, intravenous access should be established, airways should be maintained by intubation and ventilation if necessary, and adequate rehydration should be started, typically using a dextrose-containing fluid at a high infusion rate. In patients in hyperammonaemic crisis, laboratory testing is required to establish the cause of hyperammonaemia. Accurate measurement of plasma levels of ammonia is also important and should be performed on a free-flowing venous or arterial blood sample collected into a lithium heparin or EDTA tube and transported on ice to the laboratory. The sample must be processed within 15 min of draw and analysed immediately.

Once hyperammonaemia is identified, protein intake must be temporarily stopped and plasma ammonia levels monitored every 3 h. In a patient with an ammonia level at the upper limit of normal for their age — that is, 110 μmol/l (154 μg/dl) at age 1–7 days, < 90 μmol/l (126 μg/dl) at age 8–14 days and 16–53 µmol/l (22–74 μg/dl) at age 15 days to adult — stopping protein intake and initiating intravenous glucose and lipids to prevent catabolism is generally adequate. Crucially, protein intake must be reintroduced within a maximum of 48 h following the return of ammonia levels to 80–100 μmol/l (136–170 μg/dl) in order to avoid catabolism. Two factors determine the prognosis of neurological damage: the duration of hyperammonaemic coma and plasma ammonia levels. Adverse prognostic factors include hyperammonaemic coma lasting > 3 days, increased intracranial pressure and/or a plasma ammonia level > 1,000 μmol/l (1,703 μg/dl). In a study of 22 children with UCDs who survived a hyperammonaemic coma, the duration of coma was inversely correlated with the children's IQ at 12 months after recovery from the hyperammonaemic coma. The severity of abnormalities on brain CT also correlated with the duration of coma. Early management and reduced duration of hyperammonaemic coma may prevent adverse neurological outcomes. The initial medical and nutritional management of hyperammonaemia is summarized in Box 1.

A previously healthy, fully immunized, 17-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with nausea, nonbloody and nonbilious emesis, decreased oral intake, and lightheadedness during the past 24 hours. She receives antiemetic therapy and intravenous hydration and is discharged home. Several hours later, she develops confusion and agitation and returns to the ED. She is admitted from the ED to the ICU, where she is intubated for altered mental status and inability to protect her airway. The patient's mother reports that she has not had any recent fevers, illnesses, ingestions, travel, or exposure to sick contacts. To her knowledge, her daughter has not used illicit drugs. She has had normal growth and development. There is no family history of a similar presentation. Physical examination on arrival at the ICU reveals an afebrile, agitated adolescent with normal vital signs. A neurologic examination without sedation is significant for a Glasgow Coma Scale.

### Pathophysiology of brain dysfunction in hyperammonemic syndromes: the many faces of glutamine [^7e572a9e]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Ineffective hepatic clearance of excess ammonia in the form of urea, as occurs in urea cycle enzymopathies (UCDs) and in liver failure, leads to increases in circulating and tissue concentrations of glutamine and a positive correlation between brain glutamine and the severity of neurological symptoms. Studies using 1H/13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy reveal increased de novo synthesis of glutamine in the brain in acute liver failure (ALF) but increases of synthesis rates per se do not correlate with either the severity of encephalopathy or brain edema. Skeletal muscle becomes primarily responsible for removal of excess ammonia in liver failure and in UCDs, an adaptation that results from a post-translational induction of the glutamine synthetase (GS) gene. The importance of muscle in ammonia removal in hyperammonemia accounts for the resurgence of interest in maintaining adequate dietary protein and the use of agents aimed at the stimulation of muscle GS. Alternative or additional metabolic and regulatory pathways that impact on brain glutamine homeostasis in hyperammonemia include (i) glutamine deamination by the two isoforms of glutaminase, (ii) glutamine transamination leading to the production of the putative neurotoxin alpha-ketoglutaramate and (iii) alterations of high affinity astrocytic glutamine transporters (SNATs). Findings of reduced expression of the glutamine transporter SNAT-5 (responsible for glutamine clearance from the astrocyte) in ALF raise the possibility of "glutamine trapping" within these cells. Such a trapping mechanism could contribute to cytotoxic brain edema and to the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in this disorder.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — nutritional and metabolic support: Energy expenditure increases by 18%–30% compared with healthy controls, and it is recommended that ALF patients receive nutritional support if not expected to resume oral intake in a 5- to 7-day period. Oral nutrition can be considered with mild mental status changes; otherwise enteral support is preferred. Protein administration of 1.0–1.5 gm/kg/d is recommended, though in severe hyperammonemia (> 150 µmol/L) and HE, consideration can be given to delaying supplementation for the first 24–48 hours and restarting at a lower range (1.0 gm/kg/day) with close ammonia monitoring. For hypoglycemia, a constant infusion of dextrose 10% is recommended, and magnesium and phosphorus should be monitored every 8–12 hours. Key concepts emphasize monitoring and correction of glucose, fluid, and electrolytes, and to start enteral nutrition if oral intake cannot resume within 5–7 days.

### The ongoing debate of serum ammonia levels in cirrhosis: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^6a6dbffc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum ammonia testing in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been long debated in the field of hepatology. Although central to the pathophysiology of HE, serum ammonia testing is fraught with complexities that can lead to challenges in laboratory collection and interpretation. Although there is some disagreement across guideline organizations regarding routine testing of ammonia in HE, all acknowledge that normal values, although possible in HE, may warrant reconsideration of the diagnosis. In this study, we propose a nuanced approach to ammonia testing in HE. Serum ammonia testing provides little additional benefit in clinical scenarios with a high or low pretest probability for HE. However, if the pretest probability for HE is uncertain, a low ammonia level may reduce the posttest probability of HE. In this scenario, other etiologies of altered mental status should be explored. Future research should focus on developing a standardized approach to serum ammonia collection, processing, and interpretation.

Several cases of CTLN1 in pregnant women have been reported in the past. Potter et al. reported a woman diagnosed with CTLN1 at birth. She had no obvious symptoms of discomfort in daily life. Häberle et al. reported three women who presented in hyperammonemic coma shortly after delivery. One died and two survived without neurologic sequelae. They were eventually diagnosed with CTLN1. A healthy 28-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks of pregnancy presented with altered mental status, encephalopathy, and abnormal liver tests. Her ammonia level was 208 μg/dL. Eventually, she was found to have CTLN1. The patient began a low protein diet along with arginine, carnitine, and sodium phenylbutyrate. The patient's mental status normalized, and she had an uncomplicated term delivery of a healthy male baby. Salek et al also reported a 25-year-old woman at 19 weeks of pregnancy with symptoms of nausea, emesis, and edema of both lower limbs in 2010. Elevated aminotransferases, jaundice, an elevated international normalized ratio, and confusion are typical findings of idiopathic acute liver failure. CTLN1 was confirmed by molecular testing. Her ammonia levels remained low, and she delivered a male infant who appeared completely normal at birth and at 2 months of age.

### The incidence of movement disorder increases with age and contrasts with subtle and limited neuroimaging abnormalities in argininosuccinic aciduria [^8ec0e1f4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA) (OMIM#207900) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disease, with a prevalence of 1 in 110 000 live births and is the second most common urea cycle disorder. Patients present with acute hyperammonemia either in the neonatal period (early‐onset phenotype), or later in life (late‐onset presentation). Patients can develop a systemic phenotype with chronic neurological (50%–92%), hepatic (37%–52%) and gastrointestinal (33%) problems, hypokalaemia (46%) and arterial hypertension in isolated cases. The neurological phenotype is variable with intellectual difficulties, attention deficit, epilepsy, behavioural changes and a movement disorder. Whilst hyperammonemia can explain some of the symptoms and the neurological sequelae observed in ASA chronic encephalopathy and these symptoms often occur despite satisfactory control of ammonia levels. The best‐accepted therapy for ASA relies on ammonia control through use of a protein‐restricted diet, ammonia scavengers and arginine supplementation, with an increasing number of patients treated by liver transplantation. It has been suggested recently that liver transplantation could have a sustained neurological benefit even in individuals with ASA with well‐controlled ammonia levels.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^511ff5fb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Induced hyperammonemia using either glutamine alone or combined with other amino acids is associated with electroencephalographic, brain magnetic resonance and biochemical alterations, the neuropsychological consequences of which are inconstant, showing either absent, partial or generalized deterioration of tests' performance. In the present study, we observed changes limited to the Trail A and B tests, both commonly used components of standard test battery for the detection of minimal HE, suggesting that visuo-spatial skills and visuo-motor coordination are affected by hyperammonemia. We also explored whether induced hyperammonemia could predict the development of overt HE during follow-up, and found that post test capillary blood ammonia was a poor predictor of events. This is in contradiction with results from the study by Romero-Gomez et al. who reported that an abnormal ammonia response after oral glutamine was predictive of the development of overt HE during follow-up. The distribution of liver disease severity in the 2 studies (Child A patients: 75% versus 17% in our study) and the absence of any treatment for HE that may influence the ammonia response following a glutamine challenge, could explain these differences.

Our study is in line with previous results which showed that determination of blood ammonia levels, either a single venous dosage or in capillary blood after induced hyperammonemia, correlates only poorly with symptoms of HE. Whether determination of ammonia in a arterialized-venous blood, as in our study, shows higher values as compared to venous blood has been proposed but not confirmed in our small subgroup of 8 patients. Thus, additional parameters such as size and extension of portosystemic shunts, hyponatremia, nutritional status, the presence of hepatitis C infection, together with the presence of a systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome (SIRS) that may modulate ammonia neurotoxicity at the cerebral level, are factors that influence the development of HE. We were however not able to examine all these parameters in our cohort, as values of serum creatinine, sodium, and C-reactive protein were available only in a limited number of patients.

### Systemic inflammatory response exacerbates the neuropsychological effects of induced hyperammonemia in cirrhosis [^54bcb0e2]. Journal of Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Studies in acute liver failure show correlation between evidence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and progression of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We tested the hypothesis that SIRS mediators, such as nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines, may exacerbate the neuropsychological effects of hyperammonemia in cirrhosis.

Methods

Ten patients with cirrhosis were studied, 24–36 h after admission with clinical evidence of infection, and following its resolution. Hyperammonemia was induced by oral administration of an amino-acid (aa) solution mimicking hemoglobin composition. Inflammatory mediators, nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, aa profiles and a battery of neuropsychological tests were measured.

Results

The hyperammonemia generated in response to the aa solution was similar prior to, and after resolution, of the inflammation (P = 0.77). With treatment of the infection there were significant reductions in white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), nitrate/nitrite, interleukin-6, interleukin-1beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha. Induced hyperammonemia resulted in significant worsening of the neuropsychological scores when patients showed evidence of SIRS but not after its resolution.

Conclusions

The significant deterioration of neuropsychological test scores following induced hyperammonemia during the inflammatory state, but not after its resolution, suggests that the inflammation and its mediators may be important in modulating the cerebral effect of ammonia in liver disease.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^a9197f3f]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in critically ill cirrhosis — brain failure characterization and workup should be guided as follows: The West Haven HE criteria and the Glasgow Coma Scale should be used to characterize brain failure, with cutoffs of Grade 3 or 4 HE and Glasgow Coma Scale < 8 indicating severe injury; consider ICU admission for patients with Grades 3 and 4 HE; investigation and treatment of potential precipitating factors and empirical therapy for suspected HE should be performed; workup should include liver-unrelated causes of altered mental status, especially if this is the first episode of confusion or if a patient does not respond to empirical therapy or the precipitating factors are not readily identified; routine brain imaging in patients with presentation similar to prior episodes of HE is not warranted, though brain imaging could be considered for a first episode of altered mental status, seizures or new focal neurological signs, or an unsatisfactory response to therapy; routine ammonia level testing in patients with cirrhosis and altered mental status is not recommended, and a low ammonia level in patients with coma or confusion should point toward etiologies other than HE.

Idiopathic hyperammonemia is a rare complication with a high mortality rate that occurs in persons with hematologic malignancies or hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant. Patients present with encephalopathy and hyperammonemia in the absence of liver disease or inborn errors of metabolism. Several etiologies have been proposed, including chemotherapeutic agents, medications, and a catabolic state with an elevated nitrogen load in the setting of acute illness. Recently, cases of hyperammonemia in adult lung transplant recipients have been attributed to infection from Ureaplasma parvum or U urealyticum Herein, we report a 12-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukemia and neutropenic fever who developed acute encephalopathy. Laboratory testing revealed severe hyperammonemia (blood ammonia level > 1609 μmol/L) with normal liver function studies. U parvum was detected in blood, urine, and respiratory specimens by polymerase chain reaction testing. After antibiotic therapy directed against U parvum, blood ammonia levels normalized, the infection was eradicated, and the patient recovered. We propose that clinicians should test for invasive infection from Ureaplasma species in immunocompromised children with unexplained hyperammonemia.

3.3.2 Mitochondrial ornithine transporter 1 deficiency/Hyperornithinemia‐hyperammonemia‐homocitrullinuria syndrome

HHH syndrome is caused by impaired ornithine transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane due to mutations in the ORNT1 transporter. 103 HHH syndrome is associated with high clinical variability; mild forms manifest with learning difficulties and slight neurological involvement, while symptoms of severe deficiencies include coma, lethargy, hepatic signs, and seizures. Long‐term management consists of a low‐protein diet, citrulline, or arginine supplementation, and, in some patients, nitrogen‐scavenging drugs. Although the incidence of HHH syndrome is unknown, it is estimated at < 1:2 000 000. 2

Martinelli et al 103 published a comprehensive review of previously published cases as well as new cases of HHH syndrome and examined neuropsychological outcomes in 111 patients. The neuropsychological profile of patients was characterized by abnormal behavior (n = 30/51), intellectual disability (n = 58/85), seizures (n = 31/88), lethargy (n = 47/79), and coma (n = 30/94). Among patients with intellectual disability, 36% had mild or moderate intellectual disability (IQ/DQ of 35‐69), while 38% had severe disability (IQ/DQ < 35). This series included data from Kim et al 104 who reported on longitudinal follow‐up of four adults with HHH syndrome. Normal development was reported during infancy and early childhood in all four cases; however, by adulthood, all experienced progression of neurological symptoms and intellectual disability despite attempts at treatment. 104

In the UCDC Longitudinal Study, 23 three of four infants demonstrated developmental delay but performed within the borderline to average range of intelligence by preschool and school age. The one adult attained an IQ of 100 at age 21 and 84 at age 26 years. Guan et al 105 reported on three cases of HHH syndrome identified because of clinical symptoms from 2011‐2016. All three experienced developmental delay, and two had moderate intellectual disabilities. Once treated, improvements were noted in behavior and functioning

Pooled data, primarily gleaned from the Martinelli et al 103 review, suggest modest improvements when treatment is initiated early, but the disease may progress in adulthood. Intellectual disabilities were reported in 72% and 65% of published cases ≤ 2000 and > 2000, respectively.

### Features of adult hyperammonemia not due to liver failure in the ICU [^167c921b]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the epidemiology of hyperammonemia unrelated to liver failure in the critical care setting.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Setting

Critically ill patients admitted to ICUs at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (medical ICU, two mixed medical-surgical ICUs, coronary care unit, or the cardiosurgical ICU) between July 1, 2004, and October 31, 2015.

Patients

Adult critically ill patients with hyperammonemia not related to acute or chronic liver failure. We excluded patients with diagnosis of moderate or severe liver disease, hyperbilirubinemia, and patients who denied the use of their medical records.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 3,908 ICU patients with hyperammonemia, 167 (4.5%) had no evidence of acute or chronic liver failure. One-hundred one patients (60.5%) were male with median age of 65.7 years (interquartile range, 50–74.5 yr) and median serum ammonia level of 68 µg/dL (interquartile range, 58–87 µg/dL). Acute encephalopathy was present in 119 patients (71%). Predisposing conditions included malnutrition 27 (16%), gastric bypass six (3.6%), total parenteral nutrition four (2.4%); exposure to valproic acid 17 (10%); status epilepticus 11 (6.6%), high tumour burden 19 (11.3%), and renal failure 82 (49.1%). Urea cycle defects were diagnosed in seven patients (4.1%). Hospital mortality was high (30%), and median ammonia level was higher among the nonsurvivors (74 vs 67 µg/dL; p = 0.05). Deaths were more likely in hyperammonemic patients who were older (p = 0.016), had greater illness severity (higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, p < 0.01), malignancy (p < 0.01), and solid organ transplantation (p = 0.04), whereas seizure disorder was more common in survivors (p = 0.02). After adjustment, serum ammonia level was not associated with increased mortality.

Conclusions

Hyperammonemia occurs in a substantial minority of critically ill patients without liver failure. These patients have a poor prognosis, although ammonia level per se is not independently associated with mortality. Serum ammonia should be measured when risk factors are present, such as nutritional deficiencies and protein refeeding, treatment with valproic acid, high tumour burden, and known or suspected urea cycle abnormalities.

### Impact of citrulline substitution on clinical outcome after liver transplantation in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency [^89ff07b0]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiencies are rare urea cycle disorders, which can lead to life-threatening hyperammonemia. Liver transplantation (LT) provides a cure and offers an alternative to medical treatment and life-long dietary restrictions with permanent impending risk of hyperammonemia. Nevertheless, in most patients, metabolic aberrations persist after LT, especially low plasma citrulline levels, with questionable clinical impact. So far, little is known about these alterations and there is no consensus, whether l-citrulline substitution after LT improves patients' symptoms and outcomes. In this multicentre, retrospective, observational study of 24 patients who underwent LT for CPS1 (n = 11) or OTC (n = 13) deficiency, 25% did not receive l-citrulline or arginine substitution. Correlation analysis revealed no correlation between substitution dosage and citrulline levels (CPS1, p = 0.8 and OTC, p = 1). Arginine levels after liver transplantation were normal after LT independent of citrulline substitution. Native liver survival had no impact on mental impairment (p = 0.67). Regression analysis showed no correlation between l-citrulline substitution and failure to thrive (p = 0.611) or neurological outcome (p = 0.701). Peak ammonia had a significant effect on mental impairment (p = 0.017). Peak plasma ammonia levels correlate with mental impairment after LT in CPS1 and OTC deficiency. Growth and intellectual impairment after LT are not significantly associated with l-citrulline substitution.

Plasma exchange for treatment of hyperammonemia in acute liver failure — We suggest, when available, using plasma exchange in critically ill ALF patients who develop hyperammonemia (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Hyperammonemia is defined as ammonia level greater than 150 umol/L, and hyperammonemia is associated with cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension in ALF; intracranial hypertension developed in 55% of ALF patients with an ammonia level greater than 200 umol/L. The text notes limited ALF-specific studies and that treatments such as lactulose and rifaximin used in ACLF have not demonstrated benefit in ALF.

### Primary versus secondary psychosis in a patient with congenital liver disease [^98de7c5f]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling mental disorder that affects 0.5%–1% of the population worldwide that commonly presents in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterised clinically by positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations and thought disorder), negative symptoms (ie, social withdrawal, poverty of speech and anhedonia) and cognitive deficits (ie, attention, working memory and executive function).

Schizophrenia is associated with various neuroanatomical and structural brain abnormalities. For decades, the dopamine hypothesis has been the leading theory used to explain the mechanism of the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia symptoms. Over the past 20 years, however, there has been a confluence of evidence pointing to alterations in excitatory signalling, particularly involving hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), as a key contributor to the schizophrenia disease process.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurological disorder that occurs as a result of liver dysfunction, particularly in cases of cirrhosis. Advanced liver disease and portosystemic shunting do not just affect the liver; they notably impact brain function, causing behavioural, cognitive and motor impairments known as portosystemic encephalopathy, now part of HE.

The neuropsychiatric symptoms of HE can include depression, mania, hallucinations and delusions. Many of these neuropsychiatric alterations are the consequence of altered neurotransmission. Hyperammonaemia is a main contributor to the alterations in neurotransmission and neurological functions in HE. However, there exists conflicting evidence regarding its utility in monitoring treatment response and predicting prognosis for patients with HE. It is evident that blood ammonia levels correlate with the severity of HE. Nonetheless, elevated ammonia levels can persist even after clinical resolution of HE. Furthermore, the association between ammonia lowering and clinical treatment response is inconsistent, and ammonia levels are not routinely used for therapeutic monitoring. Recent studies have hinted at a prognostic significance of ammonia in patients with overt HE.

Both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission are altered in animal models of HE. Other models of acute liver failure have noted increased NMDA-displaceable glutamate binding in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

Considering findings that have traced alterations of the same neurotransmitter systems in both schizophrenia and HE, there might be room to consider an association of cirrhosis in causation and exacerbation of schizophrenia in a patient diagnosed with both disorders.

In this case report, we describe the clinical history of a man with chronic liver disease who later developed psychotic illness and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. We illustrate how decompensated cirrhosis was associated with the exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, and we discuss differential diagnostic challenges as well as possible unifying neuropathogenic mechanisms.

### Breakfast improves cognitive function in cirrhotic patients with cognitive impairment [^8fd1b620]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive disturbances are relatively common in patients with liver disease. High protein load precipitates hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a prevalent neurocognitive complication of cirrhosis.

Objective

Because the influence of nutritional factors on the progression of cognitive impairment has not been explored in depth, this study aimed to investigate the effect on cognition of acute metabolic changes induced by breakfast consumption.

Design

Twenty-one subjects (10 women) with Child A cirrhosis and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Patients and controls were divided into 2 groups: those receiving a breakfast of 500 kcal and 21 g protein and those receiving no breakfast. Serum ammonia concentrations and cognitive functions were studied (Mindstreams; NeuroTrax, Fresh Meadows, NY) before and 2 h after breakfast. A mixed model was used to analyze the data.

Results

At baseline, cirrhotic patients had significantly lower total scores and significantly lower subscores (P < 0.015 global cognitive score) in 4 of 7 cognitive categories, which is indicative of MHE. Patients with hyperammonemia (> 85 mug/dL) scored significantly lower for attention than did patients with normal serum ammonia concentrations (P < 0.003). After 2 h, MHE patients and controls responded differently to breakfast consumption with regard to attention and executive functions (P < 0.003 and P < 0.04, respectively). Although patients' scores improved after breakfast consumption, despite an increase in serum ammonia, healthy controls who continued to fast performed better.

Conclusions

Chronic hyperammonemia may negatively affect attention. Eating breakfast improves attention and executive functions of patients with MHE. Prolonged periods of starvation may be partly responsible for these changes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01083446.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate [^1bf63b26]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

A patient or carrier of these disorders should wear a Medic Alert tag stating the diagnosis. In the event that the patient has a sudden, rapid accumulation of ammonia in the blood, and, therefore, in the brain, leading to unconsciousness, the doctor will be alerted to treat the disease properly.

Periodically, depending upon the severity of a particular patient's urea cycle disorder, it will be necessary to perform blood tests. These include plasma ammonia, plasma amino acid levels, and other more routine blood tests to evaluate nutritional status.

What is sodium phenylbutyrate powder?

Sodium phenylbutyrate powder is a drug that helps to prevent ammonia from accumulating in the blood. Sodium phenylbutyrate powder aids the body in eliminating substances that produce ammonia. However, despite drug treatment, blood ammonia levels may become elevated periodically and there may be episodes of altered brain function in association with these ammonia elevations. Patients who have disease onset as newborns have a high incidence of mental retardation. Medical attention should be obtained as soon as signs appear (see above under "What are urea cycle disorders?"). Sodium phenylbutyrate powder may be used as life-long therapy or as a temporary measure until liver transplantation is performed.

What diet should I or my child follow?

In addition to taking sodium phenylbutyrate powder, it is equally important that a prescribed diet be followed. Because there is great variability in the severity of urea cycle disorders, each patient's diet should be custom designed by a physician and a nutritionist. Because the diet is so important, it is recommended that the prescribed diet be discussed with a nutritionist who is familiar with urea cycle disorders.

3 ABOUT THE YEARS THAT HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN AND CURRENT "UNKNOWNS"

Despite the many years that have passed since these important discoveries by Hans Krebs and Kurt Henseleit have been made, there remain many "Unknowns" in the field of ureagenesis disorders.

We do not fully understand the poor neurological outcome in ASL deficiency, the first described UCD; we do not understand why in this condition even in the absence of hyperammonemia there is often a poor neurological outcome. The recent description of the expression of ASL in some brainstem nuclei contributes to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. Nevertheless, there remain several open questions: What is the contribution of argininosuccinic acid (ASA) to liver and brain toxicity? Can nitric oxide donors compensate for brain ASL deficiency? Do we need to redefine the role of liver transplantation for this condition? Should gene therapy target liver and brain? How toxic are accumulating guanidino compounds? Is there creatine deficiency and does it matter?

### A deadly case of dehydration: organic acidemias in the emergency department [^de357205]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Organic acidemias are rare genetic mutations, most commonly identified in the newborn period. Late-onset presentations present a diagnostic conundrum. Early identification and appropriate management can be lifesaving.

Case Report

We describe the case of a 3-year-old boy who presented to urgent care with 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea followed by respiratory distress, shock, and encephalopathy. Brisk recognition of his shock state led to an urgent transfer to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department by air where his shock was treated and hyperammonemia was uncovered, leading to the diagnosis of late-onset propionic acidemia, which was subsequently managed with a good outcome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Late-onset presentations of inborn errors of metabolism, including organic acidemias, represent one of the most challenging pediatric cases an emergency physician can encounter. This case reviews the management and diagnosis of a late-onset inborn error of metabolism and emphasizes how prompt diagnosis and treatment can lead to a favorable outcome.

### A capillary blood ammonia bedside test following glutamine load to improve the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis [^7c5c1a68]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis that affects quality of life, increases the risk of accidents, and is an independent predictor of poor outcome. When neurological deficits are subtle but the neurological clinical examination is normal, a condition referred to as minimal HE, patients are exposed to a risk of developing clinical episodes of HE over time. The presence of HE in cirrhosis is a prognostic marker of severity and a valid indication for liver transplantation, although it is not considered in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score on which organ distribution is based in most liver transplant centres.

Neurological alterations observed in HE are postulated to result from the exposure of the brain to abnormally elevated concentrations of ammonia present in the general circulation in response to liver insufficiency and portosystemic collaterals. Accordingly, high ammonia levels have been associated with large portosystemic collaterals such as esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. However, ammonia determination is not currently accepted as a reliable marker to identify patients with HE. Hyperammonemia arises from the production by colonic bacteria and the small intestine through an increased intestinal glutaminase activity. Although the pathogenesis of HE is still incompletely elucidated, the ammonia hypothesis remain central and a large number of experimental data support the role of hyperammonemia in the direct and indirect alterations of brain function that characterize HE.

### Mechanisms, diagnosis and management of hepatic encephalopathy [^2281cbd2]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric complication of both acute and chronic liver disease. Symptoms of HE can include confusion, disorientation and poor coordination. A general consensus exists that the synergistic effects of excess ammonia and inflammation cause astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema; however, the precise molecular mechanisms that lead to these morphological changes in the brain are unclear. Cerebral edema occurs to some degree in all patients with HE, regardless of its grade, and could underlie the pathogenesis of this disorder. The different grades of HE can be diagnosed by a number of investigations, including neuropsychometric tests (such as the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score), brain imaging and clinical scales (such as the West Haven criteria). HE is best managed by excluding other possible causes of encephalopathy alongside identifying and the precipitating cause, and confirming the diagnosis by a positive response to empiric treatment. Empiric therapy for HE is largely based on the principle of reducing the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut through administration of pharmacological agents such as rifaximin and lactulose, which are approved by the FDA for the treatment of HE.

### Choosing between medical management and liver transplant in urea cycle disorders: a conceptual framework for parental treatment decision-making in rare disease [^c8eae546]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Urea cycle disorders (UCD) are rare inherited disorders of metabolism caused by deficiencies of one of six enzymes and two transporters required for ammonia detoxification and urea synthesis. Disruption of the urea cycle can result in hyperammonaemia which precipitates cytotoxic brain oedema and may result in death. In those who recover from acute hyperammonaemia, intellectual and developmental disabilities are common. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Despite significant improvements in medical management (MM) following the wider availability of alternative pathway medications, most individuals with UCD remain at high risk of hyperammonaemia. 7, 8 Thus, an increasing number of patients have been undergoing liver transplantation (LT) as a procedure that "cures" the hyperammonaemia. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 However, LT is a complicated surgical procedure, which carries risk of mortality and morbidity and requires a life‐long regimen of immunosuppression.

Most patients with UCD are at elevated risk for disability or death at various times in their lives. 14 This risk, although always present, is not easily quantified, especially among mild‐moderately affected patients. This ambiguity can make treatment decisions, like if and/or when to pursue LT, particularly challenging for patients. In other medical conditions, the decision to perform transplantation is often made because organ function has failed. However, for patients with UCD, the decision can be more complex as outcomes from medical therapy vary widely and because transplantation is ideally initiated when patients are stable rather than critically ill. There is also limited empirical evidence to support clinical guidance on treatment alternatives for patients with UCD, introducing ambiguity and personal judgement to the process of making treatment decisions. Clinicians involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UCD have long relied on non‐comparative research findings in combination with expert opinion to guide clinical practice and treatment counselling for these disorders. 15 Thus, they have been unable to help patients and families weigh available treatment alternatives against key health outcomes like survival, neurocognitive status, and quality of life. 3, 6, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 A more detailed description of currently available treatment guidance and evidence to support treatment decision making in UCD is available in the appendix (Table A1).

### Hyperammonemic encephalopathy in a child with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency due to a novel combined heterozygous mutations [^8b2e88d0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked disorder of metabolism of the urea cycle. It usually causes hyperammonemic encephalopathy in males during the neonatal to-infantile period, whereas female carriers present with variable manifestations depending on their pattern of random chromosome X inactivation in the liver. Early clinical manifestations of hyperammonemiaare nonspecific often leading to a delay in the diagnosis of OTCD. Unfortunately, delays in initiating treatment often lead to poor neurologic outcomes and overall survival. Presentation of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in children with OTCD is rare, and the mortality and morbidity rates are high. The diagnosis of OTCD and aggressive management of hyperammonemia were of paramount importance for appropriate treatment and successful recovery. Here, we report theclinical, biochemical, and molecular findings in a child with OTCD who presented with acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy.

### Identifying encephalopathies from acute metabolic derangements [^b7ced93c]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic derangements, when acute and severe, affect brain function. This presents mostly with a marked decline in the level of consciousness, resulting in impaired responsiveness, abnormal receptivity, impaired content, and loss of memory retention. The term metabolic encephalopathy has been used but is conjecture that can be challenged in the age of modern neuroimaging. We now recognize that many metabolic encephalopathies may involve structural lesions and at an early stage. Common clinical conundrums are the evaluation of the degree of brain injury and its recoverability. This review discusses the appropriate terminology for these conditions, the diagnostic approach, therapy recommendations, and prediction of recovery potential. In evaluating a presumed metabolic cause for encephalopathy, we must (1) search for and rule out structural injury to the brain despite an obvious explanatory metabolic derangement, (2) recognize that several confounding conditions often co-exist, and (3) acknowledge that resolution of brain dysfunction may be protracted despite normalization of laboratory values.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for urea cycle disorders, more specifically with respect to extracorporeal detoxification, hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration, NRN 2020 guidelines recommend to perform continuous RRT in patients with hyperammonemia in the following situations:

- rapidly deteriorating neurological status, coma, or cerebral edema with blood ammonia level > 150 mcmol/L

- presence of moderate or severe encephalopathy (moderate encephalopathy is defined as lethargy, distal flexion, decreased activity, complete extension, hypotonia, weak suck or incomplete Moro reflex, constricted pupils, or bradycardia; severe encephalopathy is defined as stupor or coma, no activity, decerebrate posture, flaccid tone, absent suck, absent Moro reflex, pupils non-reactive to light, variable HR or sleep apnea)

- persistently high blood ammonia levels > 400 mcmol/L refractory to non-RRT

- rapid rise in blood ammonia levels to > 300 mcmol/L within a few hours that cannot be controlled via non-RRT.

### The incidence of movement disorder increases with age and contrasts with subtle and limited neuroimaging abnormalities in argininosuccinic aciduria [^a029c95d]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

ASA is caused by the deficiency of the cytosolic enzyme argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), the only mammalian enzyme enabling endogenous arginine synthesis. ASL breaks down argininosuccinic acid into arginine and fumarate. This biochemical reaction is integral to the nitric oxide (NO) cycle, facilitating NO synthesis from arginine, and the urea cycle, a liver‐based pathway enabling excess nitrogen to be converted to ammonia prior to conversion to urea for excretion. The pathophysiology of ASA chronic encephalopathy is likely multifactorial with detrimental roles of hyperammonemia, argininosuccinate toxicity, deficiency of arginine and downstream metabolites such as creatine, neuronal nitro‐oxidative stressand NO‐mediated downregulation of central catecholamine biosynthesis suggesting a neurodegenerative phenotype.

Here, we present a national multicentre retrospective study assessing the movement disorder phenotype in ASA, a well‐recognised feature of ASA chronic encephalopathy. We provide a clinical description of neurodegenerative‐related symptoms, movement disorder, hypotonia/fatigue and abnormal behaviour for a large cohort of patients, present patient neuroimaging data and highlight the difficulties in modelling the movement disorder phenotype in ASA mouse models. We show that the incidence of movement disorder in ASA increases with ageing, starting in adolescence and early adulthood. Abnormal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) features can affect both the grey and white matter, preferentially close to basal ganglia. In order to assess the role of cerebral ASL deficiency (ASLD) without the confounding bias of hyperammonemia, liver‐targeting mRNA therapy‐treated ASLD mice with normalised ureagenesis were assessed. They did not recapitulate the DTI patient findings and showed normal single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) with 123 I‐ioflupane, a dopamine analogue radionuclide. These findings support the pathophysiology of a movement disorder in ASA with functional central catecholamine dysregulation but without loss of dopaminergic neurons, making movement‐disorder symptoms amenable to targeted therapy.

### Ammonia-induced stress response in liver disease progression and hepatic encephalopathy [^5925391b]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Ammonia levels are orchestrated by a series of complex interrelated pathways in which the urea cycle has a central role. Liver dysfunction leads to an accumulation of ammonia, which is toxic and is strongly associated with disruption of potassium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypoxaemia and dysregulation of neurotransmission. Hyperammonaemia is a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy and has been strongly associated with liver-related outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and liver failure. In addition to the established role of ammonia as a neurotoxin in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, an increasing number of studies suggest that it can lead to hepatic fibrosis progression, sarcopenia, immune dysfunction and cancer. However, elevated systemic ammonia levels are uncommon in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. A clear causal relationship between ammonia-induced immune dysfunction and risk of infection has not yet been definitively proven. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms by which ammonia produces its diverse deleterious effects and their clinical relevance in liver diseases, the importance of measuring ammonia levels for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and liver failure, and how our knowledge of inter-organ ammonia metabolism is leading to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

### Do ammonia levels correlate with hepatic encephalopathy?… [^0cdf9b2d]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver dysfunction is believed to be caused by a failure of the liver to clear toxic products from the stomach. The exact toxins that cause hepatic encephalopathy have not been established, but ammonia may be involved. Many physicians determine ammonia levels to diagnose hepatic encephalopathy and as a guide to treatment. However, studies have shown that the correlation between serum ammonia levels and severity of hepatic encephalopathy is inconsistent. A recent study suggested that the partial pressure of ammonia may correlate more closely with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy than the total plasma ammonia level. Ong and associates evaluated the correlation between plasma ammonia levels and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.

They also determined the best of the four types of ammonia measurements for this correlation by comparing arterial total ammonia, venous total ammonia, arterial partial pressure of ammonia, and venous partial pressure of ammonia. Consecutive patients who were admitted to a tertiary care center with the diagnosis of cirrhosis between September 1998 and December 1999 were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was established by biopsy or by signs of portal hypertension such as gastroesophageal varices, previous variceal bleeding, or ascites. Researchers collected clinical and laboratory data at the time of admission. The mental status of the patients was assessed using the West Haven Criteria for grading of mental status. A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was established when the patients' mental status was altered and other causes of mental status changes had been excluded.

After diagnosis, fasting arterial and venous blood samples were obtained, and total ammonia and partial pressure of ammonia were determined. All four measurements of ammonia increased with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. The arterial total ammonia level had the highest correlation, but it was not statistically significant. Other variables that had a correlation to the severity of hepatic encephalopathy included International Normalized Ratio values, serum creatinine levels, bilirubin levels, and lactulose use. A multivariable ordered logistic regression analysis revealed that only serum ammonia levels and INR values were independently associated with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. The authors conclude that venous total ammonia levels do correlate with severity of hepatic encephalopathy and should be adequate in evaluating patients with this condition.

Total arterial ammonia levels and partial pressure of ammonia levels had similar correlation but did not prove to be better markers than venous total ammonia levels.

### Randomized, double-blind, controlled study of glycerol phenylbutyrate in hepatic encephalopathy [^628b4b51]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) constitutes a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities ranging from confusion to coma.–It is typically reversible, although patients do not always recover to the original level of function, and it represents a major burden to patients, families, and the health care system.–

The pathophysiology of HE is incompletely understood. Though elevated blood ammonia has long been suspected as important, the evidence is largely correlative, other factors have been postulated, and evidence against ammonia has been reported.–Current treatments, including poorly absorbed disaccharides (e.g. lactulose) and antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin), may act by reducing ammonia production and/or absorption in the intestine, but are not ammonia selective.

Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB; HPN-100; Hyperion Therapeutics, Inc. South San Francisco, CA) is approved for treatment of urea cycle disorders, inherited disorders manifested by hyperammonemia,–and is under development for HE.GPB consists of three molecules of phenylbutyric acid (PBA) joined to glycerol by ester linkage and is an odorless, nearly tasteless sodium-free liquid that acts by providing an alternate pathway for ammonia removal and waste nitrogen excretion in the form of urinary phenylacetyl glutamine (PAGN).–

A 4-week open-label study indicated that 6 mL of GPB given orally twice-daily with food was well tolerated and lowered ammonia in patients with cirrhosis and HE. Therefore, we performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study to test the hypothesis that lowering ammonia using this agent in patients with HE would decrease the likelihood of patients experiencing HE events.
