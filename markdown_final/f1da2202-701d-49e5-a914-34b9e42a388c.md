## Question

neurosyphilis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an approach to a patient with suspected neurosyphilis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and pretest probability to know when to suspect the diagnosis. Then, I should verify the indications for lumbar puncture and the optimal CSF tests. Next, I will consider imaging and diagnostic synthesis when tests are discordant. After that, I need to check the first-line and alternative antibiotic regimens, including nuances such as penicillin allergy and pregnancy. Finally, I will review HIV-specific considerations, ocular/otic disease, adjunctive therapies, and how to monitor treatment response and follow-up safely and effectively.

> Let me first anchor the pretest probability. Neurosyphilis remains uncommon but is increasing in parallel with rising syphilis notifications; neurologic manifestations occur across stages and in people with and without HIV, so I should maintain a low threshold for evaluation in at-risk patients, especially with high serum RPR titers or immunosuppression; I should confirm that high nontreponemal titers (for example RPR ≥ 1:32) and CD4 ≤ 350 cells/µL in HIV confer higher odds of neurosyphilis to refine suspicion before LP [^113Drskg] [^112mHxCc] [^115zaF7v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — clinical syndromes are protean and timing matters. Early neurosyphilis may present with meningitis, cranial neuropathies, meningovascular stroke, ocular or otic involvement within weeks to a few years, whereas late disease includes tabes dorsalis and general paresis years to decades later; ocular or otic disease should prompt the same treatment as neurosyphilis even if classical neurologic signs are absent, so I need to ask specifically about vision and hearing changes and examine accordingly [^11388M7H] [^114Ma81C] [^116iUyCJ].

> I should double-check the indications for CSF examination. Lumbar puncture is indicated when neurologic or psychiatric symptoms are present, with ocular or otic involvement, with serologic treatment failure or serofast states, in selected asymptomatic patients at higher risk such as HIV with CD4 ≤ 350 cells/µL and late syphilis, or when serum RPR is ≥ 1:32; these thresholds help me avoid both over- and under-testing while capturing high-risk scenarios [^11666zWP] [^115zaF7v] [^117QH3Ab].

> Next, I should review which CSF tests are most informative. Wait, let me verify performance: CSF VDRL is highly specific but insensitive, so a reactive result is confirmatory, whereas CSF FTA-ABS is sensitive but less specific; in resource-limited settings, CSF RPR may substitute pragmatically for CSF VDRL, and basic indices like CSF WBC and protein remain indispensable; in HIV, CSF pleocytosis can be confounded, so adjunctive markers such as CXCL13 can help in selected cases when conventional assays are equivocal [^114pGJXP] [^111YbDd4] [^112RXRsj] [^114PyZpx].

> I will now examine the role of neuroimaging. MRI is not diagnostic but can reveal patterns concordant with meningitis, meningovascular infarcts, limbic or mesiotemporal signal abnormalities, or myelopathic changes that support the clinical picture and exclude other etiologies; persistent inflammatory MRI despite immunosuppression for presumed autoimmune encephalitis should prompt me to reconsider neurosyphilis and proceed to targeted testing [^112gcS43] [^114Twvgq] [^11388M7H].

> Let me synthesize how to make the diagnosis when results conflict. A reactive CSF VDRL in the right clinical context essentially confirms neurosyphilis; if CSF VDRL is nonreactive, the combination of neurologic symptoms, abnormal CSF protein or WBC, and a reactive CSF treponemal test (FTA-ABS or TP-PA) supports a presumptive diagnosis that warrants treatment, keeping in mind the lower specificity of CSF treponemal assays and the possibility of false positives in patients with syphilis but no CNS disease [^114pGJXP] [^111Q7mfe].

> Now, treatment — wait, I should confirm dose and duration precisely. First-line therapy is aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18–24 million units per day IV, given as 3–4 million units every 4 hours or continuous infusion for 10–14 days; some guidelines also allow a single dose of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM after completion to ensure treponemicidal coverage in late latent compartments, but the core is the 10–14 day IV course maintained without interruption [^114Ma81C] [^112oBc9j] [^116zMPYm].

> But wait, what if there is a penicillin allergy? I should first consider penicillin desensitization, particularly in pregnancy, to permit first-line therapy; if desensitization is not feasible, ceftriaxone 2 g IV or IM once daily for 10–14 days is a supported alternative, and procaine penicillin G 1.8–2.4 million units IM daily plus probenecid 500 mg PO QID for 10–14 days can also be used when IV therapy is impractical; I almost said ceftriaxone 1 g daily, but hold on, I should correct that — current guidance prioritizes 2 g daily in neurosyphilis, and oral options like doxycycline 200 mg BID for 28 days or amoxicillin 2 g TID plus probenecid 500 mg QID for 28 days are less preferred and evidence-limited [^115A4zWd] [^1146e6aH] [^112oswF8] [^1111XUvh] [^114bChmN].

> Let me consider adjunctive corticosteroids. BASHH recommends prednisolone 40–60 mg daily for three days starting 24 hours before antibiotics in neurosyphilis or cardiovascular syphilis to mitigate inflammatory complications such as a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction; I should acknowledge that other major guidelines are silent and high-quality trial data are lacking, so I will apply this selectively in severe presentations after weighing risks and benefits [^1125sxR6] [^117QH3Ab].

> I need to ensure I address HIV-specific issues. Regimens are the same regardless of HIV status, but I should be cautious interpreting CSF pleocytosis that may reflect HIV alone; CD4 ≤ 350 cells/µL increases neurosyphilis risk, strengthening indications for CSF evaluation; in patients with a credible history of IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, loss of sensitivity over time or desensitization can enable penicillin use and should be considered first whenever possible [^112oBc9j] [^115zaF7v] [^1139JxN9] [^115A4zWd].

> For ocular or otic disease, let me verify that management aligns with neurosyphilis. Yes — treat ocular and otic syphilis with the same neurosyphilis regimens irrespective of CSF findings, and consider LP because results can guide follow-up, though treatment should not be delayed while awaiting CSF in vision- or hearing-threatening disease [^114Ma81C] [^116iUyCJ].

> Next, I should review how to monitor response. Clinically, I expect improvement in neurologic, ocular, or otic signs; serologically, I track nontreponemal titers for a fourfold decline over 12–24 months depending on stage; if titers fail to decline appropriately, manage as possible treatment failure with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for three weeks and close follow-up; I should confirm that repeat CSF is not routinely required if clinical and serologic responses are adequate, though some guidelines suggest a follow-up CSF at 6 weeks to 6 months to document falling WBC and protein, which I individualize based on presentation and HIV status [^112LWCxT] [^112LWCxT].

> In resource-limited settings, I should double-check practical substitutions. When CSF VDRL is unavailable, CSF RPR can be used operationally with awareness of similar but imperfect performance, and pairing neurologic symptoms with CSF protein and WBC provides strong diagnostic discrimination; machine-learning–derived simplified models underscore that these few variables capture much of the diagnostic signal, but I will apply them to complement — not replace — clinical judgment and guideline criteria [^111YbDd4] [^112RXRsj] [^112a9mEJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure treatment delivery is uninterrupted. Continuous treponemicidal levels in the CNS throughout the course are critical; if therapy is interrupted for more than 24 hours, I should restart the entire IV course to avoid subtherapeutic exposure that risks relapse or progression, and I will document the exact start and stop times to avoid ambiguity during handoffs [^111KEsxd] [^notfound].

### Tabes dorsalis: A rare presentation of neurosyphilis in Western Europe [^1137kxbF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Syphilis rates are increasing globally in the 21st century, with up to 25 cases per 100,000 people in the United States. With higher syphilis rates, the number of cases of symptomatic neurosyphilis also increases, which is estimated to occur in up to 4%–10% of patients with untreated syphilis, although epidemiological data are scarce.

As the meninges, blood vessels, cranial nerves, and eyes are frequently involved in early neurosyphilis, the parenchyma of the brain and the spinal cord are most often implicated in the late forms of neurosyphilis. Together with general paresis, tabes dorsalis belongs to the rare forms of tertiary neurosyphilis caused by a direct invasion of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord and dorsal roots by T. pallidum. However, not only the direct bacterial invasion but also a dysregulated immune response may be responsible for the pathogenesis of late forms of neurosyphilis.

Demyelination of the posterior columns, the posterior roots, and the posterior root ganglia are hallmarks in neuroradiological and histopathological studies of tabetic neurosyphilis. Matching the histopathological picture, the most frequently documented symptoms of tabes dorsalis are sensory ataxia with reduced deep tendon reflexes, as well as lancinating pains, primarily in the lower extremities. Gastric and bladder dysfunction, and overflow incontinence have also been described regularly. Pupillary irregularities and the Argyll-Robertson pupil, as a sign of optic neuropathies, are cornerstone signs of tabes dorsalis. While other forms of neurosyphilis, such as meningitis, meningovas…

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: Development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^112mHxCc]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Neurosyphilis is a clinically serious disease caused by the infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (hereafter, T. pallidum). After initial infection, T. pallidum disseminates within days and invades the CNS in approximately 30% of patients with untreated primary and secondary syphilis. If the organism is not cleared from the CNS, complicated syphilis, including early or late neurosyphilis, ocular or otic syphilis, may ensue. Early neurosyphilis includes asymptomatic neurosyphilis, syphilitic meningitis, and meningovascular syphilis, which occur weeks to months to the first few years after T. pallidum initial infection. Late neurosyphilis includes general paresis and tabes dorsalis, which occur years to decades after initial infection.

There are few population-based epidemiological data on neurosyphilis. In the pre-antibiotic era, about 30% of individuals with untreated syphilis developed neurosyphilis, of which 30% were asymptomatic. In another study, 9.50% of untreated early syphilis cases developed late neurosyphilis. More recent data showed that the prevalence of confirmed or suspected neurosyphilis among primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis in the United States from 2009 to 2015 was 0.84%. The incidence rate of neurosyphilis in the Netherlands from 1999 to 2010 was 0.47 cases per 100,000 adults. In British Columbia, Canada, the reported incidence of neurosyphilis increased 26.67-fold from 0.03 cases per 100,000 adults in 1992 to 0.80 cases per 100,000 adults in 2012. In Guangdong province of China, the reported incidence…

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114Ma81C]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

The CDC 2021 guidelines for the medical management of syphilis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy for neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and auricular syphilis in HIV-negative individuals, recommend administering aqueous crystalline penicillin G. The dosage is 18,000,000 to 24,000,000 units daily, delivered as 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 units intravenously every 4 hours or through continuous IV infusion. This treatment should be maintained for 10–14 days in adult patients.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^114pGJXP]. Clinical infectious diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Thirteen studies described the performance of the CSF FTA-ABS test, though not all studies reported both sensitivity and specificity. These were summarized in a prior systematic review. In three studies of patients with definitive neurosyphilis, as determined by a reactive CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test, the sensitivity of CSF FTA-ABS ranged from 90.9% to 100%. Among those with presumptive neurosyphilis, where diagnosis was based on reactive serology, other abnormal CSF indices, and clinical signs or symptoms, sensitivity varied widely from 22.2% to 100%.

A study by Luger et al. of 60 symptomatic patients defined neurosyphilis by comparing ratios of serum protein and CSF protein with the ratio of serum treponemal antibody and CSF treponemal antibody. In this study, the sensitivity of the CSF FTA-ABS was 100%. Another large study by Hooshmand et al. (n = 156) also found 100% sensitivity of CSF FTA-ABS. However, since a reactive CSF FTA-ABS was part of the case definition, the sensitivity results cannot be fully interpreted.

The specificity of FTA-ABS varied greatly depending on the classification of true negatives. Six studies included patients without syphilis as true negatives, where the specificity of FTA-ABS was 100%. Conversely, a study by Jaffe et al. found that CSF FTA was reactive in five out of 15 patients with syphilis who showed no other evidence of neurosyphilis. In eleven studies that included patients with syphilis, but not neurosyphilis, specificity ranged from 55% to 100%.

For CSF TP-PA, four studies described the test's performance, with findings including.

### Diflucan [^115qxFDG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis: The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of Diflucan for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily.

- **Prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation**: The recommended Diflucan daily dosage for the prevention of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation is 400 mg once daily. Patients who are anticipated to have severe granulocytopenia (less than 500 neutrophils cells/mm³) should start Diflucan prophylaxis several days before the anticipated onset of neutropenia and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 1000 cells/mm³.

### 2020 European guideline on the management of syphilis [^11666zWP]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for syphilis, specifically with respect to CSF analysis, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend considering CSF assessment in asymptomatic patients in the following situations to exclude asymptomatic neurosyphilis:

- **HIV-positive patients**: Late syphilis and CD4 cells ≤ 350/mm³ and/or a serum VDRL/RPR titer > 1:32.

- **Serological failure or serofast**: Serological failure is defined as a less than fourfold decrease in the antibody titer of a non-treponemal test 6–12 months after treatment of early syphilis. Serofast refers to the persistence of a low antibody titer, i.e. ≤ 4, of a non-treponemal test 1–2 years after treatment of early syphilis.

- **Received alternative treatment**: Such as doxycycline, for late syphilis.

### Neurosyphilis presenting as limbic encephalitis [^114Twvgq]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A man in his 50s presented with focal seizures and was found to have an inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with bilateral mesiotemporal lobe hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Corticosteroid treatment was initiated for the management of limbic encephalitis. Focal seizures, imaging abnormalities, and inflammatory CSF persisted despite treatment, and the patient was found to have neurosyphilis after developing neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection with multisystem involvement, including neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Case reports have emerged of neurosyphilis presenting as limbic encephalitis with CSF pleocytosis and temporal lobe hyperintensity on MRI of the brain. Persistence of CSF or MRI abnormalities despite immunosuppressive therapy for limbic encephalitis should prompt investigation for alternate causes of chronic meningoencephalitis, which can occasionally include neurosyphilis.

### Neutrophil-associated proteins as novel biomarkers elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurosyphilis [^1137QDCx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The immunopathological mechanisms underlying neurosyphilis remain incompletely elucidated, posing significant diagnostic challenges.

- **Methods**: We employed an antibody microarray to detect 640 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from 6 patients with non-neurosyphilis and 10 with neurosyphilis. Additionally, the levels of CSF CXCL1, CXCL8, G-CSF, LCN2, MMP8, and MMP9 in 46 patients with non-neurosyphilis, 51 with untreated neurosyphilis, and 31 post-treatment for neurosyphilis were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations between the protein levels and clinical parameters in neurosyphilis were evaluated using Spearman analysis. The diagnostic performance of these proteins was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.

- **Results**: A total of 102 differentially expressed proteins between neurosyphilis and non-neurosyphilis were identified. Levels of significantly elevated neutrophil-associated proteins (CXCL1, CXCL8, G-CSF, LCN2, MMP8, and MMP9) in neurosyphilis showed a positive correlation with white blood cell counts, rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer, and protein concentration in CSF. The combination of CSF CXCL8, MMP9, and LCN2 produced an area under the curve of 0.92 for diagnosing neurosyphilis, surpassing that of CSF RPR.

- **Conclusions**: CXCL1, CXCL8, G-CSF, LCN2, MMP8, and MMP9 may be associated with central nervous system damage in neurosyphilis. The combination of CSF CXCL8, MMP9, and LCN2 presents a promising biomarker for diagnosing neurosyphilis.

### Neurosyphilis in psychiatric practice: a case-based discussion of clinical evaluation and diagnosis [^114pqY76]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Neurosyphilis can present with a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Hence, psychiatrists need to be familiar with tests for syphilis screening and how to interpret syphilis serologic tests.

- **Methods**: We present four cases of patients with positive syphilis tests encountered in a psychiatric hospital.

- **Results**: Two cases were treated for neurosyphilis, while the other two cases did not have active syphilis infection despite positive results.

- **Conclusion**: We thus highlight the challenges encountered by psychiatrists in screening for and diagnosing cases of neurosyphilis.

### Intrathecal IgA synthesis in neurosyphilis [^116VCRKJ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

Neurosyphilis can develop during any stage of syphilis. It has recently been reported that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data from patients with parenchymal or meningovascular neurosyphilis all show the absence of IgA synthesis and occasionally a concomitant IgM synthesis. In this context, it has been stated that intrathecal IgA synthesis contradicts the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. In our CSF analysis of four patients with definite neurosyphilis, we observed an intrathecal synthesis of IgA, IgG, and IgM in two patients. Our data are consistent with data from other studies suggesting that about 50% of patients with neurosyphilis show intrathecal synthesis of IgA. Therefore, intrathecal synthesis of IgA does not necessarily contradict the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

We hypothesize that intrathecal synthesis of IgA does not necessarily serve as a discriminating feature between neurosyphilis and other inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disorders and that other laboratory parameters and the clinical picture have to be taken into account as well.

### Bashh UK guidelines for the management of syphilis 2024 [^1125sxR6]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of syphilis, particularly concerning the use of corticosteroids, the BASHH 2024 guidelines recommend administering corticosteroids (40–60 mg prednisolone once daily for three days, starting 24 hours before the antibiotics) in conjunction with antibiotic therapy in patients with cardiovascular syphilis or neurosyphilis.

### Increase in ocular syphilis cases at ophthalmologic reference center, France, 2012–2015 [^116iUyCJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

We found disparities in ocular syphilis trends by clinical phenotype and evidence of neurosyphilis on CSF analysis during the 4-year study period. By clinical feature, the greatest number of cases of posterior placoid chorioretinitis occurred in 2013 (4 patients) and 2015 (7 patients), and the least in 2014 (1 patient). Meanwhile, among the patients who underwent a lumbar puncture, 75% of those with ocular syphilis had a CSF lymphocytic reaction in 2013 (3/4 patients), which decreased to 33% in 2014 (2/6 patients) and showed an increase again to 50% in 2015 (2/4 patients). These differences in ocular syphilitic forms could be related to several treponemal strains originating from distinct regions and diverse isolation dates. Five different strains in 14 patients have been identified previously.

According to guidelines, the recommended regimen for neurosyphilis and ocular syphilis is benzyl penicillin, 18–24 million units/day by intravenous injection for 10–14 days. In our study, this regimen proved to be effective. The duration of treatment was similar whether or not lumbar puncture confirmed neurosyphilis. Guidelines recommend CSF examination only if patients have clinical evidence of neurologic involvement or ophthalmic symptoms.

In our study, of 14 case-patients who had undergone CSF analysis, 7 (50%) had a lymphocytic reaction and 3 (21%) had neurosyphilis based on a positive reactive treponemal or nontreponemal test or PCR test on CSF samples. These numbers are consistent with a previous report of 26% of 31 ocular syphilis case-patients having neurosyphilis.

### Neurosyphilis in the modern era [^111Q7mfe]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

To review the nature of the presentation of neurosyphilis, the value of diagnostic tests, and the classification of the disease, a retrospective review was conducted. The records of patients identified as possible cases of neurosyphilis by a positive FTA-abs test in the CSF were analyzed. This review covered a period of 10 years at a single hospital serving a population of mixed ancestry in a defined catchment area in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Patients were categorized into predefined diagnostic groups, and their clinical, radiological, and laboratory features were assessed.

A total of 161 patients met the diagnostic criteria for neurosyphilis. Among them, 82 presented with combinations of delirium, dementia, and other neuropsychiatric conditions. The remaining patients had typical presentations such as stroke (24), spinal cord disease (15), and seizures (14). The average age of presentation ranged from 35.9 to 42.6 years across different categories of neurosyphilis. Of those followed up, 77% had residual deficits from their initial illness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VDRL was positive in 73% of cases.

The diagnosis of neurosyphilis can be made with reasonable certainty if there is an appropriate neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with a positive CSF VDRL. If the VDRL is negative, a positive FTA-abs in an appropriate clinical setting, associated with raised CSF cell count, protein, or IgG index, is a useful method of identifying neurosyphilis. Despite the rarity of tabes dorsalis, it remains the likely sole manifestation of neurosyphilis in certain cases.

### A complex neurological presentation of syphilis [^111rbi2W]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a contagious sexually transmitted infection notable for its complex array of systemic presentations. It is caused by the spirochaete *Treponema pallidum*. Although once considered a largely historical condition in the UK, the recent rise in incidence makes syphilis increasingly relevant when considering unusual presentations in at-risk patients. The disease has three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The tertiary stage is associated with a plethora of neurological features ranging from psychosis to seizures caused by direct invasion of the spirochaete into the central nervous system. Here we describe the case of a 45-year-old man presenting with tonic-clonic seizures on a background of balance and visual problems. Following a normal examination and routine investigations, further serology confirmed a diagnosis of neurosyphilis. The patient was started on appropriate treatment and made an excellent clinical recovery.

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: Development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^1111men5]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

In our study, the overall performance of the simplified models based on discrimination and calibration was compelling. This was reflected in the decision curve analyses, which demonstrated clinical utility across a range of probabilities to support decision-making in healthcare provision for various model-generated risk probabilities. In the previous seven relevant studies, those logistic regression models have not been evaluated formally regarding clinical utility, which might limit their clinical application. However, acceptability by clinicians and patients, as well as shared decision-making of clinical diagnostic models, are essential prerequisites for translation into clinical application, and the models must align with real-world clinical understanding.

Here, in our decision curve analysis, the clinical utility of the simplified models was explored in comparison to two reference strategies: manage all as if those patients with syphilis will or will not have a diagnostic outcome of neurosyphilis ("treat all" or "treat none"). The overall decision curve analysis demonstrated the net benefits of all simplified models in identifying patients with syphilis who are likely to develop a diagnostic outcome of neurosyphilis over a range of probability thresholds.

As health resources and clinical practice vary in different settings worldwide, we avoided recommending a universal optimal probability threshold for which patients with syphilis should undergo investigations for neurosyphilis. Instead, we reported the range of probability thresholds from 0.33 to 0.

### Treatment and diagnostic accuracy of neurosyphilis at Boston City Hospital's neurological unit, 1930–1979 [^114cmWG1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

The twentieth century was marked by frequent advances in the treatment and diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Once considered one of the most serious human diseases, neurosyphilis was akin to a death sentence, often preceded by agonizing pain and/or diminishing mental capacities. However, since the introduction of penicillin in 1943, the prevalence of neurosyphilis has declined dramatically, and the prognosis for the few still affected has greatly improved.

We examined patient records from Boston City Hospital's (BCH) Neurological Unit from 1930 to 1979 to obtain primary data on treatment modalities for neurosyphilis during this period, with particular attention to the use of malarial therapy. We also evaluated these same records to determine whether the "great imitator" moniker applied to neurosyphilis may have been in part due to systematic errors in diagnostic criteria and false-positive tests. BCH neurologists utilized all available treatment compounds, including arsenicals, bismuth, iodides, malaria, and typhoid. The data also suggest that the wide diversity of symptoms attributed to neurosyphilis was probably accurate.

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: Development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^1148NzW8]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we developed simplified, validated diagnostic models that accurately diagnosed neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis. Both internal and external validation demonstrated that the models are transportable across clinical settings. Stratifying patients with syphilis for risk-differentiated decision-making in health care by using the models offers net benefits over a broad range of probability thresholds. Future studies should validate our models in people living with HIV and individuals with syphilis outside China.

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: Development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^111nAgSi]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Strengths of our study include external validation in independent cohorts from three distinct settings (including External cohort 1 and 2 in China, and External cohort 3 in the United States), and a large number of participants with and without neurosyphilis. At the same time, we acknowledged the issue of insufficient samples for External cohort 3 from Washington, due to the difficulty in collecting external data.

Regarding the collection of participant-level data of HIV-negative patients with neurosyphilis, the diagnostic challenges associated with neurosyphilis in various countries or regions frequently result in a scarcity of reliable epidemiological data. In this study, in light of the real-world complexity of the diagnosis of neurosyphilis, we made efforts to find enough clinical collaborators outside of China to support data for conducting this research but could not access additional data for our modeling analysis at that time. Consequently, the samples in External cohort 3 from Washington could not be representative of the population outside of China. We believe, however, that this might indicate the potentially excellent generalizability of the models in populations outside of China, which awaits further validation with a much larger sample size in future studies.

The generalizability of the models to a worldwide population of patients with syphilis remains to be investigated in future studies with more data from various sources around the world. In this regard, the diagnostic predictions of the models should be interpreted accordingly.

### Neurosyphilis [^11388M7H]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Neurosyphilis remains an important and highly morbid neurologic infection. In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of syphilis across various populations, making the recognition of the many neurologic complications of this infection still relevant for modern clinicians. As the manifestations of neurosyphilis are famously varied, a high index of suspicion is essential, especially in the face of atypical presentations.

In this review, we discuss updates to the epidemiology, range of clinical presentations, diagnosis, and management of neurosyphilis.

### Neurosyphilis in newly admitted psychiatric patients: three case reports [^11198LZh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Neurosyphilis, also known as "general paresis of the insane", once accounted for a large portion of admissions to state psychiatric facilities. With the introduction of antibiotics, neurosyphilis is now considered very rare.

- **Method**: Chart review was performed on patients diagnosed with neurosyphilis who were admitted to a state psychiatric hospital in Raleigh, N.C., during 2002.

- **Results**: We identified 3 cases of confirmed neurosyphilis, representing 0.1% of adult admissions, diagnosed in newly admitted psychiatric patients. None of the patients were immunocompromised. Response to antibiotic treatment was poor.

- **Conclusions**: Given the increase in primary and secondary syphilis reported in the 1980s and early 1990s, routine screening of psychiatric patients for the presence of syphilis should be considered.

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: Development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^1129qnNm]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

We strongly support the principle of seeking to validate and, where possible, update existing models rather than developing new models de novo. However, at the time of writing, no prediction modeling studies on the diagnosis of neurosyphilis were identified. Previous studies of neurosyphilis risk primarily focused on significant predictors of neurosyphilis diagnosis using logistic regression.

In a 2004 study assessing CSF abnormalities, Christina M. Marra and colleagues used logistic regression to define clinical and laboratory features that identified patients with neurosyphilis. Another study assessing CSF abnormalities in HIV-negative patients with neurosyphilis applied multiple regression with a backward elimination selection procedure to identify the contribution of variables to the prediction of neurosyphilis. A study by Jeannot Dumaresq et al. on the clinical prediction and diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-positive patients with early syphilis used multivariable logistic regression to derive odds ratios and respective 95% CI as estimates of the relative risks of the putative predictors.

In an observational study in 2017, Yao Xiao et al. implemented a logistic regression model to identify novel predictors of neurosyphilis among HIV-negative patients with syphilis. Similarly, in 2019, Yong Lu et al. conducted a case–control study using multivariable logistic regression to explore diagnostic indicators for the clinical diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients. In a recent single-center, retrospective cohort study in 2022 in China, researchers used logistic regression to…

Regarding medical management for syphilis, specifically in the context of antibiotic therapy for neurosyphilis, ocular, and auricular syphilis in HIV-negative patients, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Secondary-line therapy**: Administer ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV in a single daily dose for 10–14 days. Alternatively, procaine penicillin 1,200,000–2,400,000 units IM daily, plus probenecid 500 mg QID, both for 10–14 days, can be used when hospitalization and IV benzylpenicillin are not possible.

### State-of-the-art review: Neurosyphilis [^117QH3Ab]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

We review key concepts in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of individuals with neurosyphilis. The epidemiology of syphilis in the United States is described, highlighting populations markedly affected by this infection and estimating the burden of neurosyphilis. We detail the cardinal clinical features of early and late (tertiary) neurosyphilis and discuss the clinical significance of asymptomatic neurosyphilis in the antibiotic era.

- **Diagnosis and performance characteristics of CSF assays**: Indications for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination are reviewed, along with the performance characteristics of different CSF assays, including treponemal and lipoidal antibodies, white cell count, and protein concentration.

- **Future considerations and role of imaging**: Future biomarkers and the role of imaging are briefly considered.

- **Treatment options and evidence**: Preferred and alternative treatments for neurosyphilis are reviewed, including evidence for their use. This includes the use of enhanced intramuscular benzathine penicillin G to supplement intravenous penicillin.

### Symptomatic early neurosyphilis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men — four cities, United States, January 2002-June 2004 [^112qXY8H]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Symptomatic early neurosyphilis is a rare manifestation of syphilis that usually occurs within the first 12 months of infection. Most neurologic symptoms of early neurosyphilis result from acute or subacute meningitis, abnormalities in cranial nerve function, and inflammatory vasculitis leading to a cerebrovascular accident. Symptomatic early neurosyphilis essentially disappeared in the United States after the introduction of penicillin treatment for syphilis in the late 1940s but reappeared in the 1980s among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

The disease burden from neurosyphilis is unknown because national reporting of this disease is incomplete. Because the increase in syphilis cases during the past 5 years has occurred primarily among MSM (men who have sex with men), many of whom were infected with HIV, the CDC conducted a review of possible neurosyphilis cases to describe the clinical course of symptomatic early neurosyphilis and better characterize the risk for this illness among HIV-infected MSM.

The review included health department records from four U.S. cities (Los Angeles, California; San Diego, California; Chicago, Illinois; and New York, New York) for the period January 2002-June 2004. This report describes the results of that review, which identified 49 HIV-positive MSM with symptomatic early neurosyphilis during that 30-month period. Among HIV-positive MSM with early syphilis, the estimated risk for having symptomatic early neurosyphilis was 1.7%, and the risk for having early neurosyphilis with persistent symptoms 6 months after treatment was 0.5%.

Do not use procaine penicillin in patients allergic to sulfa-containing medications.

### Late-stage neurosyphilis presenting with severe neuropsychiatric deficits: Diagnosis, therapy, and course of three patients [^1154dE9b]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Neurosyphilis is an infectious disease that has reappeared over the past two decades. It is caused by *Treponema pallidum* subspecies pallidum, which can affect the central nervous system (CNS) during any stage of the disease. While early CNS involvement predominantly presents with symptoms of meningitis, parenchymal affection of the brain, leading to severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly emerges at later stages. However, this is rarely seen nowadays due to early antibiotic treatment.

A characteristic combination of serological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities, along with clinical findings, leads to the diagnosis of neurosyphilis and is necessary to assess its activity. Particularly at later stages of the disease and after antibiotic treatment, serological and CSF abnormalities may become ambiguous and difficult to interpret. This ambiguity can be accompanied by persisting or fluctuating neuropsychological deficits. To date, no well-controlled clinical data exist concerning the treatment of late-stage neurosyphilis, including the type, optimal dosage, duration, and long-term efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Consequently, the treatment and follow-up of late-stage neurosyphilis remain challenging. Here, we present three cases of neurosyphilis with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms in non-immunocompromised patients, alongside a review of recent literature.

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: Development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^117Br2B9]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The ability to accurately identify the absolute risk of neurosyphilis diagnosis for patients with syphilis would allow preventative and therapeutic interventions to be provided to patients at high risk, sparing patients at low risk from unnecessary care. We aimed to develop, validate, and evaluate the clinical utility of simplified clinical diagnostic models for neurosyphilis diagnosis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and UpToDate for publications about neurosyphilis diagnostic guidelines in English or Chinese from database inception until March 15, 2023. We developed and validated machine learning models with a uniform set of predictors based on six authoritative diagnostic guidelines across four continents to predict neurosyphilis using routinely collected data from real-world clinical practice in China and the United States. This included data from the Dermatology Hospital of Southern Medical University in Guangzhou (659 recruited between August 2012 and March 2022, treated as the development cohort), the Beijing Youan Hospital of Capital Medical University in Beijing (480 recruited between December 2013 and April 2021, treated as external cohort 1), the Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University in Xiamen (493 recruited between November 2005 and November 2021, treated as external cohort 2) from China, and University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle (16 recruited between September 2002 and April 2014, treated as external cohort 3) from the United States. We included all these patients with the aim of enhancing neurosyphilis diagnostic accuracy.

### Association of interleukin-10 promoter polymorphisms with neurosyphilis [^115z37a8]. Human Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. Increased production of IL-10 has been found in late syphilis, presumably creating favorable conditions for bacterial persistence. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter of the IL-10 gene have been found to influence IL-10 production. We investigated whether SNPs in the IL-10 gene promoter are associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of IL-10 and neurosyphilis. Polymorphisms in the gene for IL-10 (G→A mutation at the position -1084 and C→A mutation at the position -592) were sought in 35 patients with syphilis and 24 healthy volunteers.

CSF examination, including routine laboratory tests and IL-10 levels, was performed in all syphilis patients. Neurosyphilis was defined as a reactive CSF VDRL test or CSF white blood cells ⩾5/μL and CSF protein concentration ⩾45 mg/dL. Overall, 31% of patients with syphilis had neurosyphilis. CSF IL-10 levels were significantly higher in patients with neurosyphilis compared to those with syphilis but not neurosyphilis. The -1082 GG and -592 CC genotypes were significantly associated with higher CSF IL-10 levels. Moreover, these genotypes were found to be more frequent in individuals with neurosyphilis compared to those without neurosyphilis.

The anti-inflammatory immune response seems to be important in the pathogenesis of neurosyphilis. Our data suggest that host-related factors, such as SNPs of immune regulatory genes, may influence susceptibility to neurosyphilis.

Regarding the medical management of syphilis, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy for neurosyphilis, ocular and auricular syphilis, and HIV-positive patients, the BASHH 2024 guidelines recommend ensuring continuous treponemicidal levels within the central nervous system throughout the treatment course of neurosyphilis. If the treatment is interrupted for more than 24 hours, the course should be restarted.

### Qalsody [^117Ripob]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Serious events of myelitis and/or radiculitis, papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure, and aseptic meningitis have been reported in patients treated with Qalsody. Monitoring for symptoms and initiating diagnostic workups and treatments according to standard care is advised.

	- **Myelitis and/or radiculitis**: Six patients experienced these adverse reactions during clinical studies. Two of these patients discontinued treatment and required symptomatic management with full resolution of symptoms. In four patients, symptoms resolved without discontinuation of Qalsody. If symptoms develop, initiating diagnostic workup and treatment may require interrupting or discontinuing Qalsody.

	- **Papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure**: Four patients developed elevated intracranial pressure and/or papilledema. Monitoring and appropriate intervention should be conducted as per standard care guidelines.

### Neurosyphilis in disguise [^115TpBY9]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Neurosyphilis can mimic various diseases, not only in its clinical presentation but also on imaging. Treponema pallidum is also known as the "great imitator". Having an ultimate diagnosis of neurosyphilis is quite critical, as this can affect management drastically. Herein, we discuss the case of a 69-year-old female who was treated for neurosyphilis, while having an atypical imaging finding of anterior temporal lobe enhancement that simulated an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV). We also review the available literature on different imaging findings in both the early and late stages of the disease.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature search using the new PubMed in June 2021. The terms "neurosyphilis", "MRI", and "neuroimaging" were used either alone or in combination with "early neurosyphilis" or "late neurosyphilis". Data on neurosyphilis and imaging findings were mainly derived from review articles, cohort studies, case series, and individual reports.

- **Conclusion**: Neurosyphilis can present with an extensive variation and different patterns on the MRI, and clinicians must be aware of the wide variety in radiological presentations. Anterior temporal lobe involvement is a rare presentation and requires evaluation for neurosyphilis to prevent a missed diagnosis and treatment.

### Has CXCL13 an added value in diagnosis of neurosyphilis [^114PyZpx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

In patients with syphilis, central nervous system (CNS) involvement is often difficult to determine. In patients who are also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), this becomes even more challenging, as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis can be attributed to HIV, syphilis, or both. Hence, this study investigated CSF chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13) as a potential marker to diagnose neurosyphilis in HIV-infected individuals, and the added value of CSF CXCL13 to conventional CSF biomarkers, such as the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), in diagnosing neurosyphilis.

We included 103 syphilis patients from two centers in the Netherlands: 47 non-HIV-infected patients and 56 HIV-infected patients. A positive CSF-RPR was regarded as the gold standard for neurosyphilis. CSF CXCL13 levels were significantly higher in neurosyphilis patients when diagnosed by CSF-RPR (P = 0.0002) than in the syphilis control group. The sensitivity and specificity of CSF CXCL13 (cutoff of 76.3 pg/ml) to diagnose neurosyphilis using positive CSF-RPR as the gold standard were 50% and 90%, respectively. CSF CXCL13 had an added value to CSF-RPR positivity in 70% of HIV-positive patients and in 33% of HIV-negative patients.

Our data show that CSF CXCL13 might be a potential additional marker in neurosyphilis when other markers are not conclusive. The added value of CSF CXCL13 measurement to the neurosyphilis gold standard appears to benefit HIV-positive patients more than HIV-negative patients.

### Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in patients with syphilis: Association with clinical and laboratory features [^115zaF7v]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

To define clinical and laboratory features that identify patients with neurosyphilis, subjects (n = 326) with syphilis, but no previous neurosyphilis, who met 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for lumbar puncture underwent standardized history, neurological examination, venipuncture, and lumbar puncture. Neurosyphilis was defined as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count > 20 cells/μL or reactive CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test result.

Sixty-five subjects (20.1%) had neurosyphilis. Early syphilis increased the odds of neurosyphilis in univariate but not multivariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer ≥ 1:32 increased the odds of neurosyphilis 10.85-fold in HIV-uninfected subjects and 5.98-fold in HIV-infected subjects. A peripheral blood CD4+ T cell count ≤ 350 cells/μL conferred 3.10-fold increased odds of neurosyphilis in HIV-infected subjects. Similar results were obtained when neurosyphilis was more stringently defined as a reactive CSF VDRL test result.

Serum RPR titer helps predict the likelihood of neurosyphilis, and HIV-induced immune impairment may increase the risk of neurosyphilis.

National case-based surveillance data show that reported neurologic manifestations of syphilis increased during 2019–2022 among persons with early and late-stage syphilis. Neurologic manifestations occurred across demographic groups and among those with and without HIV, highlighting the importance of evaluating for neurologic signs and symptoms in all persons with syphilis.

### Bafiertam [^112DqLF9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold Bafiertam and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Cases of PML, diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML, have been reported in patients treated with other MS medications associated with PML. Many of these patients subsequently became symptomatic with PML. Therefore, monitoring with MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be useful, and any suspicious findings should lead to further investigation to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported following discontinuation of another MS medication associated with PML in patients with PML who were initially asymptomatic compared to patients with PML who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis. It is not known whether these differences are due to early detection and discontinuation of MS treatment or due to differences in disease in these patients.

- **Herpes zoster and other serious opportunistic infections**: Serious cases of herpes zoster have occurred with dimethyl fumarate (the prodrug of Bafiertam).

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^112RXRsj]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

There is no single test that can definitively rule in or rule out the diagnosis of neurosyphilis, but several diagnostic guidelines are proposed. These guidelines may not be applicable across different clinical settings and populations from various regions worldwide. For example, a national cross-sectional study of 398 hospitals located in 116 cities in China showed that only 154 (38.69%) hospitals could perform neurosyphilis diagnostic laboratory tests, such as venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL)/rapid plasma reagin tests (RPR)/toluidine red unheated serum tests (TRUST), or T. pallidum particle agglutination or haemagglutination tests (TPPA or TPHA).

Moreover, although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VDRL is currently considered the definitive standard diagnosis test for confirming neurosyphilis, it requires specialized glass plates and a light microscope in practice. This requirement might be challenging to meet in resource-limited hospitals. Additionally, its entire testing process is time-consuming and cumbersome, which further restricts its availability in real-world clinical practice.

Ascertaining a diagnosis of neurosyphilis typically necessitates a confluence of neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs, laboratory assessments of both blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and, in some instances, imaging evaluations. Given the complexity involved in arriving at a diagnosis, the involvement of skilled clinicians, as well as specialized testing equipment and reagents, is essential. The diagnostic challenges associated with neurosyphilis in various countries or regions frequently result in significant obstacles.

### Manifest psychosis in neurosyphilis [^113N8WPh]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Recent surveys have assessed a remarkable increase in the prevalence of infectious syphilis. If left untreated, 30% of patients may develop tertiary syphilis, which can manifest as neurosyphilis.

- **Case report**: The authors present a case of an acute psychosis during and after pregnancy in a 37-year-old woman, which was identified as a manifestation of neurosyphilis after admission to a psychiatric ward. The positive screening test for syphilis provided the first hint of syphilis and gave direction for further diagnosis and specific treatment. Subsequently, the patient was treated with psychotropic medication alongside adequate antibiotic treatment for neurosyphilis and was simultaneously psychologically monitored. An improvement of psychotic symptoms during antibiotic therapy was observed.

- **Conclusion**: This case emphasizes that neurosyphilis still has to be considered in the differential diagnosis within the context of psychiatric conditions and diseases. Owing to epidemiological data and difficulties in diagnosing syphilis, routine screening tests in the psychiatric field are necessary.

### Ischemic stroke as a primary symptom of neurosyphilis among HIV-negative emergency patients [^116uVUSz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Neurosyphilis is known as "the great imitator" or "the great impostor" because of its wide range of clinical symptoms. A high misdiagnosis rate of ischemic stroke was observed among neurosyphilis patients in clinical practice, which prevents patients from receiving the most appropriate treatment and often results in more severe neurologic damage.

- **Methods**: A total of 149 neurosyphilis patients were retrospectively reviewed. The control group comprised 1570 non-neurosyphilitic ischemic stroke patients. The proportion of patients with ischemic stroke as the primary symptom of the different types of neurosyphilis and the misdiagnosis rate of neurosyphilitic ischemic stroke were analyzed, including the risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

- **Results**: Among the 149 neurosyphilis patients, 21 (14.09%) developed ischemic stroke as a primary symptom, including three cases of syphilitic meningitis and 18 cases of meningovascular neurosyphilis. Only four of the neurosyphilis patients had histories of ischemic stroke and recurrence. The other 17 cases were treated for the first time in the emergency department; however, none of the patients were initially suspected of neurosyphilitic ischemic stroke. All of the patients were only diagnosed with neurosyphilis during their follow-up treatment. The misdiagnosis rate of neurosyphilitic ischemic stroke was as high as 80.95% (17/21). Furthermore, except for hypertension, no significant differences in cardiovascular risk factors were observed between the groups (P > 0.05).

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: Development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^115UJCgf]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we used machine learning to develop and externally validate six simplified neurosyphilis diagnostic models based on six guidelines across four continents, using routinely collected data from real-world clinical practice in China and the United States. All simplified clinical diagnostic models accurately predicted the diagnosis of neurosyphilis in demographically diverse HIV-negative patients with syphilis. They demonstrated good calibration and excellent discrimination over a broad range of clinical probability thresholds.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that applies machine learning techniques to aid in simplifying the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. As there is no universal gold standard globally to diagnose neurosyphilis, various distinct diagnostic guidelines have been endorsed and recommended as silver standard diagnostic criteria worldwide, aiming for reasonable accuracy. The societies acknowledge that different diagnostic criteria exist and that the optimal diagnostic criteria may vary depending on the local condition, health resources, and preferences of clinicians and patients. However, diagnostic guidelines include various distinct essential prerequisites that may not be readily available across different clinical settings and populations from different regions in the world, especially in resource-limited regions. The machine learning approach used in this study succeeded in identifying a panel of the fewest required key predictors to meet these challenges effectively.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults with neurosyphilis [^1118VRBK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Neurosyphilis is an infection of the central nervous system caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete capable of infecting almost any organ or tissue in the body and leading to neurological complications. This disease is a tertiary manifestation of syphilis. The first-line treatment for neurosyphilis is aqueous crystalline penicillin. However, in cases of penicillin allergy, other antibiotic regimens can be used.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of antibiotic therapy for adults with neurosyphilis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Opengrey up to April 2019. We also searched proceedings of eight congresses over a maximum of 10 years and contacted trial authors for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials that involved men and women, regardless of age, with definitive diagnoses of neurosyphilis, including HIV-seropositive patients. We compared any antibiotic regimen (concentration, dose, frequency, duration) against any other antibiotic regimen for the treatment of neurosyphilis in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by involving a third review author. For dichotomous data (serological cure, clinical cure, adverse events), we presented results as summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals.

### Syphilitic meningitis presenting with multiple cranial neuropathies [^115UeiTc]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Syphilis is increasingly prevalent in the community. The protean manifestations of neurosyphilis make the recognition, diagnosis, and early initiation of treatment challenging. We report a case of early syphilitic meningitis presenting with multiple cranial neuropathies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was inflammatory with predominant lymphocytosis. The patient was diagnosed with neurosyphilis based on serum as well as CSF testing. Intravenous benzylpenicillin treatment resulted in rapid improvement of neurological symptoms. Neurosyphilis should be considered in immunocompetent patients presenting with multiple cranial neuropathies or isolated cranial neuropathies without vascular risk factors.

### Syphilis laboratory guidelines: Performance characteristics of nontreponemal antibody tests [^115qPwtp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

A neurosyphilis diagnosis is challenging, as no single laboratory test is perfectly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis. Additionally, clinical guidelines emphasize obtaining lumbar punctures primarily in situations where patients are symptomatic, as the significance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities in the absence of symptoms is unclear.

Assessing the literature was difficult due to differing definitions for neurosyphilis between studies. Some definitions were circular; for example, CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test was often included as part of the definition of neurosyphilis in studies reporting on the sensitivity of CSF VDRL, complicating the interpretation of nontreponemal test performance characteristics. Many studies included a mixture of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, making it difficult to determine nontreponemal test characteristics separately for these groups.

- **High-quality studies**: We identified four high-quality studies utilizing a gold standard that did not include a CSF nontreponemal test.
- **Moderate-quality studies**: Thirteen moderate-quality studies employed a partially circular gold-standard definition (i.e. included some element of the nontreponemal test itself).
- **Lower-quality studies**: Two lower-quality studies featured a less well-defined gold standard.

Additionally, we identified two high-quality case reports, two lower-quality reports, and one high-quality study regarding the amount of CSF blood contamination required to show a false-positive CSF VDRL.

### Aseptic meningitis and hydrocephalus secondary to neurosarcoidosis [^113zz18C]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disorder. Its annual incidence in the United Kingdom is between 9.7 and 14.5 per 100,000. Diagnosis of this condition requires the exclusion of other granulomatous disorders such as lymphoproliferative disorders, infections, drug reactions, and other autoimmune conditions. Neurological involvement (neurosarcoidosis) occurs in approximately 5%–26% of cases and may result in peripheral or central nervous system (CNS) manifestations.

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: Development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^112a9mEJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Limitations of this study are worth acknowledging. We initially overlooked well-known databases such as Cochrane Reviews and Medline when conducting our literature search for neurosyphilis diagnostic guidelines. However, we have since performed an additional search specifically in these databases and found no additional relevant articles beyond what was already included in our review (Supplementary Table S4), which suggests our literature search for available guidelines may now be comprehensive. Although our study involved a total of 1,648 confirmed patients with syphilis from four settings in China and the United States, the population size in External Cohort 3 was small. Thus, our findings are most generalizable to individuals with syphilis in China. We considered CSF VDRL and CSF RPR as equivalent for the final panel of variables in Scenario 2. The use of CSF RPR as a surrogate for CSF VDRL in the simplified models needs further research and would benefit from complete data on the two variables if available.

We did not model neurosyphilis diagnosis in people living with HIV. Constructing neurosyphilis-diagnostic models that could be applicable to the entire population of patients with syphilis (including HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients) was our original intention. However, the diagnostic challenges associated with neurosyphilis in various countries or regions frequently result in a scarcity of reliable epidemiological data. The true burden of neurosyphilis worldwide is likely underestimated due to underreporting and lack of complete data.

### Somatosensory evoked potential in neurosyphilis [^11573h7Z]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Since the development of effective antibiotic therapy, the occurrence of neurosyphilis has become less frequent. However, the number of syphilitic patients is gradually increasing as a complication in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, making the diagnosis of neurosyphilis sometimes challenging. We describe six patients with neurosyphilis and analyze their tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials. Four of the patients, including two without tabes dorsalis symptoms, exhibited delayed P15-N21 or the absence of N21. These abnormalities were ameliorated with treatment for syphilis. The analysis of tibial nerve SEPs provides a valuable tool for diagnosing neurosyphilis and evaluating the extent to which the disease has progressed.

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^112Vxb4w]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: Identification of neurosyphilis diagnostic guidelines. We searched PubMed, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and UpToDate for publications about neurosyphilis diagnostic guidelines in English or Chinese from database inception until March 15, 2023, using the search terms "neurosyphilis" OR "syphilis" AND "syphilis and treatment" OR "neurosyphilis and treatment". References of relevant articles and reviews were also screened for additional publications. Twenty-six publications in English or Chinese about neurosyphilis diagnostic guidelines were identified. The details for these 26 publications are provided in Supplementary Table S4. From these, six diagnostic guidelines were identified: China 2020 (representing Asia), Europe 2020 (representing Europe), Australia 2022 (representing Oceania), UpToDate 2020, the US CDC 2018 (Case Definitions), and the US 2021 (Treatment Guidelines) as representatives of America. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify a guideline from Africa. Detailed considerations are given in Supplementary Appendix S1.

Various guidelines have different numbers of diagnostic classifications for neurosyphilis (see Supplementary Table S1), which posed challenges for our modeling analysis aimed at simplifying the real-world diagnosis of neurosyphilis, and which were designed for binary classification. However, we intended to use information from the differential risk indications based on the various numbers of diagnostic classifications from the guidelines.

### Alternative cerebrospinal fluid tests to diagnose neurosyphilis in HIV-infected individuals [^113WgwKZ]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

To identify alternatives to the CSF-Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-infected individuals, the study analyzed CSF fluorescent treponemal antibody (FTA) reactivity and the percentage of CSF lymphocytes that were B cells in both fresh and frozen samples. The analysis included 47 HIV-infected individuals with syphilis and 26 HIV-infected controls. For both serum and CSF, a fluorescent treponemal antibody reactivity of ≥ 2+ was considered positive. Based on findings from controls and cases with normal CSF measures, the cut-offs for elevated CSF B cells were proposed to be ≥ 9% in fresh samples and ≥ 20% in frozen samples. Neurosyphilis was defined as having a reactive CSF-VDRL.

Analysis results showed that CSF-FTA-ABS (absorbed) and CSF-FTA (unabsorbed and undiluted) were 100% sensitive for diagnosing neurosyphilis. Although elevated percentages of CSF B cells in fresh and cryopreserved samples were highly specific (100%), they were not sensitive (40% and 43%, respectively) in post hoc analyses. Using the results of CSF-FTA and assessing % CSF B cells together allowed 16% of cases with pleocytosis but nonreactive CSF-VDRL to be diagnosed with neurosyphilis, and 26% diagnosed as not having the disease.

In conclusion, when the CSF-VDRL is nonreactive, tests such as CSF-FTA and the percentage of CSF B cells can aid in excluding or confirming the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

### 2020 European guideline on the management of syphilis [^116zMPYm]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for syphilis, especially in terms of antibiotic therapy for neurosyphilis, ocular, and auricular syphilis in HIV-negative patients, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend administering benzylpenicillin at doses of 18,000,000 to 24,000,000 units intravenously per day. This should be given as 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 units every four hours for a duration of 10 to 14 days as first-line therapy in patients with neurosyphilis, ocular, or auricular syphilis.

### Clinical features of syphilis patients with ocular symptoms as the initial manifestation [^112h2reX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic neurosyphilis often shows cutaneous symptoms. Untreated neurosyphilis leads to late neurosyphilis, which presents with serious neurological disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and locomotor ataxia. In this study, four patients showed such asymptomatic cutaneous symptoms.

Penicillin is the first choice for antiluetic therapy. In this study, most patients who received antiluetic therapy (both penicillin and cephems) showed alleviation of ocular symptoms, followed by an improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Studies have suggested that improvement in visual acuity following syphilitic uveitis depends on the severity of vasculitis, neurosyphilis, and early therapeutic intervention.

This study had some limitations. First, it was conducted at two medical institutions located nearby and did not examine the nationwide trends. Second, this was a retrospective study involving multiple ophthalmologists; variations in diagnosis and treatment methods occurred without a standardized protocol. Considering the increasing number of patients with syphilis in Japan, a multicenter survey is required to examine trends in disease patterns and treatment strategies among the Japanese population.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112oBc9j]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for syphilis, and more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy for neurosyphilis, ocular, and auricular syphilis in HIV-positive patients, the DHHS 2025 guidelines recommend administering aqueous crystalline penicillin G at 18,000,000 to 24,000,000 units daily. This should be given as 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 units intravenously every 4 hours or by continuous IV infusion for 10 to 14 days. An additional option is to administer benzathine penicillin G at 2,400,000 units intramuscularly once after completion of the aqueous crystalline penicillin G infusion as the preferred treatment in patients with neurosyphilis, ocular, or auricular syphilis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^11584pAp]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Concerning follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, particularly in the management of treatment failure or reinfection, the DHHS 2025 guidelines recommend managing patients with non-treponemal titers that do not decrease fourfold within 12–24 months of treatment as a possible treatment failure. In such cases, perform a neurological examination and administer retreatment with benzathine penicillin G, 2,400,000 units, at one-week intervals for three weeks.

Do not perform a repeat CSF assessment if titers do not respond appropriately after retreatment. Consider administering benzathine penicillin G, 2,400,000 units intramuscularly without a CSF assessment unless signs or symptoms of neurosyphilis are present. Obtain close clinical follow-up in patients at high risk of syphilis reinfection, particularly those presenting signs and symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis or experiencing a fourfold increase in non-treponemal titers within the past year.

### Molecular and direct detection tests for Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum: A review of the literature, 1964–2017 [^111Pk6sa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Nucleic acid amplification tests have, although infrequently, been applied to FFPE tissue biopsies of secondary syphilitic lesions, with moderate sensitivity of up to 67% reported among studies using either tpp47 or polA as the target. This limited sensitivity may, in part, be due to the formalin fixation process, which results in DNA degradation and cross-linkage, ultimately leading to inhibition of DNA amplification.

Neurosyphilis remains a challenging diagnosis to establish due to imperfect serologic markers of infection and nonspecific clinical manifestations. Direct detection of T. pallidum in CSF using NAATs has been evaluated as a possible additional tool to aid in diagnosing neuroinvasive disease. Among the largest studies evaluating this utility of T. pallidum NAATs on CSF, Castro and colleagues enrolled 124 patients with reactive T. pallidum serologic results in serum and, using the 2008 European Guidelines on the Management of Syphilis, determined that 33 patients met the criteria for neurosyphilis, while 91 did not. Among these patients, 25 (76%) and 23 (70%) of the 33 patients with neurosyphilis and 12 (13%) and 7 (8%) of the 91 patients without neurosyphilis were positive by the tpp47 and polA NAATs, respectively.

A second study evaluating the tpp47 NAAT in CSF collected from 6 patients diagnosed with neurosyphilis based on CDC criteria found that only 3 were positive. Treponema pallidum NAATs performed on CSF have also been investigated as an additional diagnostic aid for cases of suspected congenital syphilis in neonates.

### Aberrant humoral immune responses in neurosyphilis: CXCL13/CXCR5 play a pivotal role for B-cell recruitment to the cerebrospinal fluid [^112qyck1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Previous studies documented that humoral immune responses participated in neurological damage in neurosyphilis patients. However, the mechanisms that trigger and maintain humoral immunity involved in neurosyphilis remain unknown.

- **Methods**: Using flow cytometry, expression of B cells was measured in neurosyphilis and non-neurosyphilis. Expression of immunoglobulin indices and chemokine ligand CXCL13 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The migration and inhibition assays were evaluated by modified chamber assays. The presence of CXCL13+ cells, cluster of differentiation (CD)20+ B cells, CD3+ T cells, CD138+ plasma cells, and CD35+ follicular dendritic cells was studied by immunohistochemistry.

- **Results**: Enrichment of B cells was observed and activated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neurosyphilis patients. Immunoglobulin indices were increased and associated with the progress to neurosyphilis. High expression of CSF CXCL13 mediated B cell migration both in vitro and in vivo. There was a positive correlation among the CSF B cells, immunoglobulin indices, and CSF CXCL13 levels. Ectopic germinal centers (EGCs), important structures for humoral immunity, were observed in the intracranial syphilitic gumma.

- **Conclusions**: CXCL13/CXCR5 mediated the aggregation of B cells, which directed the aberrant humoral immune responses via the formation of EGCs. This suggests a molecular mechanism of neurological damage in neurosyphilis.

During January 1–October 31, 2023, NOO syphilis cases in Chicago were identified more frequently in persons who did not have HIV and who were not MSM compared with cases identified in 2019. Clinicians should consider NOO syphilis even in persons who do not have HIV and who are not MSM. Enhanced surveillance efforts to better understand NOO syphilis trends are needed.

### Tetracycline hydrochloride [^116kudoh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:

	- Adults should take the usual daily dose of 1 gram, administered as 500 mg twice a day or 250 mg four times a day. In cases of severe infections or infections not responding to smaller doses, a higher dose of 500 mg four times a day may be necessary. For pediatric patients above eight years of age, the usual daily dose is 10 mg/lb to 20 mg/lb (25 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg) of body weight, divided into four equal doses. It is recommended to take adequate amounts of fluid with the tablet formulation of tetracycline to wash down the drug and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration.

- **Absorption concerns**:

	- The absorption of tetracycline is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, as well as preparations containing iron, zinc, or sodium bicarbonate. Food and some dairy products also interfere with absorption.

- **Streptococcal infections**:

	- When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.

- **Brucellosis treatment**:

	- For the treatment of brucellosis, the dosage includes 500 mg of tetracycline four times a day for three weeks. This should be accompanied by streptomycin, administered at 1 gram intramuscularly twice daily for the first week and once daily during the second week.

- **Syphilis treatment in penicillin-allergic patients**:

	- For syphilis in patients allergic to penicillin, early syphilis (less than one year's duration) requires 500 mg of tetracycline four times a day for 15 days. For syphilis of more than one year's duration, except neurosyphilis, the dosage is 500 mg four times a day for 30 days.

- **Gonorrhea treatment**:

	- The recommended dose for the treatment of gonorrhea is 500 mg orally four times a day for seven days.

### Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-negative patients with syphilis: development, validation, and clinical utility of a suite of machine learning models [^111YbDd4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Based on the assessment of the rank order of variable importance (Fig. 2) in all models developed from six diagnostic guidelines, and the ready availability and accessibility in real-world clinical practice, the final panel of three key variables that distinguished patients with neurosyphilis from those without in Scenario 1 were neurological symptoms, CSF protein, and CSF WBC. For Scenario 2, neurological symptoms, CSF VDRL, and CSF protein were selected.

However, as shown in Table 1, in external cohorts 1 and 2, only CSF RPR was available. Considering the lack of availability of CSF VDRL in resource-limited regions, it was observed that CSF RPR has similar performance to CSF VDRL and is easier to perform with readily available commercial test kits. As a result, a new variable named CSF VDRL/RPR was introduced, which incorporates either CSF VDRL or CSF RPR. Hence, the final panel of variables in Scenario 2 comprised neurological symptoms, CSF VDRL/RPR, and CSF protein. Detailed considerations of the final panel of features are shown in Supplementary Appendix S1.

- **Shapley values**: The Shapley values for each of the candidate features in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 were assessed to interpret the models' predictions. These values were used to determine a feature's relative contribution, thereby uncovering key features. Based on the rankings of feature importance from the models in both scenarios, a consensus-based panel of key features was selected. This consensus was reached through comprehensive consideration of the rankings of feature importance across all models developed from the diagnostic guidelines.

### Neurosyphilis: MRI features and their phenotypic correlation in a cohort of 35 patients from a tertiary care university hospital [^112gcS43]. Neuroradiology (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical and MR imaging features of neurosyphilis are highly varied. In this study, we describe the spectrum of the imaging findings in patients with neurosyphilis.

- **Methods**: The MR imaging observations of 35 patients diagnosed with neurosyphilis, based on cerebrospinal fluid reactive for the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test, were reviewed.

- **Results**: All 35 patients, including four with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection, met the CDC diagnostic criteria for neurosyphilis. Patients were classified into three groups based on the dominant clinical manifestations:
	1. **Neuropsychiatric**: Fourteen patients showed diffuse cerebral atrophy (14), parenchymal signal changes in the mesial temporal region (2) and temporal and basifrontal regions (1), infarcts (3), and nonspecific white matter changes (3).

	2. **Meningovascular**: Eleven patients showed infarcts (6), diffuse cerebral atrophy (3), signal changes in the mesial temporal region (3), sulcal exudates (1), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (1), and a mass surrounding the carotid sheath (1).

	3. **Myelopathic**: Spine imaging in ten patients showed long-segment signal changes (5), contrast enhancement (2), and dorsal column involvement (2). Three of these patients had a normal spinal study. Six patients in the myelopathic group also underwent brain MRI, which showed signal changes in the temporal region (2) and frontal region (1), multiple infarcts (1), and enhancing hypothalami (1).
