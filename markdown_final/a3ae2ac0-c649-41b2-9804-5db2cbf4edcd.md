## Question

Is slow atrial fibrillation always associated with complete heart block?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether slow atrial fibrillation is always associated with complete heart block. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "slow atrial fibrillation" is defined clinically and what ECG features distinguish it from other bradyarrhythmias. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines say about when a slow, regular ventricular response during atrial fibrillation implies complete AV block. Next, I will consider alternative explanations for a slow ventricular response in AF that are not due to complete heart block. After that, I should review pacing indications in AF to ensure I'm not overcalling block. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and outline practical evaluation steps to avoid misdiagnosis.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. "Slow atrial fibrillation" generally refers to AF with a ventricular response that is unusually slow, often in the 30s–50s beats per minute, whereas "complete heart block" (third-degree AV block) is defined by the absence of AV conduction with a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm; in AF, complete block is inferred when the ventricular rhythm is slow and regular, typically less than about 50 bpm, because the irregular atrial activity cannot be conducted in a fixed ratio and a regular ventricular rhythm implies an independent escape mechanism [^114wmuEn] [^116d7xwm].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline language before drawing conclusions. Multiple ACC/AHA/HRS documents converge on the same point: a slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if this does not resolve; this is particularly emphasized in the postoperative AF context but is applied broadly to AF in general [^1141hhR3] [^113g8CNY] [^111D8R3K]. I should also confirm the numeric threshold used to infer complete block in AF; yes, several guideline sections impute complete AV block in AF when the ventricular response is slow and regular, often citing less than 50 bpm as a practical threshold, while acknowledging that precise cutoffs are not absolute and clinical context matters [^114wmuEn] [^116d7xwm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does a slow ventricular response in AF always mean complete block? I need to check alternative explanations. A slow, irregular ventricular response in AF is common and usually reflects enhanced vagal tone, AV nodal disease, or rate-slowing drugs rather than complete block; by contrast, the key ECG clue for complete block in AF is the combination of slow rate and regular R-R intervals, which implies a dissociated escape rhythm rather than variable AV nodal filtering of irregular atrial impulses [^112NRJyv] [^114wmuEn]. I should double-check that guidelines explicitly distinguish these patterns, and they do: careful ECG evaluation is required because isorhythmic dissociation and other mimics can mislead interpretation in AF [^114wmuEn] [^115ZwVqn].

> Next, I should review pacing indications to ensure I'm aligning thresholds with standards. In AF, permanent pacing is indicated for documented pauses of at least 5 seconds or for symptomatic bradycardia attributable to AV block; in asymptomatic patients, no specific pause duration mandates pacing, reinforcing that diagnosis and treatment hinge on symptoms and objective correlation rather than rate alone [^115MkiRn] [^112JLyq9] [^1124pRHE]. Let me reconsider whether a slow regular rhythm alone suffices; it does not, by itself, mandate pacing without symptoms or very long pauses, even though it strongly suggests complete block physiologically [^1124pRHE].

> I will now examine clinical contexts where this distinction is crucial. Postoperative AF frequently features bradyarrhythmias, and a slow, regular ventricular response is often complete heart block; however, guidelines still recommend watchful waiting rather than early pacemaker implantation unless there are prolonged pauses or symptoms, because conduction may recover as inflammation and drug effects abate [^1141hhR3] [^113g8CNY]. But wait, what if the slow AF is drug-induced? Rate-slowing agents like digoxin, beta-blockers, diltiazem, or amiodarone can depress AV nodal conduction and produce slow ventricular rates without complete block; in such cases, withdrawal or dose adjustment may clarify the diagnosis without immediate pacing [^117ThKjp] [^117HqUtY].

> Let me synthesize and answer the question directly. Is slow atrial fibrillation always associated with complete heart block? No, not always; a slow ventricular response in AF is common and often reflects enhanced vagal tone, intrinsic AV nodal disease, or medications, and it is typically irregular. However, when the ventricular rhythm during AF is slow and regular, that pattern usually indicates complete AV block with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism, and this inference is consistently emphasized in major guidelines, even though precise numeric thresholds are not absolute and clinical correlation is essential [^114wmuEn] [^1141hhR3] [^113g8CNY].

> Finally, I should outline practical steps to avoid misdiagnosis. I need to ensure the ECG is carefully reviewed for regularity of R-R intervals in the slow AF, correlate symptoms with bradycardia, review medications that depress AV conduction, and consider ambulatory monitoring to document pause durations; if complete block is suspected, electrophysiology study can help localize the level of block, though it has limited sensitivity and is reserved for selected cases [^1124pRHE] [^1176EzQz]. Hold on, I should verify that we do not overcall pauses in AF; indeed, in asymptomatic patients there is no specific pause duration that alone mandates pacing, underscoring the need for symptom-rhythm correlation before committing to device therapy [^1124pRHE].

Slow atrial fibrillation (AF) is **not always due to complete heart block**. While a slow, regular ventricular response in AF can suggest complete heart block [^114wmuEn], other causes include **high-grade AV block**, **drug-induced AV nodal slowing** (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin) [^117ThKjp], **increased vagal tone**, or **intrinsic AV nodal disease** [^112NRJyv]. Complete heart block is most strongly suggested by a **slow, regular ventricular rhythm** (< 50–60 bpm) with **fixed R-R intervals** and no relation to atrial activity [^114wmuEn]. Definitive diagnosis requires ECG documentation of **AV dissociation** or electrophysiology study [^1176EzQz]; pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradycardia or documented pauses ≥ 5 seconds in AF [^115MkiRn].

---

## Electrophysiological mechanisms of slow atrial fibrillation

Slow AF reflects **impaired AV nodal conduction** or **increased vagal tone**, slowing ventricular response [^112NRJyv]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Complete heart block**: No atrial impulses conduct to the ventricles; a regular junctional or ventricular escape rhythm results [^114wmuEn].

- **High-grade AV block**: Intermittent or partial conduction with slow, irregular ventricular response [^115ZwVqn].

- **Drug-induced AV nodal slowing**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin slow AV nodal conduction and can cause bradycardia [^117ThKjp].

- **Increased vagal tone**: Enhanced parasympathetic activity slows AV nodal conduction, especially at rest or during sleep [^112NRJyv].

- **Intrinsic AV nodal disease**: Degenerative or ischemic AV nodal disease can cause conduction delay or block [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence linking slow atrial fibrillation to complete heart block

A **slow, regular ventricular response** in AF strongly suggests complete heart block, but it is not diagnostic [^114wmuEn]. ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines indicate that a slow, regular ventricular rhythm during AF usually indicates complete heart block, but other causes must be excluded [^1141hhR3]. Electrophysiology studies can confirm **AV dissociation** and the level of block [^116uhdf3].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and electrocardiographic features

Complete heart block in AF is suggested by:

- **Slow, regular ventricular rhythm**: Typically < 50–60 bpm with fixed R-R intervals [^114wmuEn].

- **AV dissociation**: Ventricular rhythm independent of atrial activity [^115ZwVqn].

- **Escape rhythm**: Junctional or ventricular escape rhythm [^114wmuEn].

Definitive diagnosis requires **ECG documentation of AV dissociation** or an **electrophysiology study** [^116d7xwm] [^1176EzQz].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Slow AF with suspected complete heart block requires **careful evaluation and management**:

- **Symptom assessment**: Evaluate for syncope, presyncope, dizziness, fatigue, or heart failure symptoms [^111S3gZT].

- **ECG monitoring**: Document AV dissociation and escape rhythm [^114wmuEn].

- **Electrophysiology study**: Confirm diagnosis and assess level of block [^1176EzQz].

- **Permanent pacing**: Indicated for symptomatic bradycardia or documented pauses ≥ 5 seconds in AF [^115MkiRn].

- **Medication review**: Adjust or discontinue AV nodal blocking agents as appropriate [^112ekckL].

---

## Prognostic significance

Complete heart block in AF is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality**, including syncope, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Early recognition and appropriate pacing improve outcomes [^113Q25R3].

---

## Conclusion

Slow AF is **not always due to complete heart block**; a slow, regular ventricular rhythm suggests it, but other causes must be excluded. Accurate diagnosis relies on **ECG documentation of AV dissociation** or an **electrophysiology study**, and management includes symptom assessment, monitoring, and pacing when indicated [^114wmuEn].

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF)–associated bradycardia after cardiac surgery — AF occurs commonly after cardiac surgery in adults, with a peak incidence 2 to 4 days postoperatively and an overall incidence ranging from 10% to 65%. Postoperative AF occurs more frequently in patients undergoing valve surgery than in those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft. Bradycardia may take several forms in these patients, including slow ventricular response during AF and prolonged sinus pauses after sinus rhythm is restored. A slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if resolution does not occur. The assessment of bradyarrhythmias in this setting is often complicated by the coexistence of atrial tachyarrhythmia; transient and time-dependent postoperative effects of sinus and atrioventricular node function, and the potential presence of antiarrhythmic drugs. In general, bradyarrhythmias in the setting of postoperative AF should be treated similarly to those occurring in the nonoperative setting, and a period of watchful waiting rather than early PPM implantation is generally used. In occasional patients with refractory AF with rapid ventricular responses associated with significant SND limiting rate control drugs, a PPM may be required for adequate AF management.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG characteristics include the following: First-degree atrioventricular block is a misnomer with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms and no true block, more accurately referred to as first-degree atrioventricular delay. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II; Mobitz I occurs after gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG shows group beating from "dropped" QRS complexes, while isolated 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted; high-degree block is generally intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing, and in unusual circumstances (at night with sinus slowing) a vagal etiology may be considered when the QRS is narrow. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and is usually associated with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism; in atrial fibrillation, complete block may be imputed when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is required, as a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may be absent with isorhythmic dissociation or when sinus bradycardia is coupled with an accelerated junctional rhythm, and atrial bigeminy with repetitive premature atrial contractions can mimic atrioventricular block. Additionally, atrioventricular block within or below the His bundle may progress rapidly and unexpectedly, is associated with a slower and more unpredictable ventricular escape mechanism, and will not respond to atropine but may improve with catecholamines.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG interpretation are described as follows: First-degree atrioventricular block is each P wave conducted with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II, where Mobitz I follows gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG will show group beating due to "dropped" QRS complexes. Atrioventricular block with only 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted without complete loss of atrioventricular conduction, and high-degree atrioventricular block is generally considered to be intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and may be paroxysmal or persistent with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism, and complete atrioventricular block may be imputed in atrial fibrillation (AF) when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the ECG is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present when atrial and ventricular rates are similar (isorhythmic dissociation) or when the atrial rate is slower than the ventricular rate from sinus bradycardia with an accelerated junctional rhythm; in atrial bigeminy premature atrial contractions can lead to an erroneous diagnosis, and in unusual circumstances a vagal etiology may be considered especially when the QRS in narrow.

Atrioventricular block classification and ECG interpretation — Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) occurs after gradual PR prolongation whereas Mobitz II does not; atrioventricular block with only 2:1 conduction cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II, making it important to elucidate the level of block. High‑grade, high‑degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted, and high‑degree atrioventricular block is generally considered intra‑ or infra‑Hisian and treated with pacing. Third‑degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no atrioventricular conduction, may be paroxysmal or persistent, and is usually associated with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism; in atrial fibrillation, complete block may be imputed when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful ECG evaluation is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present with isorhythmic dissociation or when sinus bradycardia is coupled with an accelerated junctional rhythm without consistent retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction, and atrial bigeminy with premature atrial contractions may mimic atrioventricular block due to normal conduction, delay, or blocked conduction.

### NKX2–5 genetic mutation in a young woman with an atrial septal defect presenting with complete heart block: ICD or bradycardia pacemaker? [^1159bv9M]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s was admitted following syncope. The 12-lead ECG showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response and suspected complete atrioventricular (AV) block. Cardiac monitoring demonstrated non-sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Her medical history included surgical repair of an atrial septal defect (ASD) aged 4 years. The patient's mother died suddenly in her early 50s and also had an ASD. Given the patient's syncope, background of familial sudden cardiac death (SCD), suspicion of complete AV block and non-sustained VT, she received an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). She underwent genetic testing, revealing a heterozygous NKX2–5 genetic mutation. The signature phenotype in NKX2–5 mutations is ASD with AV conduction disturbance and an increased risk of SCD secondary to ventricular arrhythmias or severe bradycardia. SCD has been described in NKX2–5 mutation carriers despite functioning permanent pacemakers (PPMs). Therefore, we propose implantation of a preventive ICD, as opposed to a PPM.

### Transient proarrhythmic state following atrioventricular junction radiofrequency ablation: pathophysiologic mechanisms and recommendations for management [^116NXn7P]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The induction of complete heart block by radiofrequency ablation of the atrioventricular junction combined with pacemaker implantation has become an established therapy for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation who are unresponsive to drugs. Reports of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death after ablation have, however, raised concerns about safety. Ventricular arrhythmias are usually polymorphic and related to a phase of electrical instability due to an initial prolongation and then slow adaptation of repolarization caused by the change in heart rate and activation sequence. Structural heart disease, and other factors that predispose for the acquired long QT syndrome, seem to add to the risk. Ventricular activation and repolarization stabilize during the first week after the procedure. Routine pacing at 80 beats per minute during this phase is recommended, as well as in hospital monitoring for at least 48 hours. Patients with high-risk features for arrhythmias, such as congestive heart failure or impaired left ventricular function, may require pacing at higher rates. Adjustment of the pacing rate-although rarely below 70 beats per minute-is usually undertaken after a week in most patients, preferably after an electrocardiographic evaluation for repolarization abnormalities at the lower rate.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) definition and diagnostic criteria — ECG-based episode and recurrence thresholds are specified. AF is described as "a common supraventricular arrhythmia" with "rapid and irregular activation in the atria without discrete P waves on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG)", diagnosable by "a surface ECG, an intracardiac atrial electrogram, or both". An arrhythmia "that has the ECG characteristics of AF and lasts sufficiently long for a 12-lead ECG to be recorded, or is otherwise documented to last for at least 30 seconds, should be considered to be an AF episode"; the "30-second duration" is "used as the minimal duration to define recurrence of AF after catheter ablation" and "has not been linked to a specific outcome of AF". AF diagnosis requires demonstration of "absolutely" irregular R-R intervals (in the absence of complete atrioventricular [AV] block); (2) no distinct P waves on the surface ECG; and (3) an atrial cycle length (when visible) that is usually less than 200 ms".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acquired atrioventricular block in adults — classification and pacing evidence: First-degree AV block is defined as abnormal prolongation of the PR interval (greater than 0.20 seconds). When AV conduction occurs in a 2:1 pattern, block cannot be classified unequivocally as type I or type II. Advanced second-degree AV block refers to the blocking of 2 or more consecutive P waves with some conducted beats, and in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF) a prolonged pause (e.g., greater than 5 seconds) should be considered to be due to advanced second-degree AV block. Third-degree AV block (complete heart block) is defined as absence of AV conduction. Nonrandomized studies strongly suggest that permanent pacing improves survival in patients with third-degree AV block, whereas there is little evidence to suggest that pacemakers improve survival in patients with isolated first-degree AV block.

Introduction

The cardiac conduction system is integral to normal co-ordinated cardiac function. It consists of an elegant network of specialized myocytes, which initiate and transmit electrical impulses that trigger cardiac contraction. Heart rate, the timing of cardiac chamber filling, co-ordination of contraction, and relaxation are all governed by the sinus node and conduction system.

It has been proposed that impulses generated from the sinoatrial node travel through the right atrium using three internodal conduction pathways: anterior, medial, and posterior. Conduction to the left atrium is predominantly through Bachmann's bundle. Conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node leads to activation of the His–Purkinje system which produces rapid and co-ordinated ventricular activation.

The conduction system can be afflicted by disease in any facet of this intricate network; the location of the disease determines the impact on cardiac function (Graphical Abstract):

Sinus node disease may cause bradycardia, which can reduce cardiac output and allow other atrial rhythms to appear.
Slow atrial conduction prolongs atrial activation, delaying left atrial contraction, potentially impairing left ventricular (LV) filling. Impaired atrial function can increase atrial pressures and can increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF).
Slow conduction through the AV node prolongs AV delay, which may adversely affect biventricular filling.
Higher-degree heart block can be nodal (55%) or infra-nodal (45%) where block is most commonly due to disease within the His bundle (89%) and more rarely due to conduction block below the His bundle (4%). Complete heart block may cause profound bradycardia.
Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is most commonly due to disease within the His or proximal left bundle. It adversely affects ventricular function due to unco-ordinated LV activation and interventricular dyssynchrony, as well as impaired LV filling due to prolongation of left-sided AV delay.
Right bundle branch block (RBBB) occurs most commonly due to disease within the proximal right bundle branch and more rarely due to damaged fibres in the moderator band or more distal right bundle. It may adversely affect ventricular function due to interventricular dyssynchrony.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (NSIVCD) may be due to a range of mechanisms which include distal conduction system disease or myocardial diseases, that are distinct from the conduction system, which produce slow cell-to-cell propagation of the electrical wavefront.

Atrioventricular block in atrial fibrillation (AF) — pause interpretation and pacing implications are as follows: Atrioventricular block should be suspected in AF when a slow regular ventricular response is observed, and a wide QRS may indicate infranodal block. Retrospective ambulatory monitoring studies conflict; in 1 study, pauses > 3 seconds were mostly asymptomatic, whereas in the other 2 studies, most pauses > 3 seconds were symptomatic, and all 3 studies mixed AF and sinus rhythm without subgroup analyses. In asymptomatic patients, there is no specific pause duration that warrants permanent pacing, whereas if pauses cause symptoms or are attributable to infranodal block, the recommendation is similar to normal sinus rhythm.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — definition and electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics — is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. On the ECG, AF is characterized by the replacement of consistent P waves by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that vary in amplitude, shape, and timing, associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular response when atrioventricular (AV) conduction is intact, and regular cardiac cycles (R-R intervals) are possible in the presence of AV block or ventricular or AV junctional tachycardia. The ventricular response to AF depends on electrophysiologically (EP) properties of the AV node and other conducting tissues, the level of vagal and sympathetic tone, the presence or absence of accessory conduction pathways, and the action of drugs, and in patients with implanted pacemakers, diagnosis of AF may require temporary inhibition of the pacemaker to expose atrial fibrillatory activity. A rapid, irregular, sustained, wide-QRS-complex tachycardia strongly suggests AF with conduction over an accessory pathway or AF with underlying bundle-branch block, and extremely rapid rates (over 200 beats per minute) suggest the presence of an accessory pathway or ventricular tachycardia.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, and its incidence is increasing rapidly worldwide, accounting for nearly one‐third of all hospital admissions. 1 Meanwhile, it is also associated with increased risks of stroke, heart failure, cognitive dysfunction, impaired quality of life, and substantial healthcare costs. Furthermore, it eventually contributes to the increased risks of thromboembolic events, 2 cardiac, and overall mortalities. 3, 4, 5, 6 Atrioventricular block (AVB) is a conduction abnormality along the atrioventricular node or the His‐Purkinje system, and different etiology may result in diverse outcomes. According to the extent of its extension and the characteristics of electrocardiography (ECG), AVB can be categorized into three types: first‐degree AVB, second‐degree AVB, and third‐degree AVB. I AVB is often characterized by excessive prolongation of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. The PR interval is determined by the conduction time from the sinus node to the ventricles and thus integrates information about a number of sites in the conduction system of the heart. Prolongation of the electrocardiographic PR interval, conventionally known as first‐degree AVB when the PR interval exceeds 200 milliseconds, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. 7, 8, 9, 10 First‐degree AVB may result from conduction delay in the atrium, atrioventricular node, and/or His‐Purkinje system. The atrioventricular node is the most commonly involved site in adults. 11 Abnormalities in PR interval duration are associated with cardiac conduction defects and increased risk of AF, which carries a substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. However, the reported results of studies on the relationship between I AVB and AF are inconsistent. It is a controversial argument whether I AVB is a pathological state and related to AF. Some studies suggest that individuals with first‐degree AVB are at a substantially increased risk of future AF (~2‐fold) compared to individuals without first‐degree AVB. PR prolongation could be a marker of other changes in the cardiovascular system that contributes to a worse prognosis. Prior studies have raised the possibility that slowed intra‐atrial or interatrial conduction may directly increase the risk of AF. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 An association between PR interval and AF risk has been reported in a separate study that uses Framingham data to construct a clinical risk score for AF, 18 while others claim that first‐degree AVB has a benign prognosis. 7, 9, 10, 19, 20 First‐degree AVB typically occurs in the absence of acute cardiovascular disease. 7, 10 The relationship between AVB and AF has always been controversial.

### Case report: severe bradycardia, a reversible cause of "Cardio-renal-cerebral syndrome" [^114tw7xx]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Cardio-Renal Syndrome (CRS) is an entity that nephrologists are often faced to. It has been defined by Ronco et al. as a pathophysiologic disorder of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction of one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other. The Cardio-Renal Syndromes are subdivided into five different subtypes in order to allow physicians to better understand the situation and offer adequate treatment. The type 1 CRS is characterized by acute worsening of heart failure leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). It is considered to be the most common type of CRS and is present in approximately 25% of patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Bradyarrhythmia was not mentioned in the classification as a cause for low cardiac output (CO) in type 1 CRS. As well as the association of type 1 CRS with central nervous system (CNS) injury has not been previously described.

### Obesity and cardiac conduction block disease in China [^1119AoLy]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. In 2020, approximately 19 million people were estimated to have died from cardiovascular diseases. Arrhythmia is a common type of cardiovascular disease. According to the most recent statistics released by the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), arrhythmia-induced sudden cardiac death accounts for 20% to 50% of all cardiovascular-related fatalities. Although the pathogenesis of bradycardia and tachycardia differs, both lead to adverse clinical outcomes. Cardiac conduction block (CCB) is characterized by slow, excessively slow, or even complete blocked pulse conduction, which can have severe consequences. Even a seemingly simple first-degree atrioventricular block (FAVB) or bundle branch block is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events, such as heart failureand all-cause mortality. Therefore, the identification of modifiable factors associated with high risk of CCB is crucial. Established risk factors associated with CCB include hypertension, diabetes, and inflammation.

Obesity is a significant risk factor associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Every 5-point increase in body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)could contribute to a 16% increase in risk of sudden cardiac deathand 29% increase in risk of atrial fibrillation. Most previous studies have primarily examined the association between obesity and tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillationand ventricular arrhythmia. However, few studies have investigated the association between obesity and bradyarrhythmias. In a 2023 study investigating the association between lifestyle habits and CCB, Frimodt-Møller et alfound that a high BMI was associated with an increased risk of CCB in older adults. However, no study, to our knowledge, has reported the association between obesity and CCB in the general population. Therefore, we used data from the Kailuan Study cohortto investigate the association between obesity and CCB and its subtypes, such as high-grade AVB (HAVB).

Atrioventricular conduction during atrial fibrillation (AF) — In the absence of preexcitation or His-Purkinje dysfunction, ventricular rate is limited by the atrioventricular (AV) node, with additional modulation by concealed conduction and autonomic tone; increased parasympathetic and reduced sympathetic tone slow AV nodal conduction whereas the opposite autonomic pattern accelerates it, conducted QRS complexes are typically narrow unless bundle-branch block or an accessory pathway is present, aberrant conduction is common due to ventricular irregularity, and digitalis slows the ventricular rate predominantly via vagal tone with greater effect at rest than during activity.

ICD SVT–VT discrimination — patients most likely to benefit and risks indicate that patients will benefit most if the rates of their VTs and SVTs overlap, including those with slow monomorphic VT, those at risk for AF with rapid ventricular rates, or those capable of exercising to sinus rates in the VT zone; benefit is less for primary-prevention patients and those who cannot sustain rapid AV conduction, and patients with permanent complete AV block do not benefit. The risk is misclassification of VT or VF as SVT that can prevent VT detection or delay therapy; when modern algorithms are programmed to recommended parameters, clinically significant underdetection is rare, and large trials report no or minimal and statistically insignificant increases in syncope, with the PREPARE study noting no syncopal episode was caused by untreated tachycardia.

Myocardial and hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation (AF) — Irregular ventricular activation during AF reduces cardiac output and coronary blood flow; in a canine complete heart block model, cardiac output fell by approximately 9% during irregular pacing at the same mean cycle length as regular pacing, and after atrioventricular nodal ablation in patients, irregular right ventricular pacing at the same rate as regular pacing resulted in a 15% reduction in cardiac output. In persistent AF, mean left atrial (LA) volume increased from 45 to 64 cm3 while right atrial (RA) volume increased from 49 to 66 cm3, and a persistently elevated ventricular rate during AF — greater than or equal to 130 beats per minute in one study — can produce dilated ventricular cardiomyopathy. Coronary perfusion is impaired during AF, as animal studies show a decrease in coronary flow related to increased coronary vascular resistance, and coronary blood flow is lower during AF than during regular atrial pacing in patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries.

General principles — supportive considerations for nodal atrioventricular block: First‑ and second‑degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) AV blocks (or 2:1 AV block at the AV node) are typically benign in that they do not progress significantly to complete heart block, and treatment with a pacemaker is typically reserved for significant symptoms that affect quality of life (QOL); occasionally second‑degree Mobitz type I block is infranodal and in those instances a pacemaker may be considered even in the absence of symptoms. Although a narrow QRS suggests nodal block, infranodal disease can be revealed during an electrophysiology study (EPS), and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring or a treadmill exercise test may be useful to correlate symptoms. If symptoms do not clearly correspond to episodes of AV block, the risks associated with a pacemaker in the absence of clear benefit make the overall risk‑benefit ratio unfavorable; in long‑standing persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) with a low heart rate and appropriate chronotropic response, pacing for rate support is unlikely to be beneficial, and although PPM implantation is relatively low risk, procedural complications and death can occur and leads have long‑term management implications.

### Prognostic significance of ventricular rate at discharge in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and HF [^113AD9DL]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HF), systemic thromboembolism, and mortality. It is seen in 10% to 45% of patients with congestive HF at initial presentation. Its presence in HF patients is associated with worse prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality. Frequently, cause-effect relationship cannot be established at the time of presentation, as persistent atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate can lead to HF, and on the contrary, severe HF can be complicated by atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.

In atrial fibrillation, the relationship between ventricular rate and congestive HF is complex. Optimal management of HF, through neuro-hormonal influences, decreases sympathetic activity and thus slows ventricular rate. Slowing ventricular rate by atrioventricular blockade leads to improved ventricular filling and cardiac output. In individual patients, it is very difficult to establish which of the above is more critical; however, controlling ventricular rate is intuitive and is associated with improvement in HF. The optimal ventricular rate that is associated with the best long-term outcome remains a matter of debate.

Related arrhythmias — atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia — are described in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF), as AF may occur in isolation or in association with other arrhythmias, most commonly atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter may arise during treatment with antiarrhythmic agents prescribed to prevent recurrent AF. Atrial flutter in the typical form is characterized by a saw-tooth pattern of regular atrial activation called flutter (f) waves on the ECG, particularly visible in leads II, III, aVF, and V1, and in the untreated state, the atrial rate in atrial flutter typically ranges from 240 to 320 beats per minute. Atrial flutter commonly occurs with 2:1 AV block, resulting in a regular or irregular ventricular rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute (most characteristically about 150 beats per minute), and atrial flutter may degenerate into AF and AF may convert to atrial flutter, with the ECG pattern fluctuating between atrial flutter and AF. Atrial flutter is usually readily distinguished from AF, but when atrial activity is prominent on the ECG in more than 1 lead, AF may be misdiagnosed as atrial flutter, and focal atrial tachycardias, AV reentrant tachycardias, and AV nodal reentrant tachycardias may also trigger AF.

Synopsis — determinants and risks in atrioventricular block: The presence or absence of symptoms is a major determinant on whether permanent pacing will be required in the setting of bradycardia associated with atrioventricular block, the site of atrioventricular block is critical because patients with infranodal disease who later develop complete heart block will be dependent on unreliable ventricular escape rhythms, significant amounts of right ventricular pacing are potentially deleterious, and patients with atrioventricular block may have an associated systemic disease that leads to progressive atrioventricular block or has additional risk for ventricular arrhythmias.

### Digoxin (digox) [^116byHCu]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Sinus Node Disease and AV Block: Because digoxin slows sinoatrial and AV conduction, the drug commonly prolongs the PR interval. The drug may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. In such patients consideration should be given to the insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

Accessory AV Pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome): After intravenous digoxin therapy, some patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter and a coexisting accessory AV pathway have developed increased antegrade conduction across the accessory pathway bypassing the Av node, leading to a very rapid ventricular response or ventricular fibrillation. Unless conduction down the accessory pathway has been blocked (either pharmacologically or by surgery), digoxin should not be used in such patients. The treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in such patients is usually direct-current cardioversion.

Use in Patients with Preserved Left Ventricular Systolic Function: Patients with certain disorders involving heart failure associated with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction may be particularly susceptible to toxicity of the drug. Such disorders include restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, amyloid heart disease, and acute cor pulmonale. Patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis may have worsening of the outflow obstruction due to the inotropic effects of digoxin.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — mechanisms, efficacy, and practical considerations for rate control: The main determinants of ventricular rate during AF are the intrinsic conduction characteristics and refractoriness of the AV node and autonomic tone, and drugs that prolong the AV nodal refractory period are generally effective. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions designed to achieve rate control in AF has been about 80% in clinical trials. There is no evidence that pharmacological rate control has any adverse influence on LV function, but bradycardia and heart block may occur, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF, especially the elderly. When rapid control is required or oral administration is not feasible, medication may be administered intravenously; otherwise, in hemodynamically stable patients with a rapid ventricular response, negative chronotropic medication may be administered orally. Combinations may be necessary to achieve rate control in both acute and chronic situations, some patients may require permanent pacing for symptomatic bradycardia, and nonpharmacological therapy should be considered when pharmacological measures fail.

Paroxysmal atrioventricular block (AVB) is a poorly defined clinical entity characterized by abrupt and unexpected change from 1:1 atrioventricular conduction to complete heart block, leading to syncope and potential sudden cardiac death. Although a dangerous condition because of unreliable escape mechanism, proper diagnosis of paroxysmal AVB is often missed and overlooked because of its unfamiliarity, unpredictability, and in some cases, no clear evidence of atrioventricular conduction disease during normal 1:1 conduction.

5.1 Ventricular Fibrillation in Patients With Accessory AV Pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome)

Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby increased.

5.2 Sinus Bradycardia and Sino-atrial Block

Digoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

### Cumulative effect of complete left bundle-branch block and chronic atrial fibrillation on 1-year mortality and hospitalization in patients with congestive heart failure. A report from the Italian network on congestive heart failure (in-CHF database) [^115BagAo]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Many clinical variables have been proposed as prognostic factors in patients with congestive heart failure. Among these, complete left bundle-branch block and atrial fibrillation are known to impair significantly left ventricular performance in patients with congestive heart failure. However, their combined effect on mortality has been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to determine whether left bundle-branch block associated with atrial fibrillation had an independent, cumulative effect on mortality for congestive heart failure.

Methods and Results

We analysed the Italian Network on congestive heart failure (IN-CHF) Registry that was established by the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists in 1995. One-year follow-up data were available for 5517 patients. Complete left bundle-branch block and atrial fibrillation were associated in 185 (3.3%) patients. In this population the cause of congestive heart failure was dilated cardiomyopathy (38.4%), ischaemic heart disease (35.1%), hypertensive heart disease (17.3%), and other aetiologies (9.2%). This combination of electrical defects was associated with an increased 1-year mortality from any cause (hazard ratio, HR: 1.88; 95% CI 1.37–2.57) and sudden death (HR: 1.89; 95% CI 1.17–3.03) and 1-year hospitalization rate (HR: 1.83; 95% CI 1.26–2.67).

Conclusions

In patients with congestive heart failure, the contemporary presence of left bundle-branch block and atrial fibrillation was associated with a significant increase in mortality. This synergistic effect remained significant after adjusting for clinical variables usually associated with advanced heart failure. We can conclude that this combination of electrical disturbances identifies a congestive heart failure specific population with a high risk of mortality.

Heart Rhythm (2012). Medium credibility.

Pacemaker device and mode selection — pacing after atrioventricular (AV) junction ablation: Catheter ablation of the AV node to produce complete heart block combined with permanent pacing is a recognized treatment to control the heart rate and alleviate symptoms in patients with medically refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). However, 16–35% of patients develop permanent AF within the first 6 months after AV junction ablation, and this rate continues to increase during long-term follow-up. Based on the high rate of progression to persistent or permanent AF following AV junction ablation, single-chamber ventricular pacing is an appropriate mode of pacing for the majority of patients undergoing this procedure.

Definitions — sinus node dysfunction include sinus bradycardia defined as sinus rate < 50 bpm and ectopic atrial bradycardia as atrial depolarization attributable to an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm; sinoatrial exit block is evidence that blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue is present; sinus pause occurs when the sinus node depolarizes ≥ 3 s after the last atrial depolarization; sinus node arrest denotes no evidence of sinus node depolarization; tachycardia‑bradycardia ("tachy‑brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or atrial fibrillation (AF), with the tachycardia possibly associated with suppression of sinus node automaticity and a sinus pause of variable duration when the tachycardia terminates; chronotropic incompetence is broadly the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with activity or demand and in many studies translates to failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise; and isorhythmic dissociation describes atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization.

Atrial fibrillation — digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

QT Interval Prolongation

ANZEMET prolongs the QT interval in a dose dependent fashion. Torsade de Pointes has been reported during post-marketing experience. Avoid ANZEMET in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, hypomagnesemia, or hypokalemia. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to ANZEMET administration. Monitor these electrolytes after administration as clinically indicated. Use ECG monitoring in patients with congestive heart failure, bradycardia, renal impairment, and elderly patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

PR and QRS Interval Prolongation

ANZEMET has been shown to cause dose dependent prolongation of the PR and QRS interval and reports of second or third degree atrioventricular block, cardiac arrest and serious ventricular arrhythmias including fatalities in both adult and pediatric patients. At particular risk are patients with underlying structural heart disease and preexisting conduction system abnormalities, elderly, patients with sick sinus syndrome, patients with atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, patients with myocardial ischemia or patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil) and QRS interval (e.g., flecainide or quinidine). ANZEMET should be used with caution and with ECG monitoring in these patients. ANZEMET should be avoided in patients with complete heart block or at risk for complete heart block, unless they have an implanted pacemaker (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Tachy-brady syndrome in symptomatic sinus node dysfunction (SND) — patients have periods of fast heart rates (usually atrial fibrillation) and slow sinus rates or pauses, with one of the most disabling symptoms being recurrent syncope or presyncope secondary to transient asystolic pause after termination of paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia; no randomized trial has specifically examined permanent cardiac pacing in tachy-brady syndrome; permanent pacing can alleviate symptoms attributable to bradycardia or allow use of medications that might exacerbate bradycardia, and when bradycardia is associated with the atrial arrhythmia (AF with slow ventricular rates or post conversion pauses), ablation may obviate the requirement for permanent pacing.

### Atrial gradient as a potential predictor of atrial fibrillation [^116GDaRU]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

We tested the utility and comparability of the atrial gradient and atrial ERP as early markers of electrical remodeling and a propensity to atrial fibrillation (AF).

Background

Pacing at physiologic rates from the left atrium alters the atrial gradient and is associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias. At these physiologic rates, there is no change in the atrial effective refractory period (ERP).

Methods

Sixty-one chronically instrumented mongrel dogs in complete heart block were paced from the left or right atrium at 400 to 900 bpm for 46 ± 3 days. Dogs were monitored weekly and electrophysiologic studies conducted to determine changes in the atrial gradient, ERP, and rhythm.

Results

Rapid atrial pacing was associated with concordant decreases in atrial gradient, ERP, and occurrence of AF. Incidence of AF increased with increasing pacing rate. Although there ultimately was an equal incidence of AF with left atrial and right atrial pacing, the onset of AF occurred earlier with left atrial pacing. As expected, ERP decreased in both atria. Animals with long control ERP did not fibrillate.

Conclusions

Rapid pacing induces changes in atrial gradient, which can be used as a noninvasive marker of electrical remodeling. AF is accompanied by decreases in atrial gradient and ERP, and the incidence is highest in dogs with short control ERP.

It is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level in awake, symptom-free patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bradycardia with 1 or more pauses of at least 5 seconds or longer (Level of Evidence: C).

Electrophysiology study (EPS) — diagnostic yield and risk markers — may provide acute diagnostic information but has variable sensitivity and a small procedural risk; an EPS has a low specificity and sensitivity overall but may be helpful in selected patients in whom other testing has been unrevealing; in patients with fascicular or bundle branch block, a prolonged HV interval at EPS predicts a higher risk for complete heart block; first-degree atrioventricular block or bundle branch block were markers for abnormal EPS findings in patients with syncope.

5 DISCUSSION

AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, and its incidence is increasing rapidly worldwide accounting for nearly one‐third of all hospital admissions. 1 It is also associated with increased risks of stroke, heart failure, cognitive dysfunction, impaired quality of life, and substantial healthcare costs. Furthermore, it eventually contributes to increased risks of thromboembolic events, 2 cardiac, and overall mortalities, 3, 4, 5, 6 which may result in different outcomes. AVB is categorized into three types according to the extent of its extension and the characteristics of ECG: first‐degree AVB, second‐degree AVB, and third‐degree AVB.

5.1 I AVB and AF

The relationship between I AVB and arrhythmia has been controversial. The reported results of studies on the relationship between I AVB and AF are inconsistent. Some studies suggest that individuals with first‐degree AVB are at a substantially increased risk of future AF (~2‐fold) 8 compared with individuals without first‐degree AVB. An association between PR interval and AF risk has been reported. 18 PR prolongation could be a marker of worse prognosis in the cardiovascular system. Potential explanations may account for the association of longer PR interval with AF risk. In addition, a prolonged PR interval results in delayed and ineffective mitral valve closure and diastolic mitral regurgitation, 30 especially when the PR interval exceeds 230 milliseconds, 31 while others claim that first‐degree AVB has a benign prognosis, 7, 9, 10, 19, 20 although these studies are based on young, healthy men in the military. 7, 19 First‐degree AVB typically occurs in the absence of acute cardiovascular disease. 7, 10 The relationship between I AVB and AF has always been controversial.

Through the statistical analysis of the AF data in the Atrial Fibrillation Center of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University during 2017‐2018, it is found that: I AVB is increased in the AF group (n = 46, 6.77%) compared with the non‐AF group (24, 4.26%). The I AVB has a relative statistical risk of 1.927 (95% CI: 1.160‐3.203, P < 0.05) with the occurrence of AF. I AVB is a risk factor for AF.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — atrioventricular (AV) block in ACHD: Atrioventricular block at any level is associated with a higher mortality in the ACHD patient, yet no randomized studies exist to compare treatment strategies for the asymptomatic patient, and the degree of atrioventricular block from first-degree to complete atrioventricular block is relevant as far as reliability of an escape rhythm or unexplained syncope is concerned, yet patients may develop symptoms, regardless of the level block. Patients with significant prolongation of atrioventricular conduction (without block) can develop atrioventricular dyssynchrony to such a degree that pacemaker syndrome can develop, and certain congenital anomalies are inherently associated with a more fragile atrioventricular conduction system, and more rigorous scrutiny of these patient groups is necessary.

### Atrial-ventricular differences in rabbit cardiac voltage-gated nacurrents: basis for atrial-selective block by ranolazine [^115AaFn6]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF), characterized by rapid and irregular electrical activation of the atria, reduced cardiac output, poor response to exercise, and fatigue, is the most commonly occurring clinical arrhythmia. AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, principally through an elevated risk of thromboembolism and ischemic stroke owing to inadequate emptying of the atria, although the elevated ventricular rate can also contribute to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure. The condition tends to be progressive, with paroxysms of AF leading with time to persistent and permanent AF. The progressive nature of AF is thought to arise through the elevated rate causing electrical and structural remodeling that stabilizes the arrhythmia. Early intervention to prevent and/or control the arrhythmia is therefore highly desirable.

The activation of voltage-gated Na + channels underlies the propagation and conduction of the action potential through the heart, whereas their subsequent inactivation initiates a refractory period that is usually determined by the duration of the action potential. Voltage-gated Na + channels are a major target for antiarrhythmic drugs, as the combined effects of reduction in membrane excitability, conduction velocity slowing, and prolongation of the refractory period can both suppress triggered activity and extinguish reentrant activity. Blockers of voltage-gated Na + channels with relatively slow dissociation kinetics (ie, the class Ia and Ic antiarrhythmic drugs of the Vaughan-Williams classification) are effective in the cardioversion of early-onset AF and the maintenance of sinus rhythm. The class Ic drugs, flecainide and propafenone, are recommended as a suitable "pill-in-the-pocket".

Permanent pacing techniques and methods (continued) — In patients with atrioventricular block at the level of the atrioventricular node who have an indication for permanent pacing, His bundle pacing may be considered to maintain physiologic ventricular activation. In patients with permanent or persistent AF in whom a rhythm control strategy is not planned, implantation of an atrial lead should not be performed.

### Case report: severe bradycardia, a reversible cause of "Cardio-renal-cerebral syndrome" [^111mG4p6]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardio-Renal Syndromes were first classified in 2008 and divided into five subtypes. The type 1 Cardio-Renal Syndrome (CRS) is characterized by acute decompensation of heart failure leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). Bradyarrhythmia was not mentioned in the classification as a cause for low cardiac output (CO) in type 1 CRS. Besides, CRS was not previously associated with central nervous system (CNS) injury despite the fact that cardiac, renal and neurological diseases can coexist.

Case presentation

We report the case of a 93-year old diabetic man who presented for obnubilation. He had a slow atrial fibrillation, was not hypotensive and was not taking any beta-blocker. He developed, simultaneously, during his hospitalization, severe bradycardia (< 35 beats per minute), oligoanuria and further neurological deterioration without profound hypotension. An ECG revealed a complete atrioventricular (AV) block and all his symptoms were completely reversed after pacemaker insertion. His creatinine decreased progressively afterwards and at discharge, he was conscious, alert and well oriented.

Conclusion

Our case highlights the importance of an early recognition of low cardiac output secondary to severe bradyarrhythmia and its concurrent repercussion on the kidney and the brain. This association of the CRS with CNS injury-that we called "Cardio-Renal-Cerebral Syndrome"–was successfully treated with permanent pacemaker implantation.

### Significance of alectinib-induced bradycardia: rhythm and reversibility matter more than rate [^1132p5Rd]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Second, the Pruis et alwork provides reassurance that the bradycardia observed with alectinib may be notable but is rarely life altering and, to date, never life ending. Given the amount of electrocardiographic data Pruis et al had in this study, it would have been helpful if they were more explicit about some details. Based on the electrocardiographic data in Supplemental Table 3, because PQ intervals are reported on all patients except in 1 with atrial fibrillation and another time for 1 patient in supraventricular tachycardia, we assume that all patients were in sinus rhythm, although patients in an ectopic atrial rhythm can have a PQ interval. In the results, they note ". (no) other conduction changes were observed". Taken together, we assume that, except in 1 patient with atrial fibrillation, all "bradycardia" in the study was sinus bradycardia as opposed to other sinister forms of bradycardia like second-degree type II (Mobitz II) heart block, third-degree (complete) heart block, or ventricular escape rhythms. This distinction of the bradycardic rhythm is of critical importance. Evidence of second-degree type II heart block (Mobitz II), high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree (complete) heart block are Class I indications for a permanent pacemaker regardless of symptoms because without intervention the prognosis is poor. The rhythm in the patient who received a pacemaker was not specifically mentioned but only termed "symptomatic bradycardia". In the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines on the management of bradycardia, the threshold for the placement of a permanent pacemaker for sinus node dysfunction is higher, and symptom-rhythm correlation should be demonstrated.

### Complete heart block: determinants and clinical impact in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy undergoing nonsurgical septal reduction therapy [^112ZviP7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this paper is to examine the incidence and determinants of permanent complete heart block (CHB) after nonsurgical septal reduction therapy (NSRT), and to evaluate the clinical impact of permanent pacemaker (PPM) placement.

Background

Nonsurgical septal reduction therapy with ethanol improves the clinical and hemodynamic parameters in patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Complete heart block is a common complication after NSRT.

Methods

The database of 261 consecutive patients who underwent NSRT at Baylor College of Medicine was reviewed. Clinical variables that were considered as possible determinants for CHB after NSRT were: age, gender, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient at rest or with provocation, septal thickness, and baseline exercise duration. For electrocardiographic (ECG) variables, the presence of first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, bifascicular block, left bundle branch block, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy were analyzed. In addition, the volume of ethanol injected, the method of administration of ethanol (i.e., bolus vs. slow injection [over 30 to 60 s]), number of septal arteries occluded, use of myocardial echocardiography, and infarct size as determined by peak creatine kinase level.

Results

Of 261 consecutive patients, 37 had PPM or automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator placed before NSRT. Of the remaining 224 patients, 31 (14%) developed CHB after the procedure. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender (odds ratio [OR] 4.3; P = 0.02), bolus injection of ethanol (OR 51; P = 0.004), injecting more than one septal artery (OR 4.6; P = 0.016), the presence of left bundle branch block (OR 39; P = 0.002), and first-degree AV block (OR 14; P = 0.001) on the baseline ECG are independent predictors of CHB after NSRT. Patients requiring PPM placement had a similar improvement in their NYHA functional class, septal thickness reduction, LVOT gradient reduction, and improvement of exercise capacity when compared with patients who did not require pacing.

Conclusions

Multiple demographic, electrocardiographic, and technical factors seem to increase the risk of CHB after NSRT. Patients with CHB after NSRT derive similar clinical and hemodynamic benefit to patients who did not require permanent pacing.

Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) — early postprocedural sudden death risk and mitigation — Early observational studies showed a concerning incidence of sudden death after AVNA in 3% to 7% of patients, linked to ventricular fibrillation (VF) predominantly due to bradycardia, QT prolongation, and heterogeneity of repolarization, with initiation often pause dependent or occurring during a relatively slow pacing rate. Deaths due to malignant arrhythmias have been minimized by protocols specifying higher lower-rate pacing in the early postprocedure period, followed by lower rate adjustment over several weeks.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — table of definitions for sinus node dysfunction details: Sinus bradycardia is defined as sinus rate < 50 bpm, and ectopic atrial bradycardia is atrial depolarization attributable to an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm. Sinoatrial exit block is evidence that blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue is present. Sinus pause occurs when the sinus node depolarizes > 3 s after the last atrial depolarization, whereas sinus node arrest indicates no evidence of sinus node depolarization. Tachycardia-bradycardia ("tachy-brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or AF. Chronotropic incompetence is broadly defined as failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise, and isorhythmic dissociation describes atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^112HejQ2]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) risk factors in hospitalized patients — Risk is greater in women than men by approximately 2-fold and is more common in patients older than 65 years; predisposition has been associated with underlying heart disease of multiple origins. Hypokalemia is a well-established predisposing risk factor for TdP, as is hypomagnesemia, whereas hypocalcemia has been associated with TdP only in rare cases. The association of diuretic use with in-hospital TdP may be explained by correlations with congestive heart failure, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia, and some diuretics directly block potassium currents and may therefore reduce repolarization reserve. Intravenous potassium has been shown to reverse the QT-prolonging effects of quinidine in humans, but the value of acute potassium repletion is less well documented than that of intravenous magnesium for the acute treatment of drug-induced TdP; normal levels of both potassium and magnesium should be maintained aggressively in hospitalized patients at risk. Bradycardia is an additional important risk factor, and prolonged ventricular cycle length can present as simple sinus bradycardia or complete atrioventricular block; premature beats that lead to short-long-short cycles may foster development of TdP, whereas isoproterenol infusion or overdrive pacing can suppress TdP in these circumstances. The risk for TdP appears to be decreased when the underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation unless there is also complete heart block. No quantitative multivariate risk index exists for hospital-based prediction, and risk may be greatest when multiple recognizable factors cluster; for example, an elderly woman with diuretic-treated heart failure taking more than 1 potentially QT-prolonging drug with sinus bradycardia and occasional ventricular bigeminy would be a good candidate for ECG/QT monitoring and electrolyte repletion.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 bradycardia guideline — ACHD sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrioventricular (AV) conduction disease: Permanent pacing can alleviate symptoms from SND in adults with ACHD, and single-lead atrial-based pacing is recommended for isolated sinus nodal disease with preserved AV conduction. AV block at any level is associated with higher mortality in ACHD, and marked AV dyssynchrony without block can cause pacemaker syndrome; congenital anomalies such as ccTGA and endocardial cushion defects are associated with a more fragile AV conduction system requiring more rigorous scrutiny. In congenital complete heart block, certain clinical features are high-risk markers for adverse outcomes including death, reflecting unreliable escape rhythms and a propensity to bradycardia-related ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes.

### Association between ECG abnormalities and mortality in a low-risk population [^117BJh8L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The ECG is a simple, noninvasive screening method for cardiovascular disease and arrhythmia. The impact of ECG abnormality on mortality is not certain in low-risk populations. To address this, we evaluated the association between ECG abnormality and mortality.

Methods and Results

We retrospectively assessed baseline ECG and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in 660383 patients presenting for medical check-ups. Baseline ECG abnormalities were classified according to the Minnesota Code. Among the total 660383 participants, 23609 (3.6%) had major and 110038 (16.7%) had minor ECG abnormalities. All-cause mortality occurred in 7751 patients (1.1%) and cardiovascular mortality in 1180 (0.18%) over a median follow-up period of 8.8years. Major ECG abnormalities were associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11 [95%, 1.03–1.2]) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.63–2.27]) compared with no ECG abnormalities. All-cause mortality was associated with right atrial enlargement (HR, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.1–4.07]), left atrial enlargement (HR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.1–2.84]), sinus tachycardia (HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.15–2.01]), complete atrioventricular block (HR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.05–4.2]), atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.26–1.84]), and left ventricular hypertrophy (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.02–1.3]). Cardiovascular mortality was associated with left atrial enlargement (HR, 4.52 [95% CI, 2.15–9.5]), atrial fibrillation (HR, 3.22 [95% CI, 2.33–4.46]), left ventricular hypertrophy (HR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.35–2.19]), major Q-wave abnormality (HR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.08–2.39]), and major ST-T abnormality (HR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.01–3.04]).

Conclusions

ECG abnormalities, including left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, and major Q-wave and ST-T abnormalities, were associated with cardiovascular mortality in a low-risk population.

Sodium channel–blocking drugs — management and risks — should not be used in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) due to structural heart disease; rather, the major indication is atrial arrhythmias in patients without structural heart disease, and when used for atrial fibrillation (AF), atrioventricular (AV) nodal–blocking drugs should be administered to prevent rapid ventricular rates should atrial flutter occur, with amiodarone as a possible exception. These agents can convert AF to slow atrial flutter with 1:1 AV conduction and wide-QRS complexes and can occasionally precipitate a typical Brugada syndrome ECG; they also increase defibrillation energy requirement and pacing thresholds, sometimes necessitating reprogramming or revision of pacing or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) systems. The extent to which the prohibition in structural heart disease applies to tricyclic antidepressants that also block sodium channels is stated to be unknown.

### Procainamide hydrochloride [^111QBcyx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Complete Heart Block: Procainamide should not be administered to patients with complete heart block because of its effects in suppressing nodal or ventricular pacemakers and the hazard of asystole. It may be difficult to recognize complete heart block in patients with ventricular tachycardia, but if significant slowing of ventricular rate occurs during PA treatment without evidence of A-V conduction appearing, PA should be stopped. In cases of second degree A-V block or various types of hemiblock, PA should be avoided or discontinued because of the possibility of increased severity of block, unless the ventricular rate is controlled by an electrical pacemaker.

Idiosyncratic Hypersensitivity: In patients sensitive to procaine or other ester-type local anesthetics, cross sensitivity to PA is unlikely. However, it should be borne in mind, and PA should not be used if it produces acute allergic dermatitis, asthma, or anaphylactic symptoms.

Lupus Erythematosus: An established diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is a contraindication to PA therapy, since aggravation of symptoms is highly likely.

Torsades de Pointes: In the unusual ventricular arrhythmia called "les torsades de pointes" (twistings of the points), characterized by alternation of one or more ventricular premature beats in the directions of the QRS complexes on ECG in persons with prolonged Q-T and often enhanced U waves, Group 1A antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. Administration of PA in such cases may aggravate this special type of ventricular extrasystole or tachycardia instead of suppressing it.

### Sequence variants with large effects on cardiac electrophysiology and disease [^112atVcb]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Features of the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram, reflecting ventricular depolarisation, associate with various physiologic functions and several pathologic conditions. We test 32.5 million variants for association with ten measures of the QRS complex in 12 leads, using 405,732 electrocardiograms from 81,192 Icelanders. We identify 190 associations at 130 loci, the majority of which have not been reported before, including associations with 21 rare or low-frequency coding variants. Assessment of genes expressed in the heart yields an additional 13 rare QRS coding variants at 12 loci. We find 51 unreported associations between the QRS variants and echocardiographic traits and cardiovascular diseases, including atrial fibrillation, complete AV block, heart failure and supraventricular tachycardia. We demonstrate the advantage of in-depth analysis of the QRS complex in conjunction with other cardiovascular phenotypes to enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of myocardial mass, cardiac conduction and disease.

### End-stage heart failure in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: a multicentre study [^115XaA5V]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings are congruent with previous smaller studies, including the overall makeup of our cohort such as a broad age range, frequency of coexisting defects (VSD, PS, etc.), and use of pacemakers. Overall survival herein also largely parallels prior research, such as one showing 74% survival at 20 years of observed follow-up. Smaller studies have also explored factors associated with transplantation or death. The most consistent predictors have been TR and RV dysfunction, whereas prior cardiac surgery, age, and complete heart block were not significant.

Both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias were common in our study. Others have reported atrial fibrillation to be associated with worse survival, as do we, though progress from the first event to the primary outcome was slow and thus weakens its utility as a predictor. Heart failure admission was independent of atrial arrhythmia as a predictor in our sample. Pacing has been shown to be associated with RV dysfunction over time based on single-centre echocardiograms. We did not find similar results in our cohort, though RV function assessment was not uniform. Further, there was similarly a long duration between the need for pacing and the primary outcome, making it less significant as a predictor. In other studies, systemic RV dysfunction has been shown to increase the risk of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias. Sudden/arrhythmic death was the second most common cause of death and occurred in 17% of deaths in our cohort. One expects several unexplained deaths may also be arrhythmic, as other smaller series have shown a considerably higher prevalence of arrhythmic death than we report. Future studies are still needed to determine which patients benefit from ICD implantation.

Differential Disease Risk Patterns Across

LBBB‐dominant phenogroups 1 and 2 captured similar profiles in terms of disease risk. To assess heterogeneity within LBBB ECGs more distinctly, we further investigated trends of disease risk within these ECGs only across the tree dimensions. We found that LBBB ECGs further along dimension 1 (toward the right region of the tree) were associated with greater risk of future ventricular arrythmia, AF, LVSD, and myocardial infarction but lower risk of complete heart block when covariate‐adjusted, including adjustment for QRS duration (Figure S11A), whereas LBBB ECGs further along dimension 2 were associated with lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, complete heart block, and LVSD. In predicted survival time plots (Figure S11B), these trends aligned closely with the predicted risk probabilities for LBBB ECGs in these dimensions. Overall, these results showed that LBBB ECGs within different regions of the tree capture distinct risk profiles for specific cardiovascular diseases, challenging the simplistic approach of treating LBBB as an homogenous group.

### Risk prediction of atrial fibrillation based on electrocardiographic interatrial block [^114fvW3e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The electrocardiographic interatrial block (IAB) typically exists when a conduction delay over the Bachmann's bundle is present, however, it can also be caused by intra‐atrial conduction delay and left atrial enlargement. By analogy to other types of block, there is a continuum of IAB severity; partial IAB is defined as a P‐wave duration ≥ 120 ms and advanced IAB is defined as P‐wave duration ≥ 120 ms in conjunction with biphasic P‐wave morphology in inferior leads II, III, and aVF. 1

There has been an increasing interest in IAB in recent years, especially regarding its role in atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke. 2 In previous prospective studies of the general population (N≈15 000), advanced IAB (yes/no) has been associated with an increased risk of AF and ischemic stroke. 3, 4 The observed increased risk of ischemic stroke was reported to be independent of AF as an intermediate step. 4 For this reason, questions have been raised whether treatment with anticoagulation therapy in patients with IAB could be beneficial, regardless of AF status. 4, 5 However, to properly assess the clinical utility of a parameter with regards to risk stratification, knowledge on the absolute risks of AF and ischemic stroke associated with IAB is needed. Moreover, whether IAB is of clinical value in long‐term risks of AF and ischemic stroke on an individual level has not been investigated.

Using a large middle‐aged and elderly population of primary care patients, we aimed to: (1) replicate earlier findings of an association between IAB and an increased risk of AF and ischemic stroke; (2) examine differences in hazards according to the number of biphasic P‐waves in inferior leads; (3) investigate whether IAB is associated with conduction disorder and death from all causes; (4) evaluate whether IAB is of value in personalized long‐term risk prediction of AF and ischemic stroke; (5) to estimate absolute risks of AF and ischemic stroke based on IAB across clinically relevant subgroups, and finally; (6) to describe the association between IAB and left atrial end‐diastolic volume.

ACC/AHA/HRS — Acquired atrioventricular (AV) block in adults, Class I indications: Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level associated with bradycardia with symptoms (including heart failure) or ventricular arrhythmias presumed to be due to AV block, and is indicated when arrhythmias and other medical conditions require drug therapy that results in symptomatic bradycardia. It is indicated in awake, symptom-free patients in sinus rhythm with documented periods of asystole greater than or equal to 3.0 seconds or any escape rate less than 40 bpm, or with an escape rhythm that is below the AV node, and in awake, symptom-free patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bradycardia with 1 or more pauses of at least 5 seconds or longer. It is indicated after catheter ablation of the AV junction and for postoperative AV block that is not expected to resolve after cardiac surgery. It is indicated in association with neuromuscular diseases with AV block (e.g., myotonic muscular dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Erb dystrophy [limb-girdle muscular dystrophy], and peroneal muscular atrophy), with or without symptoms, and for second-degree AV block with associated symptomatic bradycardia regardless of type or site of block. It is indicated for asymptomatic persistent third-degree AV block with average awake ventricular rates of 40 bpm or faster if cardiomegaly or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is present or if the site of block is below the AV node, and it is indicated for second- or third-degree AV block during exercise in the absence of myocardial ischemia.

### Risk prediction of atrial fibrillation based on electrocardiographic interatrial block [^11191jhP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In a large primary care population, we found that IAB is associated with increased hazards of AF, ischemic stroke, conduction disorder, and death from all causes. IAB improved risk prediction of AF on an individual level when added to a conventional risk model. For many clinically relevant subgroups, the risk of AF among those with IAB was increased to an extent that could guide clinical decision making. For ischemic stroke as outcome, IAB does not seem to add anything in risk prediction on an individual level.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations of bradycardia — symptoms and definitions: Bradycardia can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: SND and atrioventricular block. The electrocardiographic findings in patients with SND are varied and the diagnosis may be considered in patients with sinus bradycardia or atrial depolarization from a subsidiary pacemaker other than the sinus node (ie, ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm, or ventricular escape), intermittent sinus pauses, or a blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence). Sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia (usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest, but sometimes with atrioventricular block). Regardless of whether the bradycardia is caused by SND or atrioventricular block, the term "symptomatic bradycardia" is used throughout this document and has been defined as a "documented bradyarrhythmia that is directly responsible for development of the clinical manifestations of syncope or presyncope, transient dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate". Direct attribution of bradycardia as the sole source of symptoms is challenging, and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue can be multifactorial and therefore difficult to correlate with bradycardia particularly in the setting of modest resting sinus bradycardia or with exercise.

### Innovative approaches to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy [^114g5KqQ]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Normal cardiac function requires an appropriate and regular beating rate (cardiac rhythm). When the heart rhythm is too fast or too slow, cardiac function can be impaired, with derangements that vary from mild symptoms to life-threatening complications. Irregularities, particularly those involving excessively fast or slow rates, constitute cardiac 'arrhythmias'. In the past, drug treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has proven difficult, both because of inadequate effectiveness and a risk of serious complications. However, a variety of recent advances have opened up exciting possibilities for the development of novel and superior approaches to arrhythmia therapy. This article will review recent progress and future prospects for treating two particularly important cardiac arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation.

### Association of atrial fibrillation in patients with interatrial block over prospectively followed controls with comparable echocardiographic parameters [^116WmxDp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Interatrial block (IAB) (P wave ≥ 110 ms) is a potential risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, few investigations have assessed the relevance of echocardiographic parameters, particularly the contribution of its known correlate, left atrial enlargement in this regard. We identified 32 consecutive patients with comparable echocardiographic parameters, such as left atrial dimension and left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients were evaluated for IAB and followed for 15 months for cardiovascular events (heart failure, transient ischemic attacks, and stroke), atrial tachyarrhythmias (AF/atrial flutter), and death. Preexisting AF and IAB (p = 0.02) were significantly associated with future AF events. However, logistic regression analysis indicated that IAB was not an independent predictor of future AF, only preexisting atrial tachyarrhythmias was (hazard ratio 39.5, 95% confidence interval 2.7 to 576.3, p = 0.007). In conclusion, in patients with comparable echocardiographic parameters, such as left atrial size and left ventricular ejection fraction, IAB remained associated with AF after a 15-month follow-up. Additional investigation is needed to confirm the extent of the association.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — supportive details for pacing decisions note that transient atrioventricular block after alcohol septal ablation is observed in approximately 15% to 50% of patients and usually resolves within 24 hours, and most implanted a PPM if complete atrioventricular block was present > 24 hours after alcohol septal ablation with actual time of implant varying with a range of 2 to 7 days. In some studies, persistent complete atrioventricular block > 24 hours commonly required permanent pacing for rate support at 2 weeks, although other studies observed recovery in most patients; permanent pacemakers are implanted in 2% to 10% of patients after septal myectomy usually for persistent complete heart block. Selected patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at risk for sudden cardiac death, with identified risk factors including prior history of ventricular arrhythmias, a family history of sudden cardiac death, unexplained syncope, and a maximum left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 30 mm, and surgical myectomy has been associated with decreased risk of sudden death in 1 large cohort. Late heart block with initial identification > 48 hours has been observed in some but not all studies after alcohol septal ablation.

### Predictors and outcomes of heart block during surgical stage I palliation of patients with a single ventricle: a report from the NPC-QIC [^113r79nC]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mortality in cohorts with a single ventricle remains high with multiple associated factors. The effect of heart block during stage I palliation remains unclear.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to study patient and surgical risks of heart block and its effect on 12-month transplant-free survival in patients with a single ventricle.

Methods

Patient, surgical, outcome data and heart block status (transient and permanent) were obtained from the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative single ventricle database. Bivariate analysis was performed comparing patients with and without heart block, and multivariate modeling was used to identify variables associated with block. One-year outcomes were analyzed to identify variables associated with lower 12-month transplant-free survival.

Results

In total, 1423 patients were identified, of whom 28 (2%) developed heart block (second degree or complete) during their surgical admission. Associated risk factors for block included heterotaxy syndrome (odds ratio [OR] 6.4) and atrial flutter/fibrillation (OR 3.8). Patients with heart block had lower 12-month survival, though only in patients with complete heart block as opposed to second degree block. At 12 months of age, 43% (12/28) of patients with heart block died and were more likely to experience mortality at 12 months than patients without block (OR 4.9; 95% confidence interval 1.4–17.5; p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Although rare, complete heart block after stage I palliation represents an additional risk of poor outcomes in this high-risk patient population. Heterotaxy syndrome was the most significant risk factor for the development of heart block after stage I palliation. The role of transient block in outcomes and potential rescue with long-term pacing remains unknown and requires additional study.

### Relation of advanced interatrial block to risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke [^114rAmZd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Advanced interatrial block (A-IAB) has been associated to atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke, raising the question as to whether such patients, even when still in sinus rhythm without documented AF, could benefit from oral anticoagulation. AF and A-IAB are both markers of stroke. The anatomical substrate in both is fibrotic atrial cardiomyopathy, resulting in atrial electromechanical dyssynchrony, dysfunction, and left atrial remodelling, that favour blood stasis and hypercoagulation. Under these conditions thrombogenic cascade may be triggered, resulting in systemic embolization. Before proposing oral anticoagulation in the management of selected patients with A-IAB, as is currently recommended in patients with AF and high CHA₂DS₂-Vasc score, a randomized clinical trial will have to demonstrate efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in this setting. In the meantime, an individualized approach may be considered based on the recognition of those patients at a higher risk of stroke. These may be elderly patients with A-IAB and several risk factors and, thus, with a high CHA₂DS₂-Vasc score and the presence of environmental arrhythmias.

### Procainamide hci [^113HML3Z]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Complete Heart Block: Procainamide should not be administered to patients with complete heart block because of its effects in suppressing nodal or ventricular pacemakers and the hazard of asystole. It may be difficult to recognize complete heart block in patients with ventricular tachycardia, but if significant slowing of ventricular rate occurs during PA treatment without evidence of A-V conduction appearing, PA should be stopped. In cases of second degree A-V block or various types of hemiblock, PA should be avoided or discontinued because of the possibility of increased severity of block, unless the ventricular rate is controlled by an electrical pacemaker.

Idiosyncratic Hypersensitivity: In patients sensitive to procaine or other ester-type local anesthetics, cross sensitivity to PA is unlikely. However, it should be borne in mind, and PA should not be used if it produces acute allergic dermatitis, asthma, or anaphylactic symptoms.

Lupus Erythematosus: An established diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is a contraindication to PA therapy, since aggravation of symptoms is highly likely.

Torsades de Pointes: In the unusual ventricular arrhythmia called "les torsades de pointes" (twistings of the points), characterized by alternation of one or more ventricular premature beats in the directions of the QRS complexes on ECG in persons with prolonged Q-T and often enhanced U waves, Group 1A antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. Administration of PA in such cases may aggravate this special type of ventricular extrasystole or tachycardia instead of suppressing it.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular block — permanent pacing technique selection by ejection fraction and pacing burden: For patients with atrioventricular block with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 36% and 50% who are expected to require ventricular pacing more than 40% of the time, it is reasonable to choose pacing methods that maintain physiologic ventricular activation (e.g., cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT] or His bundle pacing) over right ventricular pacing; when the expected pacing need is less than 40% of the time in the same LVEF range, it is reasonable to choose right ventricular pacing over pacing methods that maintain physiologic ventricular activation (e.g. CRT or His bundle pacing). In patients with atrioventricular block at the level of the atrioventricular node who have an indication for permanent pacing, His bundle pacing may be considered to maintain physiologic ventricular activation, and in patients with permanent or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in whom a rhythm control strategy is not planned, implantation of an atrial lead should not be performed.

### Rationale and design of the BAYES (interatrial block and yearly events) registry [^114JvzX6]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of interatrial block (IAB) is high in the elderly, particularly in those with heart disease. Despite this high prevalence-and the association of IAB with the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, and cognitive decline-little information exists about the prognosis of older patients with IAB. P-wave duration and morphology are associated with risk of developing AF, stroke, and cognitive decline in elderly patients with structural heart disease. The aim of the Interatrial Block and Yearly Events (BAYES) registry is to assess the impact of IAB on the risk of AF and stroke during 3 years of follow-up. A series of 654 ambulatory patients age ≥ 70 years with heart disease from 35 centers will be included in 3 similar-size groups of patients. Group A: normal P-wave duration (< 120 ms); Group B: partial IAB (P-wave duration ≥ 120 ms without biphasic [plus/minus] morphology in the inferior leads II, III, and aVF); and Group C: advanced IAB (P-wave duration ≥ 120 ms with biphasic [plus/minus] morphology in the inferior leads II, III, and aVF). Patients will be managed according to current recommendations. The 2 primary endpoints are defined as (1) AF duration > 5 minutes and documented in any form of electrocardiographic recording; and (2) stroke. Results from this study might significantly improve the knowledge of IAB and its impact on the outcome of elderly patients with heart disease and could open the door to the use of anticoagulation therapy in some elderly patients with IAB.

Results

Study Population

The study population consisted of 7 patients with inter/intra‐atrial dissociation and pseudo‐atrioventricular conduction block or pseudo‐VT. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. The mean age of the patients was 56 ± 12 years, and 3 (42.9%) patients were male. All patients underwent biatrial maze procedures, and 4 patients (patients 2, 3, 4, 6) underwent mitral valve repair/replacement with or without aortic valve surgery as a result of rheumatic valvular heart disease. Two patients underwent valvular repairs because of mitral regurgitation with chordae rupture (patient 1) or aortic regurgitation with annuloaortic ectasia (patient 5). One patient (patient 7) with a previous correction of tetralogy of Fallot and an atrial septal defect underwent mitral valve replacement and maze procedure because of mitral regurgitation and AF, and received a permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation on postoperative day 9 for a third‐degree atrioventricular block.

Baseline Demographic and Echocardiographic Characteristics of the Patients

Electrocardiographic Findings

Table 2 summarizes the electrocardiographic and electrophysiological findings of the study subjects. Among the 7 patients, 6 (all but patient 6) showed apparent complete atrioventricular blocks with small but distinct P waves dissociated from the QRS complexes (Figures 1A, 2A, and Figures S1 A‐D). In patient 1, junctional rhythm during complete atrioventricular block intermittently accelerated at heart rates faster than 70 to 80 beats per minute. In patient 2, AF with slow bigeminal junctional rhythm (Figure 2B) alternating with a rapid ventricular response (Figure 2C) was documented. In patients 3 and 6, paroxysmal atrioventricular blocks with nonconducted P waves were documented during Holter monitoring, and these findings were correlated with their symptoms such as dizziness or presyncope (Figure 3A and Figure S1 F). Patient 6 showed 2 distinct, dissociated P waves: 1 had a lower amplitude and was associated with the QRS complex, and the other had a higher amplitude and was dissociated from the QRS complex (Figure S1 E). Patient 7 was admitted for the evaluation of an apparent VT (rapid sensed ventricular activity dissociated from slow atrial activity), which was documented during pacemaker interrogation.

Figure 1.
Management of postoperative bradycardia. EMB indicates endomyocardial biopsy; EPS, electrophysiology study; HR, heart rate; IV, intravenous; and PPI, permanent pacemaker implantation. * Severe rejection is a relatively rare cause of bradycardia, and drug effects should be ruled out as a cause. # Pacemaker is often advised for chronotropic incompetence, especially when functional rehabilitation is prevented by bradycardia.

Figure 2.
Management of symptomatic late-onset bradycardia after HT. In addition to management of bradycardia, it is imperative to manage possible rejection and significant cardiac allograft vasculopathy. * All symptomatic bradycardia should be considered for biopsy and angiography.

Bradycardia was associated with acute rejection in a small series, but larger series do not support this observation.– However, late complete heart block or high-grade AV block has been associated with rejection in several reports and series and is associated with worse prognosis. Progressive first-degree AV block with bundle branch block may portend a poor prognosis and increased risk of SCD. Pseudo AV block can be observed in cases where there is no atrial activity from the donor atria but where atrial activity in the recipient atria gives rise to the ECG appearance of nonconducted P waves.

Many patients may have been maintained on amiodarone before HT. Residual effects of the drug may affect the new allograft and contribute to posttransplantation bradycardia that may persist for several weeks.

Incomplete and complete right bundle branch block are common ECG findings in various retrospective series; a recent retrospective series showed a lower incidence of right bundle branch block of 20% and no association with mortality rate. However, progressive bundle branch blocks on serial ECGs were associated with increased risk of mortality and SCD.

Atrial Arrhythmias

The incidence of atrial arrhythmias after HT ranges between 0.3% and 24% for AF and 2.8% and 30% for atrial flutter. Most large series consistently noted a smaller incidence of AF and atrial flutter. Other arrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, and AV reentrant tachycardia, have also been reported. AF is the most common early arrhythmia, whereas atrial flutter or macroreentrant atrial tachycardia is more common late after HT.

Tetralogy of Fallot — initial surgical repair and postoperative issues in adults include that complete repair is considered in palliated patients without irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension or unfavorable pulmonary artery anatomy and as a primary operation usually performed in the first year of life; adults previously palliated can be considered for complete repair after evaluation indicates favorable anatomy and hemodynamics; a patent foramen ovale or small atrial septal defect is usually closed when complete repair is performed in adulthood; and key postoperative issues include residual pulmonary regurgitation, right ventricular dilation and dysfunction from pulmonary regurgitation (possibly with associated tricuspid regurgitation), residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, branch pulmonary artery stenosis or hypoplasia, sustained ventricular tachycardia, sudden cardiac death, atrioventricular block, atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation, progressive aortic regurgitation, and syndromal associations.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus and higher rate of complete atrioventricular block: a Danish nationwide registry [^116M8m93]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

The present study aimed to determine the association between Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block.

Methods and Results

This nationwide nested case-control study included patients older than 18 years, diagnosed with third-degree atrioventricular block between 1 July 1995 and 31 December 2018. Data on medication, comorbidity, and outcomes were collected from Danish registries. Five controls, from the risk set of each case of third-degree atrioventricular block, were matched on age and sex to fit a Cox regression model with time-dependent exposure and time-dependent covariates. Subgroup analysis was conducted with Cox regression models for each subgroup. We located 25 995 cases with third-degree atrioventricular block that were matched with 130 004 controls. The mean age was 76 years and 62% were male. Cases had more T2DM (21% vs. 11%), hypertension (69% vs. 50%), atrial fibrillation (25% vs. 10%), heart failure (20% vs. 6.3%), and myocardial infarction (19% vs. 9.2%), compared with the control group. In Cox regression analysis, adjusting for comorbidities and atrioventricular nodal blocking agents, T2DM was significantly associated with third-degree atrioventricular block (hazard ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.57–1.69). The association remained in several subgroup analyses of diseases also suspected to be associated with third-degree atrioventricular block. There was a significant interaction with comorbidities of interest including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

Conclusion

In this nationwide study, T2DM was associated with a higher rate of third-degree atrioventricular block compared with matched controls. The association remained independent of atrioventricular nodal blocking agents and other comorbidities known to be associated with third-degree atrioventricular block.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — clinical presentation and diagnostic correlation includes symptoms that can range from mild fatigue to frank syncope, and the severity of clinical manifestations generally correlates with the heart rate or the pause duration. Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia has not been associated with adverse outcomes, whereas patients with symptoms attributable to SND have a high risk of cardiovascular events including syncope, AF, and heart failure. Syncope is a common manifestation, and other clinical symptoms include dyspnea on exertion caused by chronotropic incompetence, lightheadedness, and chronic fatigue; patients may manifest symptoms attributable to sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest or sinoatrial exit block. Correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is considered to be the "gold standard" of diagnosis, but it may be difficult to establish this correlation in some cases because of the presence of competing etiologies of symptoms as well as limitations in monitoring.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113pHCEE]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) mechanisms and pathophysiology — rate characteristics, triggers, and substrate — are outlined as AF is a chaotic, rapid (300–500 bpm), and irregular atrial rhythm. AF results from electrophysiological and structural abnormalities that disrupt impulse generation or cellular connections, often arising from ectopic action potentials most commonly generated in the pulmonary veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA) or from reentrant activity promoted by heterogeneous conduction due to interstitial fibrosis. Atrial ectopy can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistent AF requires a substrate that is either sufficiently large or sufficiently heterogeneous to sustain reentry, and the ECG abnormalities likely reflect a shared phenotype across diverse etiologies.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — pacing mode selection and right ventricular pacing effects: Superiority of atrial-based pacing (dual chamber or AAI) over single chamber ventricular pacing was demonstrated by 4 RCTs, yet another RCT in symptomatic SND found that after a mean follow-up of 8.9 years there was no difference in mortality or in any nonfatal clinical outcome. The risk of developing atrioventricular block after pacemaker implantation within 5 years of follow-up has been demonstrated to be between 3% and 35%, which should be weighed against the additional lead required for dual chamber pacing. Right ventricular pacing has been associated with negative physiologic consequences including left ventricular chamber enlargement, worsening functional mitral regurgitation, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and increased inter- and intraventricular dyssynchrony; a programming algorithm designed to minimize ventricular pacing resulted in a 40% risk reduction of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), and among SND patients with normal QRS duration, increasing ventricular pacing was associated with a higher rate of systolic heart failure hospitalization and new onset of AF; for these reasons it is almost always appropriate to program the pacemaker to minimize unnecessary chronic right ventricular pacing whenever possible.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and affects at least 1% of the population, amounting to 5.5 to 7 million patients with AF in Europe. AF is characterized by very rapid, irregular electrical activation of the atria (350 to 400 bpm), resulting in 1) loss of coordinated contraction and transport function in the atria and 2) irregular ventricular rate and loss of ventricular rate adaptation to increased demands (arrhythmia absoluta). In an ageing population, the prevalence and incidence of AF will increase dramatically in the next decades. Unlike most other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation can usually not be cured. Rather, most patients progress from paroxysmal AF, that is, AF that alternates with periods of sinus rhythm, to sustained forms (Figure 1), even when currently available therapeutic options are applied. This sobering finding is aggravated by the dramatic consequences that AF implies in affected individuals and for society (Table 1).

One of the reasons why AF is so difficult to cure is probably the complex etiology of the arrhythmia as recently outlined in two consensus conferences on AF: AF can be caused by atrial structural damage conferred by cardiac or extracardiac disease and rapid irregular ventricular rate, a sign of natural ageing of the heart, and an electrical accident due to abnormal electrical function of the heart. Furthermore, AF perpetuates itself by altering electrical function of the atria (Figure 2). Unfortunately, all of these mechanisms form vicious circles and are severely aggravated once AF has manifested. Usually, several of these factors have to concur before the arrhythmia develops.

Figure 2
Interdependence of four of the main mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. Each circle represents a relevant factor that may initiate or perpetuate atrial fibrillation (AF): The blue circle represents shortening of the atrial action potential and effective refractory period (electrical remodelling), the red circle focal triggers of AF, the blue circle ultrastructural changes conferred by AF (structural remodelling), and the brown circle the bidirectional damage conferred by left ventricular and (left) atrial function during AF. The pie chart within each circle gives educated guesses as to how often this pathophysiological mechanism will be due to AF itself (black pie piece), genetic predispositions (light blue), a response of the atria to stressors such as hypertension, diabetes, or valvular heart disease (grey), and ageing (light green). In an individual patient (but also in a specific experimental model), AF will be due to a blend of these different factors as indicated by the blended overlap between the circles.

Current management of AF patients

Adequate therapy of patients with AF considers stroke risk, often requiring continuous oral anticoagulation, AF-related symptoms as, for example, estimated by the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) score, ventricular rate during AF, and the risk for AF-related complications. In addition, all conditions that can contribute to AF and to AF-related complications require adequate management. On top of these therapeutic interventions, rhythm control therapy should be considered when AF-related symptoms are severe. The decision for rhythm control is based on individual preferences of the patient and often also considers the perceived risk of AF recurrences.

Potential benefits of sinus rhythm

Potentially, sinus rhythm should be able to prevent the adverse outcomes of AF: In cohort studies, AF associates with death and stroke in the population, and AF associates with worse prognosis than sinus rhythm in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction or in patients with heart failure. The recently published ATHENA trial also supports this notion by showing that dronedarone, an antiarrhythmic drug with additional rate-slowing properties, prevents a composite outcome of cardiovascular hospitalizations and death.

These observations have spurred several controlled trials testing whether rhythm control therapy improves outcomes in AF patients when compared to rate control therapy: At least six controlled trials have been completed and published. None of these trials showed an advantage of rhythm control over rate control, and a meta analysis even suggested a slight benefit of rate control therapy.

### About atrial fibrillation | Heart disease… [^1157CrYK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia.
- Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart. AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- Irregular heartbeat.
- Heart palpitations.
- Lightheadedness.
- Extreme fatigue.
- Shortness of breath.
- Chest pain.

Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib. Risk factors for AFib include:

- Advancing age.
- High blood pressure.
- Obesity.
- European ancestry.
- Diabetes.
- Heart failure.
- Ischemic heart disease.
- Hyperthyroidism.
- Chronic kidney disease.
- Moderate to heavy alcohol use.
- Smoking.
- Enlargement of the chambers on the left side of the heart. How is AFib related to stroke. AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining.

Treatment and recovery Treatment for AFib can include:

- Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate.
- Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk.
- Surgery.
- Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and… [^117HqUtY]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The ECG is the mainstay for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. An irregularly irregular rhythm, inconsistent R-R interval, and absence of P waves are usually noted on the cardiac monitor or ECG. Atrial fibrillation waves, which are small, irregular waves seen as a rapid-cycle baseline fluctuation, indicate rapid atrial activity and are the hallmark of the arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation should also be distinguished from atrial tachycardia with variable atrioventricular block, which usually presents with an atrial rate of approximately 150 beats per minute. In this condition, the atrial rate is regular, but conduction to the ventricles is not regular. The resultant irregularly irregular rhythm may be difficult to differentiate from atrial fibrillation.

3 Despite depressive effects on contractility, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers can be used for initial ventricular rate control in patients with heart failure. Oxygen delivery to the heart is usually much improved once the ventricular rate is controlled. A slower ventricular response rate also allows more filling time for the heart and, thus, improved cardiac output. 3 Patients with atrial fibrillation at a ventricular rate of less than 150 beats per minute who are hemodynamically stable can be initially treated with drugs for ventricular rate control and intravenously administered heparin for anticoagulation. Medical cardioversion or elective electrical cardioversion can then be considered as appropriate. Patients are usually monitored in the hospital while cardioversion is being attempted. However, one study.

Because of the risk of complications such as heart failure and embolic stroke, restoration of sinus rhythm is thought to be preferable to allowing atrial fibrillation to continue. However, restoration of sinus rhythm is not always possible. In elderly patients with longstanding atrial fibrillation, repeated attempts at cardioversion may be counterproductive. The chances of reverting to and maintaining sinus rhythm are lower with longer duration of atrial fibrillation and decrease to particularly low levels when atrial fibrillation has been present for more than one year. When cardioversion is inappropriate or unsuccessful, medication should be used for ventricular rate control, and anticoagulation therapy should be considered.

### Transient heart block-electrocardiographic studies… [^117X3SEF]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study of the heart beat by means of modern instruments of precision, such as the polygraph and the string galvanometer, has revealed the fact that the graver forms of cardiac arrhythmia, as heart block and auricular fibrillation, are much more common than was previously suspected. It has also been recognized that such arrhythmias as paroxysmal tachycardia, flutter and premature contractions, are notoriously transient in most cases, but until very recently heart block and auricular fibrillation were looked on as being nearly always permanent conditions due to extensive organic changes. In 1910, however, I was able to show that complete heart block may exist for years without demonstrable lesion of the bundle of His at autopsy, and similar cases have occasionally been reported since that time. In the case of auricular fibrillation, I have recently shown2 that transient. KRUMBHAAR EB.

### Treatment of acute atrial… [^111z9PXG]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Initial treatment also depends on the course of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation may be divided into acute and chronic forms. There are three types of chronic forms: paroxysmal, persistent and permanent. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is defined as recurrent episodes of spontaneously terminating atrial fibrillation. Persistent atrial fibrillation is defined by persistence of the arrhythmia until cardioversion is performed. Permanent atrial fibrillation is refractory to attempts at cardioversion. Thus, cardioversion is used only in cases of acute and chronic persistent atrial fibrillation and not in cases previously demonstrated to be refractory. Unfortunately, antiarrhythmic medications also decrease conduction velocity, therefore favoring atrial fibrillation, which may account for the mixed efficacy of antiarrhythmic medications in maintaining sinus rhythm.

If the decision is made for a patient to undergo cardioversion, the procedure should be performed as close to the onset of arrhythmia as possible. Sustained atrial fibrillation causes "remodeling" of the atria, including fibrosis and a decrease of the atrial refractory period. These changes favor the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. To quote Allessie. Figure 1. Patients who are unstable during atrial fibrillation require immediate cardioversion using a 200-joule synchronized shock. In stable patients, control of the heart rate often provides relief of symptoms. However, some patients remain symptomatic despite a controlled heart rate. It is often desirable to restore sinus rhythm in these patients.

Unfortunately, it is not known whether restoration of sinus rhythm improves survival, reduces morbidity or even decreases the risk of embolic events. 8 The results of these trials will determine the appropriate role of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation. Sotalol also is not useful for the acute termination of atrial fibrillation, probably because it tends to prolong atrial refractoriness more at a slow rate than during tachycardia. 30 It should be noted that sotalol and amiodarone slow conduction and prolong refractoriness in the atrioventricular node and thus can control ventricular response to atrial fibrillation.
