## Question

what is the most common breast mass in a 20 year old cisgender female patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most common breast mass is in a 20-year-old cisgender female. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and age-specific risk to anchor the pretest probability. Then, I should verify which benign entities dominate in this age range and how often fibroadenoma accounts for them. Next, I will check whether pregnancy or lactation alters the differential. Finally, I will confirm imaging and management implications so the answer is clinically grounded and reference-supported.

> Let me first confirm the baseline epidemiology in women under 30 years, because that frames the likelihood of benign versus malignant masses. The vast majority of palpable lesions in this group are benign, with breast cancer uncommon and often presenting later or under special circumstances, so I need to be cautious not to overcall malignancy here [^1153y2fk].

> Now, I should identify the most common benign entity. Multiple sources consistently indicate that fibroadenoma is the predominant benign solid breast mass in young women, with a peak incidence in the 20–30 year range and a typical ultrasound appearance of a circumscribed, oval, hypoechoic, parallel-oriented mass, which aligns with what we expect at age 20 [^112zBo8r] [^111PTs6P].

> Wait, let me verify how dominant fibroadenoma is in the under-30 population. Cohort and review data show fibroadenoma accounts for roughly 70–95% of benign breast masses in adolescents and young women, with other common entities being cysts and fibrocystic change, so at 20 years old the probability distribution strongly favors fibroadenoma as the leading diagnosis when a solid mass is found [^116YfSoo] [^115erFEn].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions. Pregnancy or lactation can shift the differential toward lactation-specific masses like galactocele or lactating adenoma, but absent that context in a 20-year-old non-pregnant, non-lactating cisgender female, fibroadenoma remains the most likely diagnosis by a substantial margin, and malignancy remains rare enough that we should not jump to conclusions without corroborating imaging and, if indicated, tissue diagnosis [^1147bi2F] [^112zBo8r].

> I will now examine the clinical approach briefly to ensure the answer is actionable. In women under 30 with a palpable mass, ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality to characterize solid versus cystic features and typical fibroadenoma morphology, reserving core needle biopsy for suspicious or discordant solid lesions and using short-interval follow-up as an alternative for probably benign solid masses suggestive of fibroadenoma when clinical and imaging features are concordant [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g].

> Let me reconsider whether I need to add any caveats. While fibroadenoma is overwhelmingly likely, a new solid mass still warrants clinical correlation and age-appropriate imaging because rare malignancies can occur in young women, and definitive diagnosis rests on concordant clinical, imaging, and, when necessary, histopathologic assessment rather than assumptions based on age alone [^1153y2fk] [^116VBFXx].

> Bottom line, after checking the epidemiology and imaging literature, the most common breast mass in a 20-year-old cisgender female is a fibroadenoma, reflecting the benign predominance of breast lesions in women under 30 and the specific age-related peak of fibroadenoma occurrence in early adulthood [^112zBo8r] [^111PTs6P] [^116YfSoo].

---

The most common breast mass in a 20-year-old cisgender female is a **fibroadenoma**, a benign, hormone-sensitive tumor that typically presents as a firm, mobile, painless lump. It accounts for about 68–77% of breast biopsies in this age group and is best evaluated with **ultrasound as first-line imaging** [^114st56g] [^115JBhqQ]. Most fibroadenomas are managed conservatively with clinical observation or ultrasound follow-up, reserving biopsy or excision for large, rapidly growing, or atypical lesions [^114st56g] [^116nSSmy].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical presentation

Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast mass in young women, particularly ages 15–35, with a peak incidence around **20–30 years** [^112zBo8r] [^111PTs6P]. They are well-circumscribed, firm, mobile, and usually painless, often discovered incidentally or during self-examination. Hormonal influences — especially estrogen and progesterone — contribute to their development and growth [^112zBo8r].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical breast examination

On examination, fibroadenomas are typically firm, smooth, well-circumscribed, and freely mobile, with no associated skin changes or nipple discharge [^111PTs6P].

---

### Imaging

Ultrasound is the **preferred initial imaging modality** for women under 30 because of its high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing solid from cystic lesions and for characterizing fibroadenomas [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g]. Mammography is generally not recommended for initial evaluation in this age group due to low sensitivity and radiation exposure concerns [^115JBhqQ].

---

### Biopsy

Core needle biopsy is indicated for lesions with atypical imaging features, rapid growth, or clinical suspicion of malignancy. It provides definitive histopathological confirmation and helps differentiate fibroadenoma from other solid masses, such as phyllodes tumors [^1126a3aR].

---

## Management

Most fibroadenomas are managed conservatively with **clinical observation and periodic ultrasound follow-up** [^112zBo8r]. Indications for surgical excision include:

- Rapid growth (> 20% increase in size within 6 months)
- Size > 3 cm (giant fibroadenoma)
- Patient preference or cosmetic concerns
- Atypical imaging or histopathological features

---

## Prognosis

Fibroadenomas have an excellent prognosis, with a very low risk of malignant transformation (< 0.1%) [^11442YuA]. Most remain stable or regress spontaneously, particularly after menopause or cessation of hormonal influence [^112zBo8r].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While fibroadenoma is the most common breast mass in this age group, other benign and malignant conditions must be considered:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Imaging features** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fibroadenoma | Firm, mobile, painless | Well-circumscribed, hypoechoic mass | Observation or excision |
| Breast cyst | Soft, fluctuant, tender | Anechoic lesion with posterior enhancement | Aspiration or observation |
| Phyllodes tumor | Rapidly growing, large | Solid, well-circumscribed, heterogeneous | Surgical excision |
| Breast carcinoma | Hard, irregular, fixed | Irregular, hypoechoic mass with ill-defined margins | Surgical excision, chemotherapy, radiotherapy |
| Lactating adenoma | Painless, firm | Well-circumscribed, hypoechoic mass | Observation or excision |

---

## Conclusion

The most common breast mass in a 20-year-old cisgender female is a **fibroadenoma**, a benign, hormone-sensitive tumor with characteristic clinical and imaging features. Ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality, and most cases are managed conservatively with observation or surgical excision if indicated [^112zBo8r] [^115JBhqQ] [^115XzghT].

Gender-Affirming Top Surgery

Gender-affirming top surgery always included glandular excision (Figs. 3, 4). No patients were treated with liposuction alone. The procedure was performed using the same methods used for cisgender gynecomastia patients, with the exception that no patient was treated with a circumareolar skin resection. Patients with more developed, pendulous breasts were treated with liposuction-assisted vertical mammaplasties (Fig. 5), without drains. Patients were advised that they could assess the degree of breast mound reduction and return for a second stage liposuction procedure for additional contour reduction (Fig. 6).

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^112wdTmg]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Presentation and screening context across resource settings notes that ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, stage III or IV, and that all women are at risk for ovarian cancer with higher-than-population risk among women with genetic predisposition; personal or family history of breast, ovarian, or colon cancer; infertility; and advancing age. There is currently no reliable screening method or primary prevention available for ovarian cancer in any setting; therefore, most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed on the basis of symptomatic presentation with the majority at advanced stages across all resource settings. In basic settings, chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound are typically the only imaging modalities available, and women with ovarian cancer report nonspecific symptoms that may be overlooked or misdiagnosed by primary care providers and contribute to delay in diagnosis.

### Evaluating breast masses in women younger than 40… [^113Zbu6q]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Patients included in the study were women younger than 40 years of age who were identified as having a breast mass. A mass was considered clinically benign if the borders were well-circumscribed and the lesion was mobile and firm. A breast mass was considered suspicious if it was hard, had irregular borders and was poorly mobile. The women were referred to one of four surgeons for further evaluation. Patients who underwent a biopsy before surgical evaluation were excluded. Outcome information, including the use of imaging studies and biopsy results, was obtained by follow-up chart review. A total of 605 patients were studied. The mean age of these women was 29 years. A family history of breast cancer was reported by 33 percent of patients. In 484 women, the mass was found during self-examination or was an incidental finding. In 121 patients, the mass was found by a primary care physician.

Surgical examination determined that 176 of the 484 patient-detected masses were clinically significant and that 35 of the 121 masses detected by a primary care physician were found to be dominant breast masses. This difference was not significant. A total of 196 breast biopsies and 15 fine-needle aspirations were performed in the patients whose masses were confirmed by a surgeon. Carcinoma was found in 28 patients, including 22 of the patient-detected masses and six of the physician-detected masses. Fibroadenoma was the most frequent benign diagnosis in both groups. Breast cysts were rarely found on biopsy, accounting for 0. 8 percent of masses found by physicians and
2. 9 percent of those found by patients.

In evaluating the use of breast imaging studies, the authors obtained 301 studies, including mammography, ultrasonography, or both, that were performed in 438 patients who had either a normal breast examination or a mass thought to be benign on examination by the surgeon. Abnormal results were noted in 112 of the imaging studies; however, the majority of these were considered of low suspicion and required only six-month follow-up. In most patients, physician follow-up is all that is necessary. If there is clinical uncertainty in patients younger than 40 years, an ultrasound examination to determine if a mass is present is the appropriate imaging procedure.

A 9-year-old premenarchal female presented to pediatric dermatology with a 6-month history of periodically tender, bilateral and symmetric axillary masses. Magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent surgical excision confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral accessory axillary breast tissue. Accessory axillary breast tissue is a rare condition seen most in pubertal, pregnant and breastfeeding women. However, it can arise in pre-adolescent patients and should be added to the differential diagnosis of an axillary mass.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPalpable breast Masses [^115HQ2DZ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy and the second leading cause of female cancer death in the United States. Although the majority of palpable breast lumps are benign, a new palpable breast mass is a common presenting sign of breast cancer. Any woman presenting with a palpable lesion should have a thorough clinical breast examination, but because many breast masses may not exhibit distinctive physical findings, imaging evaluation is necessary in almost all cases to characterize the palpable lesion. Recommended imaging options in the context of a palpable mass include diagnostic mammography and targeted-breast ultrasound and are dependent on patient age and degree of radiologic suspicion as detailed in the document Variants. There is little role for advanced technologies such as MRI, positron emission mammography, or molecular breast imaging in the evaluation of a palpable mass. When a suspicious finding is identified, biopsy is indicated. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation of palpable breast masses [^114eGvcP]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Palpable breast masses are common and usually benign, but efficient evaluation and prompt diagnosis are necessary to rule out malignancy. A thorough clinical breast examination, imaging, and tissue sampling are needed for a definitive diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration is fast, inexpensive, and accurate, and it can differentiate solid and cystic masses. However, physicians must have adequate training to perform this procedure. Mammography screens for occult malignancy in the same and contralateral breast and can detect malignant lesions in older women; it is less sensitive in women younger than 40 years. Ultrasonography can detect cystic masses, which are common, and may be used to guide biopsy techniques. Tissue specimens obtained with core-needle biopsy allow histologic diagnosis, hormone-receptor testing, and differentiation between in situ and invasive disease. Core-needle biopsy is more invasive than fine-needle aspiration, requires more training and experience, and frequently requires imaging guidance. After the clinical breast examination is performed, the evaluation depends largely on the patient's age and examination characteristics, and the physician's experience in performing fine-needle aspiration.

### Common breast problems [^116VBFXx]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Palpable breast masses, mastalgia, and nipple discharge are commonly encountered symptoms in outpatient practice, causing significant patient anxiety and precipitating medical consultation. The initial workup includes a detailed clinical history and physical examination. Women presenting with a breast mass will require imaging and further assessment to exclude cancer. Diagnostic mammography is usually preferred, but ultrasonography is more sensitive in women younger than 30 years. Any suspicious mass detected on physical examination, mammography, or ultrasonography should undergo biopsy. In most cases, a core needle biopsy should be performed with imaging guidance for evaluation of a suspicious mass. Mastalgia is usually not an indication of underlying malignancy. Oral contraceptives, hormone therapy, some psychotropic drugs, and some cardiovascular agents have been associated with mastalgia. Focal breast pain should be evaluated with diagnostic imaging. Targeted ultrasonography localized to discrete areas of the breast can be used alone to evaluate focal breast pain in women younger than 30 years, and as an adjunct to mammography in women 30 years and older. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as diclofenac, are a first-line treatment option. The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with nipple discharge is classification of the discharge as pathologic or physiologic. Nipple discharge is classified as pathologic if it is spontaneous, bloody, unilateral, or associated with a breast mass. Patients with pathologic discharge should undergo diagnostic imaging. Galactorrhea is the most common cause of physiologic discharge not associated with pregnancy or lactation. It occurs as a result of an endocrinopathy (hyperprolactinemia or thyroid dysfunction) or from the use of dopamine-inhibiting medications.

### Diagnostic and treatment considerations when newly diagnosed breast cancer coincides with pregnancy: a case report and review of literature [^113C3g1m]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy associated with pregnancy and is a rare but well-recognized complication. It is hypothesized that as more women continue to delay childbearing, the incidence of breast cancer in pregnancy will increase. Because of the lack of clinical experience with breast cancer in the setting of pregnancy, given its relative infrequency, many patients and physicians believe the diagnosis puts the life of the mother at odds with that of the fetus, but available data suggest that termination of the pregnancy does not improve the outcome for pregnant women with breast cancer. Often diagnosis is delayed because neither patient nor physician suspects malignancy. This report presents a recent case of a young primigravid woman with a newly appreciated breast mass seen at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine as a means of discussing diagnostic considerations, therapeutic options, and supportive care available to the practitioner when managing a pregnant patient with breast cancer.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on palpable breast masses [^115CRwJr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Palpable breast masses may become evident during breast self-examination or clinical breast examination or retrospectively after screening mammography. Because most breast masses do not exhibit distinctive physical findings, imaging evaluation is almost always necessary to characterize the lesions and screen the reminder of both breasts. Depending on age, the primary imaging evaluation of a palpable breast mass is mammography or breast ultrasound. Negative imaging results should not deter the biopsy of a clinically suspicious breast mass.

### ABM clinical protocol # 30: breast masses, breast complaints, and diagnostic breast imaging in the lactating woman [^1147bi2F]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Lactation-specific masses — recurrent or persistent plugging in a ductal distribution that does not resolve with conservative measures is an indication for diagnostic imaging, and lactation-specific masses that require imaging for diagnosis include galactocele, phlegmon, abscess, lactating adenoma, and lactiferous sinuses. Galactocele is the most common benign breast mass in lactating women and may warrant intervention such as drainage. Phlegmon associated with mastitis may have irregular imaging features and may warrant biopsy to rule out malignancy. An abscess progresses from unresolved mastitis in ~3% of cases, and surgical drainage no longer represents first-line treatment. For lactating adenomas, biopsy is recommended to establish the diagnosis, and lactiferous sinuses may present as a subareolar mass.

### ABM clinical protocol # 30: breast masses, breast complaints, and diagnostic breast imaging in the lactating woman [^116xpzAP]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Lactating nipple discharge — bloody nipple discharge may occur in up to 24% of women at any point during lactation and is usually self-limited; however, persistent bloody nipple discharge presenting after the immediate postpartum period should be evaluated with diagnostic imaging. Rusty pipe syndrome is a transient bilateral multiduct rusty brown or bloody discharge in the first few weeks of lactation that resolves spontaneously. Papillary lesions often present with bloody nipple discharge, and persistent unilateral bloody nipple discharge, particularly from a single duct and/or if associated with a subareolar mass, warrants imaging. Pink- or red-tinted expressed milk may be due to colonization with Serratia marcescens and should resolve with antibiotic therapy.

### Pictorial review of common and uncommon pediatric breast lesions [^112JTncY]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast masses in children and adolescents are uncommon, and the spectrum of pediatric breast masses is predominantly benign and different from that in adults. Knowledge of the clinical presentation and imaging features of the various stages of normal development and mass-forming lesions in the pediatric breast can guide a tailored imaging approach and help the radiologist make a definitive diagnosis. Breast development begins during fetal gestation along the embryologic milk lines and continues through puberty as the breast matures through the Tanner stages of development. Normal and developmental variants and benign neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions in the pediatric breast are common causes of concern. Malignant breast masses in children are rare and are more often due to metastasis than primary breast cancer. When clinically warranted, US is the mainstay for imaging the pediatric breast and requires careful correlation of sonographic findings with patient age and history. Breast MRI can be used to further characterize lesions and evaluate the extent of disease. Biopsy should be considered only for suspicious findings and must be weighed against the risk of iatrogenic injury to the developing breast. Given that the majority of mass-forming lesions in the pediatric breast are benign, the diagnostic and management approach should emphasize "first do no harm". Knowledge of the imaging appearance of normal breast development and the spectrum of benign and malignant pediatric breast masses is necessary to make the correct diagnosis. © RSNA, 2022.

### Isolated relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the breast of a young female [^112WhB1K]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old female developed a relapse of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a mass in her left breast after 6 years of maintained continuous complete remission. No leukemic lesions were identified in other sites such as the bone marrow or cerebrospinal fluid. The relapsed leukemic cells in the breast revealed the same immunophenotypes (CD10(+), CD19(+), CD20(+), HLA-DR(+), CD34(+)) as those of the onset ALL cells in the bone marrow. A literature survey found 10 other cases of ALL relapse in the breast without bone marrow involvement, mostly consisting of adolescent girls. Including the present report, a total of 11 cases were analyzed; the onset ages of ALL were a median of 16.5 (range 5–50) years old and the ages of relapse in the breast a median of 20 (range 12–51) years old. Data suggest that, although rare, the breast could become one of the extramedullary relapse sites of ALL developed in adolescent girls.

How and When Should Breast Cancer Screening Be Done?

Data remains limited on how to appropriately perform screening on transgender females. Current recommendations are based on screening guidelines for cisgender women, while considering the differences in these 2 populations.

According to a recent review, transgender female who received a diagnosis of breast cancer tended to be diagnosed at a younger median age (51.5 years) compared with both cisgender female (60 years) and cisgender male (68 years) patients. This suggests that transgender female patients may benefit from screening beginning at a younger age than their cisgender female counterparts, which is typically recommended starting at age 50. However, according to 2 cohort studies in transgender women, the incidence of breast cancer in this population remains low, between 4.1 and 20 per 100,000 patient years, compared with cisgender females, in whom the incidence is as high as 170 cases per 100,000 patient years. In addition, the review by Hartley et al, which included transgender female patients, demonstrated that only 13.6% of patients who received a diagnosis based upon screening mammography. Albeit a small sample size, this rate is significantly less than the 43% rate seen in cisgender women. Thus, although the "Guidelines for the Primary and Gender-Affirming Care of Transgender and Gender Nonbinary People" from University of California, San Francisco generally recommends beginning at age 50, the aforementioned information and the lack of randomized evidence illustrates that it is not entirely clear when initiating screening mammography is most appropriate. Therefore, an informed discussion surrounding the risks and benefits of screening before the age of 50 followed by a shared decision making process may be a reasonable approach to addressing the question of when to begin screening.

Mammography

The most common method of screening women for breast cancer is mammography, either offered by an organized program or in the form of opportunistic screening. In most European countries, mammographic screening programs include all women, with age being the only determinant: screening is offered starting at the age of 40–50 years until the age of 64–74 years or even illimitable if women are in good health (e.g. in Austria) at intervals of 1–2 years (3 years in the UK). Population-based effectiveness of mammography screening programs depend on high participation levels, and the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis recommend that at least 70–75% of a population participates in regular mammography screening. Despite the overall survival advantages achieved with the use of mammographic screening, this "one-size-fits-all" approach is associated with several drawbacks, not least that mammography alone is not sufficient to achieve early diagnosis in the high-risk population. It has been reported that program sensitivities of 86–89% in women with largely fatty breasts drop to 62–68% in the case of women with dense breasts (Fig. 1–3). Considering that about 40–50% of women have dense breasts (heterogeneously and extremely dense breast), this represents a non-negligible issue. Breast density category after performing mammography screening should always be reported since this has important implications for the performance of supplemental and/or alternative imaging methods.

Breast density categories according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) from the American College of Radiology. Depending on the breast composition, four different categories are identified: a entirely fatty; b scattered areas of fibroglandular density; c heterogeneously dense, which may obscure masses; and (d) extremely dense

In the left mammogram (a cranio-caudal and mediolateral oblique projections), extremely dense breast tissue can be observed, and no suspicious findings could be identified, only a typical benign calcification can be recognized in the retromamillary region. At supplemental ultrasound (b) performed on the same day, a suspicious mass up to 3.3 cm could be identified at 6 o'clock in the left breast. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed, and the lesion histologically corresponded to a NST moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma

### Common breast problems [^114UnLSm]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

A palpable mass, mastalgia, and nipple discharge are common breast symptoms for which patients seek medical attention. Patients should be evaluated initially with a detailed clinical history and physical examination. Most women presenting with a breast mass will require imaging and further workup to exclude cancer. Diagnostic mammography is usually the imaging study of choice, but ultrasonography is more sensitive in women younger than 30 years. Any suspicious mass that is detected on physical examination, mammography, or ultrasonography should be biopsied. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, and excisional biopsy. Mastalgia is usually not an indication of underlying malignancy. Oral contraceptives, hormone therapy, psychotropic drugs, and some cardiovascular agents have been associated with mastalgia. Focal breast pain should be evaluated with diagnostic imaging. Targeted ultrasonography can be used alone to evaluate focal breast pain in women younger than 30 years, and as an adjunct to mammography in women 30 years and older. Treatment options include acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The first step in the diagnostic workup for patients with nipple discharge is classification of the discharge as pathologic or physiologic. Nipple discharge is classified as pathologic if it is spontaneous, bloody, unilateral, or associated with a breast mass. Patients with pathologic discharge should be referred to a surgeon. Galactorrhea is the most common cause of physiologic discharge not associated with pregnancy or lactation. Prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels should be checked in patients with galactorrhea.

### ACR appropriateness criteria palpable breast masses [^114st56g]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

A palpable breast mass is one of the most common presenting features of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical features are frequently nonspecific. Imaging performed before biopsy is helpful in characterizing the nature of the mass. For women with clinically detected breast masses, the vast majority will require evaluation with ultrasound. Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging modality of choice for women aged ≥ 40 years; ultrasound is typically necessary unless a definitively benign mass is identified as the etiology of the clinical finding. For evaluating women aged < 30 years and women who are pregnant or lactating, ultrasound is used for initial evaluation. For women aged 30 to 39 years, either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography may be used for initial evaluation. MRI is rarely indicated to evaluate a clinically detected finding. Biopsy is indicated for masses with suspicious features. Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy for solid masses with probably benign features suggesting fibroadenoma. Correlation between imaging and the clinical finding is essential. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria ® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Spontaneous and inherited TP53 genetic alterations [^116eWEeX]. Oncogene (2021). Medium credibility.

Inherited TP53 mutations and The Li-Fraumeni syndrome

How can we determine what mutations in tumor suppressor genes are the initial or truncal mutations giving rise to an expanded clonal number of mutant TSSCs for each tissue-specific cancer? By definition, germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes are the truncal or initial mutations in a TSSC that will give rise to cancer at a young age. Because the inherited mutation occurs in every TSSC type in the body, the preferential tissue-specific phenotypes of the cancers formed to provide evidence for selection and clonal expansion of that mutation in a TSSC shortly after birth. Three phenotypes of the tumors arising in these patients determine the nature of the TSSC that has a functional initial or truncal Tp53 mutation that initiates tumor formation: (1) A very early age of onset of the tumor formation, (2) the tumor tissue type that is produced at this very early age indicates the TSSC and its clonal expansion, and (3) the excess risk of the tumor tissue type in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome patients compared to the general population. Figure 1 presents these phenotypes for tumor tissue types most commonly produced over the lifetime of a Li-Fraumeni patient with a germline Tp53 mutation. Rather clearly, the ages at which specific tumor tissue types are produced fall into three categories: six months to 20 years, 20–45 years, 45–70 years. At the youngest ages are medullary blastomas, choroid plexus carcinomas and papillomas, adrenocortical tumors, rhabdomyo sarcomas, and osteogenic sarcomas. In the 20–45-year old category are breast tumors in females, brain tumors (gliomas and glioblastomas), and soft tissue sarcomas, and the 45–70-year old group develops leiomyosarcomas, colon, lung, and pancreatic cancers. In some individuals with germline TP53 mutations over the age of 70, no cancers are detected over their lifetimes, and the incidence of cancers in Li-Fraumeni patients with TP53 mutations over 70 years old falls to a rate below the general population, which is increasing dramatically after 60–70 years of age. The excess risk for Li-Fraumeni patients to develop a tumor also varies with age and tissue type (the TSSC). From 6 months to 20 years of age there is about a 100 fold excess risk to develop those tissue-specific tumors. From 20–40 years of age there is about a 20–40-fold excess risk, and from 50–70 years of age the excess risk ranges from about 2–4-fold. Above 70 years of age, the excess risk falls to below 0.5 times. The single most common cancer of patients with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is female breast cancer. This mostly occurs in women between the ages of 20–40 years, which is earlier than carriers of BRCA-1 and -2 mutations. It is notable that the tumor types observed at the youngest ages with the highest risks derive from the ectoderm or neuro-ectoderm. From 20–40 years of age, with a high to intermediate excess risk, tumors are predominately from mesodermal tissue, and in the lower risk older age group from 50–70 they derive from endoderm. The TSSCs that derive from these first three germ layers of stem cells suggest that initial or truncal mutations acting first in a series of mutations occur in TSSC that form epithelial and neuro-ectodermal tissue types. By contrast, Tp53 mutations of endodermal derived TSSC are functionally active last in the series of mutations, as observed in colon, ovary, pancreatic, and lung cancers, and confer a malignant phenotype upon a previously benign tumor with several mutations. This is identical to a set of observations made in the mouse experiments of Jenkins and Copeland discussed above. It predicts that the spontaneous cancers with TSSCs derived from endoderm (prostate, high grade serous ovarian cancers, colorectal, non-small cell lung cancers) produce malignant tumors by acquiring a Tp53 mutation late in the process of cancer formation.

### Imaging findings and classification of the common and uncommon male breast diseases [^112Tf8CU]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Spectrum of disease

Benign neoplastic breast lesions

Lipoma

Lipoma is the second most common benign male breast lesion which is composed of mature fat cells and is presented as asymptomatic or soft, non-tender palpable mass on physical examination. Radiologically, lipoma is seen as well-defined, subtle encapsulated, radiolucent lesion in mammography and avascular, oval-shaped, parallelly oriented, mild hyperechoic or iso-hypoechoic mass with thin echogenic capsule in US.

Angiolipoma

Angiolipoma, which is a benign tumor formed by mature adipocytes, thin-walled vessels, and fibrin thrombi, is located typically anterior to the pectoralis fascia within fat tissue. Usual physical examination findings are painless, palpable, generally firm, mobile, and non-tender mass. Typical radiological findings are mass which is composed of mixed fat and soft-tissue densities in mammography and homogenous echogenic mass in US. Moreover, angiolipoma may not have any definite abnormality, in mammography. Differential diagnoses include acute hematoma, focal fibrosis, hemangioma, and malignancy.

Hibernoma

It is slow-growing benign neoplastic lesion arising from brown adipose tissue. The physical examination findings are frequently mobile, painless, palpable, slow-growing mass. Hibernoma is an analogous of lipoma considering imaging findings. Sometimes, hibernoma may mimic malign lesions in different modalities. For example, in positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity, it may be impossible to distinguish it from well-differentiated liposarcomas reliably.

Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH)

PASH is an uncommon stromal neoplasm composed of myofibroblasts with glandular hyperplasia within dense collagenous stroma. It is one of the benign conditions associated with gynecomastia, like as intraductal papilloma. PASH has two known forms: nodular mass-like and diffuse forms. Beside this, it could be seen incidentally within another lesion. Clinically, this benign lesion may be either asymptomatic or may present with focal palpable mass, especially in nodular form. Mammographic findings are "totally or partially circumscribed noncalcified breast mass" or "linear densities radiating from nipple similar to dendritic gynecomastia". Sonographic imaging findings are "solid circumscribed, parallelly-oriented, hypoechoic mass with/without heterogeneity" or "retroareolar hypoechoic area with projecting tubular structures like gynecomastia".

Lactation-specific masses — imaging deferral versus indication — advises that when history and examination by an experienced breastfeeding medicine physician are consistent with a lactation-related condition that the provider is comfortable managing, imaging can be deferred; if the condition presents atypically or does not resolve with standard treatment, diagnostic imaging is indicated. Examples include accessory breast tissue, which occurs in 2–6% of women with bilaterality in about one-third of cases, and plugged ducts, which occur in areas of milk stasis localized to a specific quadrant; if engorgement of accessory tissue does not resolve after several weeks postpartum, diagnostic imaging is indicated to rule out an alternative diagnosis.

### Breast cancer in a 19-year-old female adolescent identified with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^111s3wnV]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is rare in adolescents. In one study, breast carcinoma accounted for 0.02% of breast masses surgically removed in young women. We report a case of breast cancer in a 19-year-old woman who was found to have Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.

Case

The patient presented with a new, hard, nonmobile lump in the right breast which prompted her to seek medical attention. A biopsy identified invasive ductal carcinoma. Genetic testing showed a p53 mutation associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

Summary and Conclusion

Although breast masses in young women are mostly benign, one must entertain the possibility of more serious conditions when a breast mass is identified with concerning medical or physical findings. Genetic testing might be informative for such patients.

### Breast lesions in women aged younger than 30 years: clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management [^1153y2fk]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Women aged younger than 30 years frequently present with palpable breast lesions, breast pain, and nipple discharge. Diagnostic work-up often results in benign findings, including a variety of benign solid masses, infectious or inflammatory conditions, pregnancy- or lactation-related abnormalities, and normal variants. While rare, breast cancer can occur within this demographic, and it is often more advanced and aggressive than in older women. Other rare tumors can present within this patient demographic, including primary sarcoma of the breast and granular cell tumors. A knowledge of the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and management of this spectrum of pathologic entities is crucial to ensure optimal and cost-effective care within this patient demographic.

Non-mass breast complaints — skin conditions in breastfeeding: Breastfeeding women without a palpable mass may present with conditions that sometimes require diagnostic imaging and are categorized into skin conditions, nipple discharge, and breast pain. A number of skin conditions can be diagnosed by history and physical examination and thus do not require diagnostic imaging; benign lesions interfering with breastfeeding, such as a skin tag on the nipple–areolar complex, warrant referral to a breast surgeon, whereas lesions suspicious for Paget's disease, inflammatory breast cancer, or other malignancy require both diagnostic imaging and referral. Montgomery glands serve to lubricate the areola and nipple and attract the infant to the breast through olfactory signals, and they naturally enlarge during lactation and pregnancy and may not have been noticeable before this time (IV).

### Clinical breast concerns in low-risk pediatric patients: practice review with proposed recommendations [^116YkLjg]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fibroadenoma is overwhelmingly the most common pediatric breast lesion. Breast malignancy is quite uncommon in children, most frequently metastatic or hematological malignancy. Core biopsy has largely replaced excision for diagnosis of breast masses in adults.

Objective

The purpose of this study is two-fold: (1) compare utilization at our institution of interventional procedures vs. surgery for breast mass diagnosis in patients ≤ 18 years and (2) propose guidelines for breast imaging and biopsy in this population.

Materials and Methods

We extracted data for all patients ≤ 18 who, between 2004 and 2016, underwent either (a) imaging and/or intervention procedure, or (b) breast surgery, from the Radiology Information System and Pathology Data System, respectively. We recorded age, gender, imaging, procedure, lesion size and histopathology.

Results

We found 1,050 pediatric patients ≤ 18 years who underwent diagnostic breast ultrasound between 2004 and 2016. Of these, 168 patients underwent 199 interventional procedures. One hundred thirty patients underwent 160 core biopsies of solid lesions. Core biopsy pathology diagnosed benign lesions in 99%, of which 84.3% were fibroadenomas (n = 135). One malignancy was diagnosed, B cell lymphoma. Two hundred three patients underwent surgical excision for 266 discrete lesions, and 89% were fibroadenomas. Seven benign phyllodes tumors were surgically diagnosed. No malignancies were diagnosed.

Conclusion

Core biopsy in patients 18 years and younger is well-tolerated, has few risks, and is preferable to surgery in developing breasts, but the goal is to avoid any breast procedure whenever possible. We propose guidelines for pediatric breast imaging, follow-up, core biopsy and excisions.

### One-stop diagnostic breast clinics: how often are breast cancers missed? [^116zfCkc]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

All available imaging performed at the time of initial assessment was reviewed by a panel of experienced breast radiologists, who were aware that the patient had developed breast cancer but not of its side or site. Imaging was unavailable for review in 14 (48%) patients. There were no suspicious features seen on prior imaging at the site of subsequent cancer development in 10 (35%) patients. There were minimal signs of malignancy in 4 (14%) patients (2 subtle parenchymal deformity, 1 small cluster of microcalcification and 1 mammographic asymmetry). The mammogram of one patient showed a small mass lesion away from the presenting clinical complaint that was overlooked at the initial assessment and was designated a suspicious or a 'missed' interval cancer.

The multidisciplinary final case classification was as follows: no delay in diagnosis in 10 (35%) patients; probably no delay in 7 (24%) patients; possible delay in 3 (10%) patients; and delay in diagnosis in 9 (31%) patients (Table 2 and Figure 2). The likelihood of delay in diagnosis was not significantly associated with patient's age or breast density. Tumours where a delay in diagnosis was suspected were significantly larger (mean 33 vs 23 mm diameter; P = 0.03) and had significantly more involved nodes (median of 1 vs 6 nodes; P = 0.03), compared with those where no delay was suspected. Grade and oestrogen receptor status were not significantly different.

### Metformin as a new option in the medical management of breast fibroadenoma; a randomized clinical trial [^111PTs6P]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Fibroadenoma (FA) is the most common benign solid mass of the female breast, with an approximate incidence rate of around 12–25% in young women, albeit the exact incidence is not known. It is most commonly seen in young women between 14 and 35 years old and is much less common in post-menopausal women, but can occur at any age. FA can present as a solitary mass in one breast, or as multiple bilateral lumps, and can sometimes grow to very large sizes. Palpable FA has a typical appearance consisting of a firm, round, very mobile lump; however, in many instances, FA is not palpable and can only be detected by breast imaging. The typical ultrasound (US) picture is a circumscribed, regular, hypoechoic mass that lies parallel to the skin. Both clinical and paraclinical presentations can be atypical and different from the usual image.

The main underlying etiology is unknown, but the similarity of the effects of sex hormones on FA and normal breast tissue suggests a hormonal pathophysiology. Mild stromal and epithelial proliferative changes are seen in FA histology. Women with FA are at a slightly increased risk of developing malignancy in comparison with the general population. Diagnosis is based on histological examination which is available through core needle biopsy of the lesion. Cytological assessment also is helpful but not as accurate. Nonetheless, for a small FA with typical features on physical exam or US scan in a young woman, tissue sampling can be avoided; and the diagnosis can be made clinically with relative accuracy in these cases.

Despite the relative benignity of FA, it can impose a significant negative psychological impact on the patient. Stress about misdiagnosis, probable malignant transformation, or even feeling of fear while touching the lump are not uncommon consequences of conservative treatment.

Metformin (MF) is an anti-hyperglycemic agent that is being investigated for many medical disorders and conditions. One of the probable properties of MF is its anti-proliferative effects on various cells, including breast cancer cells. Also, anti-estrogenic properties have been reported for MF. Because of the estrogen-dependent and proliferative features of FA, and the anti-proliferative, sex hormone-suppressing characteristics of MF, as well as its relatively low frequency of adverse effects, we designed the present study to evaluate the therapeutic effects of MF on FA.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk females, ACR 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2D images) in intermediate-risk females (personal history of breast cancer, lobular neoplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, or 15–20% lifetime risk of breast cancer). Consider obtaining MRI as an adjunct to mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis depending on risk factors. Consider obtaining breast ultrasound in females with dense breasts, taking into account the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination.

### From the archives of the AFIP: breast masses in children and adolescents: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^1175Gqfw]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

The spectrum of breast lesions in children and adolescents varies markedly from that for adults, with the former lesions being overwhelmingly benign. A breast mass in a young boy or girl may arise from normal and abnormal breast development. Other causes of masses include infection, trauma, and cyst formation. After onset of puberty, most cases of breast enlargement arise from benign fibroadenoma in girls and gynecomastia in boys. These conditions have specific imaging appearances, although juvenile (often giant) fibroadenoma cannot be distinguished from phyllodes tumor, which can be benign or malignant. In children, both conditions usually appear as well-circumscribed, hypoechoic masses at sonography and show diffuse enhancement except for nonenhancing septations at magnetic resonance imaging. A diagnosis of juvenile papillomatosis (a benign lesion) portends later development of breast cancer, and patients with this condition should be closely monitored. Malignant lesions of the breast in children are rare. The most common malignant lesions are metastases and are usually associated with widespread disease. The most common primary breast malignancy is malignant phyllodes tumor. Primary breast carcinoma is exceedingly rare in the pediatric age group, but its imaging appearance in children is the same as seen in adults and is different from that of almost all benign lesions. In girls, diagnostic interventions may injure the developing breast and cause subsequent disfigurement. Given this risk and the low prevalence of malignant disease in this population, a prudent course should be followed in the diagnosis of breast lesions. Imaging findings are very helpful for selecting patients for further diagnostic procedures. Although malignancy is rare, lesions with suspicious imaging findings or progressive growth should be subjected to cytologic or histologic examination.

### Imaging and management of fibroepithelial lesions of the breast: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^112zBo8r]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Fibroepithelial lesions (FELs) are among the most common breast masses encountered by breast radiologists and pathologists. They encompass a spectrum of benign and malignant lesions, including fibroadenomas (FAs) and phyllodes tumors (PTs). FAs are typically seen in young premenopausal women, with a peak incidence at 20–30 years of age, and have imaging features of oval circumscribed hypoechoic masses. Although some FA variants are especially sensitive to hormonal influences and can exhibit rapid growth (eg, juvenile FA and lactational adenomas), most simple FAs are slow growing and involute after menopause. PTs can be benign, borderline, or malignant and are more common in older women aged 40–50 years. PTs usually manifest as enlarging palpable masses and are associated with a larger size and sometimes with an irregular shape at imaging compared with FAs. Although FA and FA variants are typically managed conservatively unless large and symptomatic, PTs are surgically excised because of the risk of undersampling at percutaneous biopsy and the malignant potential of borderline and malignant PTs. As a result of the overlap in imaging and histologic appearances, FELs can present a diagnostic challenge for the radiologist and pathologist. Radiologists can facilitate accurate diagnosis by supplying adequate tissue sampling and including critical information for the pathologist at the time of biopsy. Understanding the spectrum of FELs can facilitate and guide appropriate radiologic-pathologic correlation and timely diagnosis and management of PTs. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

Chest/breast feeding in transgender men and TGD AFAB — in limited studies, the majority who chose to chest/breast feed postpartum were successful with induction supported by preconception counseling and experienced lactation nursing support; patients using testosterone should be informed that testosterone does pass through chest/breast milk although quantities are small and that the impact on the developing neonate/child is unknown, therefore gender-affirming testosterone use is not recommended during lactation but may be resumed after discontinuation of chest/breast feeding; individuals may experience undesired chest growth and/or lactation even after chest reconstruction and should be supported if they desire to suppress lactation.

### Primum non nocere: utility and outcomes of pediatric breast ultrasound [^111gMfts]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the use and outcomes of ultrasound for the evaluation of breast signs and symptoms in pediatric females.

Methods

A retrospective database review identified all patients ≤ 18-years-old who underwent breast ultrasound at an academic institution over a 20-year period. Each symptomatic site was designated a case and analyses were performed on each case. Imaging findings were obtained from the radiology reports. Clinical and pathology data were obtained from the medical records. Descriptive statistics were performed.

Results

The final cohort comprised 124 cases in 101 patients. Mean age was 15 years (range 1–18). The most common indication for ultrasound was a palpable lump (71%). Thirty-seven cases (30%) demonstrated no sonographic correlate to the symptom; 36 (29%) had a benign correlate. The most common benign correlates were abscess/phlegmon and cyst. All cases of abscess/phlegmon had infectious symptoms. Fifty-one cases (41%) demonstrated a sonographic mass that was not characteristically benign. Of these indeterminate masses, 27 were recommended for biopsy, 13 for short-interval follow-up, and 6 had no recommendation. Of 27 biopsied masses, 63% were fibroadenomas. No symptoms were due to malignancy. Therefore, the NPV of ultrasound was 100% and the PPV 0%.

Conclusion

In this cohort of pediatric and adolescent patients, malignancy was never the cause of breast symptoms. Imaging yielded false positives with a biopsy recommendation in 22% of cases. Ultrasound provided value in evaluating infectious symptoms. Given the extreme rarity of breast cancer in this population, surveillance may be a safe alternative for most indeterminate lesions.

Transmasculine lactation considerations — including hormonal therapy, chest binding, and prior chest surgery — are outlined as follows: Trans men who are gestational parents generally must suspend testosterone therapy during pregnancy and this suspension may be continued in the postpartum period if lactation is desired; chest binding may result in compression atrophy, worsen engorgement, or lower milk supply; and trans men who have undergone "top" surgery may or may not have the ability to lactate, with outcomes influenced by surgical technique (e.g., resection vs preservation of the nipple areolar complex) and the likelihood of ductal regeneration when the nipple is completely removed and reattached. Modern NAC tattooing techniques are cosmetic only, and the document notes that any treatment altering the hormonal milieu of trans patients may increase gender dysphoria, emphasizing support for decisions to resume gender-affirming hormones after birth, including decisions not to lactate.

Positioning and supplementation — techniques for latch challenges and low milk supply specify practical adaptations. Positioning of infants for trans men who have had "top" surgery may also be higher on the parent's body, as there will generally be no pendulousness to the chest, and additional pillows may be needed. For patients with low milk supply, a supplemental feeding tube attached to a bottle, syringe, or specific supplemental device with human milk or artificial human milk substitute (infant formula) may be applied to provide nutrition to the infant at the same time as stimulation and milk transfer from the parent. The end of the feeding tube should reach the nipple tip, and the tube may be secured by tape to the chest wall; such a tube may be used inside or outside of a nipple shield. There is no published evidence on the best methods of use for these devices.

Table 1 — most common breast masses diagnosed during lactation — diagnostic considerations are summarized as follows: Lactating adenoma — Core needle biopsy recommended to establish diagnosis. Galactocele — Aspiration of milky fluid can confirm the diagnosis and is at risk for infection due to milk stasis, so may mimic abscess. Phlegmon — May or may not have antecedent and/or concomitant infectious symptoms (e.g., erythema). Abscess — Aspiration or drainage of purulent material can confirm the diagnosis. Fibroadenoma — Core needle biopsy is recommended for lesions > 2–3 cm to rule out Phyllodes tumor, significant growth rate, and/or discordance between clinical and radiographic findings. Breast cancer — Core needle biopsy, image guided in the case of nonpalpable cancers, is required for diagnosis and pathologic staging, and in the case of an equivocal percutaneous biopsy, surgical biopsy may be required.

Methods

Study population

The GUTS cohort (founding PI, Dr. Colditz) includes 9031 females from 50 states (in the US) who are daughters of participants in the NHSII. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. The participants' mothers provided written informed consent, and their 9–15-year-old daughters assented by completing baseline questionnaires in 1996. The cohort returned questionnaires (by mail on paper or on the Internet) annually beginning in 1996–2001, then in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. The response rate for follow-ups (≥ 1) after baseline is 97%. Most (95%) of our participants are white/non-Hispanic.

Benign breast disease

Our surveys, beginning in year 2005 and through 2014, inquired "Has a health care provider ever diagnosed you as having benign breast disease?" and whether it had been "Confirmed by breast biopsy". A total of 7362 participants (when aged 18–32 years) reported that a health care provider had ever (n = 385) or never diagnosed them with BBD and whether their diagnosis had been confirmed by breast biopsy (n = 173). Six girls, whose mothers reported childhood cancer in them, were excluded from our BBD groups, as were those whose BBD was not confirmed by biopsy. The remaining 6971 females who returned surveys during this period but never reported any BBD diagnosis became our "non-cases" for comparison with those having biopsy-confirmed BBD (n = 173).

Most of these cases of biopsy-confirmed BBD were probably diagnosed because participants, or their physicians, found a clinically palpable mass, which was subsequently biopsied. Screening mammography is not offered in this young population. In young women, the most common BBD is fibroadenoma (almost 70% of benign lesions), with the others being mostly cysts and fibrocystic changes. Among women (N = 621) in the NHSII, a validation study found 95% accuracy for self-reported biopsy-confirmed BBD.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® palpable breast masses: 2022 update [^115JBhqQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Palpable masses in women are the most common symptom associated with breast cancer. This document reviews and evaluates the current evidence for imaging recommendations of palpable masses in women less than 30 to over 40 years of age. There is also a review of several different scenarios and recommendations after initial imaging. Ultrasound is usually the appropriate initial imaging for women under 30 years of age. If ultrasound findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy (BIRADS 4 or 5), it is usually appropriate to continue with diagnostic tomosynthesis or mammography with image-guided biopsy. No further imaging is recommended if the ultrasound is benign or negative. The patient under 30 years of age with a probably benign ultrasound may undergo further imaging; however, the clinical scenario plays a role in the decision to biopsy. For women between 30 to 39 years of age, ultrasound, diagnostic mammography, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound are usually appropriate. Diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis are the appropriate initial imaging for women 40 years of age or older, as ultrasound may be appropriate if the patient had a negative mammogram within 6 months of presentation or immediately after mammography findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy. If the diagnostic mammogram, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound findings are probably benign, no further imaging is necessary unless the clinical scenario indicates a biopsy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Imaging evaluation and management of breast symptoms in the pediatric population [^1164igJJ]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical approach, differential diagnosis, diagnostic imaging, and management of breast masses differs between adult and pediatric patients. Breast symptoms in pediatric populations are likely to be normal, variants of normal development, or classically benign. When evaluating pediatric patients, a thorough history and physical examination is key and may include US imaging if clinically indicated. Currently, there are no consensus guidelines from professional societies specific to the imaging evaluation, reporting, or management of the pediatric breast. Inappropriate utilization of additional imaging or biopsy recommendations can cause stress to patients and caregivers, added financial costs, and potential damage to the developing breast. As such, it is increasingly important for radiologists to have a clear understanding of the expected physical and imaging findings for developing breast tissue, developmental abnormalities, benign conditions, and rare malignancies. This review summarizes the expected normal developmental breast changes in the pediatric population as well as common anatomic variants. Both benign and rare malignant breast pathologies are reviewed with a discussion about clinical presentation and management to guide breast imaging trainees and practicing radiologists.

### Pediatric and adolescent breast masses: a review of pathophysiology, imaging, diagnosis, and treatment [^113cTmwK]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Pediatric breast masses are relatively rare and most are benign. Most are either secondary to normal developmental changes or neoplastic processes with a relatively benign behavior. To fully understand pediatric breast disease, it is important to have a firm comprehension of normal development and of the various tumors that can arise. Physical examination and targeted history (including family history) are key to appropriate patient management. When indicated, ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice. The purpose of this article is to review the benign breast conditions that arise as part of the spectrum of normal breast development, as well as the usually benign but neoplastic process that may develop within an otherwise normal breast. Rare primary carcinomas and metastatic lesions to the pediatric breast will also be addressed. The associated imaging findings will be reviewed, as well as treatment strategies for clinical management of the pediatric patient with signs or symptoms of breast disease.

Conclusion

The majority of breast abnormalities in the pediatric patient are benign, but malignancies do occur. Careful attention to patient presentation, history, and clinical findings will help guide appropriate imaging and therapeutic decisions.

Gynecomastia, types, and differential diagnosis

The majority of male breast lumps are benign, and the most common reason is gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is formed by the proliferation of ductal and stromal elements, mostly seen during pubertal period or senescence, either presented as unilateral or bilateral breast mass along with breast enlargement and/or focal pain. Etiology of gynecomastia contains a wide-range spectrum including physiologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, neoplastic, and drug-induced causes. There are three characteristic patterns related to gynecomastia which are nodular, dendritic, and diffuse glandular forms (Table 1, Fig. 4).

Table 1
Gynecomastia types

Fig. 4
Medio-lateral oblique mammograms of gynecomastia types and pseudogynecomastia as common causes of the male breast lump. Nodular (a), dendritic (b), and diffuse glandular (c) types of gynecomastia are demonstrated. Pseudogynecomastia which refers to breast enlargement in men primarily due to fatty tissue without associated fibroglandular tissue (d)

The nodular form is characterized by prominent ductal hyperplasia and cellular/proliferative stroma. Generally, it is the sign of the early (florid) phase corresponding to a duration of less than 1 year. Nodular gynecomastia is accepted as a reversible pathology if underlying cause(s) is eliminated. It is seen as nodular or fan-shaped subareolar opacity in mammography and disk-shaped, hypervascular, hypoechoic subareolar tissue in US.

The dendritic form corresponds to periductal stromal fibrosis and minimal ductal hyperplasia. It is known as the late (quiescent) phase of a duration exceeding 1 year. It is irreversible due to chronic changes and fibrosis. Flame-shaped subareolar opacity which may extend toward upper-outer quadrants is an expected mammographic finding. Subareolar serpiginous tissue with "star-shaped" borders and "spider leg" appearance are the main characteristic findings of US.

### Imaging findings and classification of the common and uncommon male breast diseases [^114w5hzr]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Understanding the histoanatomic differences between male and female breasts has utmost importance for insighting the diversities in radiological appearance, diagnostic algorithm, biopsy procedure, and malignancy characteristics, between the two sexes. Majority of breast lumps in male patients are benign, and the most common reason is gynecomastia. Except for gynecomastia, male breast has wide-range spectrum of pathologies and hosts many lesions which can be classified according to various radiologic and histopathologic characteristics. Familiarity with the imaging findings, histopathological properties, and presentation features of various benign and malignant male breast lesions allows correct imaging interpretation which can facilitate "convenient patient management", "reaching early and confident diagnosis", and "avoiding unnecessary interventions".

Background

A 29-year-old female presented with a palpable right breast mass at a 12-week prenatal visit. She had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Ultrasound revealed a 3 cm lobulated mass, which was confirmed to be malignant by a core biopsy. Postmastectomy pathology at 15 weeks' gestation demonstrated this mass to be a stage T2N0M0 high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma with 0/20 axillary nodes involved. A staging CT scan postpartum showed an enlarged right internal mammary lymph node, confirmed by MRI as suspicious for malignancy.

Investigations

Physical examination, breast ultrasound, core biopsy, mastectomy, CT scan, MRI.

Diagnosis

Breast cancer during lactation — epidemiology and clinical implications: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in their reproductive years and thus may present during lactation, and breastfeeding women are at risk for postpartum breast cancer, which has higher risk of metastatic spread than other forms of breast cancer. Women with postpartum breast cancer have markedly lower 5-year overall survival when compared with nulliparous cases, even adjusting for biologic subtype and stage at diagnosis (III). Diagnosis is established histologically, and management is multidisciplinary and complex, tailored to the individual patient.

### Breast masses in adolescents: clinical pearls in the diagnostic… [^115erFEn]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of an adolescent presenting with a breast mass differs substantially from that of an adult because of marked differences in breast cancer risk and breast architecture. In the adolescent, early clinical assessment and close follow-up are most important, and there is less emphasis on exclusion of a breast malignancy. In adults, 11 percent of breast masses represent breast cancer. 1 In adolescents, only 0. 02 percent of surgically removed masses represent a breast malignancy, whereas fibroadenomas account for up to 95 percent of breast masses. 2–4 The prevalence of breast masses among teenage girls is approximately 3. 2 percent. 5 Common causes include fibroadenoma, cysts, hamartoma, fat necrosis, or abscess. Because the diagnosis of a primary breast carcinoma is rare, the differential diagnosis includes rare metastatic disease from malignant tumors, including rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma.
6.

Evaluation begins with eliciting a detailed history on duration, change in mass size, nipple discharge, precipitating factors, and constitutional symptoms. The presenting symptom of a breast mass or increase in mass size would increase the suspicion of a cyst, fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, or hamartoma. Nipple discharge in a patient with a breast mass would lead to a differential diagnosis of intraductal papilloma, infection, cyst, or physiologic areolar glandular secretions. It is important to exclude a diagnosis of malignancy in an adolescent with a history of weight loss, anemia, fever, or fatigue. 7, 8 The examination includes documentation of Tanner staging, mass location using the clock face, distance from the nipple, and size in two dimensions. This is prudent for monitoring changes over time and communicating findings to other physicians.

The preferred imaging modality in adolescents is breast ultrasonography, which can better characterize and delineate breast masses, differentiate cystic from solid masses, and increase sensitivity while avoiding radiation exposure. 10 Most remain static in size or resolve spontaneously. Clinical observation over two to four months is appropriate. Masses that grow by more than 1 cm, and those larger than 2 cm warrant directed ultrasonography and percutaneous biopsy to confirm that they are benign. 11.
