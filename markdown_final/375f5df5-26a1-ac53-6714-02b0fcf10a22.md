## Question

What is prostate for?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the prostate is for — what its normal function is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the prostate's anatomical location and structural components. Then, I should verify its primary physiological function in reproduction. Next, I will examine the molecular mechanisms that enable that function, including androgen signaling and metabolic specialization. After that, I should consider its secondary roles in urinary mechanics and sexual function. Finally, I will integrate how disease states disrupt these functions and summarize a concise, clinically relevant answer.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical context and basic structure. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located inferior to the bladder and anterior to the rectum, encircling the proximal urethra; it is part of the male reproductive system and contributes fluid to semen, which aligns with authoritative summaries and patient-facing sources. Wait, let me verify the histology: the gland comprises epithelial cells (luminal secretory, basal, and neuroendocrine) embedded in a stromal matrix, with luminal cells being the main secretory compartment and basal cells serving as progenitors; this architecture is consistent with detailed histologic reviews and lineage studies [^82128ee0] [^c47ba759].

> I will now examine the primary function. The prostate's main role is to produce and secrete prostatic fluid, a component of semen that lubricates, nourishes, and protects sperm during ejaculation; this is consistently stated across high-quality reviews and clinical summaries, and it is the most defensible core answer to "what is the prostate for" [^3cec47d9]. Hold on, I should verify the functional components: prostatic fluid is enriched in zinc, citrate, and kallikreins, which are crucial for sperm activation and function, reinforcing the reproductive purpose of the gland [^3cec47d9].

> Next, I should review the molecular mechanisms that enable this function. Androgen signaling is essential: testosterone is converted locally to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5α-reductase, and DHT–androgen receptor complexes drive transcriptional programs that maintain secretory activity and epithelial homeostasis; this is well established in endocrine and urologic literature and explains why androgen deprivation alters prostate function [^680ca4e6] [^ca44c828]. Let me consider metabolic specialization: healthy luminal epithelial cells accumulate zinc, which inhibits mitochondrial aconitase and diverts citrate from the TCA cycle, allowing citrate secretion into prostatic fluid; this is a hallmark of normal prostate metabolism and is frequently lost in disease states, underscoring its physiologic relevance [^aea8d208] [^503c5590].

> But wait, what about secondary roles that patients often experience clinically? The prostate encircles the urethra, so its size and smooth muscle tone influence urinary flow; enlargement or increased tone can contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms, which is why BPH treatments target both static mechanical obstruction and dynamic smooth muscle components [^ea8c39dd]. I should also confirm the sexual function link: the cavernous nerves course posterolateral to the prostate, and their injury during prostate surgery can impair erectile function, illustrating how the prostate's anatomy is intertwined with sexual outcomes even though the gland itself is not the source of erections [^e27f7ed2] [^ea5a41bf] [^fb6d70f1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without integrating disease context. In BPH, epithelial and stromal proliferation enlarge the gland and compress the urethra, disrupting normal urinary mechanics; in prostate cancer, malignant transformation and altered androgen signaling derange secretory function and metabolic specialization, with loss of citrate/zinc signatures and downregulation of secretory genes, reflecting a departure from normal prostate physiology [^ea8c39dd] [^503c5590]. I should double-check that these disease-related changes reinforce, rather than contradict, the baseline function: yes, they highlight how central citrate secretion and androgen-dependent secretory activity are to normal prostate function by showing what is lost when disease takes hold [^aea8d208] [^503c5590].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer. The prostate is a male reproductive gland whose primary function is to produce prostatic fluid that lubricates, nourishes, and protects sperm during ejaculation; this secretory role depends on androgen signaling and a unique metabolic program that secretes citrate and zinc, while the gland's urethral encirclement and proximity to neurovascular structures create secondary influences on urinary flow and erectile function that become clinically salient when the gland enlarges or is diseased [^3cec47d9] [^4885a4af] [^680ca4e6] [^aea8d208] [^ea5a41bf] [^e27f7ed2].

---

The prostate's **primary function** is to produce prostatic fluid, which nourishes and protects sperm, enhances motility, and helps semen coagulate and then liquefy after ejaculation [^3cec47d9] [^f89117b1]. It also **supports urinary function** by surrounding the urethra and helping control urine flow, and it contributes to sexual function via its role in ejaculation and proximity to nerves involved in erection [^e27f7ed2]. The prostate is androgen-dependent, so its growth and function are regulated by testosterone and dihydrotestosterone [^680ca4e6] [^ca44c828].

---

## Primary function: production of prostatic fluid

- **Prostatic fluid composition**: Prostatic fluid is a milky, alkaline secretion rich in enzymes (such as prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), zinc, citrate, and other proteins [^3cec47d9] [^aea8d208].

- **Role in reproduction**: Prostatic fluid constitutes approximately 20–30% of semen volume. It nourishes and protects sperm, enhances sperm motility, and aids in the coagulation and subsequent liquefaction of semen after ejaculation [^3cec47d9] [^f89117b1].

- **Alkalinity**: The alkaline nature of prostatic fluid helps neutralize the acidic environment of the female reproductive tract, thereby enhancing sperm survival and motility [^notfound].

---

## Secondary functions

### Urinary function

The prostate **surrounds the urethra** at the bladder outlet, helping regulate urine flow and maintain continence [^3126369c]. Enlargement or inflammation can impede urine flow, causing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [^ea5a41bf].

---

### Sexual function

The prostate contributes to **ejaculation** by contracting during orgasm to expel prostatic fluid into the urethra [^09317bad]. It lies near the neurovascular bundles that control erectile function, so prostate disease or treatment can affect erectile function [^e27f7ed2].

---

## Hormonal regulation

Androgen dependence means the prostate requires **androgens** — testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) — for development, growth, and function [^680ca4e6]. Androgen signaling regulates prostatic epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and secretory activity [^c47ba759].

---

## Clinical significance

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**: Age-related enlargement of the prostate causing urinary obstruction and LUTS [^ea8c39dd].

- **Prostate cancer**: One of the most common cancers in men, often arising from the peripheral zone of the prostate [^dd939122].

- **Prostatitis**: Inflammation of the prostate, causing pain, urinary symptoms, and sometimes systemic symptoms [^f9be0206].

---

The prostate's **main role** is to produce prostatic fluid that supports sperm function; it also supports urinary and sexual function and is regulated by androgens.

### Functional outcomes of partial prostate ablation and focal therapy: are we managing expectations of a bar set too high? [^173eec78]. Current Opinion in Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate ablation treatments have long been utilized although a recent shift away from whole gland ablation has occurred in an effort to decrease side-effects. Interest in this form of focal treatment has developed following encouraging initial reports suggesting feasibility, safety and favorable quality of life. Data on functional outcomes and limitations are now accumulating that require careful interpretation for educating patients and providers on the realistic outcomes achievable with these approaches.

Recent Findings

Published results of partial prostate ablation provide short-term outcomes using a variety of metrics to estimate treatment effects on identified cancerous regions of the prostate. Validations of these metrics in regard to intermediate and long-term oncologic outcomes are awaited. Functional results indicate short-term effects on urinary and sexual function are frequent although perhaps less severe than whole gland or conventional treatments.

Summary

Outcome measures from prostate ablation have served to partially address some patient short-term goals of treatment and to support the further development of these approaches. More specific data to understand the long-term outcomes, goals and expectations for functional recovery that may be specific to each treatment modality are needed.

Prostatic disease continues to present clinicians with challenges. Although giant strides have been made in the medical and surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia, many fundamental questions about its pathogenesis, progression, and treatment efficacy remain unanswered. Prostate cancer also continues to be an area in which progress is needed despite major recent advancements. Numerous debates that include the value of prostate-specific antigen screening and appropriate roles for each of the numerous therapeutic modalities await resolution. For millions of patients who suffer from prostatitis, a major breakthrough is yet to come. Current treatment regimens for prostatitis remain ineffective at best. Contemporary approaches to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, and prostatitis are discussed in this review.

### The role of the prostate in male fertility, health and disease [^3cec47d9]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ejaculation is a synchronized cascade of events that has the ultimate goal of activating sperm and enabling them to reach an egg for fertilization. The seminal plasma contains a complex mixture of fluids that is secreted from the testes, epididymis and male accessory glands. The prostate gland has a pivotal role in this process, as prostatic fluid enriched in Zn(2+), citrate and kallikreins is crucial for the molecular synchronization of the functional cascade triggered by ejaculatory stimuli. The prostate is the target of a number of common diseases that can affect male fertility at different ages. In both young and aged men, prostatic diseases or an unhealthy prostate can affect spermatozoa functioning and, therefore, male fertility. Consideration of prostate physiology emphasizes a number of points: the central role of Zn(2+) and citrate in the regulation of prostate epithelium homeostasis and in ejaculation; the influence of bacteria-related prostatic inflammation on male fertility; and the potential role of prostatic inflammation in promoting the development of prostatic hyperplastic growth and carcinogenesis.

### The critical role of androgens in prostate development [^adffe303]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Androgens are involved in every aspect of prostate development, growth, and function from early in male embryogenesis to prostatic hyperplasia in aging men and dogs. Likewise, androgen deprivation at any phase of life causes a decrease in prostate cell number and DNA content. The process by which the circulating androgen testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone in the tissue and dihydrotestosterone in turn gains access to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression, largely via interaction with a receptor protein, is understood, but the downstream control mechanisms by which hormonal signals are translated into differentiation, growth, and function are being unraveled.

### Metabolic reprogramming in prostate cancer [^aea8d208]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolism in the benign prostate gland

The primary function of the prostate gland is to produce and secrete prostatic fluid, which lubricates, nourishes and protects sperm. This secretory activity is mainly dependent on hormone signalling mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor. To better understand metabolic alterations in prostate cancer cells, it is important to be familiar with the metabolism of benign prostate cells (Fig. 3). Metabolic pathways have been found to be well regulated and highly specialised inside healthy prostate epithelial cells. Prostate epithelial cells, of which there are three different types (luminal, basal and neuroendocrine), comprise about 70% of the gland and are the main functional component. Specialised acinar epithelial cells, which line the prostate and give rise to the most common type of prostate cancer, acinar adenocarcinoma, accumulate large reservoirs of zinc. Zinc specifically inhibits the action of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2), the enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of citrate, which ultimately prevents citrate from entering and, thus disrupting, the TCA cycle; instead, citrate (synthesised from aspartate and glucose) is secreted as an important component of prostatic fluid. Consequently, to meet the energy requirements for survival and propagation, the citrate-producing prostate cells probably adopt alternative metabolic pathways and restrict other nonessential activities. For instance, studies suggest that citrate-producing prostate cells exhibit high levels of aerobic glycolysis. Unfortunately, extensive knowledge of these alternative and additional metabolic pathways in the prostate is lacking and needs further investigation.

### Differing levels of testosterone and the prostate: a physiological interplay [^a4c0b8f2]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

The controversies surrounding testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) have been addressed in the past few years. Although the androgenic effects of TRT on normal and malignant prostate cells have been studied for over 70 years, little clinical prospective research exists on the physiological responses of prostate tissues to a wide range of serum testosterone levels. The prostate is both an androgen-dependent and an androgen-sensitive organ; active processes are triggered at a 'threshold' or 'saturation' level of testosterone. Despite decades of research, no compelling evidence exists that increasing testosterone beyond this threshold level has a causative role in prostate cancer, or indeed changes the biology of the prostate. Testosterone deficiency has marked physiological and clinical effects on men in middle age and beyond. With subnormal testosterone levels, the potential positive benefits of TRT on factors such as muscle mass, libido or erectile function are likely a dose-response phenomenon, and should be considered differently than the threshold influence on the prostate. This Review will re-examine classic androgen research and reflect on whether testosterone actually stimulates prostatic cellular growth and progression in a 'threshold' or a 'dose-response' (or both) manner, as well as discuss the influence of testosterone on prostate cells in the hypogonadal and eugonadal states.

### The prostate as an endocrine organ: its modulation of serum testosterone [^9a9ca3dc]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Aside from nonmelanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States, and benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common benign tumor found in men. Until recently, its endocrine functions and possible influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis have been relatively understudied. This review summarizes the current understanding of the potential endocrine functions of prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue.

### The role of dihydrotestosterone in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^b739e518]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

This article examines the role of the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the healthy and diseased prostate and considers the implications of the data on DHT for therapeutic approaches to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Development and maintenance of the normal prostate, as well as development of BPH, depend on a functional androgen-signaling axis, components of which include: (1) testosterone synthesis in the testes and adrenal glands; (2) conversion of testosterone to DHT; (3) transport of DHT to target tissues; and (4) binding of DHT to the androgen receptor with consequent modulation of genes. DHT plays a beneficial role in the developing prostate but it can be detrimental in the adult prostate in that it causes pathologic prostate growth. The role of DHT in other adult tissues is uncertain. DHT has not been shown to perform beneficial functions unique from testosterone in the adult male, and it is believed that its fundamental effect is to amplify testosterone's weaker hormonal signal. Increased understanding of the cellular mechanisms by which the androgen-signaling axis functions has led to advances in treatment for prostate disease. In BPH, the 5alpha-reductase inhibitors — the only class of therapy to act at the pathophysiologic substrate of the disease — arrest the disease process, reduce prostate volume, improve symptoms, and reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and BPH-related surgery. The availability of dutasteride, the first dual (Type 1/Type 2) 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, offers the opportunity for rapid and consistent inhibition of DHT.

### Stromal cell interplay in prostate development, physiology, and pathological conditions [^429b197f]. The Prostate (2021). Medium credibility.

Advances in prostatic stroma studies over the past few decades have demonstrated that the stroma not only supports and nourishes the gland's secretory epithelium but also participates in key aspects of morphogenesis, in the prostate's hormonal metabolism, and in the functionality of the secretory epithelium. Furthermore, the stroma is implicated in the onset and progression of prostate cancer through the formation of the so-called reactive stroma, which corresponds to a tumorigenesis-permissive microenvironment. Prostatic stromal cells are interconnected and exchange paracrine signals among themselves in a gland that is highly sensitive to endocrine hormones. There is a growing body of evidence that telocytes, recently detected interstitial cells that are also present in the prostate, are involved in stromal organization, so that their processes form a network of interconnections with both the epithelium and the other stromal cells. The present review provides an update on the different types of prostate stromal cells, their interrelationships and implications for prostate development, physiology and pathological conditions.

### Breast and prostate cancer: more similar than different [^308ddcbd]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2010). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer and prostate cancer are the two most common invasive cancers in women and men, respectively. Although these cancers arise in organs that are different in terms of anatomy and physiological function both organs require gonadal steroids for their development, and tumours that arise from them are typically hormone-dependent and have remarkable underlying biological similarities. Many of the recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of breast and prostate cancers have paved the way for new treatment strategies. In this Opinion article we discuss some key issues common to breast and prostate cancer and how new insights into these cancers could improve patient outcomes.

### Overview of prostate anatomy, histology, and pathology [^252dfd7a]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The human prostate is heterogeneous with regard to its embryologic origin. The two most prevalent diseases of aging males, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer (PCa), arise from different zones within the prostate. The biology of PCa is also heterogeneous and even within a single individual there often exist prostate cancers with varying potential to progress and metastasize. Through careful study of the histology and molecular signatures of both the human and mouse-modeled disease, treatment decisions can be tailored to individual cases so as to optimize efficacy and minimize side effects from therapy.

### The Lancet commission on prostate cancer: planning for the surge in cases [^f89117b1]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer by incidence in men in 112 countries (as of 2020), and accounts for one in every 14 cancers diagnosed globally, and 15% of all male cancers. – Among men, the disease ranks second only to lung cancer in terms of cancer mortality.

The prostate gland is situated at the base of the bladder, and its basic function is to provide the seminal fluid that nourishes and supports spermatozoa in transit from the testicles during ejaculation. Cancers arise in the lining epithelium of the prostate gland: they range from low-grade tumours that require no treatment to rapidly growing, highly lethal cancers. The disease pathways and some of the underlying biology and genetics are summarised in figure 1. The biology underlying this broad range of cancer behaviour, from indolent to highly lethal, is only partly understood. Overdiagnosis of clinically trivial disease potentially leads to overtreatment and harm, whereas late diagnosis of potentially lethal disease is a major, and growing, cause of morbidity and premature death, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Treatment of prostate cancer is determined by stage (ie, TNM tumour classification) and tumour grade (ie, Gleason grading), and also depends on PSA concentrations and the age and broader health of the patient. Gleason grading goes from 1 (low) to 5 (high), although scores of 1 and 2 are now rarely used, and 3 is the lowest grade in clinical use (the system has purposefully not been updated to enable back comparison to historical series). Cancers are assigned two Gleason scores: the majority score and the score for the main minor grade. Cancers can be considered clinically insignificant if at least two of these three criteria are met: the Gleason scores are 3 and 3 (or 3 and 4 if the majority grade is 3); PSA concentrations are less than 10 ng/mL; and the cancer is classed as T1 or T2N0M0 per TNM. All other tumours should be considered clinically significant and therefore to require treatment (dependent on age, fitness, and comorbidities). If a man has comorbidities and a short life expectancy, even rapidly growing tumours can be monitored or offered minimal treatment. Conversely, relatively slow growing tumours in fit, young patients might warrant treatment to prevent harm later.

### Is there any association between periodontitis and prostatic alterations? A systematic review [^4885a4af]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The prostate gland is situated inferior to the bladder and anterior to the rectum inside the male anatomy, constituting an integral component of the reproductive system. Its main role is to produce prostatic fluid, which, among other functions, accompanies and protects the male reproductive cells and is essential in the reproduction process. This organ is susceptible to several aggressive pathological diseases, including benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and prostate cancer, which is recognized as one of the most prevalent forms of cancer globally. These disorders may arise due to hormone imbalances, genetic predisposition, and age‐related factors. Environmental risk factors include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, diet, and infections.

One of the most widely used ways of initially diagnosing prostate diseases is by measuring blood levels of PSA, a specific antigen produced almost exclusively by prostate epithelial cells, whose primary function is to liquefy seminal fluid. Elevated levels over 10.0 ng/mL in the bloodstream serve as a potential indicator of prostate issues, particularly cancer. However, it is imperative to supplement this finding with additional diagnostic procedures, including rectal examination and biopsy, to establish a conclusive diagnosis.

Although diseases of the oral cavity are commonly considered as specific and isolated conditions during clinical routine, there is already substantial data showing that oral health is directly associated with other chronic disorders. Periodontal disease specifically has been associated with several of these pathologies, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease as well as respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. The association between oral and systemic health is increasingly recognized, with periodontal disease linked to various systemic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease. This connection is mediated by multiple mechanisms, including microbial dysbiosis, altered host immune responses, and systemic inflammation.

Periodontitis is described as an inflammatory disease triggered by bacteria from oral biofilms, affecting the supporting tissues of the teeth, that is, the gingiva, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone, leading to tooth loss as it progresses. Environmental factors, such as smoking, alcoholism, diet, and endogenous factors, such as genetic susceptibility and psychological stress can modulate the course and severity of this disease. This progression can be quite aggressive, given that inflammatory response and consequent tissue destruction induce a positive feedback cycle of protein degradation, inflammation, and pathogen enrichment.

### Prostatic stem cells [^f6f3f746]. The Journal of Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Multipotent cells within the epithelial compartment, together with phenotypically 'plastic' mesenchyma cells (stromal stem cells), provide a repository of protected genetic information from which the structure, stability and functionality of the prostate gland can be maintained. However, mere preservation of cells in a non-dividing state is insufficient to provide the necessary reservoir of information from which the structure and function of the prostate gland can be retained or recreated. Rather, there is a constant dynamic interaction, at the level of information exchange, between stem cells (whether epithelial or mesenchymal) and their surrounding environment (both humoral and physical). Thus, with respect to epithelial stem cells, these reside within environmental 'niches' which allow their controlled and limited proliferation while preserving genomic integrity. Similar 'mesenchymal niches' are also predicted to occur, although not yet identified, thus providing the multipotent source from which the full spectrum of stromal phenotypes might be regenerated. Recent data from studies of the haematopoietic and hepato-biliary systems indicate that the potential scope of stem cells far exceeds the immediate phenotypic complement of those tissues within which they originate, being dependent upon their precise environment as well as their genomic integrity.

### The link between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer [^98d1bb10]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer are among the most common diseases of the prostate gland and represent significant burdens for patients and health-care systems in many countries. The two diseases share traits such as hormone-dependent growth and response to antiandrogen therapy. Furthermore, risk factors such as prostate inflammation and metabolic disruption have key roles in the development of both diseases. Despite these commonalities, BPH and prostate cancer exhibit important differences in terms of histology and localization. Although large-scale epidemiological studies have shown that men with BPH have an increased risk of prostate cancer and prostate-cancer-related mortality, it remains unclear whether this association reflects a causal link, shared risk factors or pathophysiological mechanisms, or detection bias upon statistical analysis. Establishing BPH as a causal factor for prostate cancer development could improve the accuracy of prognostication and expedite intervention, potentially reducing the number of men who die from prostate cancer.

### Androgen ablation mitigates tolerance to a prostate / prostate cancer-restricted antigen [^94406651]. Cancer Cell (2005). Low credibility.

To understand the T cell response to prostate cancer, we created transgenic mice that express a model antigen in a prostate-restricted pattern and crossed these animals to TRAMP mice that develop spontaneous prostate cancer. Adoptive transfer of prostate-specific CD4 T cells shows that, in the absence of prostate cancer, the prostate gland is mostly ignored. Tumorigenesis allows T cell recognition of the prostate gland — but this recognition is tolerogenic, resulting in abortive proliferation and ultimately in hyporesponsiveness at the systemic level. Androgen ablation (the most common treatment for metastatic prostate cancer) was able to mitigate this tolerance — allowing prostate-specific T cells to expand and develop effector function after vaccination. These results suggest that immunotherapy for prostate cancer may be most efficacious when administered after androgen ablation.

### Prostate cancer reshapes the secreted and extracellular vesicle urinary proteomes [^d9265c27]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Human urine is produced when blood is filtered by the kidneys. This filtration retains proteins and nutrients, removes undesired metabolites, and regulates pH and water levels. Excreted urine is less than 1% of pre-filtered volume. After filtration, urine is stored in the bladder for minutes to hours before being voided through the urethra. In males, the urethra runs through the prostate, a gland that produces prostatic fluid. Because urine can spend significant residence time within the genitourinary tract, it accumulates bioanalytes that reflect the current state of those tissues. The urine is therefore a remarkably complex biofluid and provides a non-invasive snapshot of both organismal state and genitourinary tissues. Its molecular composition can vary across individuals, and within a single individual over time. Urine has been widely proposed as a non-invasive longitudinal biomarker matrix, and specific DNA, RNA, or protein species have been identified in urine that can serve as biomarkers –.

Proteins enter the urine in two ways: leakage at the glomeruli of the kidney and throughout the urogenital tract. It is believed that the vast majority of the excreted urinary proteome derives from tissues of the genitourinary tract, rather than leakage from the kidneys. Urogenitary proteins can enter the urine via passive release through cell death, through active translocation, and as part of secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are nanosized particles with a lipid bilayer released by cells into the extracellular milieu. They vary dramatically in size, ranging from 30–2000 nm in diameter, and are heterogeneous in their mechanisms of biogenesis, molecular composition, and function. EVs play a crucial role in both physiology and in the pathogenesis of diseases, including cancer. EV and secreted proteomes are hypothesized to be context-driven and tissue-specific, but their presence, population variability, and disease relevance in urine remain poorly characterized.

### The ageing male reproductive tract [^0a8ad229]. The Journal of Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Ageing of the male reproductive system is characterized by changes in the endocrine system, hypogonadism, erectile dysfunction and proliferative disorders of the prostate gland. Stochastic damage accumulating within ageing leads to progressive dysregulation at each level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and in local auto/paracrine interactions, thereby inducing morphological changes in reproductive target organs, such as the prostate, testis and penis. Despite age-related changes in the HPG axis, endocrine functions are generally sufficient to maintain fertility in elderly men. Ageing of the male reproductive system can give rise to clinically relevant manifestations, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer (PCa) and erectile dysfunction (ED). In this review, we discuss morphological/histological changes occurring in these organs and current views and concepts of the underlying pathology. Moreover, we emphasize the molecular/cellular pathways leading to reduced testicular/penile function and proliferative disorders of the prostate gland.

### Imaging the male reproductive tract: current trends and future directions [^fecbd8ba]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The male reproductive system encompasses several organs: the testes, ejaculatory ducts, seminal vesicles, prostate, and penis. The function of this system is to accomplish reproduction. Diagnostic imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, CT, MR imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET), are increasingly used to evaluate the male reproductive tract. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the use of imaging techniques in the male reproductive tract and to discuss current trends and future directions in prostate and testicular imaging. This review focuses on the prostate and scrotum.

### Novel methods for mapping the cavernous nerves during radical prostatectomy [^e27f7ed2]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

The cavernous nerves, which course along the surface of the prostate gland, are responsible for erectile function. During radical prostatectomy, urologists are challenged in preserving these nerves and their function. Cavernous nerves are microscopic and show variable location in different patients; therefore, postoperative sexual potency rates are widely variable following radical prostatectomy. A variety of technologies, including electrical and optical nerve stimulation, dye-based optical fluorescence and microscopy, spectroscopy, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging have all been used to study cavernous nerve anatomy and physiology, and some of these methods are also potential intraoperative methods for identifying and preserving cavernous nerves. However, all of these technologies have inherent limitations, including slow or inconsistent nerve responses, poor image resolution, shallow image depth, slow image acquisition times and/or safety concerns. New and emerging technologies, as well as multimodal approaches combining existing methods, hold promise for improved postoperative sexual outcomes and patient quality of life following radical prostatectomy.

### Stromal androgen signaling governs essential niches in supporting prostate development and tumorigenesis [^8b2c8a59]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

Androgens and androgen receptor (AR) mediated signaling pathways are essential for prostate development, morphogenesis, growth, and regeneration. Early tissue recombination experiments showed that AR-deficient urogenital sinus mesenchyme combined with intact urogenital sinus epithelium failed to develop into a prostate, demonstrating a stem cell niche for mesenchymal AR in prostatic development. Androgen signaling remains critical for prostate maturation and growth during postnatal stages. Importantly, most primary prostate cancer (PCa) cells express the AR, and aberrant activation of AR directly promotes PCa development, growth, and progression. Therefore, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting the AR in PCa cells is the main treatment for advanced PCa. However, it eventually fails, leading to the development of castration-resistant PCa, an incurable disease. Given these clinical challenges, the oncogenic AR action needs to be reevaluated for developing new and effective therapies. Recently, an essential niche role of stromal AR was identified in regulating prostate development and tumorigenesis. Here, we summarize the latest discoveries of stromal AR niches and their interactions with prostatic epithelia. In combination with emerging clinical and experimental evidence, we specifically discuss several important and long-term unanswered questions regarding tumor niche roles of stromal AR and highlight future therapeutic strategies by co-targeting epithelial and stromal AR for treating advanced PCa.

### The progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia: examining the evidence and determining the risk [^57c54730]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is often associated with enlargement of the prostate gland, lower urinary tract symptoms, decreased urinary flow and a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, if the symptoms associated with BPH are left untreated, serious complications, such as acute urinary retention, may ensue. Evidence is emerging from long-term clinical studies to suggest that BPH is a progressive disease, with some patients progressing much more rapidly than others.

Objective

This article aims to explore the natural history of BPH progression from a molecular, pathological and clinical perspective, with emphasis on the key clinical evidence to support the progressive nature of this disease. How our increased understanding of the disease and of the risk factors for BPH progression might be applied to improve current management practices are also discussed.

Conclusion

Strategies to identify patients most at risk and guidelines directed towards long-term management, in addition to short-term treatment, may be useful in helping to prevent BPH progression.

### Prostate pathology: histologic and molecular perspectives [^8de713f3]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The field of prostate cancer research is poised for dramatic improvements in our ability to better diagnose men at risk of prostate cancer and to better predict prognosis and response to treatment. Histopathologic and molecular analyses lie at the heart of these issues. Improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms of prostate carcinogenesis and in determining why the prostate seems to be so highly targeted for cancer development will lead to rational strategies of disease prevention.

### Testosterone and the androgen receptor [^680ca4e6]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Testosterone is a steroid hormone that is responsible for the development of normal male sexual characteristics and function as well as the maintenance of homeostasis among multiple organ systems throughout life. Testosterone production is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis under the direction of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone. The testosterone-bound androgen receptor (AR) is a potent regulator of gene expression and may regulate a significant proportion of genes in prostate cells. Therapeutic modulation of testosterone levels and AR signaling activity can be achieved by several different approaches, with distinct consequences and side effects.

### Finasteride and tadalafil (Entadfi) [^dbc83897]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

What is BPH?

BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland. The prostate is located below the bladder. As the prostate enlarges, it may slowly restrict the flow of urine. This can lead to symptoms such as:

a weak or interrupted urinary stream
a feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely
a feeling of delay or hesitation when you start to urinate
a need to urinate often, especially at night
a feeling that you must urinate right away.

In some men, BPH can lead to serious problems, including urinary tract infections, a sudden inability to pass urine (acute urinary retention), as well as the need for surgery.

What ENTADFI does:

ENTADFI contains finasteride and tadalafil. Finasteride lowers levels of a hormone called DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which is a cause of prostate growth. Lowering DHT leads to shrinkage of the enlarged prostate gland in most men. This can lead to gradual improvement in urine flow and symptoms over the next several months. ENTADFI will help reduce the risk of developing a sudden inability to pass urine (urinary retention) and the need for surgery related to an enlarged prostate. Tadalafil may reduce BPH symptoms by inhibiting the action of an enzyme called PDE5 (phosphodiesterase 5), which relaxes the smooth muscle found in the part of the prostate that surrounds the urethra resulting in the release of the restriction to the flow of urine through the urethra. However, since each case of BPH is different, you should know that:

### Etiology, epidemiology, and natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1ebc084e]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Historically, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has been a major focus of urologic practice and surgery. But a simplistic causal relationship among prostatic enlargement, progressive obstruction, lower urinary tract symptoms, retention, and complications of retention has been challenged by recognition of the incomplete overlap of prostatic enlargement with symptoms and obstruction. The result has been a greater focus on symptoms than prostatic enlargement and a shift from surgery to medical treatment. Therefore, the question can be asked whether BPH per se, the glandular enlargement as it contributes to bladder dysfunction, or hyperplastic enlargement as a biomarker for generalized lower urinary tract dysfunction are concerns. This article addresses these issues.

### Review of prostate anatomy and embryology and the etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^09db236b]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Prostate development follows a common pattern between species and depends on the actions of androgens to induce and support ductal branching morphogenesis of buds emerging from the urogenital sinus. The human prostate has a compact zonal anatomy immediately surrounding the urethra and below the urinary bladder. Rodents have a lobular prostate with lobes radiating away from the urethra. The human prostate is the site of benign hyperplasia, prostate cancer, and prostatitis. The rodent prostate has little naturally occurring disease. Rodents can be used to model aspects of human benign hyperplasia, but care should be taken in data interpretation and extrapolation to the human condition.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of female prostate pathology [^f740f200]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The female prostate (paraurethral glands) is a well-known, yet poorly understood, anatomic structure. Imaging studies of the female prostate, its physiology, and pathologies are still highly controversial.

Aim

To study the anatomy of the female prostate with contemporary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and correlate these findings to clinical features.

Main Outcome Measures

Female prostate pathologic anatomy on MRI.

Methods

Women with clinical signs of function (or dysfunction) of paraurethral glands have been examined with 1.5 or 3 Tesla MRI and urethroscopy.

Results

Seven women aged 17 to 62 years (median 40 years) have been prospectively included into the study. Clinically, one of the seven women reported ejaculation at orgasm, whereas three women presented with occasional secretions independent of sexual stimulation. In two women, paraurethral glands have been randomly found on MRI that has been performed in the diagnostic workup of other diseases. One woman presented with swelling of the external urethral meatus at puberty. In this woman, a paraurethral gland has been found, besides the erectile tissue at the external meatus. Two women reported lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with mainly urethral symptoms (recurrent infections in one and paraurethral stones in the other). On MRI, paraurethral glands could be visualized in six of the seven patients. There was no relation between glandular volume and ejaculation status. In cases where glands or related pathologies could be found on physical examination, there was a clear correlation with MRI anatomy.

Conclusions

MRI has the potential to become the standard imaging modality for female prostate pathology. Exact visualization of this highly variable structure is possible by tailored MRI protocols. This tool can aid in understanding an individual woman's symptoms related to paraurethral glands with an impact on her sexual life.

### Dissecting cell-type-specific roles of androgen receptor in prostate homeostasis and regeneration through lineage tracing [^c47ba759]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Androgen signals through androgen receptor (AR) to influence prostate development and cancer. How stromal and epithelial AR regulate prostate homeostasis remains unclear. Using genetic lineage tracing, we systematically investigated the role of cell-autonomous AR in different prostate epithelial cell types. Here we show that AR is dispensable for basal cell maintenance, but is cell-autonomously required for the luminal differentiation of rare basal stem cells. In contrast, AR deletion in luminal cells alters cell morphology and induces transient over-proliferation, without affecting androgen-mediated luminal cell survival or regeneration. However, AR is selectively required for the maintenance of daughter cells produced by castration-resistant Nkx3.1 -expressing luminal stem cells (CARNs). Notably, Pten loss can override AR-loss effects in both basal and luminal compartments to initiate tumours. Our data reveal distinct cell-type-specific roles of epithelial AR in orchestrating prostate homeostasis, and question the notion that epithelial AR serves as a tumour suppressor in early cancer initiation.

### Metabolic adaptations in prostate cancer [^af7b627d]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men and is a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Among the molecular processes that contribute to this disease, the weight of metabolism has been placed under the limelight in recent years. Tumours exhibit metabolic adaptations to comply with their biosynthetic needs. However, metabolites also play an important role in supporting cell survival in challenging environments or remodelling the tumour microenvironment, thus being recognized as a hallmark in cancer. Prostate cancer is uniquely driven by androgen receptor signalling, and this knowledge has also influenced the paths of cancer metabolism research. This review provides a comprehensive perspective on the metabolic adaptations that support prostate cancer progression beyond androgen signalling, with a particular focus on tumour cell intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.

### Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT): a patient's guide [^4b5af5e3]. The Prostate (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 How does hormone therapy work?

Androgens control the growth, survival, and function of the normal prostate gland and prostate cancer cells. Androgens achieve this control by binding to a protein within the cells called the androgen receptor (also known as AR). How does this work? It may help to think about baseball, with androgen as the ball, and the AR as the glove. The baseball (androgen) needs to fit into the pocket of the glove (AR) to function properly (Figure 1A). Once bound to androgen, the AR can turn on genes that control the production of prostate‐specific proteins like prostate‐specific antigen (PSA), as well as factors that affect the growth and survival of the cancer cell. ADT works by blocking the production of testosterone (the baseball), to keep the glove empty (Figure 1B). Now, taking this analogy further, think of antiandrogens as oranges; they are kind of ball shaped. These oranges (antiandrogens) can get into the glove and block androgen from binding (Figure 1C). Prostate cancer cells need to have androgen bound to the AR — the ball in the glove — to survive. ADT has clinical benefit because it lowers the amount of androgen‐bound receptor below a critical level, which triggers the death of the prostate cell.

Figure 1
(A) Androgen receptor (AR) "glove" and androgen "ball" come together in the prostate cancer cell to function. (B) Androgen deprivation involves getting rid of the androgen ball by shutting off the production of testosterone. Testosterone can also be blocked by chemicals called antiandrogens that are ball‐shaped "oranges" that prevent testosterone from binding in the pocket of the AR glove. Antiandrogens include bicalutamide (Casodex), nilutamide (Nilandron), enzalutamide (Xtandi), apalutamide (Erleada), and darolutamide (Nubeqa). PSA, prostate‐specific antigen.

### Prostate cancer stem cells [^82128ee0]. The Journal of Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Anatomy of the human prostate

The prostate is a complex tubulo-alveolar gland composed of an epithelial parenchyma embedded within a connective tissue matrix. The epithelial cells are organized in glands that branch out from the urethra and terminate in secretory acini.

The prostate gland develops from the urogenital sinus in response to testosterone stimulation. The embryonic prostate initially consists of a multilayered epithelium surrounded by mesenchyma. In a process of ductal budding, which starts at 10 weeks of gestation, multiple epithelial outgrowths invade the surrounding mesenchyma. These epithelial buds form ducts that elongate and branch out from the urethra and terminate into acini. From the 20th week of gestation up to puberty, the immature prostatic acini and ducts are lined with multiple layers of immature cells that express cytokeratins of simple and stratified epithelium. Postnatal development includes a period of growth during the first year, quiescence during childhood and further growth with the testosterone surge at puberty. During puberty, the immature multilayered epithelium differentiates into a two-layered epithelium consisting of peripheral cuboidal basal cells and inner secretory columnar epithelium.

The main cell types discernible within normal, mature prostatic epithelium are basal, secretory luminal and neuroendocrine cells. The luminal or glandular cells constitute the exocrine compartment of the prostate, secreting PSA and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) into the glandular lumina. They are terminally differentiated, and represent the major cell type in normal and hyperplastic epithelium. They express high levels of the ARand are dependent on androgens for their survival. In contrast, basal cells are relatively undifferentiated and lack secretory activity. As their name suggests, basal cells rest on the basement membrane and morphologically they range from small flattened to cuboidal cells. They express low/undetectable levels of ARand are independent of androgens for their survival. Basal cells focally express oestrogen receptor (ER)β and proliferate under oestrogen therapy, but this affect on proliferation is possibly due to ER signalling via the stroma.

Significant populations of neuroendocrine cells also reside amongst the basal cell compartment. They are found in the epithelium of the acini and in ducts of all parts of the gland. The major type of neuroendocrine cell contains serotonin and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Neuroendocrine cells are terminally differentiated, post-mitotic cell types that are androgen-insensitive.

### Anatomy of the prostate and periprostatic region: a contemporary review, from theSpecial series on critical anatomy [^be9bc74c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

MRI of the prostate has become an essential examination in the management of prostatic disease. This Special Series Review provides a clinically oriented update of the imaging anatomy of the prostate and adjacent structures, focusing on considerations relevant to radiologists interpreting prostate imaging, particularly MRI. Fundamental concepts in prostatic and periprostatic anatomy are presented, exploring in depth anatomic structures as they relate to three major clinical contexts in which the prostate is imaged: prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and infection. In the setting of prostate cancer, detection and staging of disease should provide information to allow for disease localization and extent to determine the best treatment strategy-including surgery, radiation therapy, and ablative techniques. For BPH, the size of the gland as well as the lobar origin of BPH nodules are helpful in selecting appropriate therapy. For infection, it is important to recognize potential overlapping imaging features between prostatitis and prostate cancer. Knowledge of prostatic and periprostatic cystic lesions is also important to avoid confusion with an abscess. Radiologists must refer to structures with appropriate anatomic nomenclature to facilitate communication with other practitioners involved in the care of patients with prostatic disease.

### Is there any association between periodontitis and prostatic alterations? A systematic review [^9d04deb0]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The prostate plays a crucial role in male reproduction but is susceptible to diseases such as prostate cancer. Periodontitis, as an inflammatory disease, has the potential to modulate systemic conditions. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association between periodontitis and prostatic alterations.

Methods

The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024614333). Observational studies comparing the presence of periodontitis in men with and without prostatic alterations were included. The search strategy was applied to databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and Lilacs, as well as gray literature (OpenGrey and Google Scholar). The selection of studies and data extraction were carried out independently by two reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed using the tools of the Joanna Briggs Institute, and confounding factors were analyzed using multivariate models, where applicable.

Results

A total of 769 references were identified, and 14 studies were included. Most studies indicated a significant association between periodontitis and prostate cancer, with a higher risk in patients with periodontal disease. Associations with BPH and chronic prostatitis were also observed in fewer studies. However, methodological limitations, such as inadequate control of confounding factors (e.g. smoking, genetics and age), heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria and reliance on self-reported data, increased the risk of bias. Many studies did not adequately adjust for confounding factors, compromising the robustness of the evidence.

Conclusion

Thus, the findings suggest a potential association between periodontitis and prostatic alterations, especially prostate cancer.

### The microbiome in prostate inflammation and prostate cancer [^efa19b08]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The human microbiome may influence prostate cancer initiation and/or progression through both direct and indirect interactions. To date, the majority of studies have focused on direct interactions including the influence of prostate infections on prostate cancer risk and, more recently, on the composition of the urinary microbiome in relation to prostate cancer. Less well understood are indirect interactions of the microbiome with prostate cancer, such as the influence of the gastrointestinal or oral microbiota on pro- or anti-carcinogenic xenobiotic metabolism, and treatment response.

Methods

We review the literature to date on direct and indirect interactions of the microbiome with prostate inflammation and prostate cancer.

Results

Emerging studies indicate that the microbiome can influence prostate inflammation in relation to benign prostate conditions such as prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and benign prostatic hyperplasia, as well as in prostate cancer. We provide evidence that the human microbiome present at multiple anatomic sites (urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, etc.) may play an important role in prostate health and disease.

Conclusions

In health, the microbiome encourages homeostasis and helps educate the immune system. In dysbiosis, a systemic inflammatory state may be induced, predisposing remote anatomical sites to disease, including cancer. The microbiome's ability to affect systemic hormone levels may also be important, particularly in a disease such as prostate cancer that is dually affected by estrogen and androgen levels. Due to the complexity of the potential interconnectedness between prostate cancer and the microbiome, it is vital to further explore and understand the relationships that are involved.

### Prevention of prostate cancer [^58de40fd]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Strategies for reducing the occurrence of prostate cancers will be critical in limiting the morbidity and mortality of this disease. The long latency period of prostate tumors and improved understanding of prostate carcinogenesis suggest opportunities for effective preventive measures. Because androgen is integral to prostatic carcinogenesis, several preventive strategies under investigation target the androgen axis. Epidemiologic and basic studies implicate dietary factors in prostate cancer development and suggest that altering diet may influence prostate cancer risk and progression. Many of the micronutrients with preventive potential have antioxidant properties; cellular defenses against oxidative stresses are likely to be crucial in reducing prostate carcinogenesis. This article summarizes the current status and opportunities in prostate cancer prevention.

### Metastatic prostate cancer [^dd939122]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on prostate cancer:

- **Definition**: Prostate cancer is a neoplastic disease arising from malignant transformation of cells within the prostate gland, of which adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype.
- **Pathophysiology**: Prostate cancer originates from malignant transformation of glandular epithelial cells within the prostate, most often in the peripheral zone. Tumorigenesis is driven by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations influenced by age, androgens, and inflammation. Dysregulation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway promotes uncontrolled cell growth, while genomic aberrations such as TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, PTEN loss, and mutations in TP53 or BRCA2 enhance proliferation, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. Progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer occurs when tumor cells adapt to low-androgen environments through AR amplification, intratumoral androgen synthesis, or activation of alternative growth pathways.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of prostate cancer in the US is estimated at 123–183 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include advanced age, race (African black men, Caucasians), family history, exposure to radiation, UTIs, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, diet factors (red meat, dairy protein, dietary fat), and elevated endogenous hormones (insulin-like growth factors).
- **Disease course**: Prostate cancer typically progresses slowly and is often asymptomatic in its early stages. Localized disease may present with urinary hesitancy, weak stream, or hematuria, while advanced or metastatic disease commonly causes bone pain, weight loss, and anemia due to skeletal metastases. The natural history varies widely-from indolent tumors suitable for active surveillance to aggressive forms with rapid systemic spread. Disease progression is monitored through PSA levels, imaging, and histologic grading, which guide treatment ranging from surveillance and local therapy to androgen-deprivation and systemic targeted or chemotherapeutic regimens.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In men with localized prostate cancer, the 10-year disease-specific mortality ranges from 3% to 18%, depending on the risk category. In men with metastatic prostate cancer, the 5-year survival rate is estimated at 29.3%. In the US, the median survival following a diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is reported to be 25.6 months.

### Dihydrotestosterone: biochemistry, physiology, and clinical implications of elevated blood levels [^ca44c828]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

This review on dihydrotestosterone (DHT) biology and the clinical implications of serum DHT concentrations clarifies concepts that are of importance in clinical practice.

DHT is the 5 α -reduced metabolite of testosterone (T) that is principally converted from T in target organs such as prostate, skin, and liver. Synthesis can also occur from other precursors, but these pathways, although potentially important in some tissues (e.g. in prostate), are minor. Intracellular DHT is a more potent androgenic agonist than T, and its presence in some tissues such as the prostate is necessary for the full organ development and function. Circulating DHT levels are of much less importance than T for optimizing the intracellular DHT concentrations due to the presence of a rate-limiting enzyme, 5 α -reductase (SRD5A; types I and II). Inhibition of these enzymes with 5 α -reductase inhibitors (5AR-Is) decreases intratissue DHT levels and thus, in certain tissues (i.e. prostate), diminishes the agonist action of T, thus reducing prostate size and function. These inhibitors have been used to reduce prostate hypertrophy and the symptoms of lower urinary tract obstruction in benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH). 5AR-Is have been associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer, but they have not been approved for this purpose. Suppression of intracellular DHT levels with 5AR-Is results in reduced levels of DHT in the blood due to reduced leakage of DHT from peripheral target organs and reduced conversion of T to DHT from Leydig cells in the testes.

### Prostate cancer symptoms, tests and treatments… [^fc4617f0]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the U. S. and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths. And African-American men are more likely to get prostate cancer and twice as likely to die from the disease than men of other races. The prostate is part of the male reproductive system that makes semen. The walnut-sized gland is beneath the bladder and surrounds the upper part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration regulates certain tests and treatments for prostate cancer to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Tests to Detect Prostate Cancer A blood test that measures prostate-specific antigen can be used to help with the detection of prostate cancer, although it is not recommended for screening in all cases. PSA is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland.

Other factors that may help to put the PSA into context to better understand the risk of prostate cancer include age, race, family history, prostate size, urinary tract infection or irritation, medications and rate of PSA rise. For men ages 55 to 69, the task force recommends an individualized discussion of the risk and benefits of screening. Imaging of the prostate, such as magnetic resonance imaging, may help with detecting prostate cancer. If the risk of prostate cancer is high, a health care professional performs a biopsy to remove a sample of prostate tissue for examination to determine if cancer is present and, if so, how aggressive the cancer appears. Radiation therapy is sometimes combined with hormone therapy. Androgens, such as testosterone, are hormones that can cause prostate cancer cells to grow. ADT stops testosterone from being produced or directly blocks it from acting on prostate cancer cells.

Hormone therapy may be given to patients with prostate cancer that has recurred after radiation or surgery and is the standard of care for patients with cancer that has spread outside the prostate to other areas of the body. In 2004, the FDA approved docetaxel. This is the first approved chemotherapy drug for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that showed a survival benefit, after years of research failed to find a treatment that would prolong the lives of metastatic prostate cancer patients.

### Cellular signaling by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) in male reproduction [^c92cbd1f]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

The major function of the reproductive system is to ensure the survival of the species by passing on hereditary traits from one generation to the next. This is accomplished through the production of gametes and the generation of hormones that function in the maturation and regulation of the reproductive system. It is well established that normal development and function of the male reproductive system is mediated by endocrine and paracrine signaling pathways. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), their receptors (FGFRs), and signaling cascades have been implicated in a diverse range of cellular processes including: proliferation, apoptosis, cell survival, chemotaxis, cell adhesion, motility, and differentiation. The maintenance and regulation of correct FGF signaling is evident from human and mouse genetic studies which demonstrate that mutations leading to disruption of FGF signaling cause a variety of developmental disorders including dominant skeletal diseases, infertility, and cancer. Over the course of this review, we will provide evidence for differential expression of FGFs/FGFRs in the testis, male germ cells, the epididymis, the seminal vesicle, and the prostate. We will show that this signaling cascade has an important role in sperm development and maturation. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that FGF/FGFR signaling is essential for normal epididymal function and prostate development. To this end, we will provide evidence for the involvement of the FGF signaling system in the regulation and maintenance of the male reproductive system.

### Stromal androgen signaling governs essential niches in supporting prostate development and tumorigenesis [^8f225fa1]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Androgen signaling pathways mediated through the androgen receptor (AR) and androgens play an essential role in prostate formation, growth, and regeneration. During embryogenesis, the AR is first expressed in the urogenital sinus mesenchyme (UGM), and its expression subsequently extends to the urogenital sinus epithelium (UGE). Early tissue recombination assays showed that AR-deficient UGM combined with intact UGE failed to develop into a prostate, providing the first line of experimental evidence to demonstrate a stem cell niche role of mesenchymal AR signaling in supporting prostatic early development. Androgen signaling still remains essential during postnatal stages, controlling prostate maturation, growth, and regeneration through paracrine interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells.

Aberrant activation of androgen and AR-mediated signaling pathways also directly contributes to the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa). PCa is one of the most common malignancies and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men, accounting for 30,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. The AR is expressed in most primary PCa cells, and its activation by binding of its ligands, androgens, directly promotes PCa development, growth, and progression. Therefore, over the past decades, significant effort has been devoted to determining the intrinsic mechanism underlying AR action in PCa cells. However, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), designed to directly target AR-expressing prostate epithelial tumor cells through either antagonizing the AR or inhibiting androgen production, ultimately fails in almost all of patients, leading to the development of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), an incurable disease.

Given these critical challenges in clinics, it is imperative to reassess the oncogenic roles of AR signaling in prostate tumorigenesis to develop new and more effective therapeutic strategies for treating PCa. Recently, a significant niche role of stromal AR in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) responsive Gli1-lineage cells through stromal-epithelial paracrine interactions has been identified in regulating prostate development and tumorigenesis. Here, we summarized the latest discoveries of stromal AR niches and their interactions with prostate epithelia in controlling prostate epithelial differentiation, growth, and regeneration. In combination with emerging clinical and experimental evidence, we also discuss several important and long-term unanswered questions regarding stromal AR niches in promoting prostate epithelial oncogenesis, and tumor development and progression, and highlight future therapeutic strategies for co-targeting both epithelial and stromal AR oncogenic effects for treating advanced PCa.

### CXCL12 γ induces human prostate and mammary gland development [^cabadb04]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Epithelial stem cells (ESCs) demonstrate a capacity to maintain normal tissues homeostasis and ESCs with a deregulated behavior can contribute to cancer development. The ability to reprogram normal tissue epithelial cells into prostate or mammary stem-like cells holds great promise to help understand cell of origin and lineage plasticity in prostate and breast cancers in addition to understanding normal gland development. We previously showed that an intracellular chemokine, CXCL12γ induced cancer stem cells and neuroendocrine characteristics in both prostate and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. However, its role in normal prostate or mammary epithelial cell fate and development remains unknown. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the functional role of CXCL12γ in the regulation of ESCs and tissue development.

Methods

Prostate epithelial cells (PNT2) or mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) with overexpressed CXCL12γ was characterized by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blots, and immunofluorescence for lineage marker expression, and fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses and sphere formation assays to examine stem cell surface phenotype and function. Xenotransplantation animal models were used to evaluate gland or acini formation in vivo.

Results

Overexpression of CXCL12γ promotes the reprogramming of cells with a differentiated luminal phenotype to a nonluminal phenotype in both prostate (PNT2) and mammary (MCF10A) epithelial cells. The CXCL12γ-mediated nonluminal type cells results in an increase of epithelial stem-like phenotype including the subpopulation of EPCAM Lo /CD49f Hi /CD24 Lo /CD44 Hi cells capable of sphere formation. Critically, overexpression of CXCL12γ promotes the generation of robust gland-like structures from both prostate and mammary epithelial cells in in vivo xenograft animal models.

Conclusions

CXCL12γ supports the reprogramming of epithelial cells into nonluminal cell-derived stem cells, which facilitates gland development.

### Spatial multi-omics identifies aggressive prostate cancer signatures highlighting pro-inflammatory chemokine activity in the tumor microenvironment [^baaaad39]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Understanding the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. We interrogated spatially resolved multi-omics data to find molecular stratifiers of aggressive PCa. We report an aggressive prostate cancer (APC) gene expression signature predictive of increased risk of relapse and metastasis in a cohort of 1,588 patients. Further, we present a chemokine-enriched-gland (CEG) signature specific to non-cancerous prostatic glands from patients with aggressive cancer. The CEG signature is characterized by upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines, club-like cell enrichment, and immune cell infiltration of surrounding stroma. The activity of both signatures is correlated with reduced citrate and zinc levels and loss of normal prostate secretory gland functions. In summary we report that an increased inflammatory status linked to chemokine production, club-like cell enrichment, and metabolic changes in normal-appearing prostatic glands is associated with the subsequent development of aggressive PCa.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa) frequently coexist, posing unique challenges for the clinician. This article explores how various surgical and minimally invasive therapies for BPH can be utilized in patients with PCa, including those managing with active surveillance or pursuing radiation treatment. The discussion herein highlights the efficacy, complications, and oncological implications of these treatments. Ultimately, treatment selection requires shared decision-making and a multidisciplinary approach to achieving symptom relief while maintaining cancer control. Future research will be critical to refine best practices and assess long-term outcomes in these clinical situations.

### The impact of diet and nutrition on prostate cancer-food for thought? [^a926700b]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men and the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Approximately 11.6% of all men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Prostate cancer is most frequently diagnosed in men 65–74 years of age. The incidence varies widely and is influenced by geographic location, race, ethnicity, lifestyle factors and diet.

Although the etiology of prostate cancer is multifactorial, the influence of geographic and ethnic differences suggests that diet, environmental factors, lifestyle factors and metabolic problems may have a substantial impact on the development and progression of disease. Epidemiological evidence indicates that high body mass index and obesity are not only associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, but also with disease progression. There is a strong association between obesity and the Western diet. Indeed, the incidence of prostate cancer is six-fold higher in Western countries compared to non-Western countries with a low incidence in Asian countries.

The role of lifestyle medicine is growing in prostate cancer and healthy dietary choices are known to positively impact both overall wellbeing and disease outcomes in this patient population.

This review will summarize and discuss associations between prostate cancer and diet and outline the impact of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and phytonutrients on disease outcomes.

Dietary Factors

Dietary Fats

Fats form part of every cell and are vital for energy, physiological and biological processes. In the body, lipids exist in various forms, each with a different structure and function, including fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol and phospholipids.

Fatty acids are divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids are further divided into monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).

Although the body can manufacture most of the fats needed, there are two groups of fatty acids that the body cannot manufacture. These are termed essential fatty acids and include the omega-6 fatty acids and the omega-3 fatty acids. Both the omega-6 fatty acids and the omega-3 fatty acids are PUFA.

While the optimal ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids should be 3:1, the Western diet is abundant in omega-6 fatty acids with a ratio of up to 30:1. Animal products, such as dairy and meat, are the primary source of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids.

### Analysis of the current surgical anatomical knowledge of radical prostatectomy: an updated review [^a39def8a]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

New anatomical studies have emerged since the last prostatic surgical anatomy review published in 2016. Our goal is to present the latest periprostatic anatomical understanding.

Methods

PubMed was queried to identify articles covering prostate anatomy, emphasizing work published from 2016 to 2025.

Key Findings and Limitations

The endopelvic fascia partially engulfs the prostate laterally. Meanwhile, the prostatic fascia surrounds the medial aspect. The anterior fibromuscular stroma reinforces the prostatic stroma ventrally. The detrusor apron is continuous with anterior bladder muscle fibers, which anchors to the posterior pubis. Posterolaterally, the prostate is adjacent to a predominant neurovascular bundle. The external and internal sphincters, along with membranous urethra, are components of the urethral sphincter complex. At the prostatic base, the seminal vesicles are anteromedial to the adjoining proximal neurovascular plate. Autonomic and somatic fibers innervate the prostate, from T11-L2 and S2-S4 rami. In a spray-like pattern, autonomic fibers are distributed into the neurovascular bundle, the proximal plate, and accessory pathways. Synthesizing the most recent surgical anatomy research, we also created a three-dimensional animation.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The prostate is a dense organ with muscular and glandular features. Located within the true pelvis, the prostate is surrounded by several fascial planes that contain the neurovascular structures. Lumbosacral parasympathetic nerve root fibers of the pelvic plexus run posterolateral to the prostate gland in a neural hammock configuration. This anatomic understanding informs the nerve-sparing technique. Finally, the anterior ligamentous structures play a role in continence and possibly erectile function too.

### Prostate cancer: towards the standardization and synthesis of morphology, genetics, and prognosis [^c47dc781]. Histopathology (2012). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer research and diagnosis is undergoing a revolution in our understanding of the disease process and standardization of diagnostic criteria. Although great progress has been made, there remain many areas of uncertainty and debate. The revolution towards a synthesis of pathology with genetic changes and prognostic models is only just beginning. This supplement presents the opinions and findings of leading international experts in histopathology and prostate research dealing with subjects ranging from aetiology, basic anatomy and morphology to prognostic models, genetic changes and new drug treatments. We hope that this exciting and rapidly changing field will capture the imagination of both experienced and trainee pathologists to advance the field in both research and diagnosis.

### Terazosin hydrochloride (terazosin) [^1e7b825a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for hypertension

Non-drug treatments are sometimes effective in controlling mild hypertension. The most important lifestyle changes to lower blood pressure are to lose weight, reduce salt, fat, and alcohol in the diet, quit smoking, and exercise regularly. However, many hypertensive patients require one or more ongoing medications to control their blood pressure. There are different kinds of medications used to treat hypertension. Your doctor has prescribed Terazosin Capsules for you.

What Terazosin Capsules do to treat hypertension

Terazosin capsules work by relaxing blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. This helps to lower blood pressure.

What is BPH?

The prostate is a gland located below the bladder of men. It surrounds the urethra (you-REETH-rah), which is a tube that drains urine from the bladder. BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland. The symptoms of BPH, however, can be caused by an increase in the tightness of muscles in the prostate. If the muscles inside the prostate tighten, they can squeeze the urethra and slow the flow of urine. This can lead to symptoms such as:

a weak or interrupted stream when urinating
a feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely
a feeling of delay when you start to urinate
a need to urinate often, especially at night, or
a feeling that you must urinate right away.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^ea5a41bf]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) terminology and pathophysiology — BPH can lead to an enlargement of the prostate called benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), yet not all men with BPH will develop any evidence of BPE. The prostate gland may cause obstruction at the bladder neck termed benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), and BPO is a subset of BOO. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) increase in frequency and severity with age and are divided into storage and voiding/emptying categories, and male LUTS may be caused by conditions including BPE and BPO. The enlarged gland has been proposed to contribute to male LUTS via at least two routes: direct BOO/BPO from a mechanical static component and increased smooth muscle tone and resistance within the gland (dynamic component).

### Stromal androgen signaling governs essential niches in supporting prostate development and tumorigenesis [^37719e05]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

Remaining questions and future prospects

While a significant role for stromal androgen/AR signaling in prostate development, differentiation, and regeneration has been suggested in the past, the cellular properties and characteristics of prostatic stromal niches and the regulatory mechanisms governing the reciprocal interaction between stromal and epithelial cells were poorly understood until recently. As summarized in this review, identification of an indispensable role of stromal AR in Gli1-lineage cells in supporting prostate embryonic epithelium development, prepubertal morphogenesis, and pubertal growth, as well as prostatic epithelial oncogenesis and tumor development provides new insight into our current understanding on stromal niche roles of androgen signaling. Meanwhile, these lines of newly emerged scientific evidence also raise several important but currently unknown questions in the field. First, since previous studies have shown the expression of Gli1 and other Gli transcription factors are dispensable for prostate development and morphogenesis, identifying an indispensable role of AR expression in Gli1-lineage cells implicates a new and unique regulatory mechanism underlying AR and Gli1 interactions for prostate development, maturation, and tumorigenesis. As such, the implications of the AR and Gli1 interactions through stromal and epithelial cells in both normal and tumor status should be further investigated. Second, given that previous studies have shown that selective deletion of AR either in prostatic FBs or SMCs alone or both only resulted in modest pubertal prostate growth defects, it is possible that the population of prostatic stromal Gli1-expressing cells is different from the general prostate FBs and SMCs. Therefore, identification of the cellular properties of the prostatic Gli1-expressing cells will be extremely important to fully understand the precise identity and role of prostatic stem niche cells. Third, a significant increase in IGFBP3 expression in AR-deficient Gli1-lineage cells suggests a regulatory role for AR in Gli1-lineage niche cells to support PCa growth through regulating IGF1 axes. Thus far, it is unclear whether this regulation is divergent during ADT and related tumor progression, which may lead to aberrant activation of IGF1 to promote tumor progression and hormone refractoriness, resulting in CRPC development. Moreover, multiple lines of clinical and experimental evidence have demonstrated the biological roles of androgen signaling in both myeloid and lymphoid cells within the prostate stroma. The effects of androgen signaling on these cells, along with alterations in the cytokine environment, can reshape the tumor microenvironment, facilitating tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapies. As such, further investigations are warranted to explore in the interactions between androgen signaling and immune cells. Finally, building on the critical role of stromal AR signaling in PCa, future therapeutic strategies could focus on co-targeting both epithelial and stromal androgen and AR mediated oncogenic pathways. Stromal AR signaling, particularly within Gli1-lineage cells, may significantly contribute to therapy resistance by supporting epithelial cell survival and tumor growth during ADT. Therefore, targeting both tumor epithelial AR and stromal AR signaling could simultaneously disrupt the tumor microenvironment and inhibit epithelial tumor growth. Such an approach may offer a more comprehensive strategy for treating advanced prostate cancer. Continued research in this area is essential to gain deeper insights into these mechanisms and develop more effective therapies by co-targeting these aberrant AR signaling pathways.

### Integrative multiplatform molecular profiling of benign prostatic hyperplasia identifies distinct subtypes [^2bcefeb7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on benign prostatic hyperplasia:

- **Definition**: BPH is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland that affects aging men.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BPH is complex and not fully understood. However, androgenic hormones, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a significant role in the growth and maintenance of the prostate gland. Dihydrotestosterone is synthesized from testosterone by the action of 5-alpha reductase enzymes, and both normal and pathological growth of the prostate is dependent on dihydrotestosterone synthesis.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of BPH/LUTS in men is estimated at 15,000 per 1,000 person-years. The reported prevalence of BPH ranges from 8–14% in men aged 40–49 years to 21–43% in men aged 60–69 years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BPH include advancing age, familial predisposition, obesity, and the presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and CVD.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, BPH is primarily diagnosed based on a diverse array of progressive LUTS. These symptoms include increased urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, weak urinary stream, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BPH is variable. It is a progressive condition but is not necessarily life-threatening.

### Endocrine aspects of sexual dysfunction in men [^47e151e4]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endocrine disorders of sex steroid hormones may adversely affect men's sexual function. Aim. To provide expert opinions/recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of endocrinologic sexual medicine disorders.

Methods

An International Consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a scientific and debate process. Concerning the Endocrine committee, there were eight experts from seven countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinions/recommendations are based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, extensive internal committee discussion over 2 years, public presentation and deliberation.

Results

Hypogonadism is a clinical and biochemical syndrome characterized by a deficiency in serum androgen levels which may decrease sexual interest, quality of erections and quality of life. Biochemical investigations include testosterone and either bioavailable or calculated free testosterone; prolactin should be considered when hypogonadism has been documented. If clinically indicated, androgen therapy should maintain testosterone within the physiological range avoiding supraphysiologic values. Digital rectal examination and determination of serum prostate specific antigen values are mandatory prior to therapy and regularly thereafter. Androgen therapy is usually long-term requiring regular follow-up, frequent monitoring of blood levels and beneficial and adverse therapeutic responses.

Conclusions

Safe and effective treatments for endocrinologic sexual medicine disorders examined by prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional clinical trials are needed.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^ea8c39dd]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) background — histology, androgen pathway, and prevalence: BPH is a histologic diagnosis that refers to the proliferation of glandular epithelial tissue, smooth muscle, and connective tissue within the prostatic transition zone. The mechanism by which testosterone exerts many of its physiological effects on the prostate gland is through dihydrotestosterone (DHT); once intracytoplasmic, testosterone is converted to its active metabolite DHT by the enzyme 5 α -reductase, type 2, and DHT forms a complex with androgen receptors that is then transported to the nucleus where the complex exerts its effects on the transcription of DNA. BPH is nearly ubiquitous in aging males, with worldwide autopsy proven histological prevalence increases starting at age 40–45 years to reach 60% at age 60 and 80% at age 80, and while BPH, or histological hyperplasia, in and of itself does not require treatment.

### Prostate cancer: a dynamic illness with shifting targets [^7b04f073]. The Lancet: Oncology (2003). Medium credibility.

Despite high response rates and palliative clinical benefits, androgen ablation does not cure advanced prostate cancer because of the inevitable emergence of resistant cells. Many new therapies under development for prostate cancer target pathways and molecules that contribute to the growth and survival of these cells. The rational and effective use of targeted therapies to eradicate resistant populations of tumour cells should be grounded on the premise that prostate cancer is a dynamic disease that evolves as it progresses, and that specific molecular determinants mediating sensitivity and resistance may be relevant only during specific states of the disease. Directed approaches must account for this changing dynamic so that clinical outcomes may be improved.

### Treating prostate cancer: a rationale for targeting local oestrogens [^fbec05e7]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2007). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men, and benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common benign condition known to occur in ageing men. Oestrogen has been implicated in the development of prostate cancer, and offers a promising new avenue for treatment. Despite this, the role of oestrogens in the prostate is complex. This Perspective presents a rationale for a targeted approach for the treatment of prostate disease through the use of selective oestrogen-receptor modulators in conjunction with contemporary androgen-ablation therapy.

### Incidental findings in and around the prostate on prostate MRI: a pictorial review [^5d9be956]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) prostate allows accurate anatomical and functional imaging of the prostate gland and diagnosis of significant (intermediate and high risk) prostate cancer. mpMRI can also be utilised in active surveillance for patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer and guide targeted prostate biopsies.

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and positron emission tomography (PET) are other imaging modalities which can be used to assess the prostate and aid in diagnosis and localisation, therapy, staging, active surveillance and recurrence monitoring. On TRUS, a relatively safe and inexpensive imaging modality, prostate cancer is most often hypoechoic relative to the normal peripheral zone but may sometimes be isoechoic or even hyperechoic. Further features that increase confidence in diagnosing prostate cancer on TRUS are asymmetry in prostate size (particularly in the peripheral zone), capsular distortion and loss of differentiation between the central gland and peripheral zone.

mpMRI of the prostate typically combines the anatomical images of T1- and T2-weighted imaging with functional sequences including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (with a calculated b value of 2000), in conjunction with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) T1 sequences (using gadolinium-based IV contrast agents). The T2 sequence provides the best assessment of prostate margins for extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, neurovascular bundle and adjacent organ involvement. T1 weighted imaging helps differentiate post-biopsy haemorrhage from tumour. DWI is useful because prostate cancer has a reduced diffusion of water, compared with normal prostate, due to its tightly packed cells. DCE imaging provides further functional information as malignancy causes changes such as increased blood flow, neo-vascularity and leaky capillaries. Finally, magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a functional technique that indirectly measures metabolite levels of choline, creatinine and citrate in the prostate but, due to being technically challenging and time consuming, is often not included in a mpMRI protocol.

### A critical analysis of the current knowledge of surgical anatomy related to optimization of cancer control and preservation of continence and erection in candidates for radical prostatectomy [^fb6d70f1]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the prostate and adjacent tissues is mandatory during radical prostatectomy to ensure reliable oncologic and functional outcomes.

Objective

To review critically and to summarize the available literature on surgical anatomy of the prostate and adjacent structures involved in cancer control, erectile function, and urinary continence.

Evidence Acquisition

A search of the PubMed database was performed using the keywords radical prostatectomy, anatomy, neurovascular bundle, fascia, pelvis, and sphincter. Relevant articles and textbook chapters were reviewed, analyzed, and summarized.

Evidence Synthesis

Anatomy of the prostate and the adjacent tissues varies substantially. The fascia surrounding the prostate is multilayered, sometimes either fused with the prostate capsule or clearly separated from the capsule as a reflection of interindividual variations. The neurovascular bundle (NVB) is situated between the fascial layers covering the prostate. The NVB is composed of numerous nerve fibers superimposed on a scaffold of veins, arteries, and variable amounts of adipose tissue surrounding almost the entire lateral and posterior surfaces of the prostate. The NVB is also in close, cage-like contact to the seminal vesicles. The external urethral sphincter is a complex structure in close anatomic and functional relationship to the pelvic floor, and its fragile innervation is in close association to the prostate apex. Finally, the shape and size of the prostate can significantly modify the anatomy of the NVB, the urethral sphincter, the dorsal vascular complex, and the pubovesical/puboprostatic ligaments.

Conclusions

The surgical anatomy of the prostate and adjacent tissues involved in radical prostatectomy is complex. Precise knowledge of all relevant anatomic structures facilitates surgical orientation and dissection during radical prostatectomy and ideally translates into both superior rates of cancer control and improved functional outcomes postoperatively.

### Prostate cancer research articles-NCI… [^f42cf8d3]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

Under a new FDA approval, enzalutamide can now be used alone, or in combination with leuprolide, to treat people with nonmetastatic prostate cancer that is at high risk of returning after surgery or radiation. FDA Approves New Initial Treatment Option for Some Metastatic Prostate CancersPosted: A drug called Lu177-PSMA-617 may be a new option for treating advanced prostate cancer. In a large clinical trial, adding the drug — a type of radiopharmaceutical — to standard treatments improved how long participants lived. Hormone Therapy for Prostate Cancer. A Genetic Test Could Help DecidePosted: For some men with prostate cancer, a genetic biomarker test called Decipher may help predict if their cancer will spread elsewhere in the body. The test could help determine whether hormone therapy, which can cause distressing side effects, is needed.

In two large clinical trials, the drugs enzalutamide and apalutamide, respectively, combined with the androgen deprivation therapy, improved the survival of men with metastatic prostate cancer that still responds to hormone-suppressing therapies. Prostate Cancer Prevention and Finasteride: A Conversation with NCI's Dr. Howard ParnesPosted: The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial showed that finasteride can reduce the risk of prostate cancer, but might increase the risk of aggressive disease. NCI's Howard Parnes talks about subsequent findings and what they mean for men aged 55 and older. Darolutamide Delays the Spread of Some Prostate CancersPosted: The investigational drug darolutamide can help delay the spread of prostate cancer in some men with the disease, a recent clinical trial shows. In addition, the drug caused fewer side effects than similar prostate cancer drugs.

African American Men More Likely to Die from Low-Grade Prostate CancerPosted: For African American men, the risk of dying from low-grade prostate cancer is double that of men of other races, a new study has found. But, despite the increase, the risk is still small. The Food and Drug Administration has expanded the approval of abiraterone for men with prostate cancer. The agency approved abiraterone, in combination with the steroid prednisone, for men with metastatic prostate cancer that is responsive to hormone-blocking treatments and is at high risk of progressing.

### Spatial multi-omics identifies aggressive prostate cancer signatures highlighting pro-inflammatory chemokine activity in the tumor microenvironment [^503c5590]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We investigated biological functions associated with our signatures by looking at the activity of known prostate function-related gene sets in our ST data (Fig. 2). Our results support our previously reported observations that prostate secretory genes are downregulated in tumors from relapse patients. We could further substantiate this observation by analyzing metabolite compositions in APC and CEG active regions. Our findings show that high activity of both signatures is associated with metabolic changes in the respective regions. Specifically, the metabolic phenotype observed in APC high scoring spots displayed the typical hallmarks of PCa metabolism: Reduced citrate and zinc, increased levels of glucose, and signs for an increased glutamine consumption. Interestingly, the high CEG signature regions, even though mainly containing NCG spots, showed a very similar, cancer-like, metabolic phenotype (Fig. 5). Zinc is typically understood to block aconitase to allow healthy prostate glands to accumulate high levels of citrate. The observed reduction of both zinc and citrate, is a clear indicator for loss of this characteristic prostate gland function in NCG spots with high CEG signature activity. This agrees with our ST-based findings of reduced transcriptional activity of citrate secretion associated genes in the same spots. This metabolic change of benign glands adjacent to cancer areas has, to our knowledge, not been previously observed in PCa. The loss of gene expression associated with citrate secretion in NCG spots from aggressive cancer samples (Fig. 2e) appeared to be the most profound change of the prostate specific luminal cell-type characteristics. When inspecting the genes present in the APC signature, we found that two of the downregulated APC signature genes (ALOX15B and NCAPD3) were also central genes in our previously published network of genes for citrate secretion, further strengthening the link between aggressive tumors and loss of citrate secretion in corresponding cancer adjacent benign glands. Further, using independent publicly available data, we could support the associations between both signatures and reduced luminal functions, specifically citrate secretion on the transcriptional level. The observed increased glucose levels in the spatial data in combination with the increased lactate levels in bulk data in signature high scoring spots and samples are indicators for anaerobic glycolysis also known as the Warburg effect. Further, build-up of AMP and reduction of ATP, resulting in an elevated AMP:ATP ratio, are indicative for a low energy state of the tissue and suggest high activity of anabolic processes. This was accompanied by a potential shift to utilization of glutamate as an energy source as an adaptation to a high energy demand under hypoxic conditions suggested by the pronounced increase of NAA, glutamate, and glutamine. All these metabolic changes observed in regions with high APC and CEG activity are typically observed in cancer or inflammation. The increased urate levels in these regions, indicative of a potentially increased activity of the uric acid cycle, might be a further indicator for a high energy demand. Interestingly, urate, and urate crystals, have been implicated in being a cause for prostatitis – and a factor leading to inflammation eventually contributing to prostate carcinogenesis. The increase of taurine in these areas is interesting as it has been described as pro-apoptotic, anti-prolific, and anti-migratorybut also to mitigate the resulting oxidative stress from inflammation, typically increased in high catabolic tissue.

### Reviewing the evidence on vitamin D supplementation in the management of testosterone status and its effects on male reproductive system (testis and prostate): mechanistically dazzling but clinically disappointing [^d5671bed]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested to increase testosterone levels. The primary purpose of this literature review was to critically assess the physiologic effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum testosterone concentrations in men and the secondary purpose was to evaluate the feasibility of vitamin D status toward urologic health (testis and prostate).

Methods

A structured literature review was performed using the Cochrane, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases. The literature search encompassed studies published between 2011 and 2019.

Findings

Observational studies suggest an association between higher testosterone and serum vitamin D concentrations. Conversely, most randomized clinical trials that investigated the effect of vitamin D administration on testosterone levels have failed to detect any significant effect. Physiologically, vitamin D is engaging in spermatogenesis, but it remains unclear whether vitamin D is a determinant of fertility. With prostate support, the management of vitamin D status has been associated with a decreased prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia and symptoms (ie, lower urinary tract symptoms). However, with prostate cancer, there is a paucity of evidence pertaining to vitamin D supplementation.

Implications

Mechanistically, vitamin D exhibits essential roles in the testis and prostate; otherwise, there is no apparent evidence to support the use of vitamin D supplementation to increase testosterone levels and to improve clinical outcomes related to the male reproductive system.

### Benign prostate hyperplasia: a review of the year's progress from bench to clinic [^0e1ad89d]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Therapeutic tools for classic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) have focused on the dynamic component of obstruction and/or elimination of the static component via surgical or pharmaceutical therapies. Unfortunately, an exact cause for this disease process has not been identified, but additional insight has been achieved. This article presents an update of the BPH literature with a special focus on basic science or translational studies concerned with the cause of clinically significant BPH with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Recent Findings

Investigators are exploring connections between BPH with clinically significant LUTS, the metabolic syndrome, inflammation, alterations in cell signaling, and genetics which in turn has provided additional information concerning the pathogenesis, medical therapies as well as surgical therapies.

Summary

BPH is a chronic, progressive disease with important care implications and financial risks to the healthcare system. Continued improvements in length of life will demand that we unlock the cause of LUTS secondary to BPH with the goal of prevention as the ideal therapy. Studies reported in the last year contributed to our understanding of the disease process and provide insight for additional studies.

### Prostate cancer basics… [^3126369c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The prostate is a part of the male reproductive system.
- Prostate cancer is a disease in which cells in the prostate grow out of control. What is the prostate? The prostate is a part of the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, prostate, seminal vesicles, and testicles. The prostate is located just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds the urethra. It produces fluid that makes up a part of semen. As a man ages, the prostate tends to increase in size. This can cause the urethra to narrow and decrease urine flow. This is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, and it is not the same as prostate cancer. Men may also have other prostate changes that are not cancer.

### Klf5 acetylation regulates luminal differentiation of basal progenitors in prostate development and regeneration [^044d5106]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Roles of Klf5 and its acetylation in basal progenitors and their luminal differentiation could also occur in other organs with epithelia, because the expression of p63 is ubiquitous in the basal cells of various organs such as the lungs, mammary glands, digestive tracts, liver, epidermis etc. and Klf5 has been reported to play a role in basal cell proliferation in the epidermisand in embryonic development and the development of organs such as the lung and mammary gland –. Such roles could be responsible for the decrease in body weight of mice by Klf5 deletion in p63-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d).

Among multiple signaling pathways implicated in prostate development, Notch signaling clearly participates in the function of Klf5 acetylation in prostatic epithelial homeostasis, as multiple members of the Notch signaling pathway were upregulated by Klf5 KR knockin (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7), consistent with the previously defined function of Notch signaling in mouse prostates. In addition, blocking Notch signaling eliminated the promoting effect of deacetylated Klf5 on organoid formation (Fig. 6f). We noticed that mechanisms other than Notch signaling could also mediate the function of Klf5 acetylation in prostate homeostasis (Fig. 6a), which remain to be determined.

Importantly, acetylation of Klf5 is essential for BPDLCs to survive after castration and regenerate after androgen restoration. Firstly, Klf5 KR knockin in basal progenitors sharply decreased BPDLCs that survived after castration (Fig. 7e). Secondly, in the subsequent regeneration by restoring androgens, the reappearance of BPDLCs was again attenuated by Klf5 KR knockin (Fig. 8b; Supplementary Fig. 8h). While more than 90% of prostate luminal cells die after castration in mice, some luminal cells have stem/progenitor features and are castration-resistant (e.g. CARNs). It remains to be addressed whether castration-resistant BPDLCs overlap with CARNs. Necessity of Klf5 acetylation for castration resistance in BPDLCs also implicates KLF5 acetylation in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

### Autophagy in benign prostatic hyperplasia: insights and therapeutic potential [^e8b335fd]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic mechanism characterized by cyclic degradation. It plays an essential role in maintaining cellular quality and survival by eliminating dysfunctional cellular components. This process is pivotal in various pathophysiological processes. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common urological disorder in middle-aged and elderly men. It frequently presents as lower urinary tract symptoms due to an increase in epithelial and stromal cells surrounding the prostatic urethra. The precise pathogenesis of BPH is complex. In recent years, research on autophagy in BPH has gained significant momentum, with accumulating evidence indicating its crucial role in the onset and progression of the disease. This review aims to outline the various roles of autophagy in BPH and elucidate potential therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy for managing BPH.

### The role of prostatic inflammation in the development and progression of benign and malignant diseases [^9cb75cc3]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To evaluate the role of prostatic inflammation in the development and progression of benign and malignant prostatic diseases.

Recent Findings

Preclinical studies demonstrate that the activation of a chronic inflammatory prostatic response plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa). Approximately 40–70% of patients with BPH-related lower urinary tract symptoms harbour chronic inflammation at pathologic evaluation. These individuals should be considered at increased risk of symptom progression and acute urinary retention. Although currently available drugs approved for the treatment of BPH do not have an anti-inflammatory activity, the development of novel molecules that target the inflammatory pathway represents a promising area in the pharmacological treatment of BPH. Preclinical evidences support a potential role of chronic prostatic inflammation in the malignant transformation of prostatic cells. However, clinical investigations on the association between prostatic inflammation and the risk of PCa report conflicting results.

Summary

Men with BPH-related lower urinary tract symptoms and chronic prostatic inflammation should be considered at increased risk of symptom progression and acute urinary retention during follow-up. Although preclinical studies provide a biological rationale for the relationship between inflammation and the risk of PCa, clinical investigations report conflicting results and the direct relationship between inflammation and malignant transformation in the human prostate is still debated.

### Is there evidence of a relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer? Findings of a literature review [^1a4c9262]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Context

More than half the male population aged > 50 yr have histologic evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), while prostate cancer (PCa) is among the most common male cancers according to recent registry data. Understanding the aetiologies of both conditions is crucial to reduce the resulting burden of mortality and morbidity.

Objective

This review aims to examine the available data on the epidemiology, pathology, risk factors, and genetic markers involved in BPH and PCa; to discuss their clinical implications for management of both conditions; and to discuss their implications for PCa prevention. Our primary objective was to clarify the relationship between BPH and PCa by bringing together evidence from diverse areas of research.

Evidence Acquisition

The primary source of data was PubMed, which was searched using Boolean strategies and by scanning lists of related articles. We also examined secondary sources from reference lists of retrieved articles and data presented at recent congresses.

Evidence Synthesis

Accumulating evidence suggests that BPH and PCa share important anatomic, pathologic, and genetic links in addition to the well-established epidemiologic association between these conditions. We also found data that suggest interactions between apparently diverse factors, such as dihydrotestosterone levels and inflammation. Recent publications support the hypothesis that both BPH and PCa are part of the metabolic syndrome, while inflammation is emerging as a major contributor to the development of both BPH and PCa. Although many of the findings are preliminary and require further research, they offer new insight into the mechanisms of disease underlying the development of BPH and PCa.

Conclusions

Available data suggest that epidemiologic and pathologic links exist between BPH and PCa. Evidence of links between the conditions and contributory factors may offer common preventative strategies for BPH and PCa and common therapeutic approaches to their management.

### Anatomy of the prostate revisited: implications for prostate biopsy and zonal origins of prostate cancer [^6e675732]. Histopathology (2012). Low credibility.

Over the past 25 years, our understanding of prostatic disease has evolved secondary to the increased detection, treatment and study of both benign and neoplastic prostatic lesions. The advent of aggressive prostate-specific antigen screening and standardization of extended transrectal needle biopsy protocols has resulted in significant stage migration and earlier detection of prostate cancers, a growing proportion of which are lower-volume posterior peripheral zone tumours. Consequently, an increased incidence of anterior-predominant prostate cancers has been observed. Given the histomorphological complexity of the prostate, these developments have necessitated a reconsideration of prostatic anatomy, biopsy strategies in the detection of anterior tumours and the determination and relevance of zonal origin in prostate cancer. This review will provide a contemporary update of these topics, while highlighting specific areas in which a keen understanding of prostatic histoanatomy may influence biopsy interpretation.

### Finasteride [^93cc6ac5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The development and enlargement of the prostate gland is dependent on the potent androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Type II 5α-reductase metabolizes testosterone to DHT in the prostate gland, liver and skin. DHT induces androgenic effects by binding to androgen receptors in the cell nuclei of these organs.

Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase with which it slowly forms a stable enzyme complex. Turnover from this complex is extremely slow (t½∼ 30 days). This has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor. In man, the 5α-reduced steroid metabolites in blood and urine are decreased after administration of finasteride.

### Vessel-sparing radiation and functional anatomy-based preservation for erectile function after prostate radiotherapy [^a9395de3]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment selection for men undergoing curative treatment for prostate cancer is often a challenging decision in view of the goal of maximising cure while maintaining quality of life. Previous quality-of-life comparisons suggest that specific outcomes are associated with type of treatment (surgery vs radiation); however, the functional anatomy approach, starting with nerve-sparing prostatectomy, assumes that quality-of-life outcomes are established by anatomic preservation. Emerging applications of the functional anatomy approach for prostate radiation will ultimately allow for individualised treatments that address the normal tissue variants visible on MRI. Such approaches will encompass all essential functions affected by treatment including genitourinary, rectal, and sexual functions. In this Review, we outline the current techniques in functional anatomy-based preservation related to sexual outcomes, and outline the capacity of vessel-sparing radiotherapy to preserve sexual function in 90% of patients at the 5 year follow-up while maintaining excellent cure rates.

### A 50-year journey in the development of treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^c9fa8dca]. Npj Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive enlargement of prostatic glandular and stromal tissues, leading to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that significantly impact quality of life, particularly among the aged. BPH prevalence increases with age, affecting ~20% of men in their 40 s and up to 70% of men in their 60 s. Over the past three decades (1990–2021), the global incidence of BPH has risen dramatically from ~6.5 million to 13.5 million new cases annually, underscoring the urgent need for effective treatment options (Box 1).

Current medical therapies, including adrenergic blockers (e.g. terazosin) and 5α-reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride), provide symptom relief but do not fully address the disease's underlying pathophysiology. For patients with severe BPH, surgical intervention, primarily transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), remains a standard approach. However, the persistence of treatment failures and the progressive nature of BPH highlight the need for novel therapeutic strategies.

There is substantial evidence supporting the hormone-dependent nature of BPH during aging. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH) are critical in regulating growth hormone (GH) secretion and have been implicated in aging-related processes. Aging is associated with a decline in GH secretion, leading to reduced anabolic effects, increased adiposity, and decreased muscle mass. This hormonal shift contributes to frailty, metabolic dysfunction, and a decline in overall physiological resilience. In addition, aging-related changes in LH-RH and GH-RH signaling may influence inflammatory processes and the progression of age-related diseases, including BPH.

Experimental and clinical studies indicate that GH-RH and LH-RH analogs play a crucial role in prostate growth regulation. Prostate cells express receptors for these hypothalamic hormones, which can either stimulate hyperplasia or be blocked by antagonists to reduce prostate size and inflammation. Recent research has demonstrated that GH-RH antagonists not only shrink prostate volume but also exert potent anti-inflammatory effects, making them promising candidates for BPH treatment.

Overall, aging contributes to BPH by altering hormonal balance, increasing inflammation, and promoting prostatic tissue remodeling. This review provides a historical and scientific perspective on the evolution of hormonal therapies for BPH, focusing on the development of LH-RH and GH-RH antagonists. We discuss their molecular mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and the need for further clinical studies to optimize their application in BPH management.

### Expression of functionally active cannabinoid receptor CB1 in the human prostate gland [^b4975f0c]. The Prostate (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabinoids exert a wide spectrum of effects in men including alterations in the reproductive system. To date, two types of cannabinoid receptors have been cloned in humans, namely CB(1) and CB(2) belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Although cannabinoids have functional and morphologic effects in the prostate gland, the expression of cannabinoid receptors in this tissue has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of cannabinoid receptors in the human prostate gland and their regulatory effects on adenylyl cyclase activity.

Methods

To investigate the existence of cannabinoid receptors in prostate, we used various methods, including reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Adenylyl cyclase activity was analyzed by measuring the cAMP produced by means of a competitive assay by using PKA.

Results

Both mRNA for CB(1) and the corresponding protein are expressed in the human prostate gland at a level comparable with the receptor expressed in cerebellum. The molecular mass of the protein estimated from Western blot analysis was 58 kDa, which is in concordance with previous data for CB(1) in other tissues. Immunohistochemical studies show that CB(1) is preferentially expressed in the epithelia of the prostate. The cannabinoid receptor expressed in the prostate negatively regulates adenylyl cyclase activity through a pertussis toxin-sensitive protein.

### Extracellular vesicles for liquid biopsy in prostate cancer: where are we and where are we headed? [^f3680eff]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous class of lipid bound particles shed by any cell in the body in physiological and pathological conditions. EVs play critical functions in intercellular communication. EVs can actively travel in intercellular matrices and eventually reach the circulation. They can also be released directly in biological fluids where they appear to be stable. Because the molecular content of EVs reflects the composition of the cell of origin, they have recently emerged as a promising source of biomarkers in a number of diseases. EV analysis is particularly attractive in cancer patients that frequently present with increased numbers of circulating EVs.

Methods

We sought to review the current literature on the molecular profile of prostate cancer-derived EVs in model systems and patient biological fluids in an attempt to draw some practical and universal conclusions on the use of EVs as a tool for liquid biopsy in clinical specimens.

Results

We discuss advantages and limitations of EV-based liquid biopsy approaches summarizing salient studies on protein, DNA and RNA. Several candidate biomarkers have been identified so far but these results are difficult to apply to the clinic. However, the field is rapidly moving toward the implementation of novel tools to isolate cancer-specific EVs that are free of benign EVs and extra-vesicular contaminants. This can be achieved by identifying markers that are exquisitely present in tumor cell-derived EVs. An important contribution might also derive from a better understanding of EV types that may play specific functions in tumor progression and that may be a source of cancer-specific markers.

Conclusions

EV analysis holds strong promises for the development of non-invasive biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer. Implementation of modern methods for EV isolation and characterization will enable to interrogate circulating EVs in vivo.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^7c43c158]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — prostate size categories and unit equivalence are specified as follows: since the specific gravity of the prostate is 1.05 g/mL, gram and milliliter (cc) can be used interchangeably; when planning treatment, categorical sizes are small (< 30 g), average (30–80 g), large (> 80 to 150 g), and very large (> 150 g), and these category suggestions do not necessarily imply that efficacy outside these ranges does not exist.

### Can radiation-induced lower urinary tract disease be ameliorated in patients treated for pelvic organ cancer: ICI-RS 2019? [^cfa9881d]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Medium credibility.

Image‐guided radiotherapy (IGRT) encompasses techniques for localizing the target: by localizing surrogates 47 or anatomical features. 48 IGRT improves the accuracy of treatment delivery, allowing for dose escalation with an improved GU and GI toxicity profile. 49

Another factor influencing RT toxicity is the proximity of prostate and rectum. A hydrogel spacer that moves the rectum away from the prostate showed significantly less rectal and bladder toxicity. 50

Prostate BT is targeted directly at the prostate gland via a radiation source that is implanted or temporarily placed within the gland. This allows safe dose escalation to the prostate and results in a reduction in the dose to the bladder and rectum, thus reducing the incidence of urinary and sexual function side‐effects compared with surgery, and a lower incidence of bowel side‐effects than EBRT. 51

### Understanding prostate changes-NCI… [^09317bad]. NCI (2014). Low credibility.

About the prostate and prostate changes The prostate is part of the male reproductive system. The prostate tends to grow larger as a man ages. When men are in their 20s, the normal prostate is about the size of a walnut. By the time a man is 40 the prostate may have grown slightly larger, and by age 60, the prostate is often the size of a lemon. Age increases the risk of prostate problems, such as BPH and prostate cancer. Where is the prostate located. The prostate gland is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds part of the urethra, a tube that carries urine out of the bladder and through the penis. What does the prostate do. The prostate is a gland that helps make semen, the white, milky fluid that carries sperm when a man ejaculates. Muscles in the prostate push semen into the urethra and out, through ejaculation. Learn more about the PSA test. What is prostatitis.

Prostatitis is a benign condition that involves inflammation of the prostate. Prostatitis does not increase your risk of prostate cancer. It is the most common urinary condition in men younger than age 50 and affects at least half of all men at some time during their lives. Prostatitis can raise a man's PSA level. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is diagnosed in men of all ages who have pain that lasts more than three months, including:

- pain in the genital area, lower abdomen, or lower back
- pain when urinating, the need to urinate often, or a weak flow of urine It is the most common but least understood type of prostatitis. Infection-fighting cells are often found in the prostate fluid and semen. Symptoms related to BPH are one of the most common reasons that older men make an appointment to see a urologist. An enlarged prostate does not increase a man's risk for prostate cancer.

However, people with an enlarged prostate have an increased risk of prostatitis. Over time, if it's not treated, BPH can lead to a weak bladder, a backflow of urine that can cause bladder or kidney infections, or a blocked flow of urine, which can cause kidney failure.

### Tumor microenvironment deconvolution identifies cell-type-independent aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression in prostate cancer [^e0e62e50]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aims to investigate cellular composition in the TME of prostate cancer patients to investigate epigenetic and gene expression alterations associated with prostate carcinogenesis. The prostate gland is a walnut-sized gland below the bladder, surrounding the urethra, and it is crucial to reproduction through its role in seminal fluid production and secretion. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men behind nonmelanoma skin cancer — it is estimated that there will be 288,300 new cases and 34,700 deaths due to prostate cancer in the United States in 2023. One in every eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, meaning more than 1.2 million new cases will be diagnosed each year worldwide. Also, one in every 41 men will die of prostate cancer, making it the second leading cause of male cancer death behind lung cancer. Most prostate cancer begins in the peripheral zone, or back of the prostate, and grows slowly. While the tumor remains in the prostate, it does not pose a serious health risk, and if detected early, minimally invasive procedures can successfully treat the disease. Often, prostate cancer identified in its early stages is monitored and only treated upon exhibiting evidence of metastatic potential. The five-year survival rate of patients whose cancer has spread outside the prostate is 31%, whereas the five-year survival rate of patients whose cancer was localized to the prostate is nearly 100%. Prostate cancer is a complex disease, and several genetic alterations in prostate tumors have been identified. Frequent genetic alterations include fusions of TMPRSS2 with ETS family genes, amplification of the MYC oncogene, deletion and/or mutation of PTEN and TP53, and mutation of the androgen receptor gene have been identified as contributors to prostate cancer.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia: a brief overview of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^27af5a97]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common condition, causing symptoms in 75% of men over the age of 70. To understand the role of a novel treatment for this condition, an understanding of the pathology, approach to diagnosis, and range of existing therapies are important. This article provides a general overview of benign prostatic hyperplasia evaluation and management.

### Prostate cancer reshapes the secreted and extracellular vesicle urinary proteomes [^2acc2bf2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Urine is a complex biofluid that reflects both overall physiologic state and the state of the genitourinary tissues through which it passes. It contains both secreted proteins and proteins encapsulated in tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). To understand the population variability and clinical utility of urine, we quantified the secreted and EV proteomes from 190 men, including a subset with prostate cancer. We demonstrate that a simple protocol enriches prostatic proteins in urine. Secreted and EV proteins arise from different subcellular compartments. Urinary EVs are faithful surrogates of tissue proteomes, but secreted proteins in urine or cell line EVs are not. The urinary proteome is longitudinally stable over several years. It can accurately and non-invasively distinguish malignant from benign prostatic lesions and can risk-stratify prostate tumors. This resource quantifies the complexity of the urinary proteome and reveals the synergistic value of secreted and EV proteomes for translational and biomarker studies.

Conclusion

Our study provided an insight into the regulation of epididymal gene expression after bilateral castration. These results contribute to our understanding of testis-dependent epididymal functions. Still, we preformed insights into gene regulation of CRPC dependent or independent of castration and improved our understanding of CRPC development and progression.

### PTEN is a protein phosphatase that targets active PTK6 and inhibits PTK6 oncogenic signaling in prostate cancer [^97de9dd0]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

PTK6 promotes murine prostate cancer progression following loss of PTEN function

Prostate-specific disruption of Pten in the mouse leads to invasive adenocarcinoma. Probasin (PB)-Cre4, Pten flox/flox mice display high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) at 9 weeks of age progressing to invasive carcinoma from 17 to 42 weeks. We previously detected high levels of endogenous active membrane-associated PTK6 (PY-342) in tumors that formed following conditional disruption of Pten in this model. Here we have shown that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN negatively regulates PTK6-PY342 activating phosphorylation. To determine the contributions of PTK6 activation to prostate gland tumorigenesis following loss of Pten, we crossed the PB-Cre4, Pten flox/flox mice with Ptk6 −/− mice. Mouse prostate glands were examined after 8 months which is a sufficient interval for tumors to form in PB-Cre4, Pten flox/flox mice. At eight months of age, tumors were examined by a veterinary pathologist and subjected to histological grading. Pten flox/flox, and Pten flox/flox, Ptk6 −/− mice, which did not harbor the PB-Cre4 allele, did not display any pathological phenotype. Out of the 11 PB-Cre4, Pten flox/flox mice examined, 6 developed invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland (Table 1). In contrast, mice lacking Ptk6 were protected from prostate cancer. Out of the 11 PB-Cre4, Pten flox/flox, Ptk6 −/− mice examined, only one developed adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland (P < 0.05). Interestingly, disruption of Ptk6 also impaired development of urethral carcinomas in the PB-Cre4, Pten flox/flox mice. More than 25% of PB-Cre4, Pten flox/flox mice (3/11) developed urethral carcinomas, in contrast with 0/11 PB-Cre4, Pten flox/flox, Ptk6 −/− mice. These results demonstrate a critical role for Ptk6 in cell transformation following Pten loss of function in the prostate.

### Dynamics in the prostate immune microenvironment induced by androgen deprivation therapy [^45bbdd27]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The incidence of prostate cancer is strongly correlated with age, with the highest rates observed in older men. Testosterone, a primary male hormone, exhibits variability in both its production and physiological effects across individuals. The relationship between testosterone and the immune system is multifaceted, involving several interconnected pathways. Testosterone profoundly influences male immune function and is generally believed to suppress the immune system. It serves as a key regulator of neutrophil function and curtails the reproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. However, testosterone does not merely suppress the immune system but has various effects. It is important to fully understand how these relationships influence the individual's circumstances and diseases.

The immune system plays a crucial role in cancer's onset and progression. It can be affected when androgen levels decrease due to hormone therapy. Immune cells strive to detect and eliminate cancer cells, but these cells can evade immune attacks through various strategies. As a result, immune‐based cancer therapies, such as immunotherapy, have emerged. The relationship between the immune system and prostate cancer remains unclear, and a deeper understanding could pave the way for innovative prevention and treatment strategies. CD4 + T cells encompass a variety of cells with diverse functions, including Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, and regulatory T cells. Among them, Th1 CD4 + T cells, traditionally known as helper T cells, are crucial in tumor immunity, regulating and controlling tumor immune responses. These cells interact with antigen‐presenting cells to modulate immune responses. CD8 typically represents cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which directly destroy infected or tumor cells. Foxp3 is a key transcription factor in immune tolerance, crucial for the development and function of regulatory T cells that suppress autoimmune reactions. CD204, a cell surface marker expressed by macrophages, recognizes intracellular pathogens and regulates immune responses. In several types of carcinomas, including prostate cancer, increased infiltration of CD204 + cells in the tumor is associated with a poorer prognosis. These cells have been identified as a poor prognostic factor, such as M2 macrophages, a type of immunosuppressive cell. CD20, primarily expressed on the surface of B cells, plays a role in B‐cell maturation, activation, and proliferation. Recent reports have suggested the importance of B‐cell immunity in tumor immune responses.

These cells and molecules have crucial roles in the immune system and pathophysiology, influencing the regulation of diverse cell types and immune responses. Yet, the immunodynamics in prostate tissue triggered by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains unclear. This study aims to clarify the dynamics of immune cells in prostate cancer following ADT while considering inter‐individual differences.

### Endocrine aspects of male sexual dysfunctions [^b572a4d0]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endocrine disorders may adversely affect men's sexual function.

Aim

To provide recommendations based on best evidence for diagnosis and treatment of endocrine-related male sexual dysfunctions.

Methods

The Endocrine Aspects of Male Sexual Dysfunctions Committee, including 11 members from eight countries and four continents, collaborated with the Endocrine subcommittee of the Standards Committee of the International Society for Sexual Medicine. Medical literature was reviewed in detail, followed by extensive internal committee discussion over 2 years, then public presentation and discussion with the other experts before finalizing the report.

Main Outcome Measure

Recommendations based on grading of evidence-base medical literature and interactive discussion.

Results

From animal studies, it is derived that testosterone modulates mechanisms involved in erectile machinery, including expression of enzymes that both initiate and terminate erection. In addition, testosterone is essential for sexual motivation. Whether these findings could be extrapolated to human erections is unclear. Testosterone plays a broad role in men's overall health. Recent studies have established strong associations between low testosterone and metabolic and cardiovascular imbalances. In some studies, low testosterone decreased longevity; however, longitudinal studies do not support the predictive value of low testosterone for further cardiovascular events. The article proposes a standardized process for diagnosis and treatment of endocrine-related male sexual dysfunctions, updating the knowledge on testosterone and prostate safety. There is no compelling evidence that testosterone treatment causes prostate cancer or its progression in men without severe testosterone deficiency (TD). The possible roles of prolactin and thyroid hormones are also examined.

Conclusions

Men with erectile dysfunction, hypoactive sexual desire and retarded ejaculation, as well as those with visceral obesity and metabolic diseases, should be screened for TD and treated. Prospective interventional studies are required before screening for TD in more conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, and considering correction as preventive medicine as much data suggests.

### Comparative oncology: overcoming human cancer through companion animal studies [^e8e99406]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men worldwide. Prostate cancer is also found in canines, and it is more serious than in humans since prostate cancer is usually diagnosed at advanced stages in dogs, resulting in short overall survival and poor quality of life. The incidence of prostate cancer in both species constitutes a model for therapies for advanced prostate cancers in humans. Prostate cancer can be treated with local and systemic therapies and with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in both canines and humans.

Nevertheless, a large difference exists in that human prostate cancer is dependent on androgens, whereas canine prostate cancer is androgen-independent. In the male reproductive system, androgens play a key role in the testes and adrenal glands, producing steroid hormones such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. These hormones physically bind to androgen receptors, ultimately regulating gene expression that is involved in protein secretion, gene fusion, cell growth stimulation, growth factor production, and cell cycle regulation. As a result, androgen receptors are directly responsible for the onset and progression of prostate cancers with numerous underlying mechanisms, such as receptor amplification or mutation, androgen biosynthesis changes, and/or androgen receptor binding cofactor changes, resulting in transcriptional activity modification. However, there are now reports showing that many human prostate cancer patients develop the disease through pathways unrelated to androgen receptors. In this line, canine prostate cancer, which is unaffected by androgen receptor aberrations, can serve as a good model. Not only does it mirror androgen-independent human prostate cancer, but it is also clinically similar to hormone-resistant human prostate cancer.

### Beyond the androgen receptor: new approaches to treating metastatic prostate cancer. report of the 2013 prouts neck prostate cancer meeting [^f6bf13de]. The Prostate (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The Prouts Neck Meetings on Prostate Cancer began in 1985 through the efforts of the Organ Systems Branch of the National Cancer Institute to stimulate new research and focused around specific questions in prostate tumorigenesis and therapy.

METHODS

These meetings were think tanks, composed of around 75 individuals, and divided equally between young investigators and senior investigators. Over the years, many new concepts related to prostate cancer resulted from these meetings and the prostate cancer community has sorely missed them since the last one in 2007.

RESULTS

We report here the first of a new series of meetings. The 2013 meeting focused on defining how the field of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer needs to evolve to impact survival and was entitled: "Beyond AR: New Approaches to Treating Metastatic Prostate Cancer". As castrate resistant prostate cancers escape second generation anti-androgen agents, three phenotypes/genotypes of CRPC appear to be increasing in prevalence and remain resistant to treatment: NeuroEndocrine Prostate Cancer, Persistent AR — Dependent Prostate Cancer, and Androgen Receptor Pathway Independent Prostate Cancer.

DISCUSSION

It is clear that new treatment paradigms need to be developed for this diverse group of diseases. The Prouts Neck 2013 Meeting on Prostate Cancer helped to frame the current state of the field and jumpstart ideas for new avenues of treatment.

### Expression of pleiotrophin in the prostate is androgen regulated and it functions as an autocrine regulator of mesenchyme and cancer associated fibroblasts and as a paracrine regulator of epithelia [^ff872559]. The Prostate (2011). Low credibility.

Ptn is a secreted, highly conserved cytokine, and belongs to a novel two member family of heparin binding molecules, sharing structural and functional similarities with midkine. Ptn is an 18 kDa protein, also known as heparin affin regulatory peptide (HARP) and heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM). Ptn protein interacts with heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) at the extracellular matrix. Biological actions of Ptn are reported to be mediated by at least three different receptors; receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, RPTB/ξ, syndecan-3 (N -syndecan), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Ptn is responsive to regulation by steroid hormones, and Ptn transcript levels are upregulated in the presence of dihydrotestosterone or estradiol, in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

Ptn plays a key role in cellular growth and differentiation and has been implicated as playing an important role during development. Ptn expression is present in tissues during late embryogenesis and perinatal growth, and expression usually decreases around the time of birth. Ptn is most frequently reported in tissues derived from mesoderm and in organs where mesenchymal–epithelial interactions play an important role, such as the salivary gland, lung, pancreas, kidney, and mammary gland–. In branching organs Ptn may also be important for branching morphogensis. Ptn has not previously been studied in the developing prostate, although it is reported to play a role in prostate cancer. Ptn -deficient mice have no gross anatomical abnormalitiesand it has been proposed that Ptn and midkine, which are often co-expressed, might compensate for each other. Mice lacking both Ptn and midkine show female infertility and reproductive abnormalities though no effects upon male fertility or reproductive anatomy were reported.

Clinically localized prostate cancer risk-based management — Clinicians should inform patients that all prostate cancer treatments carry risk. The risks of treatment, in particular to patients' urinary, sexual, and bowel function, must be incorporated with the risk posed by the cancer, patient life expectancy, comorbidities, pre-existing medical conditions, and patient preferences to facilitate a shared decision-making approach to management. Clinicians should provide an individualized risk estimate of post-treatment prostate cancer recurrence to patients with prostate cancer.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis: two different sub-categories according to a previous manipulation of the lower urinary tract [^f9be0206]. World Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bacterial prostatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bacterial prostatitis is an uncommon infection of the prostate gland due to bacteria, usually with severe presentation.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute bacterial prostatitis is an infection of the prostate gland, typically caused by common urinary tract pathogens. The bacteria usually enter the prostate from the urethra, triggering an inflammatory response within the gland. This inflammation can lead to swelling and discomfort in the prostate and surrounding areas.
- **Epidemiology**: Acute bacterial prostatitis constitutes nearly 10% of prostatitis diagnoses, predominantly affecting individuals aged 20–40 and those > 70 years.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute bacterial prostatitis often present with a range of symptoms. These can include fever, chills, and malaise, as well as urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. Some patients may also experience pelvic or perineal pain, and in severe cases, there may be blood in the urine. In some instances, patients may present with symptoms of urosepsis, such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute bacterial prostatitis is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves antibiotics.

NCCN Prostate cancer — principles of surgery: Radical prostatectomy (RP) is an appropriate therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer in patients not on active surveillance who can be completely excised surgically, have a life expectancy of ≥ 10 years, and lack serious comorbid conditions that would contraindicate an elective operation. High-volume surgeons in high-volume centers generally provide better outcomes. Blood loss can be substantial with RP but can be reduced by laparoscopic or robotic assistance or careful control of the dorsal vein complex and periprostatic vessels when performed as open surgery. Urinary incontinence can be reduced by preserving urethral length beyond the apex of the prostate and avoiding damage to the distal sphincter mechanism; bladder neck preservation may decrease the risk, and anastomotic strictures increase the risk of long-term incontinence. Recovery of erectile function is directly related to age at RP, preoperative erectile function, and the degree of preservation of the cavernous nerves; replacement with nerve grafts has not been shown to be beneficial, and early restoration of erections may improve late recovery.

CONCLUSIONS

Prostate cancer encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, ranging from low‐risk disease, in which treatment can only harm and not extend life, to a fatal disease, which still claims too many lives globally. Appropriate risk stratification and individualized treatment are keys to good management. Emerging data and new therapies will continue to refine therapeutic paradigms and improve outcomes for individuals with prostate cancer.
