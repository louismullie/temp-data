## Question

do you need to check urine microalbumin for prediabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether people with prediabetes should have routine urine microalbumin (albumin-to-creatinine ratio, UACR) testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how prediabetes is defined and how UACR is used clinically. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ADA, KDOQI, AACE) actually recommend for screening people with prediabetes. Next, I will examine the evidence on the association between prediabetes and kidney disease, including albuminuria and eGFR decline. After that, I should consider counterarguments and the balance of benefits, costs, and harms. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with clear thresholds for action, while noting any nuances and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Prediabetes encompasses impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or HbA1c 5.7–6.4%, reflecting a state of dysglycemia that increases risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, though it is not diagnostic of diabetes itself. I need to check the test in question too: microalbumin testing in this context means a spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), typically interpreted as < 30 mg/g (A1), 30–300 mg/g (A2, moderately increased albuminuria), and > 300 mg/g (A3, severely increased albuminuria), with confirmation on 2 of 3 samples due to biological variability and transient elevations.

> Now, I should verify guideline positions. The ADA Standards of Care 2025 explicitly recommends assessing kidney function with UACR and eGFR in people with type 1 diabetes of ≥ 5 years' duration and in all people with type 2 diabetes at diagnosis, with annual or more frequent monitoring thereafter based on CKD stage; notably, there is no recommendation to screen people with prediabetes in the absence of established CKD or other risk factors [^114G8dUy] [^115kSSuS] [^112ShP5a]. KDOQI guidance similarly focuses screening on people with diabetes and does not extend routine albuminuria screening to prediabetes in the general population [^112bBHEU] [^112FeZxZ] [^114D9GBw]. AACE 2022 likewise limits annual UACR and eGFR to people with diabetes, not prediabetes [^1132rrLk] [^114D9GBw]. Hold on, I should verify if any of these sources carve out an exception for prediabetes; I don't see a standing recommendation to screen prediabetes broadly for albuminuria in these documents [^114G8dUy] [^112bBHEU] [^1132rrLk] [^112ShP5a].

> Next, I should review the epidemiologic evidence linking prediabetes to kidney outcomes. Meta-analytic data suggest prediabetes is associated with a modestly increased risk of chronic kidney disease, largely driven by albuminuria rather than a fall in eGFR, with pooled relative risk around 1.11–1.12 after adjustment [^111R3UTD]. Large longitudinal cohorts in Japan consistently show that prediabetes associates with new-onset proteinuria over 2 years but not with eGFR decline, supporting albuminuria as the earlier detectable renal signal in dysglycemia [^113DFsvY] [^116t1bwp]. Cross-sectional and population-based studies also report higher prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance even when HbA1c is "normal", reinforcing that dysglycemia and endothelial dysfunction can manifest as albuminuria before diabetes is diagnosed [^113sr4dR] [^111PmgLn].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiologic plausibility so I'm not over-interpreting associations. Prediabetes is linked to glomerular hyperfiltration and endothelial dysfunction, providing a mechanistic basis for albuminuria even when eGFR remains preserved, which aligns with the observation that proteinuria can precede measurable GFR decline in this population [^11777ojF] [^111j69i9]. This pattern supports the biological coherence of albuminuria as an early kidney signal in prediabetes, even if guidelines have not translated this into universal screening recommendations yet [^114D9GBw].

> But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening utility. I need to weigh benefits against potential harms and costs. The benefit side includes earlier detection of CKD risk, which could enable timely lifestyle and blood pressure interventions that modify cardiorenal risk, and potentially the use of agents with kidney-protective effects if albuminuria is present; however, in prediabetes without established CKD, there is no FDA-labeled indication for SGLT2 inhibitors solely on the basis of prediabetes, so pharmacologic kidney-directed therapy would be off-label and evidence is limited in this specific group [^notfound]. The harms include false positives from biological variability, unnecessary anxiety, cascade testing, and added costs, especially if positive results are not confirmed with repeat testing as recommended for albuminuria [^113rzxmp] [^111VG1ea]. Moreover, USPSTF reviews have not found mortality or cardiovascular outcome benefits from population screening strategies for prediabetes or diabetes that include kidney-specific endpoints, which tempers enthusiasm for broad, unfocused screening outside high-risk subgroups [^111A9u3S] [^115vtDsU].

> I should double-check the practical test-performance and operational aspects so my recommendation is feasible. Spot UACR is the preferred screening method because it adjusts for urine concentration and is convenient, but it requires confirmation on 2 of 3 specimens over 3–6 months to classify albuminuria due to high intraindividual variability; transient elevations from exercise, infection, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, or marked hypertension can confound results, and standard dipsticks lack sensitivity for microalbuminuria detection [^113rzxmp] [^111VG1ea] [^113YWT6t]. Implementation data show underuse of UACR even in people with diabetes, and when testing is done, misapplication such as using non-quantitative dipsticks or albumin without creatinine is common, underscoring the need for clear protocols and follow-up if screening is pursued [^111cANd7] [^112dbVfc].

> Let me consider who, if anyone, with prediabetes might merit albuminuria testing despite the absence of a blanket recommendation. Individuals with prediabetes who also have additional CKD risk factors — such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, a family history of kidney disease, obesity/metabolic syndrome, or suspected or known reduced eGFR — are reasonable candidates for targeted UACR testing within a risk-stratified approach, and emerging risk scores for non-diabetic adults can help prioritize screening to those with higher pretest probability of albuminuria [^112ShP5a] [^114D9GBw]. I should confirm that such risk-based screening aligns with guideline logic; while not explicitly endorsed for prediabetes per se, the principle of intensified risk assessment in high-risk non-diabetic adults is consistent with broader CKD and diabetes prevention frameworks [^114D9GBw] [^116dh1sC].

> I will now examine the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. Major diabetes and kidney guidelines do not recommend routine UACR screening for prediabetes in the general population; the signal from prediabetes to albuminuria is real and biologically plausible, but evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that routine screening in prediabetes improves hard outcomes, and potential harms and costs remain concerns without proven net benefit in unselected populations [^114G8dUy] [^112bBHEU] [^114D9GBw] [^111R3UTD] [^111A9u3S]. Therefore, screening is not advised for all with prediabetes; instead, consider UACR testing in prediabetes when additional CKD risk factors are present, with the understanding that any abnormal result should be confirmed per standard protocols before labeling and acting on albuminuria [^113rzxmp] [^111VG1ea].

> Finally, I should translate this into a practical recommendation with clear next steps. For people with prediabetes, do not order routine UACR; instead, use clinical judgment for those with concomitant hypertension, CVD, family history of kidney disease, obesity/metabolic syndrome, or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², where testing may refine risk and guide therapy intensification; if UACR is ≥ 30 mg/g, repeat testing on 2 additional first-morning specimens over 3–6 months to confirm persistence before making a diagnosis of moderately increased albuminuria, and integrate results with blood pressure, glycemic, and lipid management plans rather than treating albuminuria in isolation [^114D9GBw] [^113rzxmp] [^111VG1ea]. If prediabetes progresses to diabetes, then follow standard diabetes CKD screening: obtain UACR and eGFR at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, with more frequent monitoring if CKD is present or advancing [^114G8dUy] [^115kSSuS].

Routine urine microalbumin (ACR) testing is **not recommended for all patients with prediabetes** [^114D9GBw] [^114G8dUy]. It is appropriate to **screen high-risk patients with prediabetes** who have additional risk factors (hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or family history of CKD) [^112ShP5a] because prediabetes increases the risk of albuminuria and CKD [^111R3UTD] [^11119b9w]. Use a spot urine ACR [^115F2XKe] and confirm any elevation with two additional tests over 3–6 months [^113rzxmp] [^111VG1ea]. Routine screening is not advised for low-risk prediabetes without additional risk factors [^114D9GBw].

---

## Prevalence of microalbuminuria in prediabetes

Prediabetes is associated with an increased risk of microalbuminuria [^1173LXqC]; the prevalence is **approximately 15.5%** in people with prediabetes, reflecting early kidney involvement and increased cardiovascular risk [^1173LXqC].

---

## Clinical significance of microalbuminuria in prediabetes

Microalbuminuria is an **early marker of kidney damage** and cardiovascular risk in prediabetes, indicating endothelial dysfunction and increased risk of CKD and cardiovascular events [^1131uyvj] [^1173LXqC]. Its presence signals a higher likelihood of progression to diabetes and related complications [^1173LXqC].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines **do not recommend routine microalbuminuria screening** for all patients with prediabetes [^112ShP5a] [^114D9GBw]. Instead, they advise targeted screening for high-risk individuals — those with additional risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or a family history of CKD [^114D9GBw].

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding microalbuminuria screening in prediabetes** |
|-|-|
| ADA 2025 | - Assess kidney function (UACR and eGFR) in patients with T1DM ≥ 5 years and all T2DM patients [^114G8dUy] [^115kSSuS] <br/> - No routine screening for prediabetes without additional risk factors |
| KDIGO | - No routine screening for prediabetes <br/> - Consider in high-risk individuals with additional risk factors |
| AACE 2022 | - Annual UACR and eGFR in diabetes [^1132rrLk] <br/> - No routine screening for prediabetes without additional risk factors |

---

## Evidence supporting targeted screening in high-risk prediabetes patients

Evidence supports targeted screening in high-risk prediabetes patients [^11632b3r] because prediabetes increases CKD risk, and **early detection enables timely intervention** to slow progression [^111R3UTD] [^115uMQ2N].

---

## Diagnostic methods and interpretation

The recommended method is a **spot urine ACR**, which is convenient, cost-effective, and widely used [^113rzxmp] [^115F2XKe]. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR of 30–300 mg/g; any elevation should be confirmed with two additional tests over 3–6 months to account for variability [^113rzxmp] [^111VG1ea].

---

## Clinical management of microalbuminuria in prediabetes

Management focuses on **risk-factor modification**: optimize blood pressure, glycemic control, and lifestyle (diet, exercise, weight loss) [^1174c1xV] [^1173LXqC]. Pharmacologic therapy (e.g. ACE inhibitors or ARBs) may be considered in patients with hypertension or persistent microalbuminuria.

---

## Potential benefits and limitations of screening

Benefits include **early detection of kidney damage**, enabling timely intervention to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular risk [^1173LXqC] [^111b3w4D]. Limitations include false positives, unnecessary anxiety, and healthcare costs, especially in low-risk populations [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine microalbuminuria screening is **not recommended for all patients with prediabetes** [^112Y2Ggc]. Targeted screening is appropriate for high-risk individuals with additional risk factors, using spot urine ACR with confirmatory testing [^113rzxmp]. This approach balances early detection benefits with the limitations of routine screening.

2.3 Measurements

The database consists of demographic, physical and laboratory data including body mass index (BMI) [weight (kg)/height (m)²], waist circumference (WC), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), FPG, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c), triglycerides, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, serum creatinine and urinary protein. After an overnight fasting, complete medical check‐up was performed in the morning, and blood samples and random urine samples were obtained at each facility. BP was measured after 5 minutes of quiet rest, and mean of two BP measurements at a visit was used. All participants were required to complete self‐administered, standardized questionnaires during health check‐ups to assess for the current intake of medications for diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia; lifestyle habits such as smoking status; daily exercise; eating habit; and history of cardiac disease, stroke and kidney disease. The quality of health check‐up from each facility was standardized as all facilities passed the functional evaluation conducted by the Japan Society of Ningen Dock. In these facilities, health assessments were performed by doctors, nurses, dietitians, laboratory technicians and radiologists who undergo regular training. Therefore, the bias in the measurements is considered to be minimized. Hypertension was defined as BP of ≥ 140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive medications according to the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019). Dyslipidaemia was defined as triglyceride level of ≥ 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/L), HDL cholesterol of ˂40 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol of ≥ 140 mg/dl (3.6 mmol/L) or use of lipid‐lowering medication according to the Japan Atherosclerosis Society guideline.

RECOMMENDATION: URINE ALBUMIN AT CONCENTRATIONS ≥ 30 mg/g CREATININE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CONTINUOUS RISK MARKER FOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS B (moderate).

A. Diagnosis/screening.

Diabetes is associated with a very high rate of cardiovascular events and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western world. Early detection of risk markers, such as albumin in the urine (formerly termed "microalbuminuria"), relies on tests for urinary excretion of albumin. Conventional qualitative tests (chemical strips or "dipsticks") for albuminuria do not detect the small increases of urinary albumin excretion. For this purpose, tests to detect albumin concentrations are used (Table 7). Low levels of albuminuria have been defined by the Joint National Committee (JNC) 7 and the ADA and have more recently been redefined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Committee (,–) as excretion of 30–300 mg of albumin/24 h, 20–200 μg/min, or 30–300 μg/mg creatinine (Table 8) on two of three urine collections. Recent data, however, suggest that risk extends below the lower limit of 20 μg/min, reinforcing the notion that this factor is a continuous variable for cardiovascular risk.

### Association of elevated glycosylated hemoglobin A1c with hyperfiltration in a middle-aged and elderly Chinese population with prediabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes: a cross-sectional study [^111j69i9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

With the continuing increase in the number of patients with diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in China, the USA, and Europe. DN develops in 40% of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and in 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial-Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT-EDIC) study suggested that blood glucose levels at the time of the measurement of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may bias the results. Indeed, in patients with T1DM, the risk of impaired eGFR was lower for those treated early and aggressively compared with those with conventional treatments. Thus, early diagnosis of DN and early intervention are very important.

Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) is widely accepted as being a good indicator of blood glucose control. In 2010, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended that a HbAlc of 6.5% or higher be used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. In 2012, the ADA further recommended an HbAlc of 5.7–6.4% as a screening criterion for individuals with high risk for future diabetes (prediabetes). A community-based study has suggested that baseline HbA1c is a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose. However, very few studies have focused on the relationship between an HbA1c < 6.5% and hyperfiltration.

Previous studies have indicated that patients with prediabetes (based on impaired fasting glucose [IFG], impaired glucose tolerance [IGT] or HbA1c of 5.7–6.4%) are at high risk of future T2DM and have impaired endothelial diastolic function. In addition, the IGT group showed microalbuminuria and elevated levels of urinary albumin excretion rate. Measurement of eGFR and detection of microalbuminuria are the main methods recommended by the ADA, the National Kidney Foundation, and the International Society of Nephrology for the screening of DN and the monitoring of its progression in the clinical setting. However, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study found that 51% of patients with T2DM without albuminuria subsequently developed chronic renal insufficiency. Moreover, microalbuminuria does not necessarily lead to macroalbuminuria, and in fact may regress spontaneously. Furthermore, eGFR is a sensitive indicator of renal hemodynamics, and may have advantages over microalbuminuria in the detection of DN.

### Spot urinary microalbumin concentration, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: tehran lipid and glucose study [^112XT6EV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study include the relatively large and representative sample and defining comprehensive models to adjust the significant potential confounders. However, the present study has some limitations. First, it was a cross-sectional study, and we cannot conclude any causal inference between urinary microalbumin concentrations and the risk of developing MetS and T2DM. Well-designed prospective cohort studies with a long follow-up period should conduct to confirm the association between spot urinary microalbumin and risk of MetS and T2DM incidence. Although previous studies indicated an association between elevated urinary microalbumin and metabolic disorders, the current study addressed new cut-off values (both for urinary microalbumin and MCR) for predicting T2DM and MetS. However, prospective studies are needed to examine the predictive power of the cut-offs for the development and prognosis of the outcomes. Second, urinary microalbumin was determined based on spot urine samples, which may lead to ignoring day-to-day differences in the urinary microalbumin concentration and potential differences at different hours of a day. Although the spot urine sampling is cost-effective and straightforward for population-based studies and has some advantages, i.e. rapid, deep freezing after collection in the absence of any antiseptic agent, it might be less accurate than the 24-h urine collections for the assessment of albumin excretion. However, studies reported a good correlation between spot urine, either first morning or random morning urine, with the 24-h albumin excretion rate. Third, the ROC curve analyses indicated a relatively small effect size of microalbumin for predicting T2DM and MetS in the general population; however, a small effect size epidemiologic studies or large-scale assessment may be translated into a relevant magnitude in clinical settings. In turn, such population-based cut-off estimation may be favorably used to promote diagnostic criteria in clinical practices.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^114yMu8q]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Identifying a simple, safe, and inexpensive tool to improve prediction of future diabetes would be an important public health achievement, especially in light of the ongoing diabetes pandemic. Preliminary results from several observational studies raise the possibility that low levels of ACR could play such a role, with further (indirect) evidence being that proteinuria-reducing antihypertensive agents are associated with a reduced risk of incident diabetes. However, in the present study, the largest study of pre-diabetic individuals to date, we did not find that ACR had any independent predictive value.

Our study hypothesis was not necessarily dependent upon a causal link between increasing ACR and onset of diabetes. For example, one possible premise is that exposure to levels of glycemia below what is conventionally considered pathological induces changes in renal handling of urinary albumin, which in turn would lead to increased ACR. Alternatively, increased ACR could simply be one of a number of early, organ-specific manifestations of insulin resistance that herald the onset of diabetes. Regardless, we felt it important to test this hypothesis, especially given prior findings.

### Evaluating the safety and efficacy of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in subjects with prediabetes: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^115Wx4uA]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

In terms of urinary evaluations, participants' urine samples will be subjected to routine testing (automated urinalysis instrument). Urine creatinine levels will be gauged (picric acid method), and albumin/creatinine ratio levels will be measured to monitor for early signs of proteinuria.

Fecal samples from participants will undergo routine examinations under microscopic observations.

For male volunteers aged between 18 and 50 years, semen samples will be analyzed with the sperm quality analyzer and computer-aided semen analysis system. After collection, these samples will undergo incubation at 37 °C for 0.5–1 h and will be checked for the absence of liquefaction before centralized assessment at the Department of Reproduction Center at Peking University Third Hospital.

Upon collection, all specimens — with the exception of semen samples — will be processed promptly within 2 h at the centralized laboratory of the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Peking University Third Hospital. Following their analyses, all samples, including the semen samples, will be stored in the Peking University Third Hospital Biobank for a maximum duration of 15 years, subject to ethical board clearance. At the conclusion of this period, any remaining samples will be disposed in accordance with relevant guidelines.

Intervention Visits

Regular telephone follow-ups are carried out at week 4 and week 8 to assess medication adherence, potential adverse drug reactions, and physical activity. Table 1 delineates the specific content arrangements within the follow-up procedures.

### Prediabetes is associated with proteinuria development but not with glomerular filtration rate decline: a longitudinal observational study [^116BF48F]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Diabetes is recognized as the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the association of prediabetes with CKD remains unclear, in particular, the independent effect of prediabetes on proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has not been evaluated. This study aimed to investigate the associations of prediabetes with the proteinuria development and with eGFR decline separately in the Japanese general population without CKD.

Methods

Participants who underwent health check-ups in 2014 and had adequate data after 2 years were retrospectively analysed. A total of 405,487 participants without CKD (eGFR, ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m², with negative or trace urinary protein) at baseline were categorized according to fasting plasma glucose as having diabetes (≥ 126 mg/dl [7.0 mmol/l]), prediabetes (100–125 mg/dl [5.6–6.9 mmol/l]) or normal glucose level (˂100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l]). Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the effects of prediabetes (vs. normal glucose level) on the proteinuria development (urinary protein of ≥ 1+) and eGFR decline (˂60 mL/min/1.73 m²) after 2 years.

Results

After 2 years, 7037 participants (1.7%) developed proteinuria alone, 19,015 (4.7%) presented eGFR decline alone and 636 (0.2%) showed both proteinuria and eGFR decline. Compared to normal glucose level and adjusting for prognostic factors, prediabetes was independently associated with the proteinuria development (odds ratio [OR] 1.233; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.170–1.301], whereas prediabetes was not associated with eGFR decline (OR 0.981; 95% CI 0.947–1.017).

Conclusions

Prediabetes is associated with the proteinuria development but not with eGFR decline in the general population.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113UDKKL]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An estimated 13% of all US adults (18 years or older) have diabetes, and 34.5% meet criteria for prediabetes. The prevalences of prediabetes and diabetes are higher in older adults. Estimates of the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes vary widely, perhaps because of differences in the definition of prediabetes or the heterogeneity of prediabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and new cases of blindness among adults in the US. It is also associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and was estimated to be the seventh leading cause of death in the US in 2017. Screening asymptomatic adults for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes may allow earlier detection, diagnosis, and treatment, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes.

Objective

To update its 2015 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and preventive interventions for those with prediabetes.

Population

Nonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who have overweight or obesity (defined as a body mass index ≥ 25 and ≥ 30, respectively) and no symptoms of diabetes.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and offering or referring patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions has a moderate net benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions. (B recommendation).

### Guidelines adherence in the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus on the background of recent European recommendations-a registry-based analysis [^112dbVfc]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are a number of potential reasons for this low screening rate. First, it may be the result of partial guideline inconsistencies. For example, the 2020 ADA guidelines recommend only to screen for CKD in type 1 diabetes if diabetes duration is ≥ 5 years. This criterion is not met for at least some of the patients in the current dataset with a median diabetes duration of 11.9 years and an interquartile range of 2.7 to 25.0 years. Secondly, as multiple determinations of urinary albumin (at least two tests out of three need to be positive to arrive at a diagnosis of microalbuminuria) are necessary, the efforts for screening may be perceived to be high. Conversely, albuminuria tests are sometimes regarded as unreliable, especially if only performed once. Thirdly, not every physician's office is able to collect urinary samples, which may appear unhygienic and, thus, not desirable. As a potential limitation, we did not explore whether a twice-annual monitoring of kidney function is actually performed in patients with advanced disease (urinary albumin > 30 mg/g creatinine and/or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²). Some patients counted as screened in our analysis, would not be classified based on a requirement for two annual investigations as suggested by the ADA.

Finally, only about half of all patients in our database were screened based on both urinary albumin and creatinine. As opposed to the majority of guidelines, a determination of urinary albumin without normalization to creatinine appears to be frequent in clinical practice. This is of concern as a simple urinary dipstick test has a lower sensitivity and higher false-discovery rate compared to UACR-based screening. It has been previously described that there is no standardised method of collection and measurement of urinary albumin and creatinine and there are concerns about test reliability, intra-individual variability based on body position, activity and temperature.

### Poor adherence to clinical practice guidelines: a call to action for increased albuminuria testing in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111cANd7]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

We describe the substantial shortfall in adherence to guideline-recommended albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) testing for people in the United States with type 2 diabetes. Poor compliance with current guidelines leads to delays in diagnosis-and treatment- of chronic kidney disease, which adversely affects clinical outcomes and contributes to incremental economic burden.

Guidelines for diabetes and CKD — Likelihood of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria is stratified as follows: for GFR > 60 mL/min (CKD stage 1 + 2), normoalbuminuria is labeled "At risk", microalbuminuria "Possible DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD"; for GFR 30–60 mL/min (stage 3), normoalbuminuria "Unlikely DKD", microalbuminuria "Possible DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD"; for GFR < 30 mL/min (stage 4 + 5), normoalbuminuria "Unlikely DKD", microalbuminuria "DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD". Staging caveats note that "RAS blockade could render microalbuminuric patients normoalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric patients microalbuminuric", and in early diabetes "GFR less than 90 mL/min may represent a significant loss of function".

In conclusion, prediabetes was found to be associated with the proteinuria development but not with eGFR decline in the general population without CKD after 2 years. Proteinuria in prediabetes might be an earlier detectable renal change, and the screening for prediabetes and evaluation of proteinuria are important for the prevention of CKD. Future prospective studies examining whether lifestyle interventions for prediabetes is effective for the improvement of proteinuria are needed to prove the importance of evaluating proteinuria in prediabetes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past decades, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased worldwide to a pandemic scale. It has been estimated that the number of individuals with yet undiagnosed diabetes was as high as 193 million in 2015 and is expected to increase further by 2040 to 642 million people with diabetes and 481 million people with prediabetes. 1 Diabetes constitutes a major challenge for public healthcare systems as untreated hyperglycaemia can result in micro‐ and macrovascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy, chronic kidney failure, diabetic polyneuropathy or coronary artery disease and stroke. 2 One early sign of diabetic complications is moderately increased albuminuria. It is an indicator of chronic kidney damage and it is correlated with the risk of cardiovascular events. 3 To prevent the development or progression of such complications, early detection of individuals with yet unrecognized prediabetes and diabetes is of importance. The traditionally established measurements of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) have major drawbacks such as need for compliance to 8‐hour fasting and large intraindividual variability. 4, 5 In the current position statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and in the statement of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), it is recommended to use glycated haemoglobin HbA1c as the preferred diagnostic tool for diabetes screening to overcome these limitations. 6, 7 Some guidelines, including those of the German Diabetes Association, recommend a stepwise diagnostic approach using HbA1c as a first screening test with two different cut‐off values for the diagnostic decision, of which the lower cut‐off is used to rule out diabetes and the higher cut‐off is used to diagnose diabetes without measuring FPG and/or two‐hour postload glucose levels (2 h‐PG). In this setting, FPG and/or 2 h‐PG are only measured if the HbA1c concentration is between these two cut‐offs. 8, 9, 10

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^112fDbCP]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Our study contributes new information that has been lacking in several important ways. First, our cohort was composed exclusively of individuals who were at high risk of developing diabetes on the basis of elevated fasting glucose and IGT plus overweight or obesity (for the majority). Because our sample size was far larger than all the IGT subgroups from the previously mentioned studies combined, it is unlikely that our negative findings were related to insufficient statistical power. Interestingly, despite their elevated risk for diabetes, the great majority of our cohort did not have microalbuminuria. Second, we analyzed ACR throughout its continuous range, avoiding artificial cutoff values, such as microalbuminuria, that could limit its descriptive utility. On the other hand, the DPP included very few subjects with micro- or macroalbuminuria, which could have reduced the power to show an association in these ranges and the generalizability of our results. Indeed, the predictive power of ACR could have been obscured by the increased risk for development of diabetes present in the DPP cohort at baseline. The fact that ACR was so closely associated with insulin or glycemic parameters supports this hypothesis. In addition, we excluded individuals with chronic kidney disease, further reducing generalizability, and measured ACR only once at baseline. ACR can be affected by diet, physical activity, and other habits, which may have introduced some variability into our findings, although this would be limited somewhat by the uniform collection criterion (i.e. fasting morning sample). Finally, major differences between the DPP and prior studies were the ethnically and culturally diverse cohort and the fact that we detected early diabetes by annual or semiannual surveillance glucose tolerance tests using accepted criteria, thus reducing the likelihood that ACR reflected prior exposure to severe hyperglycemia.

The study hypothesis was based on the presumption that subtle damage occurs within the kidney in the pre-diabetic state — whether from chronic exposure to abnormal glycemia that is below the formal threshold for diabetes, elevated intrarenal blood pressure, or oxidative stress (22), among other causes — that manifests itself as elevated ACR. ACR, as a subtle marker of incipient damage, could in turn herald the onset of diabetes. Although we did not confirm such a relationship, this does not exclude the possibility that ACR can predict hard outcomes in this population, as it has in others.

In summary, in a population of subjects at elevated risk for diabetes, ACR below the microalbuminuria range does not predict incident diabetes.

Conclusions

SCH has a significant impact on UACR in patients with T2DM. It is necessary to screen for thyroid function in patients with T2DM.

### Diagnostic performance of random urine samples using albumin concentration vs ratio of albumin to creatinine for microalbuminuria screening in patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HQ7aW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

A random urine sample measuring the albumin concentration (UAC) without simultaneously measuring the urinary creatinine is less expensive than measuring the ratio of albumin to creatinine (ACR), but comparisons of their diagnostic performance for microalbuminuria screening among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have not been undertaken in previous meta-analyses.

Objective

To compare the diagnostic performance of the UAC vs the ACR in random urine samples for microalbuminuria screening among patients with DM.

Data Sources

Electronic literature searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus for English-language publications from the earliest available date of indexing through July 31, 2012.

Study Selection

Clinical studies assessing the UAC or the ACR of random urine samples in detecting the presence of microalbuminuria among patients with DM using a urinary albumin excretion rate of 30 to 300 mg/d in 24-hour timed urine collections as the criterion standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Bivariate random-effects models for analysis and pooling of the diagnostic performance measures across studies, as well as comparisons between different screening tests.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the diagnostic performance measures of the UAC or the ACR in random urine samples, as well as comparisons between them.

Results

We identified 14 studies, with a total of 2078 patients; 9 studies reported on the UAC, and 12 studies reported on the ACR. Meta-analysis showed pooled sensitivities of 0.85 and 0.87 for the UAC and the ACR, respectively, and pooled specificities of 0.88 and 0.88, respectively. No differences in sensitivity (P = 0.70), specificity (P = 0.63), or diagnostic odds ratios (P = 0.59) between the UAC and the ACR were found. The time point of urine collection did not affect the diagnostic performance of either test.

Conclusions and Relevance

The UAC and the ACR yielded high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of microalbuminuria. Because the diagnostic performance of the UAC is comparable to that of the ACR, our findings indicate that the UAC of random urine samples may become the screening tool of choice for the population with DM, considering the rising incidence of DM and the constrained health care resources in many countries.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^111b3w4D]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

### Association of high pulse pressure with proteinuria in subjects with diabetes, prediabetes, or normal glucose tolerance in a large Japanese general population sample [^115U1JZx]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Urinalysis by the dipstick method was performed on a single spot urine specimen collected in the early morning after overnight fasting. Urine dipstick results are interpreted by the medical staff in each local medical institution and recorded as −, ±, 1+, 2+, and 3+. In Japan, it is recommended and widely adopted by the activity of the Japanese Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards that all urine dipstick tests be manufactured so that a urine dipstick result of 1+ will correspond to a urinary protein level of 30 mg/dL. In the current study, proteinuria was defined as 1+ or more. eGFR was derived using the following equation: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 194 × age(years)⁻⁰.²⁸⁷ × serum creatinine(mg/dL)⁻¹.⁰⁹⁴ (if women × 0.739).

### Prediabetes is associated with proteinuria development but not with glomerular filtration rate decline: a longitudinal observational study [^116THmFE]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This is the largest study that investigated the association of prediabetes with proteinuria development and eGFR decline separately among 405,487 individuals, and clearly demonstrated that prediabetes was independently associated with the proteinuria development but not with eGFR decline after 2 years.

While most previous studies defined CKD as the combination of albuminuria (or proteinuria) and low eGFR, we investigated the association of prediabetes with the proteinuria development and with eGFR decline separately in this study. Our data demonstrated that prediabetes was independently associated with the proteinuria development; however, prediabetes when adjusted for prognostic factors was not associated with eGFR decline. We also showed that prediabetes was associated with the composite renal outcome (defined as the combination of proteinuria and eGFR decline). These results are consistent with a previous meta‐analysis (mean duration of follow‐up, 6 years) showing that prediabetes is moderately associated with CKD (defined as the combination of albuminuria [or proteinuria] and low eGFR), as well as with majority of cohort studies (duration of follow‐up: 3.8–8 years) reporting that prediabetes is not associated with low eGFR alone. People with prediabetes present with hyperfiltration. This might be one of the reasons why eGFR decline was not observed in individuals with prediabetes after 2 years.

A recent study, a secondary analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), investigated the association of impaired fasting glucose with albuminuria and worsening eGFR, and reported that impaired fasting glucose was not associated with the albuminuria development or worsening eGFR. In the study, all participants had hypertension and at least one additional CVD risk factor at baseline, which are factors leading to the albuminuria development. Thus, prediabetes may not be an independent additional risk factor for the albuminuria development among participants who are already at high risk for it. Our study population consisted of participants undergoing a health check‐up with lower rate of hypertension and lower risk for CVD. Thus, prediabetes is suggested to be associated with the proteinuria development among patients in the general population and that proteinuria development is an earlier detectable renal change in patients with prediabetes.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112bBHEU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

### Effect of oral fluid intake on urinary albumin excretion in diabetes mellitus [^112T67sQ]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2002). Low credibility.

The importance of routine screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes has gained widespread acceptance. Since shortened collection times and random urine sampling facilitate outpatient testing for patients, it is necessary to establish whether a recent fluid intake might alter test results. Specifically, does an oral fluid load (15 ml/kg) effect urinary albumin excretion in Type I diabetes? Indeed, we show that fluid intake had a significant impact: albumin concentration decreased, whereas the albumin/creatinine ratio (A/C) and albumin excretion rate increased (P < .001) significantly.

Biochemical tests

Identifying and monitoring diabetes-associated CKD primarily involves the assessment of kidney damage (albuminuria) and kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). The general recommendation is that CKD screening in individuals with diabetes should begin within five years after the diagnosis of T1DM and at the diagnosis of T2DM, which should include measuring urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) to detect microalbuminuria and serum creatinine (and/or cystatin C) for the calculation of eGFR (Table 2). These biochemical screening tests have practical advantages and limitations.

Albuminuria

Albuminuria is a major prognostic factor for CKD progression, morbidity, and mortality from CVD, as it is often the first clinical indicator of CKD in people with diabetes. However, despite albuminuria being a clinically useful tool for predicting prognosis and monitoring response to therapy, there are limitations to its usefulness.

The variability of urinary albumin, the method used to diagnose albuminuria, whether it be urinary albumin excretion rate (uAER), uACR, or by dipstick, has implications in lower-income settings. The assessment of uAER, whether timed or 24-h collections, is a more accurate measure of albumin concentration than uACR; however, it is cumbersome, and the precision of urine collection is questionable, whereas measurement of albumin from spot urine samples, without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine, is less expensive but less accurate. The dipstick test for urinary protein, which is the most frequently used test in LMICs due to its cost-effectiveness and accessibility, is even less accurate, as it is insensitive to reliably detect albumin concentrations in ranges < 300 mg/day, and it correlates poorly with uACR.

Pediatric diabetes mellitus — key definitions and thresholds include the following: In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, criteria 1–3 should be confirmed by repeat testing. Fasting blood glucose is obtained before the first meal of the day after a fast of at least 8 hours. Microalbuminuria is defined as an albumin:creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine but < 300 mg/g creatinine. Moderate hyperglycemia is blood glucose = 180–250 mg/dL, while severe hyperglycemia is blood glucose > 250 mg/dL. Weight categories are specified as obese when body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th percentile for age and gender and overweight when BMI is between the 85th and 94th percentile for age and gender. Prediabetes includes fasting plasma glucose ≥ 100–125 mg/dL or a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 5.7% to 6.4%. Exercise intensity can be gauged with the "talk test", where during moderate activity a person can talk but not sing, and during vigorous activity a person cannot talk without pausing to catch a breath.

### Cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes: what the non-specialist needs to know about current guidelines [^1132cVPV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In the US, approximately 11% of the population have diagnosed diabetes and nearly 40% have prediabetes. In addition, chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 14% of the US population including up to 40% of those with diabetes. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide where it affects approximately half of adults. The presence of CKD or diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular events. When both CKD and diabetes occur in the same patient the risks are further increased. The clinical problems of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia are all closely related with obesity, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, CKD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. The increasing frequency of obesity has driven increases in all of these medical comorbidities. These conditions frequently cluster together in the same patient exacerbating the risk of morbidity and mortality. They are also associated with cognitive dysfunction/dementia, pulmonary diseases, cancers, gastrointestinal diseases, immune system abnormalities, and inflammatory disorders. Only 6.8% of adults in US meet all targets for cardiovascular risk management with significant disparities based on race and ethnicity. Given the complexity of these multisystem problems in people with diabetes and obesity, it would seem reasonable to attempt to diagnose and treat many of the comorbidities earlier in the course of disease rather than wait for substantial end organ dysfunction to occur. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recently published a consensus statement recommending early screening for the diagnosis of heart failure, CKD and diabetes, recognizing both the frequency and gravity of this combination. Likewise, there are recommendations in the guidelines to facilitate screening for microalbuminuria, blood pressure, glycemic control and lipids earlier in patients at risk rather than wait and treat as a secondary prevention program. Thus, the general principle is to facilitate earlier recognition and diagnosis and provide treatment before downstream target organ complications occur. This review will focus on CVD and risk management based on newest recommendations and standards of care in people with diabetes by the ADA. The main considerations in the treatment of people with diabetes are glycemic control, blood pressure, lipids, and the use of medications with proven cardiorenal disease progression capability to prevent or delay.

### Using risk assessment to improve screening for albuminuria among US adults without diabetes [^112ShP5a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines currently recommend annual screening for albuminuria only among persons with diabetes mellitus (DM). There is no guidance about albuminuria screening in those with other important risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as hypertension and/or family history of kidney disease. We sought to create a risk score that predicts the likelihood of albuminuria in adults without diabetes to prompt earlier detection and management of CKD.

Methods

Data from 44,322 participants without diabetes, aged 18+years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999–2020 were analyzed. Survey-weighted logistic regression was used to assess associations between individual characteristics and presence of albuminuria (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio [UACR] ≥ 30 mg/g), including interaction terms, in three separate models. The sample was divided equally into development and validation data sets. C-statistics were used to assess model fit.

Results

The prevalence of albuminuria was 9.7% in the US adult population. Higher odds of albuminuria among the non-diabetic population were observed in females, non-Hispanic Black, and smokers, as well as those with low eGFR, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, prediabetes, low HDL cholesterol, and high uric acid levels. Age showed a J-shaped relationship with albuminuria, with lowest odds for ages 25–64 years. The C-statistic was 0.756 for the developmental and 0.752 for the validation set of the final model. Using this model, screening individuals with a predicted probability of ≥ 5% would capture 85% of individuals with albuminuria.

Conclusions

These results suggest that it may be helpful to use a risk score framework for albuminuria screening in people without DM to encourage earlier detection and management of CKD. Longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm this approach along with evaluation of its cost effectiveness.

Diabetes is recognized as the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the association of prediabetes with CKD remains unclear, in particular, the independent effect of prediabetes on proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has not been evaluated. This study aimed to investigate the associations of prediabetes with the proteinuria development and with eGFR decline separately in the Japanese general population without CKD.

Methods

Participants who underwent health check‐ups in 2014 and had adequate data after 2 years were retrospectively analysed. A total of 405,487 participants without CKD (eGFR, ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m², with negative or trace urinary protein) at baseline were categorized according to fasting plasma glucose as having diabetes (≥ 126 mg/dl [7.0 mmol/l]), prediabetes (100–125 mg/dl [5.6–6.9 mmol/l]) or normal glucose level (˂100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l]). Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the effects of prediabetes (vs. normal glucose level) on the proteinuria development (urinary protein of ≥ 1+) and eGFR decline (˂60 mL/min/1.73 m²) after 2 years.

Results

After 2 years, 7037 participants (1.7%) developed proteinuria alone, 19,015 (4.7%) presented eGFR decline alone and 636 (0.2%) showed both proteinuria and eGFR decline. Compared to normal glucose level and adjusting for prognostic factors, prediabetes was independently associated with the proteinuria development (odds ratio [OR] 1.233; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.170–1.301], whereas prediabetes was not associated with eGFR decline (OR 0.981; 95% CI 0.947–1.017).

Conclusions

Prediabetes is associated with the proteinuria development but not with eGFR decline in the general population.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — ACR should be measured in first-void urine samples, but if a random urine specimen is abnormal, the second test could be done in a first-voided morning sample obtained within the subsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, if leading to multifactorial interventions, can result in reduced risks of cardiovascular events, progression of albuminuria, and development or progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, whereas similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetes are lacking. International control between laboratories should be established, and there should also be standardized reporting of ACRs with internationally agreed-upon categorical definitions.

In all patients with diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors should be assessed at least annually. These risk factors include dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, a positive family history of premature coronary disease, and the presence of micro- or macroalbuminuria. Abnormal risk factors should be treated as described elsewhere in these guidelines. Patients at increased CHD risk should receive aspirin and a statin, and ACE inhibitor, or ARB therapy if hypertensive, unless there are contraindications to a particular drug class. While clear benefit exists for ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy in patients with nephropathy or hypertension, the benefits in patients with CVD in the absence of these conditions is less clear, especially when LDL cholesterol is concomitantly controlled.

### Prediabetes is associated with proteinuria development but not with glomerular filtration rate decline: a longitudinal observational study [^114UEcv8]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding the strengths of our study, a large general population was analysed throughout Japan, including a large number of participants with prediabetes or NGL. In addition, the data quality control was rigorous and standardized as all facilities passed the functional evaluation conducted by the Japan Society of Ningen Dock. However, several limitations still exist in this study. First, as the diagnosis of NGL, prediabetes and diabetes was based on a single assessment of FPG, there is a limit to the accuracy of the classification. For example, some participants defined to have prediabetes may have FPG levels reaching the diagnostic threshold of diabetes the following day. However, we also performed analyses when participants with HbA 1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) at baseline were classified as having diabetes, and the results were consistent with those of the main analyses. Second, this study only included individuals who had health check‐up data after 2 years. Of 412,391 participants who had health check‐up data and did not present with CKD at baseline, 6904 were excluded due to the lack of data after 2 years. However, this number was relatively smaller than that of individuals who were included in the analysis (n = 405,487). In addition, individuals who did not have data after 2 years (n = 6904) commonly included those who had retired, transferred or changed jobs. Therefore, it was unlikely that selection bias affected the results on kidney function after 2 years. Third, the urine dipstick test was used to evaluate proteinuria in this study. It was not quantitative and false‐positive results are possible under certain conditions, such as highly concentrated or alkaline urine. However, previous studies considered urine dipsticks ≥ 1+ as proteinuria development, and urine dipstick tests are widely used in the health check‐up and are more economical for screening. Fourth, since the details of antihypertensive medications were unknown in this study, a potential effect on proteinuria development of these medications (e.g. renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockade) was not considered. Fifth, as the study population consisted of Japanese people, in which ethnicity is limited, confirmation in other ethnic groups is needed. Finally, the long‐term effect of prediabetes on renal outcomes was not examined because of the short follow‐up period.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

### Unmasking the hidden burden of prediabetes on kidney function [^114zi9nJ]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Melsom et al. provide compelling evidence that prediabetes is associated with accelerated decline in kidney function when measured by measured glomerular filtration rate using iohexol clearance, a relationship not detected using estimated glomerular filtration rate equations. These findings challenge current screening practices and suggest that the burden of kidney disease in individuals with prediabetes may be underestimated. The study underscores the need for more accurate kidney function assessments and earlier intervention in at-risk populations.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The eligibility criteria, design, and methods of the DPP have been reported elsewhere. In brief, eligibility criteria included age ≥ 25 years, BMI ≥ 24 kg/m² (≥ 22 kg/m² in Asian Americans), and fasting plasma glucose levels between 95 and 125 mg/dl (lower limit did not apply to the American Indian centers) in addition to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (plasma glucose of 140–199 mg/dl 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load). Participants were recruited from 27 U.S. study sites and were excluded if they had conditions that would impair their ability to participate or took certain medicines, including thiazide diuretics and β-blockers. All participants gave informed consent and signed documents approved by the institutional review board at each center. Eligible participants received standard advice on a healthy diet and physical activity and were randomly assigned to one of three additional interventions (intensive lifestyle intervention versus metformin versus matching placebo).

### Association of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio with cardiometabolic risk markers and pre-diabetes in adults with normoglycemia, normoalbuminuria, and normotension with parental type 2 diabetes [^114zrBXK]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Increased urinary excretion of albumin is a marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiometabolic and renal risk, especially in people with diabetes or hypertension. Even modest changes in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) within the normal range have been associated with increased risks of hypertension and cardiovascular risk. Elevated urinary albumin excretion has been associated with increased risk of new-onset diabetes, but it is unknown whether the link between albuminuria and glucose dysregulation precedes diabetes diagnosis. Pre-diabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), represents an intermediate stage in the progression from normal glucose regulation to type 2 diabetes. The risk factors for pre-diabetes overlap considerably with those of type 2 diabetes. Given the reported association between albuminuria with endothelial dysfunction, cardiometabolic risk, and new-onset diabetes, we determined whether a more proximal relationship exists between albuminuria and early dysglycemia.

Because urinary albumin excretion is a continuous variable, with a known conventional upper limit, we were interested in determining whether albuminuria within the normal reference range is associated with cardiometabolic risk markers. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that albumin excretion within the normal reference range among normoglycemic, normotensive persons is associated with cardiometabolic risk markers and pre-diabetes. We tested our hypothesis in a large population of initially normoglycemic black or African American and white or European American participants enrolled in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (POP-ABC) Study. The POP-ABC participants were followed up at quarterly intervals for 5.5 years, the primary outcome being progression from normoglycemia to incident pre-diabetes. Using this prospective cohort, we have documented the association between urinary albumin excretion at enrollment and some cardiometabolic risk markers and incident pre-diabetes among initially normoglycemic, normotensive and normoalbuminuric study participants.

### Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in US adults with undiagnosed diabetes or prediabetes [^11119b9w]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diagnosed diabetes is known to be high, but little is known about the prevalence of CKD in those with undiagnosed diabetes or prediabetes. We aimed to estimate and compare the community prevalence of CKD among people with diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, prediabetes, or no diabetes.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The 1999 through 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a representative survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. Participants who were aged ≥ 20 years; responded to the diabetes questionnaire; and had fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum creatinine, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio measurements were included (N = 8188). Diabetes status was defined as follows: Diagnosed diabetes, self-reported provider diagnosis (n = 826); undiagnosed diabetes, FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl without self-reported diagnosis (n = 299); prediabetes, FPG ≥ 100 and < 126 mg/dl (n = 2272); and no diabetes, FPG < 100 mg/dl (n = 4791). Prevalence of CKD was defined by estimated GFR 15 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or albumin-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g; adjustment was performed with multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Fully 39.6% of people with diagnosed and 41.7% with undiagnosed diabetes had CKD; 17.7% with prediabetes and 10.6% without diabetes had CKD. Age-, gender-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted prevalence of CKD was 32.9, 24.2, 17.1, and 11.8%, for diagnosed, undiagnosed, pre-, and no diabetes, respectively. Among those with CKD, 39.1% had undiagnosed or prediabetes.

Conclusions

CKD prevalence is high among people with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes. These individuals might benefit from interventions aimed at preventing development and/or progression of both CKD and diabetes.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^116iFUWP]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Results from previous observational studies have supported an association between urinary albumin excretion and incident diabetes. In a longitudinal study of 2,205 American Indians, ACR of ≥ 30 mg/day (i.e. microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria) predicted incident diabetes over an average of 4 years of follow-up in a combined group of men with normal or IGT (odds ratio 2.19 [95% CI 1.48–3.21]) and women with baseline IGT only (2.69 [1.41–5.21]). A prospective, community-based Dutch study of 5,654 individuals with normal or impaired glucose tolerance found a stepwise increase in the 4-year risk of incident diabetes by baseline urinary albumin excretion as measured by 24-h urine collections (tertile 1, ≤ 6.9 mg/kg, 1.8%; tertile 2, 6.9–12.4 mg/kg, 2.3%; tertile 3, ≥ 12.4 mg/kg, 5.8%; P < 0.001). Results were relatively unchanged when individuals with baseline IGT were excluded from the analysis. Mykkänen et al. observed a significantly higher proportion of baseline microalbuminuria (44.4% vs. 30.4%, P = 0.017) in elderly Finns who developed diabetes after 3.5 years of follow-up (compared with those who did not), although there was no actual difference in mean ACR between groups. In this study, the increased odds of developing diabetes were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for fasting plasma glucose and insulin.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^1114tBnh]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) reflects urinary albumin excretion and is increasingly being accepted as an important clinical outcome predictor. Because of the great public health need for a simple and inexpensive test to identify individuals at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes, it has been suggested that the ACR might serve this purpose. We therefore determined whether the ACR could predict incident diabetes in a well-characterized cohort of pre-diabetic Americans.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 3,188 Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) participants with a mean BMI of 34 kg/m(2) and elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and baseline urinary albumin excretion measurements were followed for incident diabetes over a mean of 3.2 years.

Results

Of the participants, 94% manifested ACR levels below the microalbuminuria range and 21% ultimately developed diabetes during follow-up. Quartiles of ACR (median [range] within quartiles: 1, 3.0 [0.7–3.7]; 2, 4.6 [3.7–5.5]; 3, 7.1 [5.5–9.7]; and 4, 16.5 [9.7–1,578]) were positively associated with age, markers of adiposity and insulin secretion and resistance, blood pressure, and use of antihypertensive agents with antiproteinuric effects and inversely related to male sex and serum creatinine. An elevated hazard rate for developing diabetes with doubling of ACR disappeared after adjustment for covariates. Within the DPP intervention groups (placebo, lifestyle, and metformin), we found no consistent trend in incident diabetes by quartile or decile of ACR.

Conclusions

An ACR at levels below the microalbuminuria range does not independently predict incident diabetes in adults at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

### Screening, monitoring, and treatment of albuminuria: public health perspectives [^1131uyvj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria is an early sign of progressive cardiovascular and renal disease in individuals with and without diabetes. Despite compelling data, at present only a minority of patients with diabetes and rarely individuals without diabetes are screened for albuminuria in a systematic way. All of the criteria to implement systematic albuminuria screening are fulfilled in diabetes, and most are nearly fulfilled for microalbuminuria screening in individuals without diabetes. Because of the growing evidence that treatment of microalbuminuria in individuals without diabetes may offer a cost-effective benefit to prevent cardiovascular disease, nephrologists and other health care providers should pay more attention to the early detection and subsequent treatment of individuals with microalbuminuria.

### Assessment of oxidative stress and inflammation in prediabetes – A hospital based cross-sectional study [^113DH3Je]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Prediabetes is associated with dysglycemia, obesity, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, contributing towards the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases rendering them vulnerable for the same. The current study intended to explore the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related with prediabetes by assessing oxidative stress and inflammation using serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and urine microalbumin (MA) and their correlation with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and physical measurements.

Materials and Methods

Based on FPG values, 80 subjects were grouped into prediabetes and healthy controls. IL-6 and MPO were estimated in serum sample whereas MA was estimated in random urine sample.

Results

Prediabetes group had significantly increased (p < 0.05) mean anthropometric measurements and IL-6, MPO and MA as compared to healthy controls. MPO had significant correlation with FPG (r-0.388) in the prediabetes group. IL-6 and MPO showed a positive correlation with body mass index (BMI (r-0.339, r-0.327)), waist circumference (WC (r-484, r-0.493)) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR (r-0.430, r-0.493)) while MA did not correlate with FPG and anthropometric measurements.

Conclusion

This study suggests that prediabetes is associated with central adiposity, inflammation and oxidative stress predisposing them to an increased risk for CVD.

### Making an impact on kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: the importance of screening for albuminuria [^1173LXqC]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Albuminuria as a target for intervention

Microalbuminuria (UACR < 300 mg/g) has been reported in association with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, with a prevalence of 15.5% in people with pre-diabetes. Correlation between the presence of microalbuminuria in people with pre-diabetic conditions and progression towards T2D suggests that screening of albuminuria in the general population may be beneficial for the early prevention of kidney damage.

Reducing albuminuria may slow progression of CKD and should, therefore, be considered as a separate target for kidney-protective therapy. A meta-analysis of data from 41 clinical trials that included participants with diabetes (71%), glomerular disease (4.4%) and other CKD (25.2%) demonstrated that decreasing albuminuria is associated with a reduced risk for developing the clinical endpoint (a composite of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine concentration, or eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²), predictive of CKD progression. This is in addition to monitoring cardiovascular risks using well-established surrogate endpoints, such as glycated hemoglobin for glucose lowering, blood pressure for control of hypertension, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for efficacy of lipid lowering.

Optimum patient management requires regular screening of people with T2D to ensure early identification of CKD, followed by targeted intervention to reduce albuminuria (ie, with the use of SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs) and stabilize eGFR, along with continued regular monitoring. A proposed algorithm for the optimum management of CKD in T2D using albuminuria as a target is presented in figure 3. However, barriers to albuminuria testing exist, including confusion caused by the similarity of test names and results. For example, the typical range of results for UACR and urine albumin (UALB) is similar, but the UACR test measures albumin content relative to creatine (in units of mg/g) while the UALB test measures total albumin in urine (in units of mg/dL). Other barriers include a lack of understanding of testing guidelines and which tests to order; infrequent physician visits by patients or avoidance of treatment; and methodologic issues, such as urine collection instructions, requirement for specific urine cups, or an inadequate patient recall system when patients fail to provide a urine sample. The guideline-preferred method of screening is annual testing of albuminuria using the accurate and cost-effective UACR test (table 1).

Patients at increased CHD risk should receive aspirin and a statin and ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy if hypertensive, unless there are contraindications to a particular drug class.

### Association between prediabetes and risk of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111R3UTD]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the effect of prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) on the incidence of chronic kidney disease.

Methods

PubMed and EMBASE were searched (for studies published up to March 2015). Effects estimated from cohort studies reporting the relationship of prediabetes to incident chronic kidney disease [kidney damage (microalbuminuria, albuminuria or proteinuria) and/or decreased glomerular filtration rate] were pooled using a random-effects model meta-analysis.

Results

Nine cohort studies with a total of 185 452, mainly Asian and white, participants were followed for a total of 835 146 person-years. In eight cohort studies defining impaired fasting glucose as fasting glucose 6.1–6.9 mmol/l, the summary relative risk of chronic kidney disease after adjustment for established risk factors was 1.11 (95% CI 1.02–1.21). When a study defining impaired fasting glucose as fasting glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/dl was added, the overall relative risk of chronic kidney disease was 1.12 (95% CI 1.02–1.21). Exclusion of the only study with information on impaired glucose tolerance did not change the relative risk (1.12; 95% CI 1.02–1.21). There was no evidence of publication bias (P value for Egger test = 0.12).

Conclusion

Prediabetes is modestly associated with an increase in chronic kidney disease risk, but this remains to be robustly confirmed. Chronic kidney disease screening among people with prediabetes, and aggressive management of prediabetes in those with chronic kidney disease may be warranted.

### Prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria among individuals with normal HbA1c level but impaired glucose tolerance: results from the LIFE-adult-study [^111PmgLn]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Diabetes screening strategies using glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as first-instance diagnostic parameter may cause failure to detect individuals with abnormal glucose regulation and possible signs of microvascular complications despite "rule-out" HbA1c levels. This cross-sectional study examined the diagnostic performance of HbA1c in relation to fasting and two-hour postload plasma glucose (FPG/2 h-PG), and investigated whether individuals with normal HbA1c but abnormal FPG/2 h-PG have a higher prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria as possible sign of early stage kidney damage.

Methods

A total of 2695 individuals (age 40–79 years, 48% men) without prior diagnosis of diabetes and complete measurement of HbA1c, FPG, 2 h-PG and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were taken from a large population-based epidemiological study in the City of Leipzig, Germany.

Results

A total of 2439 individuals (90.5%, 95% CI: 89.4–91.6) had normal HbA1c levels, < 39 mmol/mol (< 5.7%), while 234 (8.7%, 95% CI: 7.7–9.8) had prediabetes, HbA1c ≥ 39 and < 48 mmol/mol (≥ 5.7 and < 6.5%), and 22 (0.8%, 95% CI: 0.5–1.2) had diabetes, HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5%), according to HbA1c. Among individuals with normal HbA1c, 35.6% (95% CI: 33.7–37.5) had impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance and 1.8% (95% CI: 1.4–2.4) had diabetes according to FPG/2 h-PG. Individuals with normal HbA1c but prediabetic or diabetic FPG/2 h-PG had a significantly higher prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria (9.4%, 95% CI: 7.6–11.5 and 13.3%, 95% CI: 5.8–25.4, respectively) than individuals with normal HbA1c and normal FPG/2 h-PG (3.9%, 95% CI: 3.0–5.0).

Conclusions

The prevalence of prediabetes according to FPG/2 h-PG among individuals with normal HbA1c is considerably high, and the prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria in this group is significantly elevated. Risk factors for diabetes such as age, gender and BMI may help to better identify this at-risk group.

### Postpartum microalbuminuria after gestational diabetes: the impact of current glucose tolerance status [^111X6jRa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

It has been reported that women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have an increased risk of microalbuminuria compared with that of their peers. Because previous GDM predicts an increased risk of prediabetes, which itself is associated with microalbuminuria, we hypothesized that current glucose intolerance may confound any association between GDM and microalbuminuria.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative impact of gestational and current dysglycemia on postpartum microalbuminuria in a cohort of women reflecting the full spectrum of gestational glucose tolerance from normal to mildly abnormal to GDM.

Design/Setting/Participants

In this prospective observational cohort study, 320 women underwent a glucose challenge test (GCT) and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in pregnancy, which identified 100 women with GDM, 58 with gestational impaired glucose tolerance, 90 with an abnormal GCT but a normal OGTT, and 72 with a normal GCT and OGTT. At 3 years postpartum, they underwent measurement of urine microalbumin and a repeat OGTT that identified 63 women with glucose intolerance (prediabetes/diabetes).

Results

The postpartum urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio did not differ among the 4 gestational glucose tolerance groups (P = 0.23). Furthermore, on logistic regression analysis, GDM did not independently predict an elevated urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio of ≥ 1.5 g/mol of creatinine (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–1.11), after adjustment for age, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, body mass index, blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and current glucose intolerance. In contrast, current glucose intolerance independently predicted a urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio of ≥ 1.5 (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–8.2, P = 0.005).

Conclusion

Current glucose intolerance, rather than previous GDM, may be associated with an increased risk of microalbuminuria in the early postpartum years.

### American college of endocrinology pre-diabetes consensus conference: part one [^115ryrzr]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

George Bakris (Chicago, IL) discussed issues of the impact of pre-diabetes on nephropathy and hypertension. He pointed out that microalbuminuria is a marker, not a risk factor, as it has not fully been shown to affect the course of renal disease or CVD when taking all other factors into account. Furthermore, in addition to having 20–25% biologic variability, the assays themselves have 5–10% variability, such that a 30% change is required for meaningful benefit. Bakris pointed out that many inflammatory conditions are associated with microalbuminuria, with albuminuria improving when they resolve. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial appears to be the only study showing a relationship between glycemia and albuminuria, although a number of preclinical studies support this effect. Bakris noted that the usual upper limit of normal for urine microalbumin, 30 mg/g creatinine, is unlikely to be correct, suggesting that 20 or even 15 may be the better cutoff. Albuminuria is strongly associated with CVD, in a fashion additive to the association with blood pressure. Bakris pointed out that the relationship between microalbuminuria and CVD is considerably stronger than that of CRP with CVD, such that he did feel this to be a useful measure. Macroalbuminuria is an even stronger CVD risk factor.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on kidney function in adults with prediabetes: a secondary analysis of a randomized trial [^115B84j3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration has been associated with higher levels of proteinuria and lower levels of eGFR in observational studies. In the Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study, we investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on kidney outcomes in a population with prediabetes.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Overweight/obese adults with high risk for type 2 diabetes (defined by meeting two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes) were randomized to vitamin D 3 4000 IU per day versus placebo. Median duration of treatment was 2.9 years (interquartile range 2.0–3.5 years). Kidney outcomes included (1) worsening in Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) risk score (low, moderate, high, very high) on two consecutive follow-up visits after the baseline visit and (2) mean changes in eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).

Results

Among 2166 participants (mean age 60 years, body mass index 32 kg/m 2, serum 25(OH)D 28 ng/ml, eGFR 87 ml/min per 1.73 m², UACR 11 mg/g, 79% with hypertension), 10% had moderate, high, or very high KDIGO risk score. Over a median follow-up of 2.9 years, there were 28 cases of KDIGO worsening in the vitamin D group and 30 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.52 to 1.52]). Mean difference in eGFR from baseline was -1.0 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -1.3 to -0.7) in the vitamin D group and -0.1 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -0.4 to 0.2) in the placebo group; between-group difference was -1.0 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -1.4 to -0.6). Mean difference in UACR was 2.7 mg/g (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3) in the vitamin D group and 2.0 (95% CI, 0.5 to 3.6) in the placebo group; between-group difference was 0.7 mg/g (95% CI, -1.5 to 2.9).

Conclusions

Among persons with prediabetes, who were not preselected on the basis of serum 25(OH)D concentration, vitamin D supplementation did not affect progression of KDIGO risk scores and did not have a meaningful effect on change in UACR or eGFR.

### Microalbuminuria: do we need a new threshold? [^115xrZhi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (30–300 mg of albumin/24 h) is a well-known independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular disease and of mortality in diabetic, hypertensive and in the general population. However, recent studies indicate that increased risk is observed at levels of albuminuria much lower than those currently employed to define microalbuminuria. Such low levels were shown to predict heart disease and death, independent of age, sex, renal function, diabetes, hypertension and lipids, in subjects with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and in the general population; as well as to predict progression to hypertension. Correction of obesity and metabolic derangements lowered levels of albuminuria below 30 mg/24 h to levels not associated with increased risk (5–7 mg/24 h). Despite the lack of outcome studies, there is substantial evidence to indicate that the threshold for defining microalbuminuria (that is, albuminuria associated with increased risk) should be lowered by nearly three to four-fold from the currently defined threshold. It would be advisable that clinical scores and future guidelines would consider including microalbuminuria at the lower rates as an independent risk factor, and as an indication for implementing early intervention. Unfortunately, and despite the abundance of evidence, albuminuria measurements are still underutilized in clinical practice.

KDOQI — microalbuminuria and GFR for DKD screening states that microalbuminuria and estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) "satisfy criteria for a screening test for DKD. (Moderate)". Microalbuminuria is described as "an independent risk factor for the development of CKD… and GFR loss… and for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality", with point prevalence varying "from 7% to 22% in type 1… and from 6.5% to 42% in type 2 diabetes", and annual incidence "of 1% to 2%… reported in type 2… and possibly type 1 diabetes". For testing, "the Work Group recommends estimating the ACR [albumin-to-creatinine ratio] in a spot urine sample (preferably the first morning void)", noting that "The sensitivity and specificity of ACR estimates are greater than 85% compared with timed urine collections", and that urinary albumin excretion has "an intraindividual CV of approximately 40%". Estimates of urine albumin excretion are also reported as "available, relatively inexpensive, and easy to perform".

### Making an impact on kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: the importance of screening for albuminuria [^11632b3r]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Albuminuria is useful for early screening and diagnosis of kidney impairment, especially in people with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), associated with increased mortality, poor cardiovascular outcomes, and high economic burden. Identifying patients with CKD who are most likely to progress to ESKD permits timely implementation of appropriate interventions. The early stages of CKD are asymptomatic, which means identification of CKD relies on routine assessment of kidney damage and function. Both albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate are measures of kidney function. This review discusses albuminuria as a marker of kidney damage and cardiorenal risk, highlights the importance of early screening and routine testing for albuminuria in people with T2D, and provides new insights on the optimum management of CKD in T2D using albuminuria as a target in a proposed algorithm. Elevated urine albumin can be used to detect CKD in people with T2D and monitor its progression; however, obstacles preventing early detection exist, including lack of awareness of CKD in the general population, poor adherence to clinical guidelines, and country-level variations in screening and treatment incentives. With albuminuria being used as an entry criterion and a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure in clinical trials, and with novel treatment interventions available to prevent CKD progression, there is an urgent need for early screening and diagnosis of kidney function decline in people with T2D or pre-diabetes.

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion (UAE) in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes duration of ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients, starting at diagnosis. (E)
Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes regardless of the degree of UAE. The serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present. (E)

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, with hypertension and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy.

Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt⁻¹ · day⁻¹ in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt⁻¹ · day⁻¹ in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (UAE rate, GFR) and is recommended (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of UAE to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

### Prediabetes and risk of glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria in the general nondiabetic population: a prospective cohort study [^11777ojF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The role of prediabetes as a risk factor for hyperfiltration and albuminuria in persons who do not develop diabetes is unclear. The lack of evidence is mainly due to the difficulty of accurately assessing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the near-normal range of GFR. We investigated whether prediabetes is an independent risk factor for glomerular hyperfiltration and high-normal urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) using measured GFR (mGFR) rather than estimated GFR.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study based on the Renal Iohexol Clearance Survey in Tromsø 6 (RENIS-T6) and the RENIS Follow-Up Study. Median observation time was 5.6 years.

Setting & Participants

A representative sample of 1,261 persons without diabetes mellitus (DM) from the general population aged 50 to 62 years.

Predictor

Prediabetes defined by fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c according to levels suggested by the American Diabetes Association (preDMADA) and the International Expert Committee of 2009 (preDMIEC).

Outcomes

Change in mGFR; hyperfiltration defined as mGFR > 90th percentile adjusted for age, sex, weight, and height; and high-normal ACR (> 10mg/g) at follow-up.

Measurements

GFR was measured with iohexol clearance.

Results

Baseline fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and both definitions of prediabetes were predictors of higher mGFR at follow-up and lower annual mGFR decline in multivariable-adjusted regression analyses. Participants with preDMIEC had an OR for hyperfiltration of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.20–3.17) and for high-normal ACR of 1.83 (95% CI, 1.04–3.22) at follow-up. We adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors including ambulatory blood pressure at baseline and change in use of antihypertensive medication between baseline and follow-up.

Limitations

Only middle-aged white patients participated. There is no consensus on how to define glomerular hyperfiltration.

Conclusions

Our findings imply an independent role of prediabetes in the development of glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria. Prediabetes might be a target for early treatment to prevent chronic kidney disease in chronic hyperglycemia.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^116bGH72]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple laboratory tests are used to diagnose and manage patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these tests varies substantially.

Approach

An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for the use of laboratory testing for patients with diabetes. A new system was developed to grade the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. Draft guidelines were posted on the Internet and presented at the 2007 Arnold O. Beckman Conference. The document was modified in response to oral and written comments, and a revised draft was posted in 2010 and again modified in response to written comments. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry and the Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine Committee of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry jointly reviewed the guidelines, which were accepted after revisions by the Professional Practice Committee and subsequently approved by the Executive Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

In addition to long-standing criteria based on measurement of plasma glucose, diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased blood hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations. Monitoring of glycemic control is performed by self-monitoring of plasma or blood glucose with meters and by laboratory analysis of HbA(1c). The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and other analytes are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations that are based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes have minimal clinical value at present, and their measurement is not recommended.

### Diabetic nephropathy screening by primary care physicians… [^1157ZrBr]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The survey also asked the physicians to estimate the percentage of patients in their practice with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who are screened for overt albuminuria and microalbuminuria and to explain what interventions they implement when albuminuria or microalbumuria is found in a patient with diabetes. Almost 86 percent of the physicians reported obtaining a urinalysis for more than one half of their patients with type 1 diabetes, and 82 percent reported doing so for more than one half of their patients with types 2 diabetes. A urine dipstick test was usually used to screen for albuminuria by about 85 percent of physicians. Unlike screening for overt albuminuria, screening for microalbuminuria was not nearly as common. As many as 43 percent of the respondents reported that they did not screen for microalbuminuria in any of their patients with type 1 diabetes. Similarly, 47 percent screened none of their patients with type 2 diabetes.

Although about one third of the physicians who tested for microalbuminuria reported doing so with a 24-hour urine collection, about one quarter of them reported screening for microalbuminuria with a urine dipstick test. With respect to the management of diabetic nephropathy, approximately 80 percent of the physicians surveyed reported using an ACE inhibitor in patients with microalbuminuria or albuminuria and hypertension. However, this figure dropped to about 55 percent when diabetic patients with abnormal urinary albumin excretion had normal blood pressure. The survey findings revealed that family physicians were much less likely than internists to screen for albuminuria and microalbuminuria. Family physicians had 0. 68 times the odds of testing all or some of their patients with type 1 diabetes.

Internists also reported using ACE inhibitors more often than family physicians in hypertensive or normotensive diabetic patients with albuminuria or microalbuminuria. Physicians familiar with the DCCT were more likely to check urine for albuminuria or microalbuminuria and to prescribe ACE inhibitors in patients with either. The authors conclude that primary care physicians are generally following the ADA guidelines for routine screening for overt albuminuria but that testing for microalbuminuria is being neglected. Such screening can allow early intervention to forestall progression of diabetic nephropathy. Specifically, use of an ACE inhibitor in normotensive as well as hypertensive patients with diabetes effectively slows renal deterioration and should be used more widely.

### Prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria among individuals with normal HbA1c level but impaired glucose tolerance: results from the LIFE-adult-study [^113sr4dR]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Aims

Diabetes screening strategies using glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as first‐instance diagnostic parameter may cause failure to detect individuals with abnormal glucose regulation and possible signs of microvascular complications despite "rule‐out" HbA1c levels. This cross‐sectional study examined the diagnostic performance of HbA1c in relation to fasting and two‐hour postload plasma glucose (/2 h‐), and investigated whether individuals with normal HbA1c but abnormal/2 h‐have a higher prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria as possible sign of early stage kidney damage.

Methods

A total of 2695 individuals (age 40‐79 years, 48% men) without prior diagnosis of diabetes and complete measurement of HbA1c, 2 h‐and urine albumin‐creatinine ratio were taken from a large population‐based epidemiological study in the City of Leipzig, Germany.

Results

A total of 2439 individuals (90.5%, 95%: 89.4‐91.6) had normal HbA1c levels, < 39 mmol/mol (< 5.7%), while 234 (8.7%, 95%: 7.7‐9.8) had prediabetes, HbA1c ≥ 39 and < 48 mmol/mol (≥ 5.7 and < 6.5%), and 22 (0.8%, 95%: 0.5‐1.2) had diabetes, HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5%), according to HbA1c. Among individuals with normal HbA1c, 35.6% (95%: 33.7‐37.5) had impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance and 1.8% (95%: 1.4‐2.4) had diabetes according to/2 h‐. Individuals with normal HbA1c but prediabetic or diabetic/2 h‐had a significantly higher prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria (9.4%, 95%: 7.6‐11.5 and 13.3%, 95%: 5.8‐25.4, respectively) than individuals with normal HbA1c and normal/2 h‐(3.9%, 95%: 3.0‐5.0).

Conclusions

The prevalence of prediabetes according to/2 h‐among individuals with normal HbA1c is considerably high, and the prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria in this group is significantly elevated. Risk factors for diabetes such as age, gender andmay help to better identify this at‐risk group.

3 RESULTS

A total of 505,873 participants underwent complete annual health check‐ups in 2014. After excluding participants with eGFR of ˂60 mL min −1 1.73 m −2, urine protein of ≥ 1+ or kidney disease diagnosis at baseline and those without data on FPG, eGFR, urinary protein after 2 years, 405,487 participants were identified without CKD at baseline. Among them, 378,799 participants retained the kidney function, 7037 developed proteinuria (urine protein of ≥ 1+, with eGFR of ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), 19,015 presented eGFR decline (eGFR of ˂60 mL/min/1.73 m², without proteinuria) and 636 showed both proteinuria and eGFR decline after 2 years (Figure 1).

Table 1 shows the participants' baseline characteristics stratified according to the diabetic status. The prevalence of diabetes was 5.6%, and prediabetes was 28.8%. Participants with prediabetes and diabetes were older, more likely man, had a higher BMI, higher WC, higher systolic and diastolic BP, higher triglycerides, lower HDL cholesterol, and were more likely to have past history of cardiac disease and stroke and to be current smokers. Hypertension and dyslipidaemia were more common in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes accompanied by higher rate of using antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering medications.

Note

Table 2 shows the prevalence of proteinuria development (urine protein of ≥ 1+) and eGFR decline (eGFR ˂60 mL min −1 1.73 m −2) after 2 years according to the diabetic status. After 2 years, proteinuria development occurred in 3914 individuals (1.5%) with NGL, 2266 (1.9%) with prediabetes, and 857 (3.8%) with diabetes at baseline. Decline in eGFR occurred in 11,225 individuals (4.2%) with NGL, 6492 (5.6%) with prediabetes and 1298 (5.7%) with diabetes. Individuals who presented both proteinuria development and eGFR decline after 2 years were 287 (0.1%) with NGL, 250 (0.2%) with prediabetes and 99 (0.4%) with diabetes.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113rzxmp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes — assessment with urine albumin and estimated GFR: Screening for albuminuria can be most easily performed by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in a random spot urine collection, with albuminuria categories defined as " < 30 mg/g creatinine", " ≥ 30–300 mg/g creatinine", and " ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine". Because of high biological variability of " > 20%", two of three UACR specimens collected within a "3-to 6-month" period should be abnormal before considering moderately or severely elevated albuminuria, and transient factors such as "Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, and marked hypertension may elevate UACR independently of kidney damage". For kidney function, "eGFR persistence < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or an urinary albumin value of > 30 mg/g of creatinine is considered abnormal", the CKD-EPI creatinine equation "was refit without the race variable and should be used for everyone", and "increased use of cystatin C… is suggested in combination with serum creatinine" because combining markers "is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone".

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^115ibogz]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

With the explosive growth of incident diabetes, type 2 diabetes has become a major international public health challenge. Moreover, an increasing number of individuals have evidence of a pre-diabetic state, which indicates significant future risk of developing diabetes. Fortunately, accumulating evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented in individuals with pre-diabetes by either lifestyle modification or medication. However, because prevention is a fundamental public health goal, there is clearly a great need for effective strategies to identify high-risk individuals. Unfortunately, the best available risk stratification method is an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is both costly and difficult to perform in a clinical setting.

The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a single untimed urinary specimen is a reflection of urinary albumin excretion and is increasingly being accepted as a marker that predicts several important health outcomes, including hypertension, kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality. These associations have been observed throughout the biological range, even at levels far below those previously considered to be pathological (e.g. microalbuminuria).

The ACR is also closely linked to cardiometabolic risk factors, vascular disease, and insulin resistance and might therefore play a clinically important role in predicting future onset of diabetes. Observational studies have shown an association between ACR and other markers of urinary albumin excretion and incident diabetes. In addition, observations that proteinuria-reducing therapies (e.g. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) delay progression to diabetes also support this hypothesis, albeit indirectly. However, the observational studies were heterogeneous in terms of study design and risk for incident diabetes, did not include proteinuria throughout its biologic range, and/or recruited individuals from ethnic groups distinct from the general U.S. population. In addition, a randomized clinical trial did not find that ramipril, a proteinuria-reducing agent, altered the incidence of diabetes.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) enrolled a large and well-characterized cohort of adults who were at high-risk for developing diabetes based on having elevated fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. We tested the hypothesis that ACR, throughout its biological range, improves the prediction of future diabetes.

### Importance of early screening and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111G8kXr]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening Enables Early Diagnosis OF CKD

Chronic kidney disease is asymptomatic in its early stages and is diagnosed via estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which assesses kidney function, and detection of albuminuria, a marker for kidney damage. The ADA 2020 Standards of Care recommend that patients with newly diagnosed T2D should be screened for CKD with urinary albumin (e.g. spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) testing and eGFR. They should then be retested annually thereafter, with the frequency of retesting driven by the level of kidney damage and function (Fig. 1). For patients with a UACR > 30 mg/g albumin/creatinine, and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, monitoring should be performed twice annually to guide therapy. Of note, in 2013 the American College of Physicians made the recommendation that patients with T2D and CKD (stage 1–3) receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) did not need to undergo annual testing for proteinuria. This recommendation has been retired, and therefore it is important that primary care providers (PCPs) take note of this change and adjust their practice accordingly. Based on the ADA guidelines, patients with stage 1–3 CKD should be screened between one and three times annually based on their level of albuminuria (Fig. 1).

The preferred method for assessment of albuminuria is the UACR, measured in a random spot urine collection. This method of assessment is easy to perform compared with a 24-h urine collection, which is inconvenient for patients and subject to incomplete collection. Concurrent measurement of urinary creatinine ensures that variations in albumin concentration due to hydration levels do not confound the result. A positive diagnosis of increased urinary albumin excretion, defined as ≥ 30 mg/g albumin/creatinine, should only be made when two of three samples collected over a 3- to 6-month period exceed that threshold.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to screening for diabetic nephropathy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor urinary albumin (such as spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio) and eGFR 1–4 times per year in patients with established diabetic kidney disease, depending on the stage of the disease.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often asymptomatic except in its advanced stages and requires laboratory testing both for diagnosis and prognostic assessment. The absence of clinical manifestations in early stages leads to delays in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapies that could slow progression towards kidney failure or other complications. Earlier detection of CKD through appropriate screening and institution of evidence-based interventions has the potential to prevent further kidney damage and progressive loss of kidney function. –

Albuminuria, an early biomarker of CKD and cardiovascular disease, often precedes the loss of kidney function as assessed by declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR). One of the first studies to demonstrate this relationship was the PREVEND study (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease Intervention Trial; 1998–2003) which showed in a prospective cohort of approximately 250 subjects that elevated urinary albumin excretion at baseline was independently predictive of developing an impaired GFR. Since then, larger studies from around the world have supported the prognostic value of albuminuria throughout the progression of chronic kidney disease to kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality. These studies have fueled interest in understanding the value of testing for albuminuria in screening for CKD. –

Screening for albuminuria has been extensively studied in diabetic populations and well-established guidelines have aided in earlier detection and treatment of CKD in individuals with diabetes. In those without diabetes, recommendations vary. For non-diabetic patients with hypertension, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association "recommends" routine urine dipstick testing, while the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension "recommends" urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) testing for all patients with hypertension as well as annual ACR testing in patients with CKD. For patients without hypertension or diabetes, the United States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and risks of screening for CKD. Similarly, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a weak recommendation given the low-quality of evidence and recommended against screening for CKD without risk factors for CKD.

Given that screening the entire population would be expensive and yield modest returns, we sought to create an optimized risk model that would predict the likelihood of albuminuria among patients without diabetes. Ultimately, the goal of such a risk model would be to serve as a clinical decision tool to help clinicians determine whether to screen a given non-diabetic patient for albuminuria. Widespread implementation of this tool could facilitate more selective testing of individuals at high risk of albuminuria to improve detection of albuminuria and as a result CKD, in this population.

Purpose Of Review

Worldwide, we are facing an increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus, the number one cause of end-stage renal disease. It is imperative that chronic kidney disease among adults with diabetes mellitus be detected early when interventions are most effective in preventing end-stage renal disease.

Recent Findings

Screening tools work best when health care providers have a clear understanding of the natural history of the disease process. The use of urine albumin measurement as a screening tool for diabetic nephropathy is based on the well characterized evolution of nephropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, the evolution of chronic kidney disease among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to be more heterogeneous. In contrast to type 1 diabetes mellitus, a substantial percentage of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus have decreased glomerular filtration rate in the absence of increased urine albumin excretion. Focusing solely on urine albumin excretion to screen for chronic kidney disease may miss a substantial number of cases in adults with diabetes mellitus. In addition, up to one-third of adults with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus already have chronic kidney disease, which may have first developed during the prediabetic state. Screening for chronic kidney disease only after an adult develops diabetes mellitus may miss that 'early' window of opportunity in many patients.

Summary

To maximize the effectiveness of our screening programs, we must not only use tests with adequate sensitivity but also implement screening tests early in the disease process to prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease.
