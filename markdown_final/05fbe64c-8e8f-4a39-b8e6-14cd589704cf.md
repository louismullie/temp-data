## Question

ureaplasma infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Ureaplasma infection, specifically covering microbiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostics, treatment, and special populations, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's taxonomy and unique biology. Then, I should verify the pathogenic mechanisms and how colonization differs from infection. Next, I will review clinical syndromes across populations, followed by diagnostic strategies and limitations. After that, I need to examine treatment options, including adult regimens, neonatal data, and resistance considerations. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize controversies and evidence gaps to guide practice decisions.

> Let me first confirm the microbiology and basic biology. Ureaplasma species are Mollicutes that lack a cell wall, which explains intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams and vancomycin; they are among the smallest free-living organisms and depend on urea hydrolysis to ammonia for energy, a feature with pathophysiologic implications in certain settings [^112ua8gn] [^112tHAh9]. I should double-check the species nomenclature: historically grouped as Ureaplasma urealyticum, they are now classified as U. urealyticum and U. parvum, with multiple serovars, and both species are commonly isolated from the lower genital tract in asymptomatic individuals, complicating attribution to disease [^112tHAh9] [^112SU9Yx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathogenicity. I need to distinguish colonization from infection. Colonization of mucosal surfaces is common and often benign, yet ascending infection can trigger inflammation, chorioamnionitis, and preterm birth; in preterm infants, lower respiratory tract colonization correlates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, though causality remains debated and likely depends on host and microbial factors, including organism load and serovar [^1123VsLp] [^113qC8fu]. Let me verify serovar-specific risk: U. parvum serovar 3 has been associated with increased risk of very preterm delivery, suggesting pathogenic heterogeneity within species [^112FTbp6].

> Next, I should review clinical manifestations across populations. In adults, U. urealyticum biovar 2 has been linked to a subset of nongonococcal urethritis, whereas U. parvum is less clearly pathogenic; invasive disease is rare but reported, including septic arthritis, pericarditis, and hyperammonemia in immunocompromised hosts, where urea hydrolysis may drive life-threatening ammonia accumulation [^114bF4G4] [^112HxF34] [^114FkwuZ] [^112tHAh9]. In pregnancy, Ureaplasma is frequently isolated from amniotic fluid and placental tissues after preterm birth and is associated with chorioamnionitis and PPROM; in preterm neonates, respiratory colonization is associated with BPD and prolonged ventilatory support, though eradication trials have not consistently translated into improved long-term outcomes [^112h56pC] [^1123VsLp] [^115iJr9t].

> I will now examine diagnostics, and I need to ensure I capture the limitations. Culture is slow and insensitive due to fastidious growth requirements; NAATs markedly improve detection, but routine testing for Ureaplasma is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals because of high colonization prevalence and unclear clinical significance; in select invasive or refractory cases, metagenomic next-generation sequencing can identify Ureaplasma when conventional cultures are negative [^114ja68W] [^116NJVn4]. Wait, let me verify neonatal sampling: tracheal aspirates better reflect lower respiratory tract involvement than nasopharyngeal swabs, which may detect upper airway colonization without true infection, a distinction relevant to interpreting BPD risk studies [^113fmHbD].

> Now, treatment in adults. I should confirm first-line therapy: doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days is a standard regimen for nongonococcal urethritis potentially due to Ureaplasma; azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose is an alternative, though persistent detection after therapy is not uncommon and may reflect colonization or tolerance rather than treatment failure; adherence matters, and suboptimal adherence increases microbiologic failure risk [^113oQTKH] [^114bF4G4] [^111qrFUr]. Hold on, I should verify cervicitis guidance: current STI guidelines do not support routine testing or treatment for Ureaplasma in cervicitis, emphasizing evaluation for chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, BV, and M. genitalium instead [^112tHAh9].

> For neonates, let me consider the randomized data carefully. A phase IIb RCT showed that intravenous azithromycin 20 mg/kg daily for 3 days achieved high Ureaplasma eradication from the respiratory tract in extremely preterm infants, but did not significantly improve survival without BPD in the overall cohort. Intriguingly, subgroup signals suggested better physiologic BPD-free survival in those with lower respiratory tract colonization, though the trial was underpowered and not designed for definitive BPD outcomes [^112h56pC] [^11191YSE]. I should double-check longer-term follow-up: at 22–26 months, no significant differences were observed in death or serious respiratory morbidity or neurodevelopmental impairment, reinforcing that routine azithromycin prophylaxis is not supported pending larger trials [^115iJr9t] [^113KdWZv]. But wait, what if we broaden to prophylaxis regardless of Ureaplasma status? The AZTEC phase III RCT in infants under 30 weeks found no improvement in survival without moderate or severe CLD with a 10-day azithromycin regimen, regardless of Ureaplasma colonization, arguing against routine neonatal prophylaxis [^115JB1zn].

> Resistance and pharmacology matter, so I should review them. Ureaplasma lacks a cell wall, rendering beta-lactams ineffective; macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones target protein synthesis and are the mainstays, but macrolide resistance via 23S rRNA methylation can occur and may be selected with repeated exposures; in vitro, neonatal isolates generally have low azithromycin MICs, but clinical breakpoints are not standardized, complicating interpretation [^112ua8gn] [^111sBeMY] [^113Tji7V]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were FDA-cleared Ureaplasma susceptibility methods; I should correct that: while FDA labeling lists in vitro activity, there are no standardized clinical breakpoints for Ureaplasma, and routine susceptibility testing is not established in clinical practice [^112ua8gn] [^111sBeMY].

> Special populations require tailored thinking. In pregnancy, treating asymptomatic vaginal colonization has not been shown to reduce preterm birth in trials, though some observational and interventional data suggest that screening and treating symptomatic women in late pregnancy may reduce preterm labor and neonatal complications. This remains controversial and not practice-standard, so decisions should be individualized and ideally within research frameworks [^114mfbwq] [^115d4c4A] [^115Qr55j]. In immunocompromised hosts, I need to maintain a high index of suspicion for invasive Ureaplasma disease, including hyperammonemia, and consider early dual therapy with a macrolide plus a tetracycline or fluoroquinolone while arranging targeted diagnostics, as delays can be fatal [^112tHAh9] [^113FV6Yb] [^112ua8gn].

> Let me synthesize the controversies and evidence gaps. The association between Ureaplasma and BPD is biologically plausible and supported by observational data, but eradication trials have not consistently improved long-term pulmonary outcomes; heterogeneity in detection methods, colonization versus infection definitions, and timing of therapy likely contribute to conflicting results, and ongoing phase III trials may clarify whether a precision approach targeting truly infected infants changes outcomes [^1123VsLp] [^115iJr9t]. I should confirm that current professional guidance does not recommend routine screening or treatment of asymptomatic colonization in adults or neonates outside research, aligning with IDSA/ASM recommendations and STI guidelines [^116Gwzym] [^111XLhhc].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical takeaways are clear. For symptomatic adults with NGU or compatible syndromes, treat per NGU guidelines with doxycycline or azithromycin, recognizing that persistent detection is common and may not mandate retreatment if symptoms resolve. For neonates, do not routinely use azithromycin prophylaxis outside trials. And for immunocompromised patients with unexplained hyperammonemia or invasive infection, promptly test for Ureaplasma and initiate appropriate therapy while confirming diagnosis with NAAT or metagenomic methods as needed [^112tHAh9] [^115JB1zn] [^116NJVn4].

Ureaplasma species are common commensals of the urogenital tract [^112SU9Yx] that can cause **significant morbidity** in pregnancy and prematurity, including chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, and neonatal complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and hyperammonemia [^113qC8fu] [^1123VsLp]. Diagnosis relies on **PCR** [^116Gwzym] because culture is insensitive; routine screening is not recommended, but testing is indicated in symptomatic or high-risk patients [^111XLhhc]. Treatment is with **macrolides or tetracyclines** [^112ua8gn]; azithromycin is preferred in pregnancy and neonates, while doxycycline is standard for adults [^116jLZih]. Evidence for preventing preterm birth or BPD with antibiotics is mixed [^114mfbwq] [^115JB1zn], and management should be individualized based on clinical context and risk [^1123VsLp].

## Microbiology and pathogenesis

- **Microbiology**: Ureaplasma are Mollicutes without a cell wall, making them inherently resistant to beta-lactams [^112ua8gn].
- **Pathogenesis**: They adhere to mucosal surfaces, invade tissues, and provoke inflammation; urease activity generates ammonia, damaging host cells and contributing to hyperammonemia in systemic infection [^112tHAh9].
- **Colonization vs infection**: Colonization is common and often asymptomatic; infection is context-dependent and associated with high bacterial load, host susceptibility, and co-factors such as bacterial vaginosis or immunosuppression [^112SU9Yx] [^112FTbp6].

---

## Clinical manifestations

### In women

In women, **pregnancy-related complications** include chorioamnionitis, preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and postpartum endometritis [^113qC8fu] [^117XQbJU]. Ureaplasma is also associated with bacterial vaginosis and cervicitis, although its role in cervicitis is less clearly established than in other syndromes [^111XLhhc].

---

### In men

In men, **urethritis** is a key manifestation, with U. urealyticum (biovar 2) specifically linked to nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) [^114bF4G4]; prostatitis and epididymitis are less common but recognized presentations [^notfound].

---

### In neonates and infants

In neonates and infants, **respiratory complications** include bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pneumonia, and respiratory distress syndrome, particularly in preterm infants [^1123VsLp] [^115HDroz]. Systemic infection may present as neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and hyperammonemia, especially in immunocompromised hosts [^112tHAh9] [^113FV6Yb].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Culture**: Historically used but slow, insensitive, and technically demanding [^113oQTKH].
- **PCR**: Rapid, sensitive, and specific; preferred diagnostic method [^116Ry7Lq].
- **Routine screening**: Not recommended in asymptomatic individuals due to high colonization rates and potential for overtreatment [^116Gwzym] [^111XLhhc].
- **Indications for testing**: Symptomatic patients, high-risk pregnancies, preterm labor, PPROM, unexplained infertility, and immunocompromised hosts [^notfound].

## Treatment

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Pregnancy (asymptomatic colonization) | No routine treatment | Insufficient evidence to support screening or treatment [^114mfbwq] [^115d4c4A] |
| Pregnancy (symptomatic or high-risk) | Azithromycin 1 g single dose or 500 mg daily for 3 days | Preferred due to safety in pregnancy [^notfound] |
| Adult urethritis | Doxycycline 100 mg BID for 7 days or azithromycin 1 g single dose | Doxycycline preferred; azithromycin alternative [^116jLZih] [^114RE7kW] |
| Neonatal colonization or infection | Azithromycin 20 mg/kg IV daily for 3 days | Effective in eradicating Ureaplasma; monitor for side effects [^112h56pC] [^113o26MF] |
| Immunocompromised hosts | Doxycycline or fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin) | Combination therapy may be required in severe cases [^112ua8gn] [^117Hvdea] |

---

## Prevention and public health implications

Prevention and public health implications include **public health measures** — screening and treating symptomatic pregnant women, maintaining safe sexual practices, and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics — to limit transmission and resistance [^111XLhhc]. Research priorities include clarifying the role of Ureaplasma in adverse pregnancy outcomes, evaluating the effectiveness of screening and treatment strategies, and investigating novel therapeutics and vaccines [^1123VsLp].

---

## Controversies and gaps in knowledge

Controversies and gaps include whether **routine screening and treatment** reduce preterm birth or BPD, with mixed evidence and ongoing debate [^114mfbwq] [^115JB1zn]. The pathogenicity of Ureaplasma is complex and likely influenced by host and microbial factors, including bacterial load, serovar, and co-infections [^112FTbp6]. Antibiotic resistance is an emerging concern, particularly with macrolides, and warrants surveillance and stewardship [^114bF4G4] [^112tHAh9].

Ureaplasma species are common commensals that can cause significant morbidity in pregnancy and prematurity. Diagnosis relies on PCR, and treatment is with macrolides or tetracyclines; however, evidence for preventing preterm birth or BPD is mixed, and management should be individualized based on clinical context and risk.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^112VtfYn]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) infection, as well as asymptomatic leukocytospermia, whether it has effect on semen parameters and whether it needs screening and treatment is still a confusing and controversial topic for clinicians.

Methods

Among 1530 adult males who visited Guilin People's Hospital due to infertility, 295 were diagnosed with asymptomatic leukocytospermia, and 95 were further screened for UU-positive. 81 UU-positive asymptomatic leukocytospermia patients received 7-day or 14-day treatment plan with doxycycline, and 70 cases were cured. The semen parameters of non-leukocytospermia, leukocytospermia, UU-positive leukocytospermia and UU-negative leukocytospermia groups were compared, and the differences between the two treatment plans and the semen parameters before UU treatment and 1 month after UU-cured were compared.

Results

Compared with non-leukocytospermia patients, the sperm concentration, progressive motility (PR), and normal morphology of patients with leukocytospermia decreased, while those with UU-positive leukocytospermia performed more significantly. The PR, total motility, and normal morphology of UU-positive leukocytospermia patients were significantly lower than those of UU-negative leukocytospermia patients (all p < 0.001). The UU cure rates of the 7-day and 14-day treatment plan with doxycycline was 84.62% and 89.66% (p = 0.738), respectively, and the sperm concentration, PR, total motility, and normal morphology of the cured UU-positive leukocytospermia patients were all increased after 1 month (p = 0.001, p = 0.022, p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively).

Conclusions

It is significant to screen and treat UU infection in asymptomatic leukocytospermia for improving sperm quality. Where appropriate, the 7-day treatment plan with doxycycline may be a good choice.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^113J8r2Z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia before treatment was not independently associated with BPD development in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants, despite a remarkably higher rate of BPD in infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia compared to those with colonization (44.6% vs. 17.7%). In contrast, an effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with decreased risk for BPD in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants [OR 0.011, 95% CI (0.000, 0.250)].

Ureaplasma is smaller than bacteria in diameter and colonizes in the genitourinary tract of pregnant women. Ureaplasma might transmit to the new-borns respiratory tract in the uterus or during delivery, causing interstitial pneumonia and closely associated BPD in premature infants. Some speculations are proposed on the role of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of BPD. Phospholipase released by Ureaplasma has long been considered as the virulence factor causing epithelium necrosis. Infants who died from Ureaplasma pneumonia exhibited severe fibrosis, indicating fibroblast involvement. Besides, Ureaplasma infection increased the infiltration of inflammatory cells, releasing cytokines of interleukin 6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF α) and contributing to late-onset sepsis (LOS). These pathophysiological processes justify using interstitial pneumonia as an essential parameter for Ureaplasma infection in the current study. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a persistent association between Ureaplasma and BPD in preterm infants. However, our findings suggest that an infective pattern of Ureaplasma was not independently associated with the onset of BPD.

Since Ureaplasma in broncho alveolar lavage fluids was first reported in 1988, the role of Ureaplasma in morbidities of prematurity, especially in BPD, has drawn the great interest of neonatologists. However, infants tested positive for Ureaplasma are not routinely treated in NICUs, given that no evidence supports that eradication of Ureaplasma reduces the risk for BPD. Several researchers speculated that the pattern of Ureaplasma infection might determine its contribution to BPD. Castro-Alcaraz et al. reported that only persistent Ureaplasma colonization was associated with BPD. Maternal Ureaplasma abundance might increase the risk of BPD. In the current study, we found Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was not significantly associated with a higher risk of BPD, despite a striking clinical effect being noticed.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^113fmHbD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

An effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with a reduced risk of BPD. These sort of contradictory findings indicate that azithromycin treatment might work by other mechanisms than eradicating Ureaplasma, including but not strict to the anti-inflammatory effect of azithromycin. Viscardi et al. had previously reported that administration of azithromycin at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg for three days effectively eradicated Ureaplasma from the respiratory tract and tended to reduce BPD. However, the effect was not statistically significant, which could be attributed to the under power of the study. The same authors reported an increased rate of death or serious respiratory morbidities in Ureaplasma positive infants (58%) compared to negative infants (21%) in a 2-years-follow-up study of the trial, indicating a compromised lung function in Ureaplasma positive infants.

We acknowledge that the clinical setting regarding Ureaplasma, azithromycin and BPD is highly complicated. The complicated issues include the association between Ureaplasma and BPD, azithromycin and pneumonia resolution, the influence of pneumonia on BPD, the effect of azithromycin on the development of BPD, etc. Addressing these issues would be challenging even in a series of well-designed prospective studies. However, we hope the findings in our study could add to the body of evidence regarding these topics. There could be some confounders compromising the accuracy of CXR assessment. A severe RDS might interfere with the initial assessment of CXR (20% in this cohort), while other concurrent pulmonary infections and PDA might impede the second accurate assessment of CXR. Furthermore, sampling from tracheal aspirates would be more accurate than nasopharyngeal swabs in PCR testing for Ureaplasma.

In summary, we found that radiographic improvement following azithromycin treatment was associated with a reduced risk for BPD in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants. However, these data need to be interpreted with caution since potential confounders might affect the accuracy of the CXR evaluation.

### Doxycycline tablets and advanced acne wash (benzoDox 30 kit) [^117WhARb]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

​INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline tablets and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

Rocky mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.

Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.

Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydophila psittaci.

Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated as judged by immunofluorescence.

Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.

Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.

Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.

Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis.

Doxycycline is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms:

### Azithromycin monohydrate (azithromycin) [^1128z9Vr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Azithromycin acts by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.

Resistance

Azithromycin demonstrates cross-resistance with erythromycin. The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is modification of the 23S rRNA target, most often by methylation. Ribosomal modifications can determine cross resistance to other macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLSBphenotype).

Antimicrobial Activity

Azithromycin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae

Gram-Negative Bacteria

Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Legionella pneumophila

Other Bacteria

Chlamydophila pneumoniae Chlamydia trachomatis Mycoplasma hominis Mycoplasma pneumoniae

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Aerobic Gram-Positive Bacteria

Streptococci (Groups C, F, G)

Viridans group streptococci

Gram-Negative Bacteria

Bordetella pertussis

Anaerobic Bacteria

Peptostreptococcus species

Prevotella bivia

Other Bacteria

Ureaplasma urealyticum

### The role of Ureaplasma species in prenatal and postnatal morbidity of preterm infants: current concepts [^1123VsLp]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma species are considered commensals of the adult urogenital tract. Yet, in pregnancy, Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum have been associated with chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. In preterm infants, Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization has been correlated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other complications of prematurity. Controversies on the impact of Ureaplasma exposure on neonatal morbidity, however, remain, and recommendations for screening practices and therapeutic management in preterm infants are missing.

Summary

In this review, we outline clinical and experimental evidence of Ureaplasma-driven fetal and neonatal morbidity, critically examining inconsistencies across some of the existing studies. We explore underlying mechanisms of Ureaplasma-associated neonatal morbidity and discuss gaps in the current understanding including the interplay between Ureaplasma and the maternal urogenital tract and the preterm airway microbiome. Ultimately, we highlight the importance of adequate diagnostics and review the potential efficacy of anti-infective therapies.

Key Messages

There is strong evidence that perinatal Ureaplasma exposure is causally related to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and there are conclusive data of the role of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of neonatal central nervous system infection. Observational and experimental findings indicate immunomodulatory capacities that might promote an increased risk of secondary infections. The burden of Ureaplasma exposure is inversely related to gestational age - leaving the tiniest babies at highest risk. A better knowledge of contributing pathogen and host factors and modulating conditions remains paramount to define screening and treatment recommendations allowing early intervention in preterm infants at risk.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^115FioKW]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at risk for adverse pulmonary outcomes during childhood and into adulthood. – Up to 50% of BPD infants require re-hospitalization in the first year of life. – Since respiratory health may continue to evolve over the first few years of life and BPD and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes are closely linked, it is essential to include long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental assessments as part of any neonatal clinical trial to prevent BPD.

The genital mollicute species Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomesand morbidities of prematurity, including BPD, necrotizing enterocolitis, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). – Although macrolides have antimicrobial and immmumodulatory properties making them ideal therapeutic candidates for Ureaplasma eradication, none of the prior studies of macrolides for prevention of BPD included long-term follow-up. –

We conducted a series of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic open-label studies of intravenous azithromycin (AZM) – to select a safe, effective dose for the recently completed pilot (Phase IIb) randomized clinical trial of multi-dose AZM (20 mg/kg × 3 days) in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, 24–28 weeks gestation). The results of this trial demonstrated that (1) a 3-day course of AZM effectively eradicated Ureaplasma in ELGAN infants and (2) perinatal mortality and prolonged respiratory support are concentrated in ELGANs who have Ureaplasma in the lower respiratory tract. To determine the long-term safety of neonatal AZM therapy and the potential impact on long-term outcomes, pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed at 22–26 months corrected age in participants of the randomized controlled trial (RCT).

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^115RzdUV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Azithromycin treatment strategies

VLBW infants were routinely screened for Ureaplasma after admission. The testing result was available within 48–72 h. The treatment was initiated shortly after doctors received the results. There is no current census on azithromycin treatment for Ureaplasma in preterm infants. For infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia, azithromycin was administered orally at a daily dose of ten mg/kg for a week followed by five mg/kg for the next week. This regimen was modified from Ballard et al. where they used ten mg/kg of azithromycin daily for seven days, followed by five mg/kg of azithromycin for an additional five weeks. We shortened the course on consideration of the potential side effect of azithromycin. For infants with Ureaplasma colonization, ten mg/kg azithromycin was administered orally daily for three days, suspended for four days, then repeated for three days. Dosage of azithromycin for Ureaplasma colonization was modified from a local consensus. Eleven infants in Ureaplasma colonized group completed half the treatment course (ten mg/Kg for three days) due to clinical sepsis and feeding intolerance. They were included in the analysis. No RT-PCR test for Ureaplasma was performed after azithromycin treatment. The efficacy of azithromycin treatment was thus assessed based on radiographic improvement and laboratory tests.

Statistics

The sample size was calculated based on a pilot study, where the rate of BPD was 48% in Ureaplasma-associated pneumonic infants, and the rate was 20% in Ureaplasma colonized VLBW infants. At an 80% power and an α = 0.05, 42 infants in each group would be sufficient to detect a significant difference. All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0. In the univariate analysis, the chi-square test was used to analyse categorical variables, the nonparametric McNemar test was used for comparison of paired categorical variables, and the Student t-test was used for normally distributed continuous variables. Data were reported as numbers (%), the mean ± standard deviation, and IQR, respectively. Variates with a P -value < 0.1 were included in the multivariate logistic analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed by binary logistic regression and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^117Um8nf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Post hoc analyses

Patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation (n = 21) were of lower gestation and birth weight than TA-negative intubated participants (n = 52) and non-intubated infants (n = 47) (table 3). In 5/52 (10%) TA-negative and 18/47 (38%) non-intubated neonates, one or more nasopharyngeal samples were Ureaplasma positive. Outcomes including Ureaplasma -free survival, overall survival, physiological BPD-free survival, durations of hospitalisation, mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and postnatal steroid exposure were less favourable in patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation than intubated infants without lower tract involvement or non-intubated patients (table 3). In patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation, physiological BPD-free survival was 50% (5/10), (95% CI 19% to 81%) in azithromycin-treated versus 18% (2/11), (95% CI 2% to 52%) in placebo-treated infants (p = 0.18) (table 4).

Safety

Common morbidities of prematurity occurring after randomisation and prior to hospital discharge were similar between treatment groups (table 5) and when stratified by race (online supplementary table 2S). Posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) was more common in the azithromycin-assigned compared with the placebo group (6 vs 0). Prior to dosing, IVH status was unknown in 4/6 of these infants; 1/6 had grade 2 IVH; and 1/6 received no azithromycin. Among those assigned to azithromycin, 11/56 (20%) had retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) > stage 2 compared with 4/56 (7%) assigned to placebo. ROP was more common in white infants in both treatment groups than non-white infants, which appears to explain most of this difference (online supplementary table 2S). There were no reported cases of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) or QT-interval prolongation.

### Method for identification and bacterial count quantification in a case of Ureaplasma meningitis [^115Pooji]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine Ureaplasma infection is associated with chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. The difficulty of detecting Ureaplasma species by conventional culture methods makes definitive diagnosis of clinical infection challenging. Thus far, quantitative tests for Ureaplasma have been performed using adult cervical samples, amniotic fluid, and pediatric bronchial secretions, but quantification of bacterial count in central nervous system infections caused by Ureaplasma species has not been unreported. We report a case of culture-negative Ureaplasma meningitis in a preterm infant in whom novel techniques to identify this pathogen and quantify bacterial count were effective. We suspected meningitis based on a sustained reduction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose levels. Multiple CSF cultures were sterile. We confirmed infection by Ureaplasma species using the melting temperature mapping method. Treatment with erythromycin and ciprofloxacin resulted in a gradual decrease in the bacterial count in the CSF to 0. Our study highlights the potential utility of the melting temperature mapping method as a new diagnostic tool for culture-negative Ureaplasma meningitis and establishes the utility of serial quantification of bacterial count to monitor response to therapy.

Regarding medical management for non-gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to general principles, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to decide on the choice of therapy for Mycoplasma genitalium infection based on an individual resistance profile, surveillance data, or suspected resistance from typical prescribing practices (antibiotic consumption) for other infections.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^115u1afc]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic sensitivity test showed that the susceptible rate of Cyclolipoerythromycin was 94.74%, Minocycline was 93.68%, and doxycycline was 92.63% (Fig. 1), As doxycycline is inexpensive and easily available, we usually recommend doxycycline for patients who are susceptible to doxycycline and have no history of allergies or contraindications, and choose 7-day or 14-day treatment plan according to the patient's wishes. As a result, 14 UU-positive patients were treated with other sensitive antibiotics due to antibiotic sensitivity tests showing doxycycline resistance or intermediate sensitivity, or for other reasons, and 81 UU-positive patients received doxycycline treatment. We collected 52 patients with a 7-day treatment plan and 29 patients with a 14 day treatment plan with doxycycline, the cure rates were 84.62% and 89.66% respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two treatment plans (p = 0.738). (Table 2). At the same time, we also found that the two treatment plans have no significant difference in semen volume, PH, sperm concentration, PR, total motility and normal morphology for UU cured patients (p = 0.490, p = 0.529, p = 0.995, p = 0.592, p = 0.486 and p = 0.293, respectively).

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^113PaK25]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia and azithromycin treatment affect the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants who tested positive for Ureaplasma within 72 h after birth in a tertiary unit. Chest X-ray (CXR) and laboratory test were performed before and after azithromycin treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent association between BPD and Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia, as well as BPD and effective azithromycin treatment.

Results

A total of 118 infants were included in the current study, of whom 36 developed BPD (defined as supplemental oxygen needed at postmenstrual age 36 weeks or discharge). The rate of BPD was significantly higher in infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia (44.6%) compared to infants with Ureaplasma colonization (17.7%, P = 0.002). After adjusting for confounders, an effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with reduced risk of BPD [odd ratio (OR) 0.011; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.000–0.250), whereas Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was not significantly associated with BPD (OR 1.835; 95% CI: 0.548–6.147).

Conclusion

Effective Azithromycin treatment in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants was associated with a reduced risk of BPD.

### Prevalence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in women with chronic urinary symptoms [^117PFJBt]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the prevalence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in women experiencing chronic urinary symptoms.

Methods

Urine, vaginal, and urethral samples obtained from 153 women presenting with chronic voiding symptoms were tested for the presence of pathogens including U. urealyticum and M. hominis. Patients with positive cultures for Mycoplasma were treated with a single dose of 1 g azithromycin and followed up 1 month after therapy. Patients with persistent infection received 100 mg doxycycline orally, twice daily for 7 days, according to the results of the susceptibility test. The patients were asked to rate the severity of their symptoms at their initial visit and after treatment.

Results

U. urealyticum was detected from ≥ 1 site in 81 women (52.9%), and M. hominis was detected in 5 patients (3.3%), always in association with U. urealyticum. At follow-up, 77 patients (95.1%) initially positive for Mycoplasma had negative cultures; the cultures of 4 (4.9%) remained positive for U. urealyticum and became negative after the second therapeutic regimen. A significant improvement in all symptoms was observed in women with positive cultures for Mycoplasma after therapy.

Conclusions

A high prevalence of U. urealyticum was observed in women with unexplained chronic voiding symptoms. Testing for the presence of U. urealyticum and M. hominis in the urogenital tract could prove valuable for the management of a significant percentage of chronic urinary symptoms in women through appropriate treatment.

### The significance of Ureaplasma urealyticum as a pathogenic agent in the paediatric population [^115Gm4Ld]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ureaplasma urealyticum is a frequent commensal in the lower genital tract of sexually active women. It may be transmitted perinatally from the colonized mother to her offspring, often resulting in prematurity and neonatal disease. The microorganism also sustains a causative role for infectious diseases in older children.

Recent Findings

U. urealyticum infection can be diagnosed by culture, polymerase chain reaction, and the detection of specific antibodies. Neonatal infection has been implicated in various pathological conditions including pneumonia, chronic lung disease, central nervous system disorders, sepsis, osteomyelitis and even death. Older children may present with wheezing, pneumonitis, pertussis-like syndrome and different forms of arthritis. Large well-designed trials have demonstrated that the regular administration of antibiotics to vaginally colonized women are not beneficial in terms of preventing preterm labour. Macrolide-containing antibiotic regimens are, however, recommended for preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Erythromycin treatment of ureaplasma respiratory colonized premature infants shows no reduction in the incidence of chronic lung disease. Treatment of central nervous system infections, sepsis and arthritides includes tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and anti-inflammatory agents, respectively.

Summary

This review covers recent evidence concerning the role of U. urealyticum as a pathogen during childhood. It also includes an evaluation of contemporary diagnostic techniques and optimal therapeutic approaches.

### Rare case ofseptic arthritis in an immunocompetent patient [^112HxF34]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Mycoplasmatacea family comprises two genera: Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma Ureaplasma parvum (previously known as U. urealyticum biovar 1) commonly colonises the urogenital tract in humans. Although Ureaplasma species have well-established pathogenicity in urogenital infections, its involvement in septic arthritis has been limited to prosthetic joint infections and immunocompromised individuals. We present a rare case of native right knee infection due to U. parvum identified using next-generation sequencing of microbial cell-free DNA testing and confirmed with PCR assays. This rare case of Ureaplasma septic arthritis was diagnosed using newer next-generation DNA sequencing diagnostic modalities and a literature review of prior cases, antibiotic coverage and antimicrobial resistance is incorporated as part of the discussion.

### Azithromycin dihydrate (azithromycin) [^113Nwb22]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Azithromycin acts by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.

Resistance

Azithromycin demonstrates cross-resistance with erythromycin. The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is modification of the 23S rRNA target, most often by methylation. Ribosomal modifications can determine cross resistance to other macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLSBphenotype).

Antimicrobial Activity

Azithromycin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-positive Bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Gram-negative Bacteria

Haemophilus influenzae

Moraxella catarrhalis

Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Legionella pneumophila

Other Bacteria

Chlamydophila pneumoniae

Chlamydia trachomatis

Mycoplasma hominis

Mycoplasma pneumoniae

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Aerobic Gram-Positive Bacteria

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^113o26MF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test whether azithromycin eradicates Ureaplasma from the respiratory tract in preterm infants.

Design

Prospective, phase IIb randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Seven level III-IV US, academic, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

Patients

Infants 24 0 6 weeks' gestation (stratified 24 0 6; 27 0 6 weeks) randomly assigned within 4 days following birth from July 2013 to August 2016.

Interventions

Intravenous azithromycin 20 mg/kg or an equal volume of D5W (placebo) every 24 hours for 3 days.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was Ureaplasma -free survival. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, Ureaplasma clearance, physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, comorbidities of prematurity and duration of respiratory support.

Results

One hundred and twenty-one randomised participants (azithromycin: n = 60; placebo: n = 61) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (mean gestational age 26.2 ± 1.4 weeks). Forty-four of 121 participants (36%) were Ureaplasma positive (azithromycin: n = 19; placebo: n = 25). Ureaplasma -free survival was 55/60 (92% (95% CI 82% to 97%)) for azithromycin compared with 37/61 (61% (95% CI 48% to 73%)) for placebo. Mortality was similar comparing the two treatment groups (5/60 (8%) vs 6/61 (10%)). Azithromycin effectively eradicated Ureaplasma in all azithromycin-assigned colonised infants, but 21/25 (84%) Ureaplasma -colonised participants receiving placebo were culture positive at one or more follow-up timepoints. Most of the neonatal mortality and morbidity was concentrated in 21 infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation. In a subgroup analysis, physiological BPD-free survival was 5/10 (50%) (95% CI 19% to 81%) among azithromycin-assigned infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation versus 2/11 (18%) (95% CI 2% to 52%) in placebo-treated infants.

Conclusion

A 3-day azithromycin regimen effectively eradicated respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation in this study.

Trial Registration Number

NCT01778634.

### Erythromycin (ERYTHROMYCIN base filmtab) [^113RjL9E]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Optimal blood levels are obtained when Erythromycin Base Filmtab tablets are given in the fasting state (at least ½ hour and preferably 2 hours before meals).

Adults

The usual dosage of Erythromycin Base Filmtab is one 250 mg tablet four times daily in equally spaced doses or one 500 mg tablet every 12 hours. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. However, twice-a-day dosing is not recommended when doses larger than 1 g daily are administered.

Children

Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. The usual dosage is 30 to 50 mg/kg/day, in equally divided doses. For more severe infections this dosage may be doubled but should not exceed 4 g per day.

In the treatment of streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory tract (e.g., tonsillitis or pharyngitis), the therapeutic dosage of erythromycin should be administered for at least ten days.

The American Heart Association suggests a dosage of 250 mg of erythromycin orally, twice a day in long-term prophylaxis of streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections for the prevention of recurring attacks of rheumatic fever in patients allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides.3

Conjunctivitis of the Newborn Caused by Chlamydia trachomatis

Oral erythromycin suspension 50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for at least 2 weeks.3

Pneumonia of Infancy Caused by Chlamydia trachomatis

Although the optimal duration of therapy has not been established, the recommended therapy is oral erythromycin suspension 50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for at least 3 weeks.

Urogenital Infections During Pregnancy Due to Chlamydia trachomatis

Although the optimal dose and duration of therapy have not been established, the suggested treatment is 500 mg of erythromycin by mouth four times a day on an empty stomach for at least 7 days. For women who cannot tolerate this regimen, a decreased dose of one erythromycin 500 mg tablet orally every 12 hours or 250 mg by mouth four times a day should be used for at least 14 days.5

For adults with uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, when tetracycline is contraindicated or not tolerated

500 mg of erythromycin by mouth four times a day for at least 7 days.5

For patients with nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum when tetracycline is contraindicated or not tolerated

500 mg of erythromycin by mouth four times a day for at least seven days.5

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^113KdWZv]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We conducted 22–26-month corrected age follow-up for this Phase IIb RCT to assess the potential impact of AZM therapy on long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. We have previously published the primary efficacy outcome analysis showing that intravenous AZM 20 mg/kg for 3 days effectively eradicates Ureaplasma respiratory colonization. In the follow-up study, we did not find strong evidence for an impact of neonatal exposure to AZM on later pulmonary and neurodevelopment outcomes. Based on the 95% confidence interval (−14 to 21%), our data do not rule out either a moderately reduced or moderately increased risk of death or serious respiratory morbidity at 22–26 months corrected age in those receiving AZM relative to placebo. Similarly, the 95% confidence interval for difference in death or NDI between treatment groups is broad (−2 to 34%). Importantly, we observed that infants who had lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization in the neonatal period had persistent adverse pulmonary outcomes, including greater risk for the composite outcome death or serious respiratory morbidity, suggesting that these infants should be targeted in future trials.

Since the widely used BPD definitions are poor predictors of subsequent respiratory illness later in childhood, consensus is lacking among neonatologists on which clinically meaningful short- and long-term endpoints should be targeted in clinical trials of BPD prevention.– In the current follow-up study, we chose the composite outcome of death or serious respiratory morbidity defined by Jensen et al.as the primary outcome. The components of the serious respiratory morbidity definition could be ascertained from the electronic medical records for the majority of subjects and they represent meaningful clinical outcomesand are factors that impact parents' perceptions of quality of life for their childrenand inform healthcare providers. Jensen et al.determined that a revised BPD definition that categorized lung disease severity according to mode of respiratory support at 36 weeks PMA rather than supplemental oxygen best predicted serious respiratory morbidity in the first 2 years of life in preterm infants born < 27 weeks gestation.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^115iJr9t]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To assess the potential impact of azithromycin treatment in the first week following birth on 2-year outcomes in preterm infants with and without Ureaplasma respiratory colonization who participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Respiratory morbidity was assessed at NICU discharge and at 6, 12, and 22–26 months corrected age using pulmonary questionnaires. Comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessments were completed between 22 and 26 months corrected age. The primary and secondary composite outcomes were death or severe respiratory morbidity and death or moderate–severe neurodevelopmental impairment, respectively, at 22–26 months corrected age.

Results

One hundred and twenty-one randomized participants (azithromycin, N = 60; placebo, N = 61) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. There were no significant differences in death or serious respiratory morbidity (34.8 vs 30.4%, p = 0.67) or death or moderate–severe neurodevelopmental impairment (47 vs 33%, p = 0.11) between the azithromycin and placebo groups. Among all trial participants, tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive infants experienced a higher frequency of death or serious respiratory morbidity at 22–26 months corrected age (58%) than tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -negative infants (34%) or non-intubated infants (21%) (p = 0.028).

Conclusions

We did not observe strong evidence of a difference in long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopment outcomes in preterm infants treated with azithromycin in the first week of life compared to placebo.

Impact

No strong evidence of a difference in long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopment outcomes was identified at 22–26 months corrected age in infants treated with azithromycin in the first week of life compared to placebo.
The RCT is the first study of 2-year pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes of azithromycin treatment in ELGANs.
Provides evidence that ELGANs with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma have the most frequent serious respiratory morbidity in the first 2 years of life, suggesting that a Phase III trial of azithromycin to prevent BPD targeting this population is warranted.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1159CYr9]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

ASB and struvite stones — management of urease-producing bacteriuria: Certain bacteria (most commonly P. mirabilis) produce urease and are associated with infection (struvite) stones, and when infection stones are present, complete removal of the stones is required to eradicate the associated UTI. However, there is no clear evidence that identification and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) caused by urease-producing organisms prevents struvite stone formation, and for these reasons the Panel does not recommend the routine treatment of urease-producing bacteriuria (including P. mirabilis) in the absence of UTI symptoms or documented urinary tract stones. In certain patients with recurrent struvite stones, screening for and treating urease-producing bacteriuria may be indicated if other measures have not been able to prevent stone formation.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^113Tji7V]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Study participants

Infants were recruited from seven sites over 37 months (July 2013–August 2016). A total of 982 patients were screened, of whom 434 (44%) were eligible (online supplementary figure 1S). Of 121 randomised, 60 were assigned to azithromycin and 61 were assigned to placebo; 119 (98%) received at least one dose of assigned treatment, one in each treatment group did not receive any doses of assigned treatment and treatment was discontinued in four azithromycin participants (one parent request and three clinical team request). All participants who received < 3 doses were Ureaplasma negative. One placebo-assigned infant who was nasopharyngeal Ureaplasma positive received a single dose of azithromycin due to pharmacy error.

The baseline characteristics of randomised patients and stratified by Ureaplasma status are summarised in table 1. An imbalance in race distribution occurred with 40% non-white in the azithromycin versus 75% in the placebo group. Other baseline characteristics were similar comparing treatment arms for the entire study cohort and when stratified by Ureaplasma colonisation status.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the study participants for the total cohort and stratified by Ureaplasma status

Forty-four of 121 participants (36%) were Ureaplasma positive at one or more time points with 19 (32%) randomised to azithromycin and 25 (41%) to placebo (table 1 and online supplementary figure 2S). Ureaplasma prevalence was higher in the 24 0–26 6 weeks' gestation stratum compared with 27 0–28 6 weeks (36/83 (43%) vs 8/38 (21%), p = 0.02). Ureaplasma parvum was the most common species detected in both treatment arms (U. parvum, n = 33 (75%); U. urealyticum n = 7 (16%); both species, n = 3 (7%); untyped n = 1 (2%)). The Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)₅₀ and MIC₉₀ for Ureaplasma isolates were 2 µg/mL and 4 µg/mL, respectively. No tested isolate was resistant to azithromycin (MIC ≥ 16 µg/mL).

### Ureaplasma infection and neonatal lung disease [^115HDroz]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Infection with the ureaplasmas may occur in utero or perinatally in prematurely born infants. For some infants, infection with these organisms triggers a vigorous pro-inflammatory response in the lungs and increases the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). At present, there is insufficient evidence from clinical trials to determine whether antibiotic treatment of Ureaplasma has any influence on the development of BPD and its comorbidities. Future investigation in the context of well-designed, adequately powered controlled clinical trials should focus on determining whether treatment of ureaplasmal infection lessens lung inflammation, decreases rates of BPD, and improves long-term, neurodevelopmental outcome.

### Ureaplasma – are you sitting comfortably? [^112SU9Yx]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The role of Ureaplasma spp. in human disease has been controversial, as these bacteria are commonly isolated as part of the normal genital tract flora. Ureaplasma has been shown to have a causal role in urogenital infections and is associated with significant foetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when infection occurs during the perinatal period. Although rare, invasive Ureaplasma infection (meningitis, renal abscess, mediastinitis and arthritis) has also been reported in both adults and children. This review outlines the unique microbiological features and various clinical presentations of Ureaplasma infection. It also discusses the treatment options, which in the neonatal period can be particularly challenging.

### Randomized clinical trial of extended spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis with coverage for Ureaplasma urealyticum to reduce post-cesarean delivery endometritis [^111t7QPa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if extended spectrum prophylactic antibiotic treatment (with efficacy against Ureaplasma urealyticum) reduces post-cesarean delivery clinical endometritis.

Methods

After cord clamping at cesarean delivery, subjects received prophylaxis with cefotetan. Subjects were then simultaneously randomized (double blind) to receive doxycyline plus azithromycin versus placebo. Post-cesarean delivery endometritis was defined clinically as fever of 100.4F or higher with one or more supporting clinical signs or a physician diagnosis of endometritis plus the absence of a nonpelvic source of fever.

Results

A total of 597 women were enrolled, 301 in the doxycycline/azithromycin group and 296 in the placebo group. The study population was 56% black, 25.5 ± 6.2 years of age, and 43% nulliparous. The groups were similar (P > .05) for black race, parity, maternal age, and most risk factors for post-cesarean delivery endometritis. The frequency of post-cesarean delivery endometritis (16.9% versus 24.7%, P = 0.020), wound infections (0.8% versus 3.6%, P = 0.030), and a combination of these two outcomes (19.0% versus 27.8%, P = 0.019) were significantly lower in the doxycycline/azithromycin group compared with the placebo-treated group. The doxycycline/azithromycin versus placebo groups were dissimilar for maternal leukocytosis (24.9% versus 12.5%, P = 0.042) and frequency of classic uterine incision (7.6% versus 12.5%, P = 0.048). Adjusting for these factors did not alter the risk ratio for post-cesarean delivery endometritis in the active versus placebo-treated group (relative risk 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.43, 0.98). Length of stay was longer in the placebo group overall (104 ± 56 versus 95 ± 32 hours, P = 0.016) and among women with endometritis (146 ± 52 versus 127 ± 46 hours, P = 0.047).

Conclusion

Extended spectrum prophylactic antibiotic treatment (with presumed efficacy against U urealyticum) given to women undergoing cesarean delivery at term shortens hospital stay and reduces the frequency of post-cesarean delivery endometritis and wound infections.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^1172xUXx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication in premature infants and remains prevalent in extremely preterm infants despite great advances in perinatal care. The pathogenesis of BPD is unclear and multifactorial, including but not restricted to oxygen toxicity, mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury and infection/inflammation. Ureaplasma spp. has been reported as one of the earliest microbiotas colonized in the airway of premature infants, potentially contributing to the inflammatory and fibrotic profile of BPD. Ureaplasma spp. has two species, Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum, with 14 known serovars. Both species were linked with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), chorioamnionitis and preterm labor. The association between Ureaplasma and BPD was first discussed by Holtzman et al. in 1989, who concluded that there was not enough evidence to prove the association. Several studies also investigated the association between Ureaplasma and BPD, yielding conflicting findings. Castro-Alcaraz and colleagues found the pattern of Ureaplasma colonization may be related to BPD, given that infants with persistent Ureaplasma had an increased risk of BPD. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, pulmonary colonization with Ureaplasma increased the risk of BPD by three folds in premature infants. However, a recent randomized trial reported that the eradication of Ureaplasma by azithromycin failed to decrease the risk of BPD. Although the trial was underpowered to detect a difference in BPD due to funding problems, it indirectly supports the idea that Ureaplasma was not associated with BPD. Noticeably, the detection and diagnosis criteria of Ureaplasma and BPD vary greatly among these studies, which may partially explain the elusive association between Ureaplasma and BPD.

In clinical practice, we observed that infants at a radiographically infectious status display a different respiratory clinical course than those with colonization alone. Inspired by Castro-Alcaraz and colleagues who found the pattern of Ureaplasma colonization was essential, this study aims to investigate the association between the proven infection of Ureaplasma with BPD and to evaluate the effect of azithromycin treatment on BPD.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^113zUPa5]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Leukocytospermia or pyospermia is still a confusing and controversial topic for clinicians. Although it has been proposed by the World Health Organization as an indicator of reproductive tract infection and inflammation, the evidence is not convincing. The frequency of leukocytospermia among infertile males is quite wide, and the reliable incidence is about 30%. Some pathophysiological views recognize that bacteria and infiltrating leukocytes, two major inflammatory mediators, directly or indirectly affect human sperm function, However, most leukocytospermia is not caused by bacterial infection or bacteriospermia, or there is no evidence of microbial infection, this may be because the invasion of male reproductive tract by microorganisms may be divided into three different stages. In the first stage, bacterial infection can be induced by microorganisms, and pathological bacterial strains can be observed in semen, without attracting a large number of white blood cells; in the second stage, activated white blood cells appear in ejaculation; in the third stage, bacteria are removed, usually with isolated leukocytospermia as the representative. Bacteria are mainly involved in the intrinsic and mitochondrial dependent apoptosis cell death, while oxidative stress may play a role in reducing the conventional sperm parameters in leukocytospermia, and the combined effect of bacteria and leukocytes accelerated the apoptosis and necrosis of sperm. The increased seminal leukocytes may mediate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by direct cell–cell contact or soluble products released by leukocytes. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Case–Control Studies indicated that patients with leukocytospermia showed lower sperm concentration and lower progressive motility compared to men without leukocytospermia, however, the significant differences disappeared, along with the large inter-study heterogeneity, when analyses were restricted to studies clearly reporting the inclusion of men without clinical evidence of seminal tract infection. It seems that the clinical evidence of seminal tract infection is the key to sperm quality decline, and clinical studies have also found that compared with some pathogenic bacterial strains, the direct contact between conditioned pathogenic bacteria and sperm may play a greater role in promoting apoptosis.

### Efficacy of standard therapies against Ureaplasma species and persistence among men with non-gonococcal urethritis enrolled in a randomised controlled trial [^114bF4G4]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), but not Ureaplasma parvum (UP), has been associated with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), but little is known about species-specific responses to standard therapies. We examined species-specific treatment outcomes and followed men with treatment failure for 9weeks.

Methods

From May 2007 to July 2011, men aged ≥ 16 attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (urethral discharge or urethral symptoms plus ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leucocytes /high-powered field) enrolled in a double-blind, randomised trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1g) + placebo doxycycline or active doxycycline (100mg twice a day ×7days) + placebo azithromycin. Ureaplasma were detected in culture followed by species-specific PCR. Outcomes were assessed at 3, 6 and 9weeks. At 3weeks, men with persistent Ureaplasma detection received 'reverse therapy' (e.g., active doxycycline if they first received active azithromycin). At 6weeks, persistently positive men received moxifloxacin (400mg×7days).

Results

Of 490 men, 107 (22%) and 60 (12%) were infected with UU-2 and UP, respectively, and returned at 3weeks. Persistent detection was similar for UU-2-infected men initially treated with azithromycin or doxycycline (25% vs. 31%; p = 0.53), but differed somewhat for men with UP (45% vs. 24%; p = 0.11). At 6weeks, 57% of UU-2-infected and 63% of UP-infected men who received both drugs had persistent detection. Failure after moxifloxacin occurred in 30% and 36%, respectively. Persistent detection of UU-2 or UP was not associated with signs/symptoms of NGU.

Conclusions

Persistent detection after treatment with doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin was common for UU and UP, but not associated with persistent urethritis.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^114PQNPD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

During the study period, 812 VLBW infants were admitted to the NICU. In these infants, 121 (14.9%) were tested positive for Ureaplasma. Three infants were excluded due to death before 14 days. A total of 118 infants are included in the final analysis (Fig. 1), of which 30.5% (36/118) developed BPD. The clinical characteristics of these infants were summarized in Table 2.

Infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia had significantly higher risk of BPD (44.6% vs. 17.7%, P = 0.002), longer invasive ventilation (1.0 vs 0.0 day, P = 0.004], longer non-invasive ventilation (37.0 vs 19.5 days, P < 0.001), longer oxygen support (58.0 vs 33.0 days, P < 0.001) and longer hospital stay (74.0 vs 50.0 days, P < 0.001, Table 3).

We further analysed the association between Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia and BPD, as well as the association between effective azithromycin treatment and BPD, in the multivariate logistic analysis. Univariate analysis was shown in supplemental Table 1. Although a higher rate of Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was observed in BPD infants compared with those without BPD (58.6% vs. 24.7%), the association did not reach statistically significant after adjustment [OR 1.835, 95%CI (0.548, 6.147), Table 4]. An effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with a reduced risk for BPD [OR 0.011, 95% CI (0.000, 0.250), Table 4].

### Treatment of genital Mycoplasma in colonized pregnant women in late pregnancy is associated with a lower rate of premature labour and neonatal complications [^115Qr55j]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma spp. may colonize the human genital tract and have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm labour and preterm premature rupture of membranes. However, as these bacteria can reside in the normal vaginal flora, there are controversies regarding their true role during pregnancy and so the need to treat these organisms. We therefore conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the treatment of genital mycoplasma in 5377 pregnant patients showing symptoms of potential obstetric complications at 25–37 weeks of gestation. Women presenting with symptoms were routinely screened by culture for the presence of these bacteria and treated with clindamycin when positive. Compared with uninfected untreated patients, women treated for genital mycoplasma demonstrated lower rates of premature labour. Indeed preterm birth rates were, respectively, 40.9% and 37.7% in women colonized with Ureaplasma spp. and M. hominis, compared with 44.1% in uncolonized women (Ureaplasma spp., p 0.024; M. hominis, p 0.001). Moreover, a reduction of neonatal complications rates was observed, with 10.9% of newborns developing respiratory diseases in case of Ureaplasma spp. colonization and 5.9% in the presence of M. hominis, compared with 12.8% in the absence of those bacteria (Ureaplasma spp., p 0.050; M. hominis, p < 0.001). Microbiological screening of Ureaplasma spp. and/or M. hominis and pre-emptive antibiotic therapy of symptomatic pregnant women in late pregnancy might represent a beneficial strategy to reduce premature labour and neonatal complications.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^113HDoM4]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Leukocytospermia is an abnormal laboratory finding defined by the World Health Organization as the presence of 1 × 10⁶ seminal leukocytes per mL in human ejaculate, It is generally accepted that leukocytospermia may indicate infection or inflammation of the male urogenital and sex glands tract, and it is a poor marker for either bacteriospermia or impaired semen quality, which has a negative impact on spermatogenesis or maturation, and is related to the decrease of semen parameters such as sperm concentration, motility, normal morphology and DNA fragmentation index. A prospective, controlled, blinded study suggests that leukocytospermia has a significant effect on sperm dynamic motility patterns, DNA and chromosome integrity in infertile men, and the pregnancy rate of patients cured with antibiotics is significantly higher than that of patients with persistent leukocytospermia. Studies showed that antibiotics might improve the rate of resolution of leukocytospermia, the bacteriologic cure rate, and even improve sperm parameters to increase pregnancy rate. A meta-analysis of 12 studies showed that using broad spectrum antibiotics in the treatment of patients with leukocytospermia might be useful in improving sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. But a number of studies have shown that there is no correlation between elevated levels of semen leukocytes and bacteriospermia, and evidence from an RCT study also suggests that antibiotic therapy is not beneficial for the treatment of asymptomatic leucocytospermia, even in infertile men, leukocytospermia does not affect the success rate of IVF or ICSI. Although a large number of studies have proved the relationship between semen leukocytosis and bacterial infection, sperm quality, and even the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment, the conflicting results are not convincing, the association of leukocytospermia with semen quality or male fertility and the significance of antibiotic therapy are still under debate.

### Investigation of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species using a molecular method in male patients suffering from urethritis symptoms: a cross-sectional study in the city of antalya [^112mz5G9]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) spread predominantly through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. More than 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites are transmitted through sexual contact. The characteristic findings of urethritis include urethral discharge, dysuria, itching, and burning in the anterior urethra. However, not all men with urethritis present with symptoms.

Infectious urethritis is typically caused by a sexually transmitted pathogen; thus, most cases occur in sexually active young men. The most common cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is Chlamydia (C) trachomatis, followed by Mycoplasma (M) genitalium. Ureaplasma (U) spp. and M. hominis may occur as commensals in the lower genital tract in many healthy sexually active adults. The role of ureaplasmas in NGU has long been controversial. U. urealyticum in high bacterial loads might cause a small proportion of male NGU cases, but in most men with U. urealyticum infection/colonization, NGU does not develop. Evidence that M. hominis and U. parvum cause NGU is lacking. Furthermore, almost half of all NGU cases have no specific etiology.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the fastest and sensitive diagnostic method for gonococcal urethritis and NGU. It allows the use of noninvasive samples, such as first-void urine samples and self-collected swabs. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV recommends the use of nucleic acid amplification tests as the only useful diagnostic method for M. genitalium infection in clinical samples.

Empirical treatment of NGU usually involves doxycycline or as an alternative azithromycin therapy. It is recommended that M. genitalium infection be considered in all patients with persistent urethritis despite initial empirical therapy, and if possible, a test to detect macrolide resistance should be performed. The prevalence of macrolide resistance in M. genitalium limits the usefulness of azithromycin-based regimens.

The main aim of this study was to determine the presence of M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, and U. parvum in male patients with symptoms of urethritis using molecular methods. In addition, this study investigated macrolide resistance in M. genitalium –positive samples. Other pathogenic agents of urethritis, such as Neisseria (N) gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas (T) vaginalis, were also examined in the samples.

### Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^116Ry7Lq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum may colonize the human genital tract and have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Chorioamnionitis, spontaneous preterm labour and preterm premature rupture of membranes are significant contributors to neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, as these bacteria can reside in the normal vaginal flora, there are controversies regarding their true role during pregnancy and thus the need to treat these organisms.

Recent Findings

We review here the recent data on the epidemiology of mycoplasmas and their clinical role during pregnancy. The association of these organisms with preterm labour has been suggested by many observational studies, but proof of causality remains limited. PCR is an excellent alternative to culture to detect the presence of these organisms, but culture allows antibiotic susceptibility testing. Whether antimicrobial treatment of mycoplasma-colonized pregnant patients can effectively reduce the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes warrants further investigations.

Summary

The role of Mycoplasma spp. and U. urealyticum in adverse pregnancy outcomes is increasingly accepted. However, sole presence of these microorganisms in the vaginal flora might be insufficient to cause pathological issues, but their combination with other factors such as bacterial vaginosis or cervical incompetence may be additionally needed to induce preterm birth.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^117Q6gXh]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Asymptomatic leukocytospermia may have some effect on sperm parameters, which seem to be mainly manifested in sperm concentration. When patients with asymptomatic leukocytospermia are infected with UU at the same time, the effect on sperm quality is more obvious and serious, which can involve multiple aspects of semen parameters such as PR, total motor ability and normal morphological. It is significant to screen and treat UU infection in asymptomatic leukocytospermia for improving sperm quality. Where appropriate, we recommend the 7-day treatment plan with doxycycline.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^1142dxhz]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed adult males who visited Guilin People's Hospital due to infertility and performed routine semen analysis and UU screening and treatment for patients with leukocytospermia from April 2017 to December 2019. After excluded patients with systemic diseases, cryptorchidism, chromosome abnormalities, varicocele, male azoospermia, bacteriospermia, as well as patients who drank excessively, smoked heavily, had symptoms of genitourinary tract infection or a history of antibiotic use in recent 4 weeks, 1530 patients and medical records were finally collected. Among them, 295 cases were diagnosed with leukocytospermia, 95 cases were further screened for UU-positive, 81 cases were treated with doxycycline, and 14 cases were treated with other sensitive antibiotics due to antibiotic sensitivity tests showing doxycycline resistance or intermediate sensitivity, or for other reasons. The semen parameters of non-leukocytospermia, leukocytospermia, UU-positive leukocytospermia and UU-negative leukocytospermia groups were compared, and the differences between two treatment plans with doxycycline and the semen parameters before UU treatment and 1 month after UU-cured were compared. The study was approved by the ethical review committee.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^113TtvaS]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Post hoc analyses

We had previously observed that Ureaplasma -free survival, overall survival, and physiologic BPD-free survival were lower and durations of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen, and postnatal steroid exposure were higher in intubated patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization compared to intubated infants without lower tract involvement or non-intubated infants. At follow-up, differences in unfavorable pulmonary outcomes persisted in children who had lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization. Tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive infants were discharged to home and supplemental oxygen was discontinued at later PMA and they experienced a higher frequency of the composite outcome death or serious respiratory morbidity at 22–26 months corrected age than tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -negative infants and non-intubated infants (Table 4). There were no differences among the three groups for death or moderate-to-severe NDI. To assess the long-term effect of neonatal lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization in the absence of treatment, we compared outcomes of placebo-treated tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive and Ureaplasma -negative infants (Supplemental Table 2). Placebo-treated tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive infants were discharged to home at a later PMA. Although the differences were not statistically significant, all-cause mortality (36 vs 9%, p = 0.07) and mortality from respiratory causes (18 vs 0%, p = 0.098) was greater in the Ureaplasma -positive group than for infants assigned to placebo. In patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization, death or serious respiratory morbidity was 60% (6/10) in AZM-treated vs 56% (6/11) in placebo-treated infants (p = 0.61; Table 5).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111XLhhc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Etiology

C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae is the most common etiology of cervicitis defined by diagnostic testing. Trichomoniasis, genital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection), or M. genitalium (,–) also have been associated with cervicitis. However, in many cases of cervicitis, no organism is isolated, especially among women at relatively low risk for recent acquisition of these STIs (e.g. women aged > 30 years). Limited data indicate that BV and frequent douching might cause cervicitis. The majority of persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by reinfection with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; other factors might be involved (e.g. persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, M. genitalium, douching or exposure to other types of chemical irritants, dysplasia, or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of ectopy). Available data do not indicate an association between group B streptococcus colonization and cervicitis. No specific evidence exists for a role for Ureaplasma parvum or Ureaplasma urealyticum in cervicitis.

Diagnostic Considerations

Because cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract infection (e.g. endometritis), women should be assessed for signs of PID and tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae with NAAT on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). Women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant BV and trichomoniasis. Because sensitivity of microscopy for detecting T. vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet-mount microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e. NAAT, culture, or other FDA-cleared diagnostic test) (see Trichomoniasis). Testing for M. genitalium with the FDA-cleared NAAT can be considered. Although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (i.e. PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown. Testing for U. parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital culture for group B streptococcus is not recommended.

### Ureaplasma parvum prosthetic joint infection detected by PCR [^114ja68W]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

We describe the first reported case of Ureaplasma parvum prosthetic joint infection (PJI) detected by PCR. Ureaplasma species do not possess a cell wall and are usually associated with colonization and infection of mucosal surfaces (not prosthetic material). U. parvum is a relatively new species name for certain serovars of Ureaplasma urealyticum, and PCR is useful for species determination. Our patient presented with late infection of his right total knee arthroplasty. Intraoperative fluid and tissue cultures and pre- and postoperative synovial fluid cultures were all negative. To discern the pathogen, we employed PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). Our patient's failure to respond to empirical antimicrobial treatment and our previous experience with PCR/ESI-MS in culture-negative cases of infection prompted us to use this approach over other diagnostic modalities. PCR/ESI-MS detected U. parvum in all samples. U. parvum-specific PCR testing was performed on all synovial fluid samples to confirm the U. parvum detection.

### Doxycycline [^111RFdLa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Treatment:

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.
Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydophila psittaci.
Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence.
Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.
Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis.

Doxycycline is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms:

### The role of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma in adverse pregnancy outcomes [^113F5g3i]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Genital mycoplasmas are frequently found in the vaginal flora across socioeconomic and ethnic groups and have been demonstrated to be involved in adverse perinatal outcomes. Both Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp cause inflammation potentially leading to spontaneous preterm birth and PPROM as well as postdelivery infectious complications and neonatal infections. Herein we have provided an overview of the existing literature and supportive evidence for genital mycoplasma's role in perinatal complications. Future research will need to focus on clearly delineating the species, allowing for discrimination of their effects.

### Vaginal Ureaplasma parvum serovars and spontaneous preterm birth [^112FTbp6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma species (spp) are the bacteria most often isolated from the amniotic cavity of women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes; thus, the link between intrauterine Ureaplasma spp infection and adverse pregnancy outcome clearly is established. However, because vaginal Ureaplasma spp colonization is very common in pregnant women, the reason that these microorganisms cause ascending infections in some cases but remain asymptomatic in most pregnancies is not clear. Previous studies suggested an association between vaginal colonization with Ureaplasma parvum as opposed to U urealyticum and preterm delivery. However, because of the high frequency of vaginal Ureaplasma spp colonization during pregnancy, additional risk factors are needed to select a group of women who might benefit from treatment.

Objective

To further identify pregnant women who are at increased risk for preterm delivery, the aim of the present study was to investigate U parvum serovar-specific pathogenicity in a large clinical cohort.

Study Design

We serotyped 1316 samples that were positive for U parvum using a high-resolution melt polymerase chain reaction assay, and results were correlated with pregnancy outcome.

Results

Within U parvum positive samples, serovar 3 was the most common isolate (43.3%), followed by serovar 6 (31.4%) and serovar 1 (25.2%). There was a significantly increased risk for spontaneous preterm birth at very low (< 32 weeks gestation; P < .005) and extremely low (< 28 weeks gestation; P < .005) gestational age in the group with vaginal U parvum serovar 3 colonization compared with the control group of pregnant women who tested negative for vaginal Ureaplasma spp colonization. This association was found for neither serovar 1 nor serovar 6. The combination of vaginal U parvum serovar 3 colonization and diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy or a history of preterm birth further increased the risk for adverse pregnancy outcome.

Conclusion

Colonization with U parvum serovar 3, but not serovar 1 or serovar 6, in early pregnancy is associated with preterm delivery at very and extremely low gestational age. The combination of U parvum serovar 3 colonization and a history of preterm birth or bacterial vaginosis further increases the risk for spontaneous preterm birth at low gestational age and may define a target group for therapeutic intervention studies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113p1GKE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Lethal hyperammonemia in a CAR-T cell recipient due topneumonia: a case report of a unique severe complication [^115ACCnz]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report the first incidence of Ureaplasma infection causing lethal hyperammonemia in a chimeric receptor antigen T cell (CAR-T) recipient. A 53-year-old woman, after receiving CAR-T therapy, suffered sepsis and encephalopathy. She was found to have hyperammonemia up to 643 µmol/L. Imaging revealed lung consolidations and bronchoalveolar lavage PCR was positive for U. parvum. Workup excluded liver failure and metabolic abnormalities. Antibiotics, lactulose, dextrose, arginine, levocarnitine, sodium phenylbutyrate and dialysis were used. Despite these, the patient suffered persistent elevations in ammonia, status epilepticus and cerebral oedema. Early recognition of this rare infection in susceptible populations is needed. CAR-T patients are at risk due to their immunocompromised state and may have amplified harm due to the impact of CAR-T therapy on astrocytes. An early aggressive multimodality approach is needed given the high mortality rates. These include antimicrobials, possibly with double coverage for Ureaplasma. Additionally, concurrent ammonia-suppressing and ammonia-eliminating treatments are necessary.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^11191YSE]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

To accomplish an analysis according to the principle of intention to treat and avoid treating death as a good or neutral outcome, we defined our primary outcome as Ureaplasma -free survival (ie, survival to NICU discharge with three negative cultures post-treatment). Secondary outcomes were mortality, Ureaplasma clearance, physiological BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) determined by a room air challenge (RAC), comorbidities of prematurity and duration of respiratory support. Participants were assessed at 36 ± 1 weeks' PMA and physiological BPD classified as present if they were receiving positive pressure respiratory support, nasal cannula flow ≥ 4 liters per minute (LPM or effective fractional inspired oxygen > 0.3or failed a RAC. To compare with BPD rates in other neonatal trials, participants were also classified according to the BPD severityand the modified Shennan classificationthat assigned infants on supplemental oxygen at 36 0 week as BPD present regardless of respiratory support and infants discharged home on room air < 36 weeks' PMA as BPD absent.

Sample size and statistical analysis

Using a two-sided α level of 0.05 and assuming an 80% overall survival rate in both groups, 20% twins and a 25% placebo clearance rate, the study would have power of 0.8 to detect an absolute 40% difference in the primary outcome of Ureaplasma -free survival with enrolment of 30 Ureaplasma -positive infants in each group. With an expected 45% respiratory prevalenceand 5% drop-out rate, we planned to enrol 140 participants. The principal investigator (RV) ended recruitment without any information on the unblinded treatment comparisons when 121 neonates had been randomised because of interruption to funding.

For the efficacy analysis, we compared Ureaplasma eradication and other outcomes among all randomised participants according to the principle of intention to treat and in the subgroups of Ureaplasma -positive and Ureaplasma -negative participants to estimate the extent to which azithromycin had efficacy beyond clearance. To account for possible correlation between outcomes in twins, we used generalised estimating equationsand multiple outputation. When observed counts were small, we used exact methods without accounting for twinning to calculate p values and CIs. Additional details of the statistical analysis plan are described in the online supplementary file 1.

In post hoc analyses, we explored the impact of lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation on the primary and major secondary outcomes.

All analyses were performed using SAS V.9.4.

### Ureaplasma and BPD [^114Vinwf]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Ureaplasma is an organism with low virulence and is a commensal of the lower genito-urinary tract in females. From here, it can gain entry in the amniotic fluid to cause inflammation in the amniotic compartment during pregnancy. Ureaplasma spp. are the most common organisms isolated from women with chorioamnionitis. Ureaplasma spp. are associated with increased risk for preterm labor and morbidity in the preterm neonate. However, there is some controversy regarding the importance of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This article will review the microbiology of Ureaplasma, host innate immune responses, and the pathology of lung injury in animal models of Ureaplasma chorioamnionitis. We will review epidemiological studies of Ureaplasma and BPD in preterm infants and efficacy of antibiotics in preventing preterm labor and BPD.

### Diagnostic value of metagenomic next generation sequencing for Ureaplasma urealyticum infection: a case report [^116NJVn4]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma urealyticum has high nutritional requirements for culture, and it requires special tools for identification. Theoretically, metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) can be used to detect many pathogens in clinical specimens, especially for complex infectious diseases with rare and atypical causes. Here, our patient developed severe pneumonia caused by U. urealyticum infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the etiology is unclear. After continuous negative culture, U. urealyticum was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by mNGS, and azithromycin was used. Because of the difficulty in its diagnosis, diagnosis and treatment of extragenital U. urealyticum infection is challenging. In addition, many broad-spectrum antibiotics are ineffective against this pathogen because it lacks a cell wall. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing further complications and deaths.

### Azithromycin for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm infants: a cohort study [^113BFzkV]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a significant pulmonary morbidity affecting approximately 48%−60% of extremely preterm infants (EPI). Factors contributing to BPD include, but not limited to, antenatal and post‐natal infections, receipt of mechanical ventilation, presence of inflammation, and hyperoxia‐induced injuries. Despite advancements in perinatal care such as antenatal steroids, surfactant replacement, optimized ventilation strategies, and postnatal steroids use, the incidence of BPD has shown minimal change, underscoring the need for innovative interventions in BPD management.

Aberrant regulation of lung inflammation has been considered the most important mechanism for BPD. Thus, anti‐inflammatory therapies offer the potential of preventative and reparative treatment for infants with BPD. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that exhibits both antimicrobial and anti‐inflammatory properties and been used extensively to eradicate Ureaplasma species in preterm infants. Although azithromycin has been proven effective in the treatment of other inflammatory lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its efficacy on BPD is inconclusive. A meta‐analysis reported azithromycin was associated with a significant reduction in BPD and the duration of supplemental oxygen, however, recent clinical trials have failed to confirm this effect. This discrepancy may be due to the confounding influence of Ureaplasma species infection status in preterm infants. We and others have previously found that different infection statuses of Ureaplasma species might be associated with varying BPD outcomes. Previous studies did not account for the infection status of Ureaplasma species, which may have led to the protective effects of azithromycin being concealed by Ureaplasma species infection, particularly in infants with severe Ureaplasma pneumonia.

Therefore, this study aims to assess the protective effect of azithromycin treatment on BPD in a "clean" cohort, consisting of Ureaplasma species negative infants and those classified as having Ureaplasma species colonization while excluding infants with Ureaplasma species pneumonia.

Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) testing and screening — M. genitalium is a recognized pathogen causing nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in males and cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, with 15%–25% of infections due to this organism; NAATs are the best option for detection. Currently, 2 NAATs for M. genitalium are FDA cleared (Hologic Aptima M. Gen Assay and Abbott's Alinity STI assay) for use with urine and urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, and vaginal swab samples. Routine screening is not recommended in asymptomatic men or women, and testing should be considered in persistent NGU or PID. Molecular tests for resistance markers to macrolides and fluoroquinolones are not commercially available in the United States, and culture or NAATs for Ureaplasma are not recommended because of the high prevalence of colonization in asymptomatic, sexually active people.

### Azithromycin for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm infants: a cohort study [^117D6m4h]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To test the effect of azithromycin in reducing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) risk in extremely preterm infants (EPI) without pulmonary infection.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study was performed in EPI in a tertiary unit from September 2018 to September 2022. Since only Ureaplasma species positive infants were treated with azithromycin, we included infants without Ureaplasma species (no azithromycin treatment) and those diagnosed with Ureaplasma species colonization (azithromycin treatment) in the study, while infants with Ureaplasma species pneumonia were excluded. The primary outcome was grade II + BPD, defined as BPD of grade II or higher according to the updated NICHD criteria (2018). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent association between grade II + BPD and azithromycin treatment.

Results

A total of 237 EPIs were included in the current study, of which 202 infants were classified as no azithromycin treatment (Ureaplasma species negative) and 35 infants were classified as azithromycin treatment (Ureaplasma species colonization). Clinical characteristics were similar between groups. Infants treated with azithromycin had a significantly lower rate of grade II + BPD (8.6% vs. 31.2%, p = 0.006), and shorter duration of invasive ventilation (0 vs. 3 days, p = 0.045) compared to untreated ones. After adjusting for confounders, azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with reduced risk of grade II + BPD in the whole cohort (odd ratio [OR] 0.211, 95% CI: 0.056, 0.786, p = 0.020], and infants absent of other pulmonary infection (OR 0.115, 95% CI: 0.014, 0.979, p = 0.048).

Conclusion

Azithromycin is associated with a reduced risk of grade II + BPD in EPIs, likely due to its anti-inflammatory effect.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^112h56pC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test whether azithromycin eradicates Ureaplasma from the respiratory tract in preterm infants.

Design

Prospective, phase IIb randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Seven level III–IV US, academic, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

Patients

Infants 24 0–28 6 weeks' gestation (stratified 24 0–26 6; 27 0–28 6 weeks) randomly assigned within 4 days following birth from July 2013 to August 2016.

Interventions

Intravenous azithromycin 20 mg/kg or an equal volume of D5W (placebo) every 24 hours for 3 days.

Main outcome measures

The primary efficacy outcome was Ureaplasma -free survival. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, Ureaplasma clearance, physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, comorbidities of prematurity and duration of respiratory support.

Results

One hundred and twenty-one randomised participants (azithromycin: n = 60; placebo: n = 61) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (mean gestational age 26.2 ± 1.4 weeks). Forty-four of 121 participants (36%) were Ureaplasma positive (azithromycin: n = 19; placebo: n = 25). Ureaplasma -free survival was 55/60 (92% (95% CI 82% to 97%)) for azithromycin compared with 37/61 (61% (95% CI 48% to 73%)) for placebo. Mortality was similar comparing the two treatment groups (5/60 (8%) vs 6/61 (10%)). Azithromycin effectively eradicated Ureaplasma in all azithromycin-assigned colonised infants, but 21/25 (84%) Ureaplasma -colonised participants receiving placebo were culture positive at one or more follow-up timepoints. Most of the neonatal mortality and morbidity was concentrated in 21 infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation. In a subgroup analysis, physiological BPD-free survival was 5/10 (50%) (95% CI 19% to 81%) among azithromycin-assigned infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation versus 2/11 (18%) (95% CI 2% to 52%) in placebo-treated infants.

Conclusion

A 3-day azithromycin regimen effectively eradicated respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation in this study.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of DORYX and other antibacterial drugs, DORYX should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Treatment

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.
Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydia psittaci.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^114uyobz]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), usually considered as a conditional pathogen, belongs to the genus Ureaplasma and the family Mycoplasmataceae in the order Mycoplasmatales. A meta-analysis found that UU, but not undifferentiated Ureaplasma infections or U. parvum, has been shown to be the pathogen of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). Moreover, UU is easy to be implanted in urethra, but not necessarily cause urethritis, quite a few patients with these infections are not aware of their infections because they may be asymptomatic, even whether it is pathogenic and the impact on fertility is still uncertain. The incidence of UU was reported inconsistently, a study of 19,098 infertile men and 3368 fertile men found that 10.22% and 3.65% of UU infertile and fertile men's urethra specimens, and 3.16% and 0.89% of MH specimens, UU infection will significantly affect sperm quality, and there is a significant relationship between UU infection and male infertility. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that there was a significant relationship between UU and Mycoplasma hominis with male infertility, and compared with the global average, the UU-positive rate was significantly higher in both the infertility group and the control group in China, while the positive rate was significantly lower in Mycoplasma hominis. Similarly, UU infection can directly affect sperm, cause leukocyte-mediated inflammatory response, and affect sperm by producing ROS.

### Chorioamnionitis: from pathogenesis to treatment [^117XQbJU]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Chorioamnionitis refers to inflammation of the amniochorionic membrane, and is a significant cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity. Chorioamnionitis most often occurs as a result of ascending infection, and is commonly associated with premature rupture of the membranes. Chorioamnionitis is generally the result of a polymicrobial infection, with Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Gram-negative anaerobes being frequent causative organisms. The mainstay of treatment includes antimicrobial agents, antipyretics, expedition of delivery and supportive care. Further research is required to identify mechanistic pathways and early biomarkers that accurately predict women at higher risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and that can thus lead to the development of additional treatment and prevention strategies.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^112tPBLz]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

AZM has a low incidence of side effects in adults and children aged > 2 years, primarily gastrointestinal symptoms. The safety of AZM in preterm infants has been assessed in a systematic review of 11 neonatal RCTs and observational studies. The majority of adverse events in the neonatal period were related to prematurity and were assessed as unlikely associated with AZM treatment. Although infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been associated with AZM exposure in the first few weeks of life, only 4 cases were identified in 473 infants included in the systematic review and there were no cases in the current trial. In addition, AZM is pro-arrhythmogenic with prior reports of occurrences of QT-interval prolongation and torsade's de pointes in adultsbut has not been observed in neonates treated with therapeutic doses.

Long-term safety of neonatal AZM exposure has not been previously addressed. In our small sample of children who were Ureaplasma positive from upper and/or lower airways, there was significantly greater serious respiratory morbidity in the AZM-assigned group than in the placebo-assigned group. A larger trial will be needed to determine whether this finding is directly related to neonatal AZM exposure or is due to random variation. This observation underscores the importance of delaying adopting AZM therapy to prevent BPD into clinical practice until a Phase III RCT is completed. There is an ongoing AZM therapy for chronic lung disease of prematurity (AZTEC) Phase III RCT of a 10-day course of AZM (20 mg/kg × 3 days, followed by 10 mg/kg for a further 7 days) that will enroll 796 preterm infants < 30 weeks gestation to determine the safety and efficacy of this regimen to improve survival without BPD.

### Maternal azithromycin therapy for Ureaplasma parvum intraamniotic infection improves fetal hemodynamics in a nonhuman primate model [^1123shaW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma parvum infection is a prevalent cause of intrauterine infection associated with preterm birth, preterm premature rupture of membranes, fetal inflammatory response syndrome, and adverse postnatal sequelae. Elucidation of diagnostic and treatment strategies for infection-associated preterm labor may improve perinatal and long-term outcomes for these cases.

Objective

This study assessed the effect of intraamniotic Ureaplasma infection on fetal hemodynamic and cardiac function and the effect of maternal antibiotic treatment on these outcomes.

Study Design

Chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus monkeys were assigned to control (n = 6), intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum (10⁷ colony-forming units/mL, n = 15), and intraamniotic infection plus azithromycin treatment (12.5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously, n = 8) groups. At approximately 135 days' gestation (term = 165 days), pulsed and color Doppler ultrasonography was used to obtain measurements of fetal hemodynamics (pulsatility index of umbilical artery, ductus venosus, descending aorta, ductus arteriosus, aortic isthmus, right pulmonary artery, middle cerebral artery and cerebroplacental ratio, and left and right ventricular cardiac outputs) and cardiac function (ratio of peak early vs late transmitral flow velocity [marker of ventricular function], Tei index [myocardial performance index]). These indices were stratified by amniotic fluid proinflammatory mediator levels and cardiac histology.

Results

Umbilical and fetal pulmonary artery vascular impedances were significantly increased in animals from the intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum group (P < .05). Azithromycin treatment restored values to control levels. Amniotic fluid prostaglandin F2 alpha levels were significantly higher in animals with abnormal umbilical artery pulsatility index (> 1.1) than in those with normal blood flow (P < .05; Spearman ρ = 0.6, P < .05). In the intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum group, left ventricular cardiac output was significantly decreased (P < .001), and more animals had abnormal right-to-left ventricular cardiac output ratios (defined as > 1.6, P < .05). Amniotic fluid interleukin-6 concentrations were elevated in cases of abnormal right-to-left ventricular cardiac output ratios compared with those in normal cases (P < .05).

Conclusion

Fetal hemodynamic alterations were associated with intraamniotic Ureaplasma infection and ameliorated after maternal antibiotic treatment. Doppler ultrasonographic measurements merit continuing investigation as a diagnostic method to identify fetal cardiovascular and hemodynamic compromise associated with intrauterine infection or inflammation and in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions or clinical management of preterm labor.

### Advances in the understanding and treatment of male urethritis [^116fZK4v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are well-documented urethral pathogens, and the literature supporting Mycoplasma genitalium as an etiology of urethritis is growing. Trichomonas vaginalis and viral pathogens (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and adenovirus) can cause urethritis, particularly in specific subpopulations. New data are emerging regarding the potential role of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria in urethritis, although results are inconsistent regarding the pathogenic role of Ureaplasma urealyticum in men. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma parvum do not appear to be pathogens. Men with suspected urethritis should undergo evaluation to confirm urethral inflammation and etiologic cause. Although nucleic acid amplification testing would detect N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis (or T. vaginalis if utilized), there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical test for M. genitalium available in the United States at this time. The varied etiologies of urethritis and lack of diagnostic options for some organisms present treatment challenges in the clinical setting.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^114QKPAN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonisation is an independent risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Evidence from clinical studies, and experimental infection models, established lung Ureaplasma as proinflammatory and profibrotic, contributing to BPD alone or when combined with inflammatory stimuli such as hyperoxia or mechanical ventilation. Whether eradicating Ureasplasma from the developing lung will reduce the risk for BPD is unknown.

Since azithromycin exhibits high potency against clinical Ureaplasma isolates in vitroand immunomodulatory properties, it is an appropriate therapeutic candidate to eradicate Ureaplasma and reduce inflammation-mediated BPD in preterm infants. We conducted open-label, pilot studies characterising the population pharmacokinetics, safety and microbiological efficacy of intravenous 10 and 20 mg/kg single dose and 20 mg/kg x3d multidose azithromycin in 24–28 week gestation infants. In the open-label, uncontrolled 20 mg/kg multidose study, azithromycin eradicated Ureaplasma and appeared safe, with no deaths or serious adverse events attributed to the drug. We performed the current pilot (phase IIb) randomised clinical trial to test: (1) the feasibility of recruitment and Ureaplasma detection; (2) whether the 3-day azithromycin regimen was safe and was more effective than placebo to eradicate Ureaplasma in colonised infants; and (3) whether azithromycin would be beneficial or harmful in the subgroups of Ureaplasma -positive and Ureaplasma -negative infants. Respiratory outcomes were explored as potential endpoints for a later phase III trial.

### Immune regulation, maternal infection, vaccination, and pregnancy outcome [^114x7Vhh]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Human cytomegalovirus

Currently, no safe or effective treatments exist for maternal HCMV infection to prevent fetal transmission. Recommendations include universal screening, prevention, hygiene education, and diagnosis of maternal HCMV infection to mitigate the significant consequences for the fetus. Although no vaccines exist currently for HCMV, modification of the most efficacious MF59-adjuvanted glycoprotein B (gB) protein subunit vaccine (gB/MF59) is underway in preclinical models.

Herpes simplex virus

HSV neonatal infection is rare but can result in fetal neurological impairment. Maternal transfer of immunoglobuloin G antibodies crossing the placenta offers a natural form of protection to the fetus; the highest risk to the fetus occurs when maternal infection and shedding are active close to delivery. Clinical trials for HSV vaccines have failed to meet their endpoint for the prevention of adult-to-adult transmission, but evidence suggests that maternal vaccination might protect infants from infection. Studies in mice using a replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine candidate, dl5–29, protected pups from infection after intranasal HSV challenge 1–2 days postpartum.

Ureaplasma

Potential causes for virulence and intra-amniotic infection with Ureaplasma are changes in the lipoprotein multiple-banded antigen isolates detected in preterm birth. Imbalance of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract increases vaginal pH, promoting infections from the vagina into the amniotic cavity. Such isolates as Ureaplasma urealyticum with higher urease activity increase pH, causing infections locally.

### Suboptimal adherence to doxycycline and treatment outcomes among men with non-gonococcal urethritis: a prospective cohort study [^111qrFUr]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Doxycycline, one of two recommended therapies for non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), consists of a 7-day course of therapy (100 mg BID). Since suboptimal adherence may contribute to poor treatment outcomes, we examined the association between self-reported imperfect adherence to doxycycline and clinical and microbiologic failure among men with NGU.

Methods

Men aged ≥ 16 years with NGU attending a Seattle, WA, sexually transmitted diseases clinic were enrolled in a double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial from January 2007 to July 2011. Men were randomised to active doxycycline/placebo azithromycin or placebo doxycycline/active azithromycin. Imperfect adherence was defined as missing ≥ 1 dose in 7 days. Urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), and Ureaplasma urealyticum-biovar 2 (UU-2) using nucleic acid amplification tests. Clinical failure (symptoms and ≥ 5 PMNs/HPF or discharge) and microbiologic failure (positive tests for CT, MG, and/or UU-2) were determined after 3 weeks.

Results

184 men with NGU were randomised to active doxycycline and provided data on adherence. Baseline prevalence of CT, MG and UU-2 was 26%, 13% and 27%, respectively. 28% of men reported imperfect adherence, and this was associated with microbiologic failure among men with CT (aRR = 9.33; 95% CI 1.00 to 89.2) and UU-2 (aRR = 3.08; 95% CI 1.31 to 7.26) but not MG. Imperfect adherence was not significantly associated with clinical failure overall or for any specific pathogens, but it was more common among imperfectly adherent men with CT (aRR = 2.63; 0.93–7.41, p = 0.07).

Conclusions

Adherence may be important for microbiologic cure of select pathogens. Factors other than adherence should be considered for CT-negative men with persistent NGU.

### Lethal hyperammonemia in a CAR-T cell recipient due topneumonia: a case report of a unique severe complication [^113FV6Yb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Learning points

Infection with urea-producing organisms (ie, Ureaplasma) can develop in immunocompromised patients, particularly recipients of organ and bone marrow transplantation, and present with sepsis and/or encephalopathy.
Ureaplasma infection should be suspected in patients with hyperammonemia who do not have liver disease and who have a low likelihood of inborn errors of metabolism (ie, adult patients).
If Ureaplasma infection is suspected, empirical antimicrobials should be started as detection of Ureaplasma requires Mycoplasma -specific media or PCR testing.
Treatment of Ureaplasma requires macrolides, tetracyclines and/or fluoroquinolones along with multiple simultaneous interventions to reduce ammonia levels and the cerebral oedema that may develop.

### Standard treatment regimens for nongonococcal urethritis have similar but declining cure rates: a randomized controlled trial [^114RE7kW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Azithromycin or doxycycline is recommended for nongonococcal urethritis (NGU); recent evidence suggests their efficacy has declined. We compared azithromycin and doxycycline in men with NGU, hypothesizing that azithromycin was more effective than doxycycline.

Methods

From January 2007 to July 2011, English-speaking males ≥ 16 years, attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (visible urethral discharge or ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field [PMNs/HPF]) were eligible for this double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1 g) + placebo doxycycline or active doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) + placebo azithromycin. Urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using nucleic acid amplification tests. Clinical cure (< 5 PMNs/HPF with or without urethral symptoms and absence of discharge) and microbiologic cure (negative tests for CT, MG, and/or UU-2) were determined after 3 weeks.

Results

Of 606 men, 304 were randomized to azithromycin and 302 to doxycycline; CT, MG, TV, and UU-2 were detected in 24%, 13%, 2%, and 23%, respectively. In modified intent-to-treat analyses, 172 of 216 (80%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 74%-85%) receiving azithromycin and 157 of 206 (76%; 95% CI, 70%-82%) receiving doxycycline experienced clinical cure (P = 0.40). In pathogen-specific analyses, clinical cure did not differ by arm, nor did microbiologic cure differ for CT (86% vs 90%, P = 0.56), MG (40% vs 30%, P = 0.41), or UU-2 (75% vs 70%, P = 0.50). No unexpected adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

Clinical and microbiologic cure rates for NGU were somewhat low and there was no significant difference between azithromycin and doxycycline. Mycoplasma genitalium treatment failure was extremely common. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT00358462.

Infection — although organisms such as Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, chlamydia, Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus have been identified more frequently in women with sporadic miscarriages, there are no convincing data that infections cause RPL; therefore there are no clear indications for routine testing for these organisms in the RPL evaluation, and given the lack of prospective studies linking any infectious agent to recurrent early pregnancy loss, any use of antibiotics is not supported by the evidence.

### The role of Mycoplasma genitalium and Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 in postgonococcal urethritis [^115bvYiF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There are few studies on coinfection with genital mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas in men with gonococcal urethritis (GU). The role of these species in postgonococcal urethritis (PGU) is poorly understood. Thus, we conducted a study to determine the prevalence of coinfection with genital mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas among men with GU and to assess the role of these pathogens in PGU.

Methods

Three hundred ninety men infected with culture-confirmed Neisseria gonorrhoeae participated in the study. Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum biovar 1, and Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 in first-voided urine samples were detected by polymerase chain reaction-based assay at the patients' initial visits. PGU was judged to be present if the urethral smear was positive for polymorphonuclear leucocytes 7–14 days after treatment for gonorrhea. The association between each microorganism and PGU, measured by the odds ratio, was estimated by multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. parvum biovar 1, and U. urealyticum biovar 2 were detected in 85 (21.8%), 16 (4.1%), 8 (2.1%), and 33 men (8.5%), respectively. In patients with chlamydia-negative GU, coinfection with M. genitalium was associated with a 14.54-fold greater risk of PGU (95% confidence interval, 2.91–72.74), and coinfection with U. urealyticum biovar 2 was associated with a 3.64-fold greater risk of PGU (95% confidence interval, 1.24–10.63).

Conclusions

Coinfection with M. genitalium or U. ureaplasma biovar 2 in men with GU was significantly associated with PGU, independent of C. trachomatis. Men with GU should be treated presumptively with antibiotics that are active against C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, and U. urealyticum biovar 2.

Systematic reviews have reported conflicting evidence on whether macrolide antibiotics reduce rates of chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) in at-risk preterm infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestation, including in those colonised with pulmonary Ureaplasma spp. Since an adequately powered trial has been lacking, we aimed to assess if the macrolide azithromycin improved survival without the development of physiologically defined moderate or severe CLD in preterm infants.

Methods

AZTEC was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 28 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in the UK. Infants were eligible if they were born at less than 30 weeks' gestation and had received at least 2 h of either non-invasive (continuous positive airway pressure or humidified high flow nasal cannula therapy) or invasive respiratory support (via endotracheal tube) within 72 h of birth. Eligible infants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio using random permuted blocks of four to receive either intravenous azithromycin at 20 mg/kg per day for 3 days followed by 10 mg/kg for 7 days, or to placebo. Allocation was stratified by centre and gestational age at birth (< 28 weeks vs ≥ 28 weeks). Azithromycin and placebo vials were encased in tamper-evident custom cardboard cartons to ensure masking for clinicians, parents, and the research team. The primary outcome was survival without development of physiologically defined moderate or severe CLD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Outcomes and safety were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (all randomly allocated infants, regardless of any post-randomisation events). The study was registered with ISRCRN (11650227) and is closed.

Findings

Infants were recruited between Oct 9, 2019, and March 22, 2022. 799 (53.1%) of 1505 eligible infants underwent random allocation; three infants were withdrawn, including consent to use their data, leaving 796 infants for analysis. Survival without moderate or severe CLD occurred in 166 (42%) of 394 infants in the intervention group and 179 (45%) of 402 in the placebo group (three-level adjusted OR [aOR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.55–1.29, p = 0.43). Pulmonary Ureaplasma spp colonisation did not influence treatment effect. Overall, seven serious adverse events were reported for the azithromycin group (five graded as severe, two as moderate), and six serious adverse events were reported in the placebo group (two severe, two moderate, and two mild), as assessed by the local principal investigators.

Interpretation

Since prophylactic use of azithromycin did not improve survival without development of physiologically-defined CLD, regardless of Ureaplasma spp colonisation, it cannot be recommended in clinical practice.

### Perinatal infections with Ureaplasma [^113qC8fu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma species are increasingly recognized as relevant pathogens in prenatal, perinatal and postnatal morbidity. They are commonly found as commensals on the mucous membranes of the lower urogenital tract of pregnant women, but when ascending, they can cause bacterial vaginosis, chorioamnionitis, premature birth and postnatal morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and early-onset neonatal sepsis and meningitis. The detection of Ureaplasma species is challenging and is not covered by routine diagnostics, and current empiric antibiotic treatment in neonates suspected of infection is not directed against Ureaplasma species. The aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiology of Ureaplasma infections, the clinical consequences and the current difficulties in diagnosis and treatment by providing an overview of the current literature.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^115wTrZk]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Efficacy analysis

The Ureaplasma -free survival was higher in the azithromycin group (92% (95% CI 82% to 97%)) compared with the placebo group (61% (95% CI 48% to 73%)) (p < 0.001) (table 2) and was sustained in analyses stratified by race (online supplementary table 1). For Ureaplasma -positive infants, Ureaplasma -free survival was higher in the azithromycin group (16/19 (84%), (95% CI 60% to 97%)) than in the placebo group (3/25 (12%), (95% CI 3% to 31%)) (p < 0.001) (table 2). The proportion of infants who survived until discharge was similar in each treatment group (92% vs 90%, table 2). All follow-up cultures were negative in the azithromycin group, but 21/25 (84%) of colonised placebo subjects were culture positive at one or more follow-up time point (online supplementary figure S2). Seven azithromycin-assigned participants were PCR positive, but culture-negative post-treatment.

Table 2
Primary and secondary outcomes of total cohort and stratified by Ureaplasma respiratory colonisation status

Secondary outcomes

Two-thirds (12/19) of participants who met criteria for RAC, failed and were classified as physiological BPD. Three infants did not have a RAC completed so they could not be classified. There were no significant differences between treatment groups for the entire cohort or stratified by Ureaplasma colonisation status (table 2) or race (online supplementary table 1S) in overall survival, physiological BPD-free survival, frequency BPD by any classification or other secondary outcomes.

### And its role in adverse perinatal outcomes: a review [^113oQTKH]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Human Ureaplasma species are the most common microbes found in amniotic fluid and in the placenta after preterm birth, and have previously been correlated with chorioamnionitis, preterm labor, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, among other adverse birth and neonatal outcomes. Although these correlations exist, there still remains little explanation as to whether Ureaplasma plays a pathogenic role in the development of neonatal disease. In addition, Ureaplasma species are not usually identified on routine culture as they require special culture methods because of their fastidious growth requirements. Treatment of Ureaplasma with macrolides has been shown to effectively eradicate the bacteria in pregnant women and infants. However, it is unclear whether this leads to improved neonatal morbidity and mortality, or whether these generally represent commensal organisms. This review will synthesize the current perspectives about the proposed mechanisms of pathogenicity of Ureaplasma bacteria, its links to poor neonatal outcomes, and the role of screening and treatment in current clinical practice.

### Azithromycin for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1112N8gN]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Azithromycin has anti-Ureaplasma and anti-inflammatory properties that might help reduce lung injury in preterm infants.

Objective

To test the efficacy and safety of prophylactic or therapeutic azithromycin in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants with unknown or proven Ureaplasma status.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library until 13 September 2020. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted the data. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to yield pooled relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the Cochrane GRADE methodology for summarizing the results.

Results

We included five randomized clinical trials. The meta-analysis revealed no significant differences in BPD (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.71, 1.19; low-quality evidence), death (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.52, 1.10; low-quality evidence), and BPD or death (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.74, 1.10; low-quality evidence). However, a significantly lower BPD or death (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70, 0.99) and a trend toward lower BPD (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66, 1.03) with azithromycin therapy was noted in Ureoplasma positive neonates. No differences in secondary outcomes were noted, except for significantly lower supplemental oxygen days with azithromycin (MD, -6.06; 95% CI, -7.40, -4.72; moderate-quality evidence). The test for subgroup differences between short (< 7 days) and long (> 7 days) course of azithromycin were nonsignificant for all the outcomes.

Conclusion

Low-quality evidence suggests azithromycin therapy reduces BPD or death in preterm infants with positive Ureoplasma, but not in all preterm infants.

### Severeinfection in a patient with ocrelizumab-induced hypogammaglobulinaemia [^117Hvdea]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Infections caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum in immune-competent people are typically simple and uncomplicated. However, in cases of immunosuppression, severe disseminated infections can occur. This case report describes the case of a severe, disseminated infection caused by U. urealyticum in a young female with unacknowledged humoral immunosuppression due to treatment with ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis. The patient was admitted due to a recurrent episode of a tubo-ovarian abscess. Throughout the following 2months of hospitalisation, treatment with several types of antibiotics and the placement of various drains led to no improvement. As extensive investigations indicated hypogammaglobulinaemia, U. urealyticum was suspected, and tests came back positive. Treatment with doxycycline and moxifloxacin led to a full recovery. This demonstrates how humoral immunosuppression is a risk factor for severe disseminated infections and how these may be avoided through monitoring of immunoglobulin levels in patients treated with ocrelizumab.

### Transition of the genital mollicutes from the second to the third trimester of pregnancy and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM women: a prospective, single-center cohort study from China [^113QvTAK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Based on this pregnancy cohort study, we found no statistically significant association between Molicutes infection and transition and adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM patients. However, when assessing for the first time the relationship between ureaplasma load variation and adverse pregnancy outcomes, we found that among GDM women with infection in both trimesters, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was significantly increased in GDM pregnant women with increased ureaplasma load from the second to the third trimester. This study highlights the need for quantitative screening for vaginal infections at different weeks of pregnancy in persistently infected GDM women and for careful personalized fertility treatment during perinatal period.

### Ureaplasma transmitted from donor lungs is pathogenic after lung transplantation [^114bkjSx]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia is a highly fatal syndrome in lung recipients that is usually refractory to medical therapy. We recently reported that infection by a Mollicute, Ureaplasma, is causative for hyperammonemia and can be successfully treated with antimicrobial agents. However, it remains unknown whether the pathogenic strain of Ureaplasma is donor or recipient derived. Here we provide evidence that donor-derived Ureaplasma infection can be pathogenic. As such, we uncover a previously unknown lethal donor-derived opportunistic infection in lung recipients. Given the high mortality associated with hyperammonemia, strategies for routine donor screening or prophylaxis should be further evaluated in prospective studies.

### An unusual and difficult to detect cause of infection in two trauma patients [^112ua8gn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding optimal antimicrobial selection is limited by lack of standardized methods and clinical breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Additionally, clinical data on the treatment of these organisms are limited to case reports and series, with limited data on clinical or microbiological response. Beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin are inactive because they target the cell wall. Myoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. are generally susceptible to agents that inhibit protein synthesis. Fluoroquinolones, which are bactericidal against mycoplasmas should be considered for empiric treatment. Doxycycline should also be considered, although resistance may be increasing. It is reasonable to use combination therapy (eg, moxifloxacin and doxycycline).

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^116T8WR7]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Similarly, asymptomatic carrying of Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) and Mycoplasma hominis (MH) is common, most people will not develop into diseases, and there is not enough evidence to prove that it is beneficial to detect and treat these infections, so it is not recommended to carry out routine detection and treatment for asymptomatic or symptomatic men and women. On the other hand, some studies suggest that the presence of UU and MH is related to the abnormal sperm parameters, sperm vitality and Progressive motility of UU infected men were significantly lower than those of uninfected men, and the mean sperm concentration was also lower. The relationship between UU infection and sperm quality or male fertility is also debated.

Therefore, we designed this study to find more evidence of the effect of asymptomatic leukocytospermia and UU infection on sperm quality and whether antibiotic therapy is beneficial.

### Azithromycin monohydrate [^117LXMfc]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Azithromycin acts by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.

Resistance

Azithromycin demonstrates cross-resistance with erythromycin. The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is modification of the 23S rRNA target, most often by methylation. Ribosomal modifications can determine cross resistance to other macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLSBphenotype).

Antimicrobial Activity

Azithromycin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus

Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-Negative Bacteria

Haemophilus influenzae

Moraxella catarrhalis

Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Legionella pneumophila

Other Bacteria

Chlamydophila pneumoniae

Chlamydia trachomatis

Mycoplasma hominis

Mycoplasma pneumoniae The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

### Ureaplasma: pathogen or passenger in neonatal meningitis? [^112hnoH2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The significance of Ureaplasma species as pathogens in neonatal meningitis remains contentious. Using an illustrative case of a premature infant with Ureaplasma parvum meningitis, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid cultures and both specific and 16s rDNA polymerase chain reaction, we discuss the epidemiology of Ureaplasma species, the difficulties involved in diagnosis and establishing pathogenicity, and the challenges in defining appropriate treatment.

### Antibiotics for Ureaplasma in the vagina in pregnancy [^115d4c4A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is a significant perinatal problem contributing to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Heavy vaginal ureaplasma colonisation is suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat infections and have been used to treat pregnant women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, resulting in some short-term improvements. However, the benefit of using antibiotics in early pregnancy to treat heavy vaginal colonisation is unclear.

Objectives

To assess whether antibiotic treatment of pregnant women with heavy vaginal ureaplasma colonisation reduces the incidence of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic regimen with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with ureaplasma detected in the vagina.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included one trial, involving 1071 women. Of these, 644 women between 22 weeks and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to one of three groups of antibiotic treatment (n = 174 erythromycin estolate, n = 224 erythromycin stearate, and n = 246 clindamycin hydrochloride) or a placebo (n = 427). Preterm birth data was not reported in this trial. Incidence of low birthweight less than 2500 grams was only evaluated for erythromycin (combined, n = 398) compared to placebo (n = 427) and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.07). There were no statistically significant differences in side effects sufficient to stop treatment between either group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.85).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to assess whether pregnant women who have vaginal colonisation with ureaplasma should be treated with antibiotics to prevent preterm birth. Preterm birth is a significant perinatal problem. Upper genital tract infections, including ureaplasmas, are suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes; this may result in prolongation of pregnancy and lowers the risks of maternal and neonatal infection. However, antibiotics may be beneficial earlier in pregnancy to eradicate potentially causative agents.

### Disseminated Ureaplasma infection as a cause of fatal hyperammonemia in humans [^112tHAh9]. Science Translational Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia syndrome is a fatal complication affecting immunosuppressed patients. Frequently refractory to treatment, it is characterized by progressive elevations in serum ammonia of unknown etiology, ultimately leading to cerebral edema and death. In mammals, ammonia produced during amino acid metabolism is primarily cleared through the hepatic production of urea, which is eliminated in the kidney. Ureaplasma species, commensals of the urogenital tract, are Mollicutes dependent on urea hydrolysis to ammonia and carbon dioxide for energy production. We hypothesized that systemic infection with Ureaplasma species might pose a unique challenge to human ammonia metabolism by liberating free ammonia resulting in the hyperammonemia syndrome. We used polymerase chain reaction, specialized culture, and molecular resistance profiling to identify systemic Ureaplasma infection in lung transplant recipients with hyperammonemia syndrome, but did not detect it in any lung transplant recipients with normal ammonia concentrations. Administration of Ureaplasma-directed antimicrobials to patients with hyperammonemia syndrome resulted in biochemical and clinical resolution of the disorder. Relapse in one patient was accompanied by recurrent Ureaplasma bacteremia with antimicrobial resistance. Our results provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between Ureaplasma infection and hyperammonemia, suggesting a need to test for this organism and provide empiric antimicrobial treatment while awaiting microbiological confirmation.

### Antibiotics for Ureaplasma in the vagina in pregnancy [^114mfbwq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is a significant obstetric problem in high-income countries. Genital infection including ureaplasmas are suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes and results in prolongation of pregnancy and lowers the risks of maternal and neonatal infection. However, antibiotics may be beneficial earlier in pregnancy to eradicate potentially causative agents.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess whether antibiotic treatment of pregnant women with ureaplasma in the vagina reduces the incidence of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (April 2003).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared any antibiotic regimen with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with ureaplasma detected in the vagina.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

One trial involving 1071 women was included. Of these, 644 randomly received antibiotic treatment (174 erythromycin estolate, 224 erythromycin sterate, and 246 clindamycin hydrochloride) and 427 received placebo. This trial did not report data on preterm birth. Incidence of low birthweight less than 2500 grams was only evaluated for erythromycin (combined) (n = 398) compared to placebo (n = 427) and there was no statistically significant difference between those treated and those not treated (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.07). In regards to side-effects sufficient to stop treatment, data were available for all women, and there were no statistically significant differences between any antibiotic (combined) and the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.85).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to show whether giving antibiotics to women with ureaplasma in the vagina will prevent preterm birth.
