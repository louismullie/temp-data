## Question

Can toradol reduce or help alleviate a fever

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Toradol (ketorolac) can reduce or help alleviate fever. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and whether ketorolac has plausible antipyretic effects. Then, I should verify direct clinical evidence for fever reduction. Next, I will check regulatory labeling to see if fever is an approved indication. After that, I need to compare ketorolac's antipyretic performance with standard agents like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. I should also review safety and contraindications that might limit its use for fever. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note any special scenarios where it might still be reasonable to use for antipyresis despite the lack of an indication [^114eDf6Y] [^113dEMgV].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic basis for antipyresis. Ketorolac, like other NSAIDs, inhibits cyclooxygenase, thereby reducing prostaglandin E2 synthesis in the hypothalamus, which resets the thermoregulatory set point and lowers fever; this mechanism is well established for NSAIDs as a class and makes an antipyretic effect biologically plausible for ketorolac as well [^114eDf6Y] [^1138qbLt].

> Now, I should verify direct clinical evidence. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in febrile adults found that IV ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg (max 30 mg) reduced temperature by a mean of 0.8°C at 60 minutes versus 0.4°C with placebo, and patients were more likely to be afebrile at 60 minutes with ketorolac (odds ratio 7.1), supporting a modest but real antipyretic effect in that acute setting [^111f2kEH]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and context: the effect size is small-to-moderate and observed over a short window, which aligns with NSAID pharmacodynamics and the short duration of ketorolac's clinical use, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly [^111f2kEH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indications. I need to check the FDA label. Ketorolac is indicated for short-term management of moderately severe acute pain, typically initiated parenterally and limited to a total of 5 days; it is not indicated for fever reduction, and the label emphasizes serious GI, renal, and cardiovascular risks that constrain its use outside of pain control contexts [^113dEMgV] [^112zU5UV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a labeled antipyretic use somewhere, but I should double-check: multiple FDA sources reiterate pain-only indications and do not list fever as an approved use, confirming that any antipyretic use would be off-label [^113dEMgV] [^116jtnGT].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness. Standard antipyretics like acetaminophen and ibuprofen have robust evidence and labeled indications for fever reduction, with acetaminophen acting centrally on the thermoregulatory center and ibuprofen providing NSAID-mediated antipyresis; ketorolac's single small RCT shows a modest 0.8°C reduction at 1 hour, which is less compelling than the broader, higher-quality evidence base for acetaminophen and ibuprofen in routine fever management [^113HP4Gh] [^112pSnrq] [^111f2kEH]. I should confirm that IV ibuprofen is the only IV NSAID in the U.S. with an explicit fever indication, underscoring that ketorolac lacks regulatory endorsement for antipyresis despite mechanistic plausibility [^117BuoTs].

> I will now examine safety and contraindications that could tilt the risk–benefit balance unfavorably for fever treatment. Ketorolac carries boxed and major warnings for GI bleeding and perforation, serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, renal toxicity, and bleeding risk; use is restricted to short courses and is contraindicated in patients with active GI ulceration, advanced renal impairment, high bleeding risk, and in late pregnancy due to ductus arteriosus closure risk, all of which argue against routine use for uncomplicated fever when safer alternatives exist [^112zU5UV] [^115eWt4b]. But wait, what if the patient has concomitant moderate-to-severe pain with fever? Even then, I need to ensure bleeding risk, renal function, and GI history are acceptable before considering ketorolac, and even then the antipyretic benefit remains secondary and modest at best [^112zU5UV].

> Let me consider special scenarios where ketorolac might still be reasonable despite the lack of indication. In postoperative patients with pain and fever, ketorolac can address analgesia while providing incidental antipyresis; a randomized trial after abdominal myomectomy showed fewer febrile episodes with ketorolac, suggesting fever reduction as a secondary outcome in an inflammatory postoperative context, though this is not a generalizable antipyretic indication [^112hn9Nu]. I should also acknowledge that palliative care surveys occasionally list NSAIDs, including rare ketorolac use, for symptom control of fever, but this reflects individualized, context-specific practice rather than evidence-based first-line antipyretic therapy [^114oHpVr].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. Yes, ketorolac can modestly reduce fever via COX inhibition and prostaglandin modulation, with a mean 0.8°C reduction at 60 minutes shown in one small RCT, but it is not FDA-approved for fever, has a less favorable risk–benefit profile for routine antipyresis than acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and should not be used solely for fever control outside of specific contexts like concurrent moderate-to-severe pain where its analgesic benefit is primary and antipyresis is incidental [^111f2kEH] [^113dEMgV] [^113HP4Gh] [^112pSnrq]. Hold on, I should verify the bottom line: ketorolac is not a first-line antipyretic; prefer acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever, and if ketorolac is chosen for pain, monitor closely for GI, renal, cardiovascular, and bleeding risks and limit total duration to 5 days [^112zU5UV] [^115eWt4b].

Toradol (ketorolac) **can reduce fever** because it is an NSAID that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and lowers the hypothalamic set point [^114eDf6Y]. In adults with fever, **IV ketorolac 30 mg reduces temperature by about 0.8°C within 60 minutes** compared with 0.4°C with placebo, indicating modest antipyretic activity [^111f2kEH]. However, ketorolac is not approved for fever control and should not be used solely for antipyresis; use acetaminophen or ibuprofen first-line because ketorolac carries higher risks of GI bleeding, renal impairment, and bleeding complications [^117BuoTs] [^1131nySW]. Reserve ketorolac for short-term use in adults with moderate-to-severe pain and concurrent fever when first-line antipyretics are contraindicated or ineffective, and avoid in pregnancy, renal or hepatic impairment, or bleeding risk [^113dEMgV] [^115eWt4b].

---

## Mechanism of antipyretic action

Ketorolac reduces fever by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), thereby decreasing prostaglandin synthesis — especially PGE2 — which resets the hypothalamic thermoregulatory set point and lowers body temperature [^114eDf6Y]. This is the **same mechanism** underlying other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin.

---

## Clinical evidence of antipyretic efficacy

Limited clinical data specifically evaluate ketorolac's antipyretic effects; most focus on analgesia. Nevertheless, available evidence shows modest antipyretic activity:

- **IV ketorolac 30 mg reduced fever by ~0.8°C at 60 minutes** in adults, compared with 0.4°C with placebo (p < 0.05) [^111f2kEH].
- The odds of becoming afebrile at 60 minutes were higher with ketorolac than placebo (OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.3–39.5) [^111f2kEH].
- These effects are modest and slower than standard antipyretics, limiting ketorolac's role for fever control.

---

## Comparison with standard antipyretics

Ketorolac's antipyretic efficacy is **inferior to acetaminophen and ibuprofen**, which are first-line for fever because of greater efficacy, safety, and availability:

| **Attribute** | **Acetaminophen** | **Ibuprofen** | **Ketorolac** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antipyretic efficacy | High | High | Modest |
| Onset of action | Rapid | Rapid | Moderate |
| Safety profile | Excellent | Good | Higher risk |
| Approval for fever | Yes | Yes | No |

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Ketorolac has a **less favorable safety profile** than standard antipyretics, with significant risks that limit its use for fever:

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Increased risk of ulcers and bleeding, especially with prolonged use or in high-risk patients [^112zU5UV].
- **Renal impairment**: Risk of acute renal failure, particularly in patients with preexisting renal disease or dehydration [^116YCJ38].
- **Bleeding risk**: Platelet dysfunction increases bleeding risk, contraindicated in patients with bleeding disorders or those undergoing surgery [^117BuoTs].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Potential for hypertension and cardiovascular events with prolonged use [^114KptMy].
- **Contraindications**: Active GI ulceration, severe renal impairment, bleeding disorders, pregnancy, and hypersensitivity to NSAIDs [^1138qbLt].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend ketorolac for routine fever management. It is indicated for short-term management of moderate-to-severe acute pain, typically not exceeding five days [^113dEMgV]. For fever, **acetaminophen or ibuprofen are preferred** because of their established safety and efficacy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios for ketorolac use in fever

Ketorolac may be considered in **specific scenarios** where:

- **Moderate-to-severe pain**: Concurrent with fever, and standard antipyretics are contraindicated or ineffective.
- **Postoperative pain**: Short-term use in postoperative patients with fever and pain.
- **Alternative antipyretics contraindicated**: Patients cannot tolerate acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Ketorolac has modest antipyretic effects but is **not recommended for routine fever management** because of its inferior efficacy and higher risk profile compared with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. It should be reserved for short-term use in adults with moderate-to-severe pain and concurrent fever when first-line antipyretics are contraindicated or ineffective, with careful monitoring for adverse effects.

### Antipyretic effectiveness of intravenous ketorolac tromethamine [^111f2kEH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We assessed the antipyretic effectiveness of intravenously administered ketorolac tromethamine in the febrile adult. A double-blind placebo controlled trial enrolling a convenience sample of febrile (T > 38.0 degrees C, oral) patients (18–65 years old) randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/kg (max 30 mg) intravenous ketorolac or placebo. Oral temperatures were recorded every 15 min during the 1-h study period. There were 20 patients in each group. At 60 min, the temperature decrease was 0.4 degrees C (95% CI: 0.0 degrees, 0.7 degrees) for the control group and 0.8 degrees C (95% CI: 0.5 degrees, 1.1 degrees) for the ketorolac group. Logistic regression modeling of afebrile at 60 min, controlling for baseline temperature, yielded an odds ratio for ketorolac of 7.1 (95% CI: 1.3, 39.5). In conclusion, our data support that intravenously administered ketorolac has antipyretic properties.

Physicians, when prescribing ketorolac tromethamine, should inform their
patients or their guardians of the potential risks of ketorolac tromethamine
treatment (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE
REACTIONS sections), instruct patients to seek medical advice if they
develop treatment-related adverse events, and advise patients
not to give ketorolac tromethamine tablets to other
family members and to discard any unused drug.

Remember that the total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine
tablet and ketorolac tromethamine IV or IM dosing is not to exceed 5 days in
adults. Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric
patients.

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating
therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.
Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that
accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side
effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even
death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients
should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath,
weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing
any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance
of this follow-up (see WARNINGS:

Cardiovascular Effects).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and
rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result
in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and
bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the
signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical
advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain,
dyspepsia, melena and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance
of this follow-up (see WARNINGS:

Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side
effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in
hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur
without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin
rash and blisters, fever or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and
should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms.
Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type
of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain
or edema to their physicians.
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of
hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper
quadrant tenderness and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be
instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g.,
difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients
should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine should be
avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Ketorolac tromethamine [^115eWt4b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Advise patients to stop taking ketorolac tromethamine immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS).
Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS).
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of ketorolac tromethamine and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with ketorolac tromethamine is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy).

Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.

Drug Interactions

Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%). There is no evidence in animal or human studies that ketorolac tromethamine induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.

MEDICATION GUIDE FOR NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs)

(See the end of this Medication Guide for a
list of prescription NSAID medicines.)

What is the most important information I should know about
medicines called Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

NSAID medicines may increase the chance of a heart attack or
stroke that can lead to death. This chance increases:

with longer use of NSAID medicines
in people who have heart disease

NSAID medicines should never be used right before or after a
heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)".

NSAID medicines can cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach
and intestines at any time during treatment. Ulcers and bleeding:

can happen without warning symptoms
may cause death

The chance of a person getting an ulcer or bleeding
increases with:

taking medicines called "corticosteroids" and "anticoagulants"
longer use
smoking
drinking alcohol
older age
having poor health

NSAID medicines should only be used:

exactly as prescribed
at the lowest dose possible for your treatment
for the shortest time needed

What are Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

NSAID medicines are used to treat pain and redness, swelling, and heat
(inflammation) from medical conditions such as:

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^117BuoTs]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a well known and long history of use. Oral ibuprofen was approved in the United States over 40 years ago and has been a nonprescription drug for more than 30 years. IV ibuprofen (Caldolor ®, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. Nashville, TN, USA) was first approved in 2009 for the management of mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with narcotics, and for the reduction of fever in adults. It is the only IV NSAID approved for the treatment of fever in the United States. Since 2002, the safety and effectiveness of IV ibuprofen has been investigated in ten clinical studies, Phases II–IV, conducted under a corporate investigational new drug application (Table 1).

Two other IV NSAIDs are currently available in the US market, ketorolac tromethamine injection ("ketorolac", Toradol, Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) and diclofenac sodium injection ("diclofenac", Dyloject™, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA). Ketorolac injection was approved in 1989 for the short-term management of moderately severe, acute pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. Ketorolac is contraindicated for use in excess of 5 days, for minor or chronic pain, and for use in pediatric patients. Additional limitations on ketorolac administration include prohibitions against all preoperative use, in patients with active ulcers or who are otherwise at a high risk of bleeding, those with advanced renal impairment, and women who are nursing. Diclofenac sodium injection was approved in December 2014 for the management of mild to moderate pain or moderate to severe pain either alone or in combination with opiates. Diclofenac is only approved for use in adults and is contraindicated in patients with known moderate to severe renal insufficiency who may become volume depleted. Neither of these IV NSAIDs are indicated for the treatment of fever.

### Toradol following breast surgery: is there an increased risk of hematoma? [^114kU2zS]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ketorolac tromethamine (Toradol), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, is used with increased frequency given its success in postoperative pain control and the subsequent decreased need for narcotics. Its use has been limited in plastic surgery for fear of postoperative bleeding and hematoma formation. In this study of breast surgery patients, the authors investigated whether ketorolac increased the risk of postoperative hematoma formation.

Methods

After obtaining institutional review board approval, the authors retrospectively reviewed the records of patients undergoing breast surgery from January of 2012 through December of 2014. The authors compared the incidence of postoperative hematomas in patients who did, versus those who did not, receive ketorolac postoperatively.

Results

For the entire cohort, the overall hematoma rate was 2.8 percent. Of the patients who received ketorolac, the rate was 3.5 percent; of those who did not, the rate was 2.5 percent. Of the breast reduction patients, the rate was 4 percent in those who received ketorolac versus 3.2 percent in those who did not. Of the breast reconstruction patients, the rate was 4 percent in those who received ketorolac versus 3.2 percent in those who did not.

Conclusions

Recently, the high rates of prescribing postoperative narcotics have received increased attention. Aside from the risk of increased availability of narcotics in the community, the side effects can delay patient recovery. Ketorolac is controversial for postoperative pain control because of the potential risk of bleeding, but in the authors' 3-year retrospective study, it was not associated with an increased risk of hematoma formation.

Clinical Question/Level Of Evidence

WARNINGS

(see also Boxed WARNING)

The total combined duration of use of oral ketorolac tromethamine and IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac tromethamine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.

The most serious risks associated with ketorolac tromethamine are:

Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dyspepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy.

The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with ketorolac tromethamine. Do not use ketorolac tromethamine for more than five days.

However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of ulcer disease, other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of ketorolac tromethamine until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.

### Should we treat pyrexia? And how do we do it? [^1164R7Fg]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Around 35% of in-hospital patients will develop pyrexia, increasing up to 70% amongst the critically unwell. Pyrexia has long been thought of as a protective physiological response to help host defences, although this is now being challenged. Despite recent advances, it remains unclear whether pyrexia or the physiological response to pyrexia causes morbidity and mortality and whether management of pyrexia with pharmacological agents or physical cooling actually confers benefit. We review some of the recent evidence for and against treating pyrexia with reference to varying disease severity. Finally, we discuss treatment strategies and methods.

This narrative review of pyrexia and associated treatment options is based on the latest available published evidence. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for articles published in English before 12 Feb 2016. We used the search terms "fever", "pyrexia", "hyperthermia" in combination with "ICU" or "sepsis" or "brain injury" or "cardiac arrest" and with "cooling" or "antipyretics" or "acetaminophen" or "NSAIDS". We largely selected publication from the past 15 years. Further evidence was selected from these articles' reference lists and from our previous knowledge of the subject. Review articles are cited to provide further information on aspects that are not within the remit of this article.

### Death due to anaphylactic shock secondary to intravenous self-injection of toradol: a case report and review of the literature [^113yHd2J]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A fatality due to the intravenous self-injection of Ketorolac (Toradol) is reported. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked analgesic activity. There is limited information of fatalities attributed to ketorolac toxicity. Here we report the case of a 53-year-old woman with a medical history of depression that was found deceased at home with no evidence of trauma or injuries. Near the body, a syringe and three empty vials (30 mg) of Toradol were found. A fresh needle mark on the right arm was noticed. Toxicological analyses were performed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique. The estimated ketorolac concentration in the blood was 8 mug/ml; urine and gastric content were negative for this compound. Based on the autopsy, histologic findings and toxicological results of anaphylactic shock associated with ketorolac self-administration was assumed to be the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of death and the manner, suicide.

### Comparison of intravenous ketorolac at three doses for treating renal colic in the emergency department: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^112YaEN3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is extensively used for the management of renal colic in the emergency department (ED). It has been proposed that ketorolac is used at doses above its analgesic ceiling with no more advantages and increased risk of adverse effects. In this study, we compared the analgesic effects of three doses of intravenous ketorolac in patients with renal colic.

Methods

This noninferiority, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluated the analgesic efficacy of three doses of intravenous ketorolac (10, 20, and 30 mg) in adult patients presenting to the ED with renal colic. Exclusion criteria consisted of age > 65 years, active peptic ulcer disease, acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal or hepatic insufficiency, NSAID hypersensitivity, pregnancy or breastfeeding, unstable vital signs, and patients who had received analgesics in the past 24 hours. Pain was recorded every 15 minutes from baseline up to 60 minutes, and the primary outcome was pain reduction at 30 minutes. If patients still required additional pain medications at 30 minutes, they would receive 0.1 mg/kg intravenous morphine sulfate as a rescue analgesic.

Results

A total of 165 subjects enrolled in this study, 55 in each group. The median visual analog scale score in 30 minutes was improved from 90 at baseline to 40 among subjects who were randomized to 30-mg group. This improvement was 40 and 50 mm in 20- and 10-mg ketorolac treatment arms, respectively, with no significant difference between the three doses (p < 0.05). Secondary outcomes showed similar rescue analgesic administration and adverse effects. There was no serious adverse event.

Conclusion

Ketorolac at 10-, 20-, and 30-mg doses can produce similar analgesic efficacy in renal colic.

Fever

The most prescribed medicines for fever were paracetamol (n = 267 of 272 (98.2%) services), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (n = 46 of 272 (16.9%) services) and metamizole (n = 15 of 272 (5.5%) services) (table 1). NSAIDs prescribed were ibuprofen, representing 11 of 48 (22.9%) prescribed NSAIDs, diclofenac (n = 7 (14.6%)) and ketorolac (n = 1 (2.1%)). In 29 (60.4%) cases, the type of NSAID prescribed was not stated (online supplemental appendix 5a).

Prescribing for fever tended to be similar across world regions except for metamizole. Metamizole was not prescribed in the UK, while 32% and 3.4% of services in the rest of Europe and the world respectively prescribed it (online supplemental appendix 5b). Prescribing for fever was similar across settings (online supplemental appendix 5c).

Thirty-seven services indicated how quickly medicines worked; 17 (45.9%) responded that they worked within 30 min and 19 (51.4%) within over 31 min. One (2.7%) service said this varied.

Out of f 201, 188 (93.5%) respondents on the effectiveness of these medicines considered them to be effective or to have some effect, while the remaining reported limited effect (10, 5%), no effect (1, 0.5%) or unclear effect (2, 1%) (online supplemental appendix 5d). There was an indication of variation in recommendations across countries regarding what to prescribe for fever.

[paracetamol] quite effective but NSAIDS might have been more effective - in the French COVID context, they were not recommended because allegedly causing more severe cases (inpatient palliative care unit/hospital palliative care team, rest of Europe).

Services also described limited effect.

### Ketorolac and hematoma incidence in postmastectomy implant-based breast reconstruction [^113ZnDcs]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ketorolac tromethamine (Toradol) is an effective a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a powerful analgesic for patients undergoing breast surgery. However, the potential for postoperative bleeding has not yet been explored specifically in women undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction. There is concern that an increased risk of bleeding exists in this population due to the lack of tissue apposition as a result of implant placement. We therefore seek to assess the associated risk of bleeding complication in implant-based breast reconstruction at our academic institution. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first case series addressing safety profile of Toradol specifically in patients undergoing nonautologous, implant-based breast reconstruction.

Methods/Results

A single-center, retrospective review was performed analyzing our institutional experience with Toradol in nonautologous, implant-based breast reconstruction following mastectomy. A prospective database of 522 patients collected between 2008 and 2013 was analyzed. Within the database, 57 patients who received intraoperative ketorolac were identified among a total of 180 patients undergoing prosthetic reconstruction. No statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of clinically relevant hematoma formation between the control and Toradol groups. The frequency of hematoma formation in the control was 0.09 (11/123 patients, 95% confidence interval = 0.05–0.15) and 0.04 in the Toradol group (2/57 patients, 95% confidence interval = 0.01–0.12), resulting in a P value of 0.32. Regarding the secondary outcomes, we did not detect a statistically significant difference in the total number of complications or length of hospital stay in the Toradol and control groups.

Conclusions

Review of our breast reconstruction database did not find a trend toward an elevated incidence of hematoma associated with intraoperative Toradol use in implant-based postmastectomy reconstruction.

### Intravenous acetaminophen is superior to ketamine for postoperative pain after abdominal hysterectomy: results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial [^111QL3Lz]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hysterectomy is the second-most-common gynecological surgery in the United States after cesarean section. Nearly 40% of American women undergo hysterectomy before the age of 60 years. Of the various surgical approaches to hysterectomy (abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, or open), the open abdominal approach has been correlated with relatively greater postoperative pain.

Because these surgeries are painful, optimal perioperative pain management is of utmost importance and contributes to greater patient satisfaction, fewer adverse events, shorter hospital stays, and reduction in health care costs. Pain management can take many forms. Although systemic opioid analgesics and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) remain at the forefront of pain management, this class of medications is associated with multiple common adverse reactions (pruritus, nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory complications, urinary retention, and altered mentation). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ketamine, acetaminophen, and local anesthetics have all been reported to reduce postoperative opioid consumption.–

Although oral and rectal forms of acetaminophen have been in use for decades, intravenous (IV) acetaminophen has only recently become available. Despite its recent introduction, it has become a routine analgesic in operating rooms and inpatient wards. Its analgesic action has not been fully elucidated, but evidence suggests that it is mediated by both cannabinoid and serotonergic pathways in the central nervous system and, to a lesser degree, though peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. It also lowers fever by acting directly on the thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus.–Intravenous acetaminophen has been shown to have significant opioid-sparing effects for a multitude of surgical procedures, including abdominal hysterectomies. Clinical studies have suggested that 1 g IV acetaminophen is as effective as 30 mg IV ketorolac (NSAID) or 10 mg intramuscular morphine, but no study has compared the analgesic efficacy of IV acetaminophen with the efficacy of IV ketamine.

Ketamine is an anesthetic agent used for anesthesia, sedation, and analgesia. As an N-methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine reduces the sensitivity of the central nervous system to painful stimuli. In this study, we hypothesized that IV acetaminophen would be more effective than IV ketamine as an analgesic and would have significantly lower sedation scores and fewer adverse effects.

### The effect of ketorolac on postoperative febrile episodes in patients after abdominal myomectomy [^112hn9Nu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine whether administering the anti-inflammatory agent ketorolac after abdominal myomectomy reduces the incidence of febrile episodes.

Study Design

This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical investigation compared administering ketorolac 15 mg intravenously every 6 hours beginning in the recovery room with saline solution administered in the same regimen in 122 patients undergoing abdominal myomectomy in a large, urban academic medical center. The primary outcome was fever > 101.0 degrees F in the postoperative period. Results were analyzed by chi(2) analysis, independent samples t test, and logistic regression.

Results

Data were analyzed on 112 patients, with 56 in the treatment group and 56 in the placebo group. After confounding factors were controlled with logistic regression, the data revealed a statistically significant reduction in febrile episodes in the ketorolac-treated group (27%) compared with the saline solution-treated group (41%) (P = .04).

Conclusion

Treatment with ketorolac after abdominal myomectomy results in a statistically significant reduction in the rate of febrile episodes.

Conclusion

Pretreatment with intravenous ketorolac tromethamine 0.5 mg/kg can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of sufentanil-induced cough during induction of general anesthesia, which can also significantly and safely reduce postoperative incision pain and restlessness in the recovery period. To a certain extent, it provided a comfortable medical experience and humane care, which is worth popularizing.

### Equal antipyretic effectiveness of oral and rectal acetaminophen: a randomized controlled trial [^112XKFmq]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Primary outcome

Intent-to-treat analysis of the time to maximum antipyresis, the primary outcome measure of the study, revealed no significant differences among the three groups (P = 0.5). The overall mean (95% CI) was 3.3 (2.4–4.2) hours for the rectal low-dose group, 3.6 (2.8–4.3) hours for the oral group, and 3.9 (3.3–4.6) hours for the rectal high-dose group [Table 1]. Repeat analysis excluding the three patients with long duration of fever, and the only patient who received a low-dose rectal acetaminophen instead of his allocated high-rectal dose, revealed similar results to the intent-to-treat analysis. Therefore, analyses of both primary and secondary outcomes were kept as intent-to-treat.

Ketorolac tromethamine alleviates incision hypersensitivity and inflammatory response in neonatal injured rats

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketorolac tromethamine has been widely used to treat moderately severe pain and inflammation after surgery. We applied ketorolac tromethamine to the nIN-IN group every 6 h for 48 h, starting immediately after a repeat hindpaw incision. The enhanced mechanical hypersensitivity in this group was significantly reduced by ketorolac injection compared to saline injection from POD1 to 5 (nIN-ktIN versus nIN-sIN, Fig. 5 A) Ketorolac intramuscular injection also reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the injured tissue, as indicated by H&E staining (Fig. 5 B) and the expression of CD11b in the injured tissue (Fig. 5 C-D). The expressions of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα were inhibited by ketorolac tromethamine. (Fig. 5 E).

### Novel depots of ketorolac esters have long-acting antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects [^116wBJxv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

No long-acting nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug is clinically available for the treatment of pain. In this study, we evaluated the antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects and duration of action of several novel depots of ketorolac esters, such as ketorolac propyl ester, pentyl ester, heptyl ester, and decyl ester, and observed whether they had a long-acting effect. Four studies in Sprague-Dawley rats were performed. In Studies 1–3, the antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects of IM ketorolac tromethamine and its base and propyl ester were evaluated. In Study 4, the antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects of several other ketorolac esters were evaluated. We found that ketorolac tromethamine 24, 80, and 240 micromol/kg (in saline) produced significant antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects with duration of action of approximately 6–8 h. The four ketorolac esters at a dose of 240 micromol/kg (in oil) produced significant long-acting antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects, with duration of action of approximately 52–76 h. We concluded that IM injection of novel depots of ketorolac esters in rats produce long-acting antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects that are 6.5- to 9.5-fold longer than the traditional dosage form of ketorolac tromethamine.

### Ketorolac tromethamine pretreatment suppresses sufentanil-induced cough during general anesthesia induction: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^113AkwJV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the possible adverse reactions and safety of ketorolac tromethamine injection pretreatment, we compared the mean arterial pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen saturation values of the two groups of patients at different time points. The results suggest that pretreatment with ketorolac tromethamine injection does not have adverse effects on the vital signs of patients. Additionally, the results showed that the incidence of nausea, delayed recovery, dizziness, drowsiness and respiratory depression was not significantly increased when ketorolac tromethamine was used in advance, making it safe for patients. However, it is undeniable that one of the main risks of NSAIDs, such as ketorolac tromethamine, is that they may affect bleeding during and after the operation by inhibiting platelet function. However, the dosage of drugs used in this study was not large and was within the scope of reasonable use in the instructions. In addition, this study has limited the research subjects; for example, patients who had a history of peptic ulcer or bleeding, liver or kidney disease, or blood system diseases before operation were excluded. Under these premises, ketorolac tromethamine will not have a significant impact on the operation or postoperative bleeding.

There are also some deficiencies in our research. First, due to the limitation of objective conditions, we have not studied the mechanism of ketorolac tromethamine in inhibition of the cough response and cannot give more reasonable inferences about the relevant mechanisms. We describe the relevant effects objectively because there is no relevant report about ketorolac tromethamine injection or other nonsteroidal drugs inhibiting sufentanil-induced cough. Second, the pretreatment dose of ketorolac tromethamine that was used (0.5 mg/kg) may not be the most appropriate dose for ketorolac tromethamine to inhibit the sufentanil-induced cough response, but it was given according to the early postoperative analgesic dose recommended in the drug instructions. Third, our study was a single center study with a small sample size. To determine whether pretreatment with ketorolac tromethamine injection can reduce the sufentanil-induced cough response, we still need a large sample and multicenter study.

### When the child has a fever [^115EgPux]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Fever in a child is usually due to a self-limiting viral infection, with recovery occurring quickly without intervention. However, fever may also be the presenting feature of severe illnesses such as meningitis, septicaemia, urinary tract infections and pneumonia, and trying to exclude such causes is a key part of management. In a review 17 years ago, we concluded that there was no evidence that reducing fever improved the outcome of childhood infections, but that it probably alleviated distress and discomfort caused by fever. We also advised that parents should give paracetamol only if the child seemed uncomfortable or had previously had a febrile convulsion, and said that tepid sponging may further comfort the child, while recognising evidence that it added little to the effect of paracetamol alone. Does this advice still hold?

### Ketorolac in the era of cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a systematic review of efficacy, side effects, and regulatory issues [^116Hyzod]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The recent introduction of oral COX-2 selective NSAIDs with potential for perioperative use, and the ongoing development of intravenous formulations, stimulated a systemic review of efficacy, side effects, and regulatory issues related to ketorolac for management of postoperative analgesia.

Design

To examine the opioid dose sparing effect of ketorolac, we compiled published, randomized controlled trials of ketorolac versus placebo, with opioids given for breakthrough pain, published in English-language journals from 1986–2001. Odds ratios were computed to assess whether the use of ketorolac reduced the incidence of opioid side effects or improved the quality of analgesia.

Results

Depending on the type of surgery, ketorolac reduced opioid dose by a mean of 36% (range 0% to 73%). Seventy percent of patients in control groups experienced moderate-severe pain 1 hour postoperatively, while 36% of the control patients had moderate to severe pain 24 hours postoperatively. Analgesia was improved in patients receiving ketorolac in combination with opioids. However, we did not find a concomitant reduction in opioid side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting). This may be due to studies having inadequate (to small) sample sizes to detect differences in the incidence of opioid related side effects. The risk for adverse events with ketorolac increases with high doses, with prolonged therapy (> 5 days), or invulnerable patients (e.g. the elderly). The incidence of serious adverse events has declined since dosage guidelines were revised.

Conclusions

Ketorolac should be administered at the lowest dose necessary. Analgesics that provide effective analgesia with minimal adverse effects are needed.

### Evidence-based guidelines for prehospital pain management: recommendations [^11537gcF]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Intravenous NSAIDs versus IV opioids — We suggest either IV NSAIDs or IV opioids for the initial management of moderate to severe pain in the prehospital setting. (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding pain severity at 15 minutes, partial, or full relief of pain, or time to analgesic effect, and the evidence did not demonstrate any clinically significant difference in pain severity at 30 or 60 minutes. The panel expressed concern that there was evidence of significant sub-therapeutic dosing of the NSAID, ketorolac, in the limited data available, and noted a small difference in cost with the intervention (NSAIDs, specifically ketorolac) being more costly than opioids; at least one study suggested that adverse events were more common with morphine, including drowsiness/sleeping and nausea/vomiting. Intravenous NSAIDs, including ketorolac, may be attractive as a first line analgesic in patients who are intolerant or allergic to opioids or who prefer a lower risk of side effects, and the panel noted that ketorolac is already in use in many EMS systems.

### Should we treat pyrexia? And how do we do it? [^115qmzyV]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Should we treat pyrexia?

The cost of pyrexia

The cost of pyrexia should be considered in several ways. Pyrexia has a metabolic cost such that cooling febrile ICU patients will reduce oxygen consumption by 10% per °C. Small studies in sedated patients demonstrated a significant reduction in VO 2 (the rate of oxygen consumption) and VCO 2 (the rate of carbon dioxide elimination) during cooling. In septic shock, temperature lowering by ibuprofen was associated with increased lactate clearance. In patients with acute brain injury, pyrexia may increase intracranial pressure and worsen secondary ischemic damage. These suggest the possibility of therapeutically offloading the cardiorespiratory system and preserving brain function at times of stress. Whether the cost of pyrexia translates to unfavourable outcomes remains unknown. The incidence of pyrexia is decreasing over time with an absolute reduction of 35% found in Canadian ICUs. This did not coincide with an appreciable decrease in mortality, suggesting that important outcomes may not be affected by the incidence of pyrexia.

Perhaps the question should not be "should we treat pyrexia?" but "in what conditions is it beneficial to treat pyrexia?" (Fig 2). This is highlighted in a large observational study where fever within the first 24 h of ICU admission was significantly associated with decreased mortality in patients with infection while peak fever ≥ 40 °C was associated with increased mortality in patients without infection. An observational study on 1400 non-neurological critically ill patients also revealed different associations between the maximal peak temperature and mortality according to the presence of sepsis or not. Fever ≥ 39.5 °C was associated with increased mortality in non-septic patients while moderate fever (37.5–38.4 °C) was associated with decrease mortality in septic patients. Moreover, this study highlights different impacts of fever treatment. Physical cooling did not alter the mortality risk and the use of antipyretic agents did not alter mortality in the non-septic group but did increase 28-day mortality in the septic group (adjusted odds ratio 2.61 (P = 0.028) for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 2.05 (P = 0.01) for paracetamol.

### Antipyretics: mechanisms of action and clinical use in fever suppression [^114eDf6Y]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Fever is a complex physiologic response triggered by infectious or aseptic stimuli. Elevations in body temperature occur when concentrations of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) increase within certain areas of the brain. These elevations alter the firing rate of neurons that control thermoregulation in the hypothalamus. Although fever benefits the nonspecific immune response to invading microorganisms, it is also viewed as a source of discomfort and is commonly suppressed with antipyretic medication. Antipyretics such as aspirin have been widely used since the late 19th century, but the mechanisms by which they relieve fever have only been characterized in the last few decades. It is now clear that most antipyretics work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase and reducing the levels of PGE(2) within the hypothalamus. Recently, other mechanisms of action for antipyretic drugs have been suggested, including their ability to reduce proinflammatory mediators, enhance anti-inflammatory signals at sites of injury, or boost antipyretic messages within the brain. Although the complex biologic actions of antipyretic agents are better understood, the indications for their clinical use are less clear. They may not be indicated for all febrile conditions because some paradoxically contribute to patient discomfort, interfere with accurately assessing patients receiving antimicrobials, or predispose patients to adverse effects from other medications. The development of more selective fever-relieving agents and their prudent use with attention to possible untoward consequences are important to the future quality of clinical medicine.

### A randomized, controlled trial to compare ketorolac tromethamine versus placebo after cesarean section to reduce pain and narcotic usage [^115fiLG7]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether postcesarean section administration of ketorolac tromethamine reduces pain and narcotic usage.

Study Design

A double-blinded randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ketorolac tromethamine was performed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ketorolac tromethamine or placebo. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was used for pain control. Visual analog scales (VAS) were administered postoperatively to assess pain levels. Morphine equivalents and attempts were recorded.

Results

There were 22 patients in each arm of the study. There was no significant difference between patient demographics, blood loss, and type of anesthesia. Pain scores were significantly different at 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (P = .033). There was a significant decrease in pain medication usage (P = .008) in the study group.

Conclusion

Ketorolac tromethamine is efficacious in reducing postoperative pain and narcotics usage after cesarean section.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^112v6J3a]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Antipyretic medications for critically ill ICU patients with fever — For critically ill patients with fever who value comfort by reducing temperature, we suggest using antipyretic medications over nonpharmacologic methods to reduce body temperature (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 RCTs including 1,963 non-neurocritically ill patients were examined; fever management reduced body temperature (8 RCTs, n = 1,139, MD −0.41; 95% CI [−0.66 to −0.16]; p < 0.001; I2 = 94%, low quality), but did not improve 28-day mortality (11 RCTs, n = 1,745 patients, RR 1.03; 95% CI [0.79–1.35]; p = 0.82; I2 = 45%, low quality), hospital mortality (3 RCT, n = 877, RR 0.97; 95% CI [0.73–1.30]; p = 0.85; I2 = 0%, moderate quality) or shock reversal (2 RCTs, n = 229, RR 1.11; 95% CI [0.76–1.62]; p = 0.59; I2 = 19%, very low quality). The panel issued a weak recommendation against the routine use of antipyretics in febrile ICU patients; however, in selected cases where patients or family members value reducing temperature for symptomatic relief, the panel issued a weak recommendation favoring the use of antipyretic medications to treat fever. In certain patient populations, (neurologically injured or post cardiac arrest) the theoretical benefit of antipyretic therapy may outweigh the risk, but there is little evidence to support a recommendation for routine use of antipyretic medications in these populations.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115rDGgN]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling — Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses — for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

### Ketorolac for postoperative pain in children [^116qbZyz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children who undergo surgical procedures in ambulatory and inpatient settings are at risk of experiencing acute pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce moderate to severe pain without many of the side effects associated with opioids. However, NSAIDs may cause bleeding, renal and gastrointestinal toxicity, and potentially delay wound and bone healing. Intravenous administration of ketorolac for postoperative pain in children has not been approved in many countries, but is routinely administered in clinical practise.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of ketorolac for postoperative pain in children.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases, without language restrictions, to November 2017: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 10); MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of reviews, and retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared the analgesic efficacy of ketorolac (in any dose, administered via any route) with placebo or another active treatment, in treating postoperative pain in participants zero to 18 years of age following any type of surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We analyzed trials in two groups; ketorolac versus placebo, and ketorolac versus opioid. However, we performed limited pooled analyses. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE, and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 13 studies, involving 920 randomised participants. There was considerable heterogeneity among study designs, including the comparator arms (placebo, opioid, another NSAID, or a different regimen of ketorolac), dosing regimens (routes and timing of administration, single versus multiple dose), outcome assessment methods, and types of surgery. Mean study population ages ranged from 356 days to 13.9 years. The majority of studies chose a dose of either 0.5 mg/kg (as a single or multiple dose regimen) or 1 mg/kg (single dose with 0.5 mg/kg for any subsequent doses). One study administered interventions intraoperatively; the remainder administered interventions postoperatively, often after the participant reported moderate to severe pain. There were insufficient data to perform meta-analysis for either of our primary outcomes: participants with at least 50% pain relief; or mean postoperative pain intensity. Four studies individually reported statistically significant reductions in pain intensity when comparing ketorolac with placebo, but the studies were small and had various risks of bias, primarily due to incomplete outcome data and small sample sizes. We found limited data available for the secondary outcomes of participants requiring rescue medication and opioid consumption. For the former, we saw no clear difference between ketorolac and placebo; 74 of 135 (55%) participants receiving ketorolac required rescue analgesia in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) versus 81 of 127 (64%) receiving placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.00, P = 0.05; 4 studies, 262 participants). For opioid consumption in the PACU, we saw no clear difference between ketorolac and placebo (P = 0.61). For the time period zero to four hours after administration of the interventions, participants receiving ketorolac received 1.58 mg less intravenous morphine equivalents than those receiving placebo (95% CI -2.58 mg to -0.57 mg, P = 0.002; 2 studies, 129 participants). However, we are uncertain whether ketorolac has an important effect on opioid consumption, as the data were sparse and the results were inconsistent. Only one study reported data for opioid consumption when comparing ketorolac with an opioid. There were no clear differences between the ketorolac and opioid group at any time point. There were no data assessing this outcome for the comparison of ketorolac with another NSAID. There were insufficient data to allow us to analyze overall adverse event or serious adverse event rates. Although the majority of serious adverse events reported in those receiving ketorolac involved bleeding, the number of events was too low to conclude that bleeding risk was increased in those receiving ketorolac perioperatively. There was not a statistically significant increase in event rates for any specific adverse event, either in pooled analysis or in single studies, when comparing ketorolac and placebo. When comparing ketorolac with opioids or other NSAIDs, there were too few data to make any conclusions regarding event rates. Lastly, withdrawals due to adverse events were vary rare in all groups, reflecting the acute nature of such studies. We assessed the quality of evidence for all outcomes for each comparison (placebo or active) as very low, due to issues with risk of bias in individual studies, imprecision, heterogeneity between studies, and low overall numbers of participants and events.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the lack of data for our primary outcomes, and the very low-quality evidence for secondary outcomes, the efficacy and safety of ketorolac in treating postoperative pain in children were both uncertain. The evidence was insufficient to support or reject its use.

### Ketorolac tromethamine pretreatment suppresses sufentanil-induced cough during general anesthesia induction: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^115kwFtf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Five minutes before anesthesia induction, intravenous ketorolac tromethamine 0.5 mg/kg pretreatment can significantly reduce the incidence of coughing reactions during the induction period in general anesthesia patients and can significantly reduce restlessness in the recovery period of patients, which increases safety.

Many studies have been performed on the mechanism of the sufentanil-induced cough response, but the relevant mechanism is still not very clear. It may be related to sufentanil activating the C-fiber receptor of the bronchus, adapting the pulmonary stretch receptors (RARs), inducing airway hyperresponsiveness, inhibiting the efferent impulse of the sympathetic nerve, increasing the comparative advantage of the vagus nerve, and finally leading to the occurrence of the cough response. At present, there are few reports about ketorolac tromethamine reducing the sufentanil-induced cough response. It has been reported that intravenous injection of dezocine before anesthesia induction can inhibit the cough response induced by sufentanil or fentanyl to some extent by activating the K receptor and inhibiting histamine release. Considering that ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, the mechanism of a ketorolac tromethamine injection reducing the cough response may be related to the reduction of histamine release and other reasons.

Ketorolac tromethamine is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Motov S et al. found that intravenous infusion of 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine can significantly improve moderate to severe pain in emergency patients. Studies by Yang HL et al. suggested that injection of ketorolac tromethamine before tracheal intubation can reduce the incidence of sore throat caused by endotracheal intubation from 71.6 to 21.1%. Compared with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine has a weaker anti-inflammatory effect and stronger analgesic effect and has been widely used in the clinic. In this study, ketorolac tromethamine significantly reduced the number of patients with VAS scores greater than 3. Pretreatment with a ketorolac tromethamine injection also played a role in the recovery period of anesthesia, significantly reducing the postoperative incision pain of patients, and the incidence of restlessness caused by pain and other adverse stimulation naturally decreased significantly. To a certain extent, it provided patients with a comfortable medical experience and humane care.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^1179UPxn]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Social media is a major influence in healthcare today, including the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19. There is a reasonable possibility of patients' opinions being affected by information that is not scientifically founded. At every opportunity, the importance of basing treatment decisions on consultation with healthcare professionals rather than unfounded information on social media should be emphasized.

Since the start of the pandemic, major health authorities across the world have published updated guidelines on clinical management of COVID-19 in an effort to combat misinformation. They consistently support the use of NSAIDs for treatment of COVID-19 symptoms, on the basis that there is no evidence of these drugs contributing to worsened outcomes. The WHO published its latest guidance in January 2021. This document recommends that patients with mild COVID-19 "be given symptomatic treatment such as antipyretics for fever and pain, adequate nutrition and appropriate rehydration", and states "at present, there is no evidence to indicate that there are severe adverse events in patients with COVID-19 as a result of NSAIDs". On its website, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides information specifically on COVID-19. In the section for healthcare professionals, the question "Do NSAIDs worsen the course of disease for people with COVID-19?" is addressed. In June 2021, the text stated "CDC is currently not aware of any evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs and worsening of COVID-19" and that they were continuing to monitor the situation. On March 19, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wrote they were "not aware of any scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs with worsening of COVID-19 symptoms". They also reminded readers of the following warning: "the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections".

### Should we treat pyrexia? And how do we do it? [^115BLMp7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Thermal tolerance of cooling

Any decrease in core and/or peripheral temperature will result in vasoconstriction followed by shivering. In normal and febrile conditions, shivering commences at a body core temperature of ≈1.5 °C under the hypothalamic set point. Skin temperature accounts for around 20% of thermoregulation and cold stress can promote shivering while the core temperature remains constant. Some studies report less shivering with endovascular cooling but the results are inconsistent.

Cooling patients with an elevated temperature set point will promote the shivering reflex to produce heat and counter core temperature lowering. Shivering not only impedes thermal control but its metabolic cost is substantial. Cooling awake septic patients increases VO 2 by up to 60%. Shivering also promotes the cardiovascular and respiratory stress response and increases cerebral metabolic stress. Avoidance of shivering is, therefore, a crucial component of the cooling procedure. The administration of an antipyretic agent to reduce the temperature set point before commencement of cooling is a common practice but appears to be ineffective.

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of shivering has been proposed. Given the indication for cooling, many of these disease processes occur in patients who are already receiving some form of sedation. Slight anaesthesia decreases the shivering threshold and represents the most efficient way to prevent it and achieve the goal of VO 2 and cardiovascular stress reduction. In awake patients, the benefit of pyrexia treatment using cooling should be clearly evaluated against the risk of metabolic and cerebral stress induced by shivering, especially given that shivering can occur without any clinical manifestation and may only be detected by VO 2 monitoring.

Pharmacological versus non-pharmacological methods

A meta-analysis of 11 trials considered pharmacological versus non-pharmacological antipyretic treatments with outcome measures being targeted temperature and haemodynamic effects. It found that intravascular as opposed to surface cooling had better target temperature results, although there was a non-significant trend towards higher mortality. Only three small studies consisted of a head-to-head comparison of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic methods, for which the analysis was inconclusive.

In sepsis, the three largest RCTs compared ibuprofen, paracetamol and surface cooling against placebo or no treatment. The maximal between-group differences in temperatures reported were 0.6 °C on day 1, 0.9 °C at 10 h and 1.6 °C at 12 h, respectively. Although inconclusive, these data may suggest that controlling fever by surface cooling is more efficient than by antipyretic agents.

### A review of the use of ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% in the treatment of post-surgical inflammation following cataract and refractive surgery [^116n3edz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% ophthalmic solution, a recent reformulation containing 20% less active ingredient that the original formulation, is indicated for the reduction of ocular pain and burning/stinging following corneal refractive surgery. Clinical studies have shown ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% to be as effective as ketorolac tromethamine 0.5% to control inflammation after cataract surgery including prevention of cystoid macular edema (CME). Its efficacy to inhibit miosis during cataract surgery as well as its role in the treatment of dry eye has been reported. The purpose of this paper is to review the use of ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% in the treatment of post-surgical inflammation following cataract and refractive surgery.

### Should we treat pyrexia? And how do we do it? [^115VXRga]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis

For many years pyrexia has been considered a physiological host defence which may confer benefit. The development of antipyretics was justified in terms of patient comfort and the physiological reduction of cardiorespiratory stress. During sepsis, fever is not consistently reported as deleterious and may be protective. The opposite impacts of pyrexia on inflammation and microbiological control may explain discrepant results. Pyrexia enhances inflammation but decrease bacterial and viral load. This dual effect has been highlighted in animals with pneumonia, showing that pyrexia treatment is beneficial for survival only when antibiotics allow effective control of bacterial load.

Whilst the advantages of cooling in sepsis remain a controversial topic, there is now good evidence that cooling is safe and effective in septic shock. One study allocated 200 sedated and ventilated patients with severe sepsis on vasopressors to external cooling or none. The findings demonstrated a significant decrease in vasopressor requirement and in 14-day mortality (19 versus 34%; absolute difference −16%; 95% confidence interval (CI) −28 to −4) with cooling. The mortality outcome was similar. In a post hoc analysis, it was confirmed that temperature control was a main mediator of early mortality. The benefits of cooling could be explained by specific patients' profiles and the cooling strategy used. Patients with severe sepsis benefit the most from the prevention of pyrexia. In this trial the main source of infection was pneumonia with a large majority of patients under adequate antimicrobial therapy at the time of cooling initiation. None were exposed to hypothermia and only two experienced shivering, all being sedated.

The "HEAT" study compared pyrexia control by intravenous paracetamol with placebo in 691 randomized ICU patients with suspected infection and temperature > 38 °C. Only 20% of patients experienced septic shock. Paracetamol was well tolerated. The outcomes for ICU free days and 28-day and 90-day mortalities were similar between the groups.

These two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in sepsis show that fever control is safe. Interestingly, both noted that patients who received pyrexia treatment had a longer time to death. The avoidance of pyrexia costs at the early stage of severe infection may be balanced by delayed adverse effects. Of these, an acquired hypo-immune state may lead to increased late mortality.

### Equal antipyretic effectiveness of oral and rectal acetaminophen: a randomized controlled trial [^113onau6]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, oral and rectal acetaminophen preparations seem to have equal antipyretic effectiveness which is in line with earlier studies. There is no evidence to support the belief that rectal suppositories, whether prescribed in the standard dose of 15 mg/kg, or in the high dose of 30–40 mg/kg, are superior to oral acetaminophen in terms of rapidity of action, or in the extent of temperature reduction. Though the oral route may be preferred because of its predictable rapid absorption, the rectal route seems to be a good and equally effective alternative in special circumstances like vomiting, or conditions preventing oral administration. High-dose rectal acetaminophen should be used with caution, since it may result in hypothermia, a finding that deserves further exploration in the future. Physicians should educate parents about fever being a benign symptom of illness, rather than a disease in itself. While it is desirable to treat fever in children, parents need to be aware that fever per se is not a usual cause of mortality in a child, while acetaminophen overdose can be.

Primary Outcomes

Moderate-quality evidence from randomized studies showed that compared with acetaminophen, ibuprofen was associated with reduced temperature within 4 hours (4 studies, with 435 participants; SMD, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.67; p = 0.01; I² = 49%) (Table and Figure 2). Very low-quality evidence from nonrandomized studies showed that ibuprofen and acetaminophen had similar antipyretic profiles within 4 hours (2 studies, with 123 participants; SMD, −0.04; 95% CI, −0.40 to 0.31; p = 0.81; I² = 0%) (Table; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). None of the included studies reported pain outcomes within 4 hours from treatment onset. Subgroup analyses for fever reduction within 4 hours comparing lower and higher dosages of ibuprofen and acetaminophen did not alter the results (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Data were not available for the remainder of the planned subgroup analyses. In sensitivity analysis, exclusion of 2 studies at high risk of bias, did not alter the results.
