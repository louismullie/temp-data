## Question

What is the treatment for outpatient community acquired pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for outpatient community-acquired pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and risk stratification to ensure the patient truly belongs in the outpatient pathway. Then, I should verify comorbidity status because this drives empiric therapy. Next, I will select first-line antibiotics for patients without comorbidities, followed by broader regimens for those with comorbidities. After that, I need to check duration, follow-up, and when to obtain imaging or labs. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like influenza coinfection, macrolide resistance thresholds, and pediatric nuances, and I will close with a concise, practical summary anchored to guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and risk stratification, because I need to ensure we are treating true CAP and not a viral bronchitis or another process. In ambulatory adults with suspected CAP, chest radiography or lung ultrasound supports the diagnosis when imaging is obtainable, whereas in settings where imaging cannot be obtained, empiric antibiotics may still be considered if pneumonia is suspected based on clinical features, while routine antibiotics should be avoided when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia and vitals and lung exam are normal [^aa7f8968] [^56290367] [^f756189b]. I should double-check severity next; validated tools like PSI or CURB-65 help decide site of care, with PSI preferred for prognostic discrimination and evidence that its use safely increases outpatient care without worsening outcomes, though clinical judgment remains essential [^4359e1f8] [^71009d0e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics before I classify comorbidity status, since this determines empiric breadth. Patients without comorbidities or recent antibiotic exposure are managed differently from those with chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy, or asplenia, who warrant broader-spectrum therapy due to higher risk of resistant pathogens and atypicals [^f68083c3] [^d3e0a451]. I should confirm that recent antibiotic use within 90 days also shifts therapy toward a different class to mitigate resistance risk, which is explicitly recommended in the guideline [^dcd15bca].

> For adults without comorbidities, I will now examine first-line options. The ATS/IDSA guideline recommends high-dose amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily as a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence, or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily as a conditional option with low-quality evidence, with macrolide monotherapy reserved only where local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is documented to be less than 25% [^d3e0a451] [^688d8fef] [^ac063e83]. Wait, let me verify the resistance threshold; yes, the 25% cutoff is the key determinant for macrolide use, and in many U.S. regions resistance exceeds this, so macrolide monotherapy should generally be avoided unless local data show resistance below 25% or alternatives are contraindicated [^d3e0a451] [^5a3f6afb].

> For adults with comorbidities, I need to ensure broader coverage. Recommended regimens include combination therapy with a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or a cephalosporin like cefpodoxime or cefuroxime plus a macrolide, or alternatively a beta-lactam plus doxycycline, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, chosen based on patient-specific risks and local epidemiology [^f68083c3] [^dcd15bca]. Hold on, I should verify that the guideline does not preferentially rank among these options; indeed, it presents multiple acceptable choices and emphasizes tailoring to allergies, prior antibiotic exposure, and comorbidities, including caution with fluoroquinolones in patients with vascular disease or QT risk [^dcd15bca].

> Next, I should review duration and follow-up, because overtreatment is common and harmful. The ATS/IDSA guideline recommends a minimum of 5 days for most patients, provided they achieve clinical stability within 48 to 72 hours, which aligns with evidence that 5 days is sufficient for many adults with CAP; I initially thought 7 to 10 days might be standard, but wait, that longer interval reflects older practice and is not the current recommendation for uncomplicated cases [^760f62a6]. I need to ensure we do not over-order tests; routine sputum cultures and blood cultures are not recommended in the outpatient setting, and follow-up chest radiography is not routinely required, though a repeat film can be considered if the patient fails to improve as expected or if malignancy is a concern [^b7ec5544] [^daeb8b71] [^88dd7966].

> I will now examine special scenarios, starting with influenza coinfection. If the patient has clinical and radiographic CAP and tests positive for influenza, I should confirm that standard antibacterial therapy is still recommended initially because bacterial coinfection is common, while also considering antiviral therapy for influenza; importantly, if no bacterial pathogen is identified, procalcitonin is low, and the patient is clinically stable by 48 to 72 hours, early discontinuation of antibiotics can be considered, though this is a conditional suggestion pending stronger evidence [^70ecc6b6] [^b52c2b1e] [^e912a650]. But wait, what if the patient is an outpatient without comorbidities and tests positive for a respiratory virus; newer ATS guidance suggests avoiding empiric antibiotics in that scenario, whereas patients with comorbidities and imaging-confirmed CAP who test positive for a virus may warrant empiric antibiotics due to concern for bacterial-viral coinfection, so I should align with local policy and patient risk [^38004ed8] [^9e0d0ba2].

> Let me consider macrolide resistance again, because this is easy to misapply. Macrolide monotherapy is not advised when local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is 25% or higher, which is the case in many U.S. regions; if resistance is below 25% and there are contraindications to amoxicillin or doxycycline, macrolide monotherapy may be reasonable, but I should double-check local antibiograms before choosing that path [^d3e0a451] [^ac063e83] [^5a3f6afb]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to outpatients without comorbidities; yes, the restriction is particularly emphasized for otherwise healthy outpatients, whereas patients with comorbidities already qualify for broader regimens by default [^d3e0a451].

> For pediatric patients, I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize adult regimens. In children older than 3 months managed as outpatients, amoxicillin is first-line for suspected bacterial CAP, with macrolides reserved for school-aged children when atypical pathogens like Mycoplasma are suspected; importantly, recent high-quality evidence supports shorter antibiotic courses of 3 to 5 days as noninferior to 7 to 10 days, with fewer adverse effects and less resistance, so I should favor 5 days when the child is clinically improving [^b78966c4] [^7da23c47] [^3c49e54e] [^6ccebd83]. Wait, let me verify the age range for shorter courses; the pivotal trial and meta-analyses focused on children aged 6 months and older, which supports adopting shorter courses in that group when clinically appropriate [^3c49e54e] [^6ccebd83].

> I should double-check that I have addressed prevention and follow-up counseling, because this reduces recurrence and improves outcomes. Adults 65 years or older, or those 19 to 64 with chronic conditions, should receive pneumococcal vaccination per current schedules, and all adults should be offered influenza vaccination; smoking cessation counseling and assessment of home supports are also important parts of comprehensive care, though these are beyond the acute treatment scope [^f756189b]. Let me reconsider whether any of these change empiric choices; they do not alter initial antibiotics, but they shape downstream risk and public health impact, reinforcing the need for guideline-concordant, stewardship-minded prescribing [^f756189b].

> In summary, I need to ensure my plan is concise and actionable: confirm CAP clinically and with imaging when feasible, risk-stratify to keep appropriate patients outpatient, choose amoxicillin or doxycycline for those without comorbidities while avoiding macrolide monotherapy where resistance is high, broaden to beta-lactam plus macrolide or doxycycline, or to a respiratory fluoroquinolone, for patients with comorbidities, treat for at least 5 days once stable, avoid routine sputum or blood cultures in the outpatient setting, and tailor for influenza coinfection and pediatric nuances, all while integrating local resistance data and patient-specific contraindications [^d3e0a451] [^f68083c3] [^760f62a6] [^b7ec5544] [^70ecc6b6] [^3c49e54e].

---

Outpatient CAP treatment is **empiric and risk-based**: use **amoxicillin or doxycycline** for healthy adults without comorbidities [^d3e0a451], and a **beta-lactam plus macrolide or doxycycline**, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, for patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic use [^f68083c3] [^0a447dfe]. Macrolide monotherapy is only for areas with **pneumococcal macrolide resistance < 25%** [^ac063e83] [^688d8fef]. Treat for 5 days [^760f62a6] once clinically stable, avoid routine labs or sputum cultures [^b7ec5544], and add influenza therapy if positive [^e912a650]. In children, use **amoxicillin** as first-line [^b78966c4] [^7da23c47]; shorten to 5 days if improving [^3c49e54e] [^6ccebd83].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and severity assessment

- **Clinical diagnosis**: CAP is suspected by cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, fever, and abnormal lung exam [^30247ffd]; confirm with chest radiography or lung ultrasound when feasible [^f756189b].

- **Severity assessment**: Use PSI or CURB-65 to guide site of care; PSI is preferred for prognostic accuracy and safely increases outpatient care [^4359e1f8] [^71009d0e].

- **Routine testing**: Do not obtain routine sputum cultures, blood cultures, or serology in outpatients [^b7ec5544] [^daeb8b71].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy is **guided by comorbidities, recent antibiotic use, and local resistance patterns** [^d3e0a451] [^f68083c3].

| **Patient category** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Healthy adults without comorbidities | - Amoxicillin 1 g PO TID [^d3e0a451] [^30479eb6] <br/> - Or doxycycline 100 mg PO BID [^d3e0a451] [^30479eb6] <br/> - Macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance < 25% [^ac063e83] [^688d8fef] |
| Adults with comorbidities or recent antibiotic use | - Beta-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) plus macrolide or doxycycline [^f68083c3] [^0a447dfe] <br/> - Or respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) monotherapy [^f68083c3] [^0a447dfe] |

---

## Duration of therapy

Treat for a **minimum of 5 days** [^760f62a6], ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before discontinuation. Most patients stabilize within 48–72 hours, supporting a 5-day total course [^760f62a6].

---

## Special considerations

- **Influenza coinfection**: If influenza is confirmed, add antiviral therapy (e.g. oseltamivir) [^e912a650] and consider early antibiotic discontinuation if no bacterial pathogen is identified and the patient is clinically stable [^70ecc6b6].

- **Pediatric patients**: Amoxicillin is first-line [^b78966c4]; shorten to 5 days if improving [^3c49e54e] [^6ccebd83].

- **Macrolide resistance**: Avoid macrolide monotherapy if local pneumococcal resistance is ≥ 25% [^d3e0a451] [^5a3f6afb].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **clinical follow-up** within 48–72 hours to assess response and adherence. Routine repeat chest radiography is not required unless the patient fails to improve or has persistent symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Emphasize **medication adherence**, hydration, and warning signs of deterioration. Ensure **vaccination** with influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines per guidelines [^f756189b].

---

Outpatient CAP management is **empiric and risk-based**, with amoxicillin or doxycycline for healthy adults and broader regimens for those with comorbidities or recent antibiotics [^d3e0a451] [^f68083c3]. Five days of therapy suffices once stable, and macrolide monotherapy is reserved for low-resistance settings [^760f62a6] [^ac063e83].

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^ab3d5bff]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^760bdc66]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^c1dbce47]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the first leading cause of death in low-income countries. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition that causes a significant disease burden for the community, particularly in children younger than five years, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for CAP. However, increasing antibiotic use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side effects for the patient. Several studies have been published regarding optimal antibiotic treatment for CAP but many of these data address treatments in hospitalised patients. This is an update of our 2009 Cochrane Review and addresses antibiotic therapies for CAP in outpatient settings.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatments for CAP in participants older than 12 years treated in outpatient settings with respect to clinical, radiological and bacteriological outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (2009 to March 2014), Web of Science (2009 to March 2014) and LILACS (2009 to March 2014).

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, of antibiotics versus placebo as well as antibiotics versus another antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings in participants older than 12 years of age. However, we did not find any studies of antibiotics versus placebo. Therefore, this review includes RCTs of one or more antibiotics, which report the diagnostic criteria and describe the clinical outcomes considered for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LMB, TJMV) independently assessed study reports in the first publication. In the 2009 update, LMB performed study selection, which was checked by TJMV and MMK. In this 2014 update, two review authors (SP, SM) independently performed and checked study selection. We contacted trial authors to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. We compiled and analysed the data. We resolved differences between review authors by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in this review update (3352 participants older than 12 years with a diagnosis of CAP); 10 RCTs assessed nine antibiotic pairs (3321 participants) and one RCT assessed four antibiotics (31 participants) in people with CAP. The study quality was generally good, with some differences in the extent of the reporting. A variety of clinical, bacteriological and adverse events were reported. Overall, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics. Studies evaluating clarithromycin and amoxicillin provided only descriptive data regarding the primary outcome. Though the majority of adverse events were similar between all antibiotics, nemonoxacin demonstrated higher gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events when compared to levofloxacin, while cethromycin demonstrated significantly more nervous system side effects, especially dysgeusia, when compared to clarithromycin. Similarly, high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day) was associated with higher incidence of gastritis and diarrhoea compared to clarithromycin, azithromycin and levofloxacin.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence from recent RCTs is insufficient to make new evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies assessing the same antibiotic pairs. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. However, two studies did find significantly more adverse events with use of cethromycin as compared to clarithromycin and nemonoxacin when compared to levofloxacin. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations. Further studies focusing on diagnosis, management, cost-effectiveness and misuse of antibiotics in CAP and LRTI are warranted in high-, middle- and low-income countries.

### Principles of antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^a75cf1c1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Nearly 80% of the treatment for this condition is provided in the outpatient setting. Among the etiologic agents associated with bacterial CAP, the predominant pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Treatment of CAP for the most part is empirical; therefore, any antibiotic treatment should cover both typical and atypical pathogens. The beta-lactams have historically been considered standard therapy for the treatment of CAP. However, the impact of rising resistance rates is now a primary concern facing physicians. For patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic therapy, current guidelines recommend either combination therapy with a beta-lactam and a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that exhibit high levels of penetration into the lungs and low levels of resistance. Evidence from clinical trials indicates clinical success rates of > 90% for moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin in the treatment of CAP due to S pneumoniae. Data from comparative clinical trials suggest fluoroquinolone monotherapy is as efficacious as beta-lactam-macrolide combination therapy in the treatment of CAP patients. The respiratory fluoroquinolone levofloxacin has also been shown to be effective in CAP patients for the treatment of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. The use of azithromycin, telithromycin, and fluoroquinolones in short-course regimens has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and tolerable in patients with CAP. Based on clinical evidence, high-dose, short-course therapies may represent a significant advance in the management of CAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^429450f9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. Results: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. Conclusions: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^64aa66c9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

### Clinical end points of therapy for patients with mild community-acquired pneumonia [^3d9837da]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Approximately 80% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia receive treatment as outpatients. The question is what are valid, reproducible, and quantifiable clinical end points that can be used in prospective clinical trials of the safety and efficacy of antibacterials. Patient-reported outcomes and measurements of time to end point are reasonable methods that, according to the limited data available, appear to work in clinical trials of therapy for mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia among outpatients.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^6ccebd83]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The optimal treatment duration of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children has been controversial in high-income countries. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare short antibiotic treatment (3–5 days) with longer treatment (7–10 days) among children aged ≥ 6 months.

Methods

On 31 January 2022, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies published in English from 2003 to 2022. We included randomized controlled trials focusing on antibiotic treatment duration in children with CAP treated as outpatients. We calculated risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals and used the fixed-effect model (low heterogeneity). Our main outcome was treatment failure, defined as need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month. Our secondary outcome was presence of antibiotic-related harms.

Results

A total of 541 studies were screened, and 4 studies with 1541 children were included in the review. Three studies had low risk of bias, and one had some concerns. All 4 studies assessed treatment failures, and the RD was 0.1% (95% confidence interval, −3.0% to 2.0%) with high quality of evidence. Two studies (1194 children) assessed adverse events related to antibiotic treatment, and the RD was 0.0% (−5.0% to 5.0%) with moderate quality of evidence. The diagnostic criteria varied between the included studies.

Conclusions

A short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was equally effective and safe compared with the longer (current) recommendation of 7–10 days in children aged ≥ 6 months with CAP. We suggest that short antibiotic courses can be implemented in treatment of pediatric CAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^e912a650]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) outpatient antibiotic evidence — "RCTs of antibiotic treatment regimens for adults with CAP provide little evidence of either superiority or equivalence of one antibiotic regimen over another", partly due to comparators no longer available, and "We identified 16 relevant RCTs comparing two antibiotic regimens for the treatment of outpatient CAP… Meta-analyses of each of these groups of studies revealed no differences in relevant outcomes between any of the compared regimens".

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^70ecc6b6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^24babb34]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^4e59d67a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition representing a significant disease burden for the community, particularly for the elderly. Because antibiotics are helpful in treating CAP, they are the standard treatment and CAP thus contributes significantly to antibiotic use, which is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side-effects. Although several studies have been published concerning CAP and its treatment, the available data arises mainly from studies conducted in hospitalized patients and outpatients. There is no concise summary of the available evidence that can help clinicians in choosing the most appropriate antibiotic.

Objectives

Our goal was to summarize the evidence currently available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy of alternative antibiotic treatments for CAP in ambulatory patients above 12 years of age.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's trial register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 3, 2003), and EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2003). Studies were also identified by checking the bibliographies of studies and review articles retrieved as well as by perusing medical journals. To identify any additional published or unpublished studies, we contacted the following antibiotics manufacturers: Abbott, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Lilly, Merck, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Sanofi, and Yamanouchi. No language restrictions were applied in any of the search strategies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which one or more antibiotics were tested for the treatment of CAP in ambulatory adolescent or adult patients. Studies testing one or more antibiotic and reporting the diagnostic criteria used in selecting patients as well as the clinical outcomes achieved were included. No language restrictions were applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and study reports assessed by two independent reviewers (LMB and TJMV). Authors of studies were contacted as needed to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. The data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 4.2.2 Software. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

Three randomized controlled trials involving a total of 622 patients aged 12 years and older diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia were included. The quality of the studies and of the reporting was variable. A variety of clinical, radiological and bacteriological diagnostic criteria and outcomes were reported. Overall there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics under study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in ambulatory patients. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations.

### Outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia [^41489377]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The first guidelines on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were published in 1993, but since then many of the challenges regarding the outpatient management of CAP persist. These include the difficulty in establishing the initial clinical diagnosis, its risk stratification, which will dictate the place of treatment, the empirical choice of antibiotics, the relative scarcity of novel antibiotics and the importance of knowing local microbiological susceptibility patterns.

Recent Findings

New molecular biology methods have changed the etiologic perspective of CAP, especially the contribution of virus. Lung ultrasound and biomarkers might aid diagnosis and severity stratification in the outpatient setting. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem that reinforces the importance of novel antibiotics. And finally, prevention and the use of anti-pneumococcal vaccine are instrumental in reducing the burden of disease.

Summary

Most of CAP cases are managed in the community; however, most research comes from hospitalized severe patients. New and awaited advances might contribute to aid diagnosis, cause and assessment of patients with CAP in the community. This knowledge might prove decisive in the execution of stewardship programmes that maintain current antibiotics, safeguard future ones and reinforce prevention.

### Outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia [^ee9901b7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although most patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are treated as outpatients, the majority of data regarding CAP management is provided by hospitals, either from emergency department or inpatients. This was already noted in the first CAP guidelines, published in 1993, and the challenges regarding the outpatient management of CAP persist nowadays. These include the uncertainty of the initial diagnosis and risk stratification, the empirical choice of antibiotics, the overgrowing of antibiotic resistance bacteria and the relative scarcity of novel antibiotics.

Recent Findings

New molecular biology methods have changed the etiologic perspective of CAP, unveiling the role of virus. Diagnostic uncertainty may lead to antibiotic overuse and bacteria resistance. Novel antibiotics along with diagnostic improvement, related to the use of lung ultrasound and point-of-care biomarkers testing, may help to improve CAP treatment. Prevention, especially the use of antipneumococcal vaccine, is instrumental in reducing the burden of disease.

Summary

Most of CAP cases are managed in the outpatient setting. However, most research is focused on hospitalized severe patients. New and awaited advances might contribute to aid diagnosis, cause and assessment of patients with CAP in the community. This knowledge might prove decisive in improving outcomes, as well as to the execution of stewardship programs that maintain current antibiotics, safeguard future ones and reinforce prevention.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^bd24d22c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^f2e2362f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^cbe0b5b9]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Clinical policy for the management and risk stratification of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the emergency department [^3e6ed85e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical policy represents an approach that emphasizes key clinical information to determine the severity of CAP. By using this approach, a determination of whether the patient can be treated as an outpatient or inpatient may be made. Recommendations about the utility of ancillary studies and the use of antibiotics are also given. As more of the questions are answered through controlled studies, an evidence-based approach to this problem will become increasingly important in improving the outcome of patients with CAP.

### Guideline adoption for community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^18e7ff32]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America national childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline encouraged the standard evaluation and treatment of children who were managed as outpatients. Our objectives were to (1) increase adherence to guideline-recommended diagnostics and antibiotic treatment of CAP at 5 pediatric primary care practices (PPCPs) by using quality-improvement methods and (2) evaluate the association between guideline adherence and unscheduled follow-up visits.

Methods

Immunocompetent children > 3 months of age with no complex chronic conditions and who were diagnosed with CAP were eligible for inclusion in this stepped-wedge study. Interventions were focused on education, knowledge of colleagues' prescribing practices, and feedback sessions. Statistical process control charts were used to assess changes in recommendations and antibiotic treatment. Unscheduled follow-up visits were compared across time by using generalized estimating equations that were clustered by PPCP.

Results

CAP was diagnosed in 1906 children. Guideline recommended therapy and pulse oximetry use increased from a mean baseline of 24.9% to a mean of 68.0% and from 4.3% to 85.0%, respectively, over the study period. Among children > 5 years of age, but not among those who were younger, the receipt of guideline recommended antibiotics, as compared with nonguideline therapy, was associated with the increased likelihood of unscheduled follow-up (adjusted odds ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.31–3.43). Chest radiographs and complete blood cell counts were rarely performed at baseline.

Conclusions

Recommendations for limited use of chest radiographs and complete blood cell counts and standardized antibiotic therapy in children is supported at PPCPs. However, the guideline may need to include macrolide monotherapy as appropriate antibiotic therapy for older children.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^1310d877]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the northern hemisphere about 12/1000 people a year (on average) contract pneumonia while living in the community, with most cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mortality ranges from about 5% to 35% depending on severity of disease, with a worse prognosis in older people, men, and people with chronic diseases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent community-acquired pneumonia? What are the effects of treatments for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient settings, in people admitted to hospital, and in people receiving intensive care? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, intravenous), different combinations, and prompt administration of antibiotics in intensive-care settings, early mobilisation, influenza vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^e907035a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Recommendations and Influenza

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza. In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%). Antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with AS considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels. We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^5cd42207]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects 0.3%–1.5% of children yearly in Western countries. The current standard treatment strategy in international guidelines for CAP is 7–10 days of oral amoxicillin, regardless of etiology. In children < 5 years of age, viruses alone or in mixed infections with bacteria are the most common cause of CAP. Evidence shows that Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved in more than half of the cases after 10 years of age, but the usefulness of antibiotics remains obscure. At all ages the most important bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications are rare, but when they are present, they usually follow pneumococcal CAP.

The optimal treatment duration for CAP in high-income countries has been controversial. A systematic review published in 2014, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), addressed the efficacy of the shorter treatment duration for CAP. Only 1 of the 8 RCTs was from a high-income country and most of the RCTs did not compare shorter antibiotic treatment with the current treatment recommendation. The most recent systematic review without meta-analysis included 11 trials (of which 8 were from developing countries) and concluded that more studies from high-income countries were needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of shorter antibiotic treatment in children.

Shorter antibiotic treatments for pediatric CAP cases have, at least in theory, several potential benefits over current treatment strategies. Shorter courses may prevent development of antibiotic resistance by minimizing exposure of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes of normal flora to antibiotics, which diminishes the selection pressure for emergence of resistant strains. In addition, unnecessary long courses increase the risk of adverse events, such as diarrhea, which is common in young children treated with antibiotics.

This meta-analysis comprising RCTs focused on antibiotic treatment duration of CAP in children treated as outpatients in high-income countries. Our primary aim was to determine whether a short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was as effective and safe as the longer treatment duration of 7–10 days. In addition, we evaluated antibiotic-related adverse events as a secondary objective of the study.

Outpatient CAP with comorbidities — broader-spectrum regimens and fluoroquinolone considerations: Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment, with regimens recommended that include a β-lactam or cephalosporin in combination with either a macrolide or doxycycline; these combinations should effectively treat macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, β-lactamase–producing strains of H. influenzae, many enteric gram-negative bacilli, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Despite increasing reports of adverse events related to fluoroquinolone use, the panel believed that fluoroquinolone therapy was justified for adults with comorbidities and CAP managed in the outpatient setting. The guideline adopts the convention to recommend that patients with recent exposure to one antibiotic class receive treatment with a different class, and notes that both sets of treatment recommendations contain multiple antibiotic options without specifying a preference order, requiring a risk–benefit assessment that weighs local epidemiology and individual risk factors such as documented β-lactam or macrolide allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides), vascular disease (fluoroquinolones), and history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — key changes versus 2007 — state that sputum culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa", and blood culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa". Macrolide monotherapy carries a "Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels". Use of procalcitonin is "Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy", and corticosteroids are "Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock". The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to "Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative". For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, "Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination", and follow-up chest imaging is "Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated".

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^f3594bdf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^fa4eb4cd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The main result of this meta-analysis on the duration of antibiotic courses in children treated for CAP as outpatients was that a short antibiotic course of 3–5 days was not inferior to a long course of 7–10 days (the recommendation in the currently available guidelines). The analysis included 4 RCTs from high-income countries with a total of 1451 children aged ≥ 6 months. Treatment failure was defined as the need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month, and the rates were surprisingly similar: 7.9% and 8.0%, respectively. The RD between the arms was 0.1%, and the 95% CI was very narrow, confirming that the result for the primary outcome was reliable. In addition, there was no substantial heterogeneity between the 4 studies for reporting retreatments and hospitalizations within 1 month after starting of primary antibiotics.

Adverse events, which was the secondary outcome of the analyses, were reported in 2 studies and they did not differ between the short-course and long-course treatment arms. Adverse events rates were 62.1% and 61.8%, respectively. These adverse events, such as diarrhea and rash, were mild and were often seen in children during antibiotic treatment. Two studies reported severe adverse events, and such events were seen in 0.3% of the cases, which means that the short-course antibiotic therapy was safe. A previous meta-analysis stated that each additional day of antibiotic treatment increases the rates of antibiotic-related adverse effects. Two of the included studies also analyzed the effects of treatment duration on antibiotic resistance and found the shorter course to be more beneficial, but we did not include this as an outcome in the meta-analysis.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — site-of-care decision support recommends a validated clinical prediction rule for prognosis, preferentially the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) over the CURB-65 (tool based on confusion, urea level, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥ 65) (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence), to determine the need for hospitalization in adults diagnosed with CAP; both the PSI and CURB-65 were developed to predict 30-day mortality, and when compared with CURB-65, PSI identifies larger proportions of patients at low risk and has a higher discriminative power in predicting mortality; two multicenter, cluster-randomized trials demonstrated that use of the PSI safely increases the proportion of patients who can be treated in the outpatient setting, and these trials and one additional randomized controlled trial (RCT) support the safety of using the PSI to guide the initial site of treatment without worsening mortality or other clinically relevant outcomes; when used as a decision aid, the PSI should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment; in comparison to the PSI, there is less evidence that CURB-65 is effective as a decision aid, with one pre–post, controlled before–after study using an electronically calculated version of CURB-65, PaO2/FiO2 < 300, absence of pleural effusion, and fewer than three minor ATS severity criteria observing no significant increase in the use of outpatient treatment of adults with CAP; providing a conditional recommendation to use CURB-65 considers its greater simplicity of use relative to the PSI, and the PSI may underestimate illness severity among younger patients because, for example, all systolic blood pressures < 90 mm Hg are considered abnormal regardless of baseline and actual measurement.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy, outpatient setting, patients without comorbidities, AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend to administer high-dose amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide (if local macrolide resistance rates for pneumococcus are < 25%) for empiric antibiotic therapy in adult outpatients with CAP without comorbid conditions.

### Adherence to Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for empiric therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia in a commercially insured cohort [^89b12acd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

There is little published research addressing how the 2003 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are implemented in clinical practice.

Objective

This study was designed to describe antibiotic treatment patterns among patients with CAP treated in ambulatory settings in light of the IDSA guidelines.

Methods

Health insurance claims data from a large managed care organization with -30 million enrollees located in geographically diverse regions of the United States were analyzed. Patients ≥ 18 years of age with CAP who received a prescription for any antibiotic in an ambulatory setting during 2004 were identified via International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for diagnosis (481–486). Recent antibiotic use was defined as receipt of any antibiotics < 90 days before the date of diagnosis. Antibiotics were identified through National Drug Codes and from outpatient medical claims data with the use of J codes. Individuals were classified, per IDSA guidelines, as previously healthy without recent antibiotic use (group 1); previously healthy with recent antibiotic use (group 2); with comorbidities and without recent antibiotic use (group 3); and with comorbidities and recent antibiotic use (group 4). The guideline adherence was calculated using the number of patients receiving recommended treatment divided by the total number of patients in each group.

Results

Of 34,342 patients identified, 76.5% had no reported comorbidities. Among group-1 patients, 52.0% received the recommended empiric therapy (macrolide or doxycycline). In group-2 patients, 42.5% received the recommended therapy (respiratory quinolone alone or advanced-generation macrolide plus amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate). A high rate of compliance with recommended empiric therapy (advanced-generation macrolides or respiratory quinolones) was observed in group-3 patients (81.5%). In group-4 patients, 43.4% received the recommended therapy (respiratory quinolone or advanced-generation macrolide plus ss-lactam). Patients whose therapy was adherent with the guidelines had fewer respiratory-infection-related hospital admissions within 30 days after initiation of antibiotic treatment (overall, relative risk = 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71–0.94]).

Conclusion

Although these data reflect a period shortly after the 2003 IDSA guidelines were published, they suggest that there is room for improvement with regard to choice of empiric antibiotic therapy among these patients with CAP treated in ambulatory settings.

### The controversy of combination vs monotherapy in the treatment of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia [^1250b8c3]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients (about 80%) will be treated as outpatients, because therapy with a single agent will work. For the remaining 20% of patients requiring hospitalization, there is some growing debate regarding the efficacy of different management approaches. For hospitalized patients, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone agent seems to be gaining popularity, but dual therapy combining a beta-lactam and an advanced macrolide still represents a good choice. Indeed, this regimen was recommended for all of the inpatient categories in the latest Infectious Disease Society of America CAP guidelines in 2003.

Aim

The purpose of this review was to examine the current clinical evidence to support one option or the other by gathering all of the available published literature. We will review the existing controversies in terms of microbiology, immunology, and clinical outcomes comparing dual therapy (ie, with any combination of beta-lactams, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones) with monotherapy in the treatment of CAP.

Results

For the vast majority of patients with CAP (ie, outpatients and inpatients on medical wards), the type of antibiotic regimen prescribed does not have any significant impact. For patients with severe pneumonia, for which there is no accepted definition so far, the controversy remains alive. Mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia has been reduced over the last decades, but despite improved medical care, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is still as lethal as ever, probably because of the aging population, the greater number of immunocompromised patients, and the number of patients with frequent comorbid conditions. Worldwide, the increasing rates of resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics are also a serious concern, and the clinical implications are not always obvious. Although limited in number, the four studies showing the importance of adding a macrolide to a beta-lactam regimen for the treatment of bacteremic S pneumoniae pneumonia are retrospective and nonblinded, the findings are consistent, and they point to a trend that has to be explored more thoroughly. Studies published in the last few years suggest that combination therapy may be superior for bacteremic S pneumoniae pneumonia.

Conclusion

In the meantime, for practical purposes, patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe CAP may benefit from a dual antibiotic therapy combining a third-generation cephalosporin and a macrolide. For the majority of hospitalized patients with CAP who are not severely ill, fluoroquinolone monotherapy remains an approved, tested, and reliable option. Indeed, the time for more aggressive outpatient fluoroquinolone therapy may reduce the number of patients who are hospitalized with CAP. Independent prospective studies comparing combination therapy with standard monotherapy are urgently required for hospitalized patients with severe CAP.

### Local guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia: development, implementation, and outcome studies [^03ef4dc4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Published outcome studies mostly report a positive effect of successfully implemented pneumonia guidelines. Confirmatory studies are needed that use randomized, parallel groups with precisely defined treatments, however. Further research also is needed to develop methodology for more easily providing guideline logic to clinicians at the point of care.

### Outpatient treatment for low-risk pneumonia is safe… [^ef911992]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Hospitalization rates for patients with community-acquired pneumonia vary widely. A clinical prediction rule based on the Pneumonia Severity Index attempts to standardize care by grouping patients into five risk categories based on predicted 30-day mortality. General agreement exists that patients in high-risk classes IV and V should receive inpatient treatment. However, controversy remains regarding the optimal treatment setting for patients in lower-risk classes II and III, who account for up to one half of all hospitalizations. Carratalà and colleagues conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare outcomes of inpatient and outpatient treatment of patients in PSI risk classes II and III. The study population consisted of 224 patients who were at least 18 years of age and had received a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency departments of two tertiary care hospitals.

Patients were excluded from the study if they were hypoxic, immunosuppressed, or had a serious comorbid medical or psychosocial condition that mandated hospitalization. Patients also were excluded if they had received a quinolone antibiotic in the preceding three months or had a known allergy or other contraindication to quinolones. Following the collection of blood, sputum, and urine cultures, patients were randomly assigned to receive outpatient oral levofloxacin 500 mg per day, or inpatient sequential intravenous and oral levofloxacin 500 mg per day. |Absence of death from any cause within 30 days of diagnosis| An overall successful outcome was recorded at the 30-day visit in 83. 6 percent of outpatients and
80. 7 percent of initially hospitalized patients. The one patient who died had received outpatient treatment and was hospitalized for intestinal ischemia two weeks after being diagnosed with pneumonia.

Health-related quality of life was similar between groups, but outpatients reported greater satisfaction with their care than did inpatients. The authors conclude that most patients in PSI classes II and III may be treated safely as outpatients, and that this treatment strategy improves patient satisfaction with care. In addition, they suggest that implementing this standard of care could produce significant economic savings because inpatient pneumonia treatment in the United States costs $6, 000 to $7, 000, whereas outpatient treatment costs less than $200. They caution, however, that this small study of low-risk patients was not powered to detect a difference in mortality.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^570afc0e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Until now, most data on the length of antibiotic courses have come from low-income or middle-income countries. The main differences in relation to the high-income countries concern the definition of CAP by the World Health Organization criteria for developing countries, which highlight increased respiratory rate and rates of severe treatment failure > 5%, which are not acceptable in Western countries.

The main strength of our review is the high quality and low risk of bias of the included studies, which increases the validity of our results. Furthermore, we did not have any major protocol deviations. Moreover, the numbers of cases — 1451 for the primary outcome and 1194 for the secondary outcome of antibiotic-related adverse events — allow reliable meta-analysis. The exclusion of studies focusing on treatment of atypical pneumonias increased the consistency of data, since the necessity to treat them remains open.

A minor limitation to our results is the fact that more than half of the patients were from a single study, but this should not cause bias in the estimates, given that the results were similar in all studies. The main limitation of our study is the differing definition of CAP in the included studies, because 2 of them required chest radiographs and 2 did not. The currently available guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of CAP treated at home is clinical, and imaging is needed only in complicated cases. Viral determinations were performed in only one study, but virus identification does not necessarily influence decision making in CAP, since mixed viral-bacterial infections are common and it is recommended that all pediatric CAP cases in children ≥ 6 months of age are treated with antibiotics. Therefore, future studies should focus more on optimal differential recognition of bacterial and viral pneumonia, and a double-blinded placebo design should be used to determine whether antibiotics are needed at all in mild pneumonia. As seen in a previous study from England, antibiotics did not improve outcomes in nonsevere lower respiratory tract infections.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis, including 4 high-level RCTs, showed that short treatment was equally safe and effective as longer treatment of 7–10 days for CAP in outpatient children aged ≥ 6 months in high-income countries. We suggest that this shorter treatment for 3–5 days can now be implemented into clinical practice.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^6c23624e]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics remain the primary treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP), however rising rates of antimicrobial resistance may jeopardize their future efficacy. With higher rates of disease reported in the youngest populations, effective treatment courses for pediatric pneumonia are of paramount importance. This study is the first to examine the quality of pediatric antibiotic use by agent, dose and duration.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study included all outpatient/primary care physician visits for pediatric CAP (aged < 19 years) between January 1 2014 to December 31 2018. Relevant practice guidelines were identified, and treatment recommendations extracted. Amoxicillin was the primary first-line agent for pediatric CAP. Categories of prescribing included: guideline adherent, effective but unnecessary (excess dose and/or duration), under treatment (insufficient dose and/or duration), and not recommended. Proportions of attributable-antibiotic use were examined by prescribing category, and then stratified by age and sex.

Result(s)

A total of 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP were identified. Of those, 31,347 (76%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicillin accounted for 51% of all prescriptions. Overall, 27% of prescribing was fully guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, 10% under treatment, and 44% not recommended by agent. Excessive duration was the hallmark of effective but unnecessary prescribing (97%) Macrolides accounted for the majority on non-first line agent use, with only 32% of not recommended prescribing preceded by a previous course of antibiotics.

Conclusion(s)

This study is the first in Canada to examine prescribing quality for pediatric CAP by agent, dose and duration. Utilizing first-line agents, and shorter-course treatments are targets for stewardship.

### Recent advances in community-acquired pneumonia: inpatient and outpatient [^664f75a5]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness, with the majority of patients treated out of the hospital, yet the greatest burden of the cost of care comes from inpatient management. In the past several years, the management of these patients has advanced, with new information about the natural history and prognosis of illness, the utility of serum markers to guide management, the use of appropriate clinical tools to guide the site-of-care decision, and the finding that guidelines can be developed in a way that improves patient outcome. The challenges to patient management include the emergence of new pathogens and the progression of antibiotic resistance in some of the common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Few new antimicrobial treatment options are available, and the utility of some new therapies has been limited by drug-related toxicity. Ancillary care for severe pneumonia with activated protein C and corticosteroids is being studied, but recently, inpatient care has been most affected by the development of evidence-based "core measures" for management that have been promoted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which form the basis for the public reporting of hospital performance in CAP care.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^a3feca65]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia remains one of the leading global causes of mortality particularly in children, and older adults. In Canada, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated to substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burden. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) encompasses infections outside of a hospital setting. Up to 80% of patients with pneumonia are treated in the community, however the etiology of CAP is heterogeneous with both bacterial and viral etiologies prevalent in children. Underlying pathogens can include S. pneumoniae however viral infections, and mixed bacterial-viral infections are common, contributing to the complexity of pathogen detection and treatment. In light of this heterogeneity, physicians rarely have knowledge of precise etiology, and treatment is commonly empiric in nature.

The evaluation of outpatient prescribing is often contingent on patient factors not captured within routine, administrative health data. Prior efforts to overcome gaps include the establishment of expected, or maximal, prescribing rates in order to create a benchmark against which antibiotic use may be contextualized. Most often generated using expert consensus methodology, these markers are inherently limited by participant self-selection, physician biases to specific populations, and issues with reliability/external validity. Moreover, these results provide high-level interpretations of appropriate use, which has been subject to criticism given the lack of robust patient information to sufficiently elucidate prescription quality. Efforts are further limited by the absence of standardized nomenclature.

This retrospective cohort study is the first in Canada to examine the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions issued for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia, in outpatient care. In British Columbia (BC), Canada Bugs & Drugs™ is a provincially utilized clinical reference, published in 2012. The objective of this study was to utilize this resource, as well as other relevant practice guidelines available during the study period, to examine appropriate antibiotic use. The use of guidelines to define categories of prescribing offer a novel, objective interpretation of prescribing quality when compared to previous efforts of expert opinion. Our objectives were to determine the quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric CAP by agent, dose and duration. Appropriate use by agent was hypothesized to account for a majority of antibiotic use, while duration of therapy was expected to exceed guideline recommendations.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — antibiotic duration and oral step-down: We recommend treating for a minimum of 5 days, with most patients achieving clinical stability within 48 to 72 hours such that a total duration of therapy of 5 days will be appropriate for most patients; when switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics, either the same agent or the same drug class should be used, and for CAP due to suspected or proven MRSA or P. aeruginosa, therapy should be 7 days.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a practical approach to management for the hospitalist [^33eae90e]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common, and inpatient physicians should be familiar with the most current evidence about and guidelines for CAP management. Our conclusions and recommendations include: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common identified cause of CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of severe CAP. The chest radiograph remains an essential initial test in the diagnosis of CAP and should be supplemented by blood cultures sampled prior to antibiotic therapy and sputum for gram stain and culture if a high-quality specimen can be rapidly processed. Once the diagnosis is made, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) should be used to optimize the location of treatment and to provide prognostic information. Absent other mitigating factors, patients in PSI risk classes I, II, and III can safely be treated as outpatients. Hospitalized patients with CAP should be treated promptly with empiric antibiotics. Nonsevere pneumonia should be treated with a parenteral beta-lactam plus either doxycycline or a macrolide. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone as well as be evaluated for pseudomonal risk factors. Most patients with nonsevere CAP reach clinical stability in 2–3 days and should be considered for a switch to oral therapy and discharge shortly thereafter. Patients should receive pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, and tobacco cessation counseling prior to discharge if eligible. Multiple quality indicators are measured and publicly reported in the management of CAP, which provides hospitals with an opportunity to improve care processes and patient outcomes.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^30247ffd]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### ACCP releases consensus statement on outpatient… [^9a97824e]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Choosing the Site of Care According to the statement, the decision to treat a patient on an outpatient basis as opposed to in the hospital should be based on the severity of the illness, the ability of the patient or caregiver to manage the treatment, and the patient's wishes. Patients who live alone or have abnormal vital signs, mental instability, alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspiration, cardiovascular instability, uremia, or malnutrition, and those who have been hospitalized for pneumonia in the past year have a poor prognosis for in-home treatment. Treatment Needs of the Outpatient The ACCP maintains that the physician is responsible for confirming the availability of all aspects of the treatment plan in the patient's home before initiating outpatient treatment. Physicians should evaluate the caregiver's ability to respond to the patient's needs in regard to hydration, nutrition, pain, cough, and shortness of breath.

Oral administration of antibiotics is recommended by the ACCP for outpatient treatment, but the choice of antibiotic should be made on a case-by-case basis. The use of a macrolide antibiotic, doxycycline, or fluoroquinolone agent may be appropriate empiric outpatient treatment for low-risk patients. Alternatives to these agents in low-risk patients are amoxicillin-clavulanate and some second-generation cephalosporins. Patients who are at high risk because of complicated comorbidities or extensive prior antibiotic use may be a candidate for treatment with a beta lactam-macrolide combination or a antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone.

Double therapy with a beta lactam-macrolide combination or a beta lactam-antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone should be considered in patients who normally would be considered for admission to an intensive care unit but have chosen to be treated on an outpatient basis. Resolution of Symptoms The physician should confirm resolution of symptoms with chest radiography and evaluate the patient's status eight weeks after the diagnosis of CAP. The patient should be made aware of preventive measures for the future, including smoking cessation, influenza vaccination, initial pneumococcal vaccination, and revaccination with the pneumococcal vaccine every five to seven years if appropriate.

### The pneumonia severity index: a decade after the initial derivation and validation [^71009d0e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia ranges from rapid resolution of symptoms and full recovery of functional status to the development of severe medical complications and death. The pneumonia severity index is a rigorously studied prediction rule for prognosis that objectively stratifies patients into quintiles of risk for short-term mortality on the basis of 20 demographic and clinical variables routinely available at presentation. The pneumonia severity index was derived and validated with data on > 50,000 patients with community-acquired pneumonia by use of well-accepted methodological standards and is the only pneumonia decision aid that has been empirically shown to safely increase the proportion of patients given treatment in the outpatient setting. Because of its prognostic accuracy, methodological rigor, and effectiveness and safety as a decision aid, the pneumonia severity index has become the reference standard for risk stratification of community-acquired pneumonia.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: what is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society guidelines [^5727375d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions. In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States 5 years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: rapid evidence review [^f756189b]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition with a hospitalization rate of about 2% in people 65 years or older and is associated with a 30-day mortality rate of 6% in hospitalized patients. In studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, a bacterial pathogen was identified in 11% of patients, a viral pathogen in 23% of patients, and no organism in 62% of patients. Certain signs and symptoms can be helpful in diagnosing CAP and selecting imaging studies. Diagnosis is usually made with a combination of history, physical examination, and findings on chest radiography, lung ultrasonography, or computed tomography. Procalcitonin measurement is not recommended. CRB-65 (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 65 years of age) is a well-validated risk stratification tool in the primary care setting and does not require laboratory testing. For outpatients without comorbidities, treatment with amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide is recommended (the latter only in areas where pneumococcal resistance to macrolides is less than 25%). In outpatients with comorbidities and inpatients with nonsevere pneumonia, a combination of a beta-lactam or third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended. Patients should be treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas infection only if they present with risk factors for those pathogens. All adults 65 years or older or those 19 to 64 with underlying conditions should receive the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine alone or the 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine one year later. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is no longer recommended for routine administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends vaccination against influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses for all adults.

### Executive summary: the management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months of age: clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^ba945f6c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Evidenced-based guidelines for management of infants and children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were prepared by an expert panel comprising clinicians and investigators representing community pediatrics, public health, and the pediatric specialties of critical care, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, infectious diseases, pulmonology, and surgery. These guidelines are intended for use by primary care and subspecialty providers responsible for the management of otherwise healthy infants and children with CAP in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Site-of-care management, diagnosis, antimicrobial and adjunctive surgical therapy, and prevention are discussed. Areas that warrant future investigations are also highlighted.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^f4441452]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Short-vs standard-course outpatient antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in children: the SCOUT-CAP randomized clinical trial [^3c49e54e]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics. Shorter courses may be effective with fewer adverse effects and decreased potential for antibiotic resistance.

Objective

To compare a short (5-day) vs standard (10-day) antibiotic treatment strategy for CAP in young children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in outpatient clinic, urgent care, or emergency settings in 8 US cities. A total of 380 healthy children aged 6 to 71 months with nonsevere CAP demonstrating early clinical improvement were enrolled from December 2, 2016, to December 16, 2019. Data were analyzed from January to September 2020.

Intervention

On day 6 of their originally prescribed therapy, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 5 days of matching placebo or 5 additional days of the same antibiotic.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the end-of-treatment response adjusted for duration of antibiotic risk (RADAR), a composite end point that ranks each child's clinical response, resolution of symptoms, and antibiotic-associated adverse effects in an ordinal desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR). Within each DOOR rank, participants were further ranked by the number of antibiotic days, assuming that shorter antibiotic durations were more desirable. Using RADAR, the probability of a more desirable outcome was estimated for the short- vs standard-course strategy. In a subset of children, throat swabs were collected between study days 19 and 25 to quantify antibiotic resistance genes in oropharyngeal flora.

Results

A total of 380 children (189 randomized to short course and 191 randomized to standard course) made up the study population. The mean (SD) age was 35.7 (17.2) months, and 194 participants (51%) were male. Of the included children, 8 were Asian, 99 were Black or African American, 234 were White, 32 were multiracial, and 7 were of unknown or unreported race; 33 were Hispanic or Latino, 344 were not Hispanic or Latino, and 3 were of unknown or unreported ethnicity. There were no differences between strategies in the DOOR or its individual components. Fewer than 10% of children in either strategy had an inadequate clinical response. The short-course strategy had a 69% (95% CI, 63–75) probability of a more desirable RADAR outcome compared with the standard-course strategy. A total of 171 children were included in the resistome analysis. The median (range) number of antibiotic resistance genes per prokaryotic cell (RGPC) was significantly lower in the short-course strategy compared with the standard-course strategy for total RGPC (1.17 [0.35–2.43] vs 1.33 [0.46–11.08]; P = 0.01) and β-lactamase RGPC (0.55 [0.18–1.24] vs 0.60 [0.21–2.45]; P = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, among children responding to initial treatment for outpatient CAP, a 5-day antibiotic strategy was superior to a 10-day strategy. The shortened approach resulted in similar clinical response and antibiotic-associated adverse effects, while reducing antibiotic exposure and resistance.

Trial Registration

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^f30cc1d7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### Short-course versus long-course therapy of the same antibiotic for community-acquired pneumonia in adolescent and adult outpatients [^cfbd03df]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lung infection that can be acquired during day-to-day activities in the community (not while receiving care in a hospital). Community-acquired pneumonia poses a significant public health burden in terms of mortality, morbidity, and costs. Shorter antibiotic courses for CAP may limit treatment costs and adverse effects, but the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment is uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-course versus longer-course treatment with the same antibiotic at the same daily dosage for CAP in non-hospitalised adolescents and adults (outpatients). We planned to investigate non-inferiority of short-course versus longer-term course treatment for efficacy outcomes, and superiority of short-course treatment for safety outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and three trials registers on 28 September 2017 together with conference proceedings, reference checking, and contact with experts and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short- and long-courses of the same antibiotic for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to use standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

Our searches identified 5260 records. We did not identify any RCTs that compared short- and longer-courses of the same antibiotic for the treatment of adolescents and adult outpatients with CAP. We excluded two RCTs that compared short courses (five compared to seven days) of the same antibiotic at the same daily dose because they evaluated antibiotics (gemifloxacin and telithromycin) not commonly used in practice for the treatment of CAP. In particular, gemifloxacin is no longer approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate CAP due to its questionable risk-benefit balance, and reported adverse effects. Moreover, the safety profile of telithromycin is also cause for concern. We found one ongoing study that we will assess for inclusion in future updates of the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no eligible RCTs that studied a short-course of antibiotic compared to a longer-course (with the same antibiotic at the same daily dosage) for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients. The effects of antibiotic therapy duration for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients remains unclear.

### Hospital-reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin [^cda59b1f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial drug treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia is largely empirical because the pathogen is not frequently identified. Even when a bacterial pathogen is identified, antimicrobial drug susceptibility information is frequently delayed for a few days, necessitating empiric treatment decisions. Guidelines for empirical treatment have been provided by several organizations, emphasizing the selection of agents based on the probability of specific pathogens in different clinical settings. One consistent recommendation of all guidelines for all clinical settings is that antimicrobial therapy cover Streptococcus pneumoniae because it is the most common bacterial pathogen and among the most virulent.

A number of factors guide the selection of empirical therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia, including drug efficacy, side effect profile, and ease of administration. In addition, the recent emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae has raised considerable concern that a number of drugs historically endorsed by national treatment guidelines may no longer be effective. The recommendations to avoid β-lactams and macrolides in high-risk settings has not been preceded by clinical studies demonstrating that drug resistance in vitro translates into clinical treatment failures. Regardless, emerging resistance to penicillins, tetracyclines, and macrolides has prompted newer versions of treatment guidelines to recommend abandoning these therapies in favor of newer therapies, such as fluoroquinolones, in settings where the risk for a drug-resistant pneumococcal infection is high. Given that penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae are increasingly multidrug resistant, if the risk for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is high, the risk for resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines is correspondingly high.

Specific risk factors for infection with penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae have not been clearly identified. Individual risk factors include prior exposure to antibiotics and exposure to young children in daycare, although no specific rules guide the interpretation of these risk factors. In addition, awareness of substantial geographic variation in the proportion of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae has lead some groups to recommend consideration of regional susceptibility patterns in the choice of empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia. Unfortunately, routine isolation of S. pneumoniae is highly dependent on the clinical setting. For example, blood and sputum samples are rarely sent from outpatient settings; thus, local rates of pneumococcal drug resistance are primarily determined by the phenotypes of bacteria isolated from sicker patients who require hospitalization. Whether results from local hospital microbiology laboratories provide valid information for guiding treatment is unclear.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

### Macrolide resistance in cases of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in the emergency department [^5a3f6afb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians are under pressure to prescribe an antibiotic early in the treatment course of a patient with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Macrolides are recommended first-line empirical therapy for the outpatient treatment of CAP in patients without associated comorbidities; however, resistance rates to macrolides in the United States are on the rise.

Objective

This review considers macrolide use for CAP in the emergency department by reviewing the microbiologic environment in the United States and whether macrolides can overcome in vitro resistance during actual clinical use. Alternatives to macrolides for CAP are briefly discussed.

Discussion

Resistance to macrolides is now above 25% in all regions of the United States, and resistance to other antibiotics is also on the rise. The failure of outpatient macrolide treatment for CAP because of resistance rates increases the burden of the disease both in terms of the patient and health economics. No definitive answer is available on whether macrolides will achieve treatment success despite infection with in vitro resistant strains. When selecting a therapy, a balance needs to be struck between spectrum of activity targeted against the probable etiology (including atypical pathogens) for respiratory tract infections and the need for first-time success.

Conclusions

Currently available macrolides are now facing resistance rates that cloud their recommendation as a first-line treatment for CAP. Clinicians need a better understanding of their own local resistance rates, while hospitals need to do a better job in describing low- and high-level resistance rates to better inform their physicians.

### Factors associated with the hospitalization of low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia in a cluster-randomized trial [^3b1fd9d1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Many low-risk patients with pneumonia are hospitalized despite recommendations to treat such patients in the outpatient setting.

Objective

To identify the factors associated with the hospitalization of low-risk patients with pneumonia.

Methods

We analyzed data collected by retrospective chart review for 1,889 low-risk patients (Pneumonia Severity Index [PSI] risk classes I to III without evidence of arterial oxygen desaturation) enrolled in a cluster-randomized trial conducted in 32 emergency departments.

Results

Overall, 845 (44.7%) of all low-risk patients were treated as inpatients. Factors independently associated with an increased odds of hospitalization included PSI risk classes II and III, the presence of medical or psychosocial contraindications to outpatient treatment, comorbid conditions that were not contained in the PSI (cognitive impairment, history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, or pulmonary disease), multilobar radiographic infiltrates, and home therapy with oxygen, corticosteroids, or antibiotics before presentation. While 32.8% of low-risk inpatients had a contraindication to outpatient treatment and 47.1% had one or more preexisting treatments, comorbid conditions, or radiographic abnormalities not contained in the PSI, 20.1% had no identifiable risk factors for hospitalization other than PSI risk class II or III.

Conclusions

Hospital admission appears justified for one-third of low-risk inpatients based upon the presence of one or more contraindications to outpatient treatment. At least one-fifth of low-risk inpatients did not have a contraindication to outpatient treatment or an identifiable risk factor for hospitalization, suggesting that treatment of a larger proportion of such low-risk patients in the outpatient setting could be achieved without adversely affecting patient outcomes.
