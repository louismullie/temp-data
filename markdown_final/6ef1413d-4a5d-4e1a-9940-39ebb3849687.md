## Question

What are the clinical indications for modafinil?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical indications for modafinil. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved indications and limitations of use. Then, I should verify key safety warnings and contraindications that shape prescribing. Next, I will examine off-label uses with the strongest evidence, followed by emerging or limited-evidence indications. After that, I must reconcile jurisdictional differences, especially pediatric guidance, and integrate mechanism of action to justify clinical rationale. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, hierarchical summary with dosing and monitoring considerations, ensuring I double-check conflicts and uncertainties along the way.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled uses so I do not overstate the drug's scope of approval. Modafinil is indicated in adults to improve wakefulness in narcolepsy, as adjunctive therapy for residual excessive sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea where it does not treat the airway obstruction, and for shift work disorder; importantly, it offers symptomatic relief and does not replace adequate sleep or primary OSA therapy such as CPAP, and labeling emphasizes use only after a maximal CPAP effort for an adequate period in OSA, which I should not forget to restate precisely [^115HpMgQ] [^114DnxKB] [^114DnxKB].

> I need to check key limitations and safety warnings next, because they strongly condition clinical decision-making. Hold on, I should verify pediatric status before proceeding: modafinil is not approved for any pediatric indication in the U.S. due to serious dermatologic risks, with an approximate 0.8% discontinuation rate for rash in pediatric trials and reports of SJS/TEN/DRESS, often within the first two weeks; therefore, I must not imply pediatric approval or routine pediatric use in U.S. practice [^1174rn2n] [^115K4dZb] [^114Dir5k]. Psychiatric adverse reactions including anxiety, insomnia, agitation, depression, mania, psychosis, and suicidality warrant caution in those with psychiatric histories; cardiovascular caution is advised in patients with cardiac disease or arrhythmias; severe hepatic impairment requires a 50% dose reduction; and hypersensitivity or angioedema mandates avoidance and prompt discontinuation if such reactions occur [^115mF9og] [^117FGjFQ] [^113bfZXY] [^117JLETw] [^115yjXwm]. I should also remember common adverse effects such as headache and insomnia and the broader label reminder that modafinil does not treat the underlying obstruction in OSA, which influences counseling and monitoring plans [^111oeYnV] [^113x6jW1] [^115HpMgQ].

> Next, I will examine off-label indications with relatively stronger signals; however, I must be careful not to conflate evidence strength with regulatory approval. ADHD comes to mind first, and I almost wrote that ADHD is FDA-approved for modafinil — wait, let me verify that; that is incorrect, as FDA labeling clearly states modafinil is not approved for pediatric patients for any indication due to safety concerns, despite systematic review data suggesting the strongest off-label evidence among psychiatric uses, and pediatric trials do not override the U.S. safety position [^1174rn2n] [^114DnxKB] [^115K4dZb]. For bipolar depression, I should confirm RCT data: adjunctive modafinil improved depressive symptoms and response/remission rates in a 6-week study with low observed switch rates, though vigilance for mood destabilization remains prudent and guideline opinions vary, which calls for careful patient selection and monitoring [^112qLpkc] [^116nahwd] [^112nW33B]. For neurological hypersomnolence/fatigue syndromes, I will now examine multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and TBI: AASM recommends considering modafinil for hypersomnia secondary to MS; Canadian guidance supports consideration in PD-related EDS after excluding reversible causes; and Class I evidence shows efficacy for post–traumatic brain injury excessive daytime sleepiness, though not for post-TBI fatigue, which I should not overinterpret [^115jH3m9] [^114KZYQG] [^116Rrst5].

> I should now review conditions with emerging or limited evidence and be explicit about the strength and generalizability of findings. The MIDAS crossover trial suggested reductions in fatigue and improved quality of life post-stroke with modafinil, but replication and longer-term safety data are limited, so I need to be cautious in extrapolation beyond specialized settings [^1136NNiJ]. Smaller or lower-credibility bodies of evidence suggest potential benefits for myotonic dystrophy somnolence, cancer- or HIV-related fatigue, fibromyalgia, and postoperative fatigue after general anesthesia, as well as possible cognitive or negative symptom adjunctive benefit in schizophrenia, but these signals require individual risk–benefit assessments and are not substitutes for disorder-specific standards of care [^114d3Roe] [^114Bp3L3] [^112MBSXF] [^1135hGHy] [^113rdoS7]. I should also mention an IBD fatigue case series showing improvements with open-label modafinil, but single-center uncontrolled data should not drive routine practice without confirmation [^116A2T5U].

> But wait, what if the clinical question involves stimulant use disorders, where the literature and guidance appear contradictory; I need to double-check this conflict explicitly. The 2024 AAAP/ASAM guideline suggests considering modafinil to reduce cocaine use and improve retention in cocaine use disorder in the absence of comorbid alcohol use disorder, whereas the 2023 WHO mhGAP guidance recommends against using modafinil for stimulant use disorders due to safety concerns; this discrepancy argues for jurisdiction-aware decision-making, shared decision-making, and heightened safety monitoring if considered at all in specialized care contexts [^116VvT1N] [^116cKtxW] [^114Bp3L3].

> I should confirm pediatric guidance nuances next, so I do not inadvertently misapply adult data. European Academy of Neurology guidance allows consideration of modafinil for pediatric narcolepsy with attention to safety issues, yet in the U.S. the FDA labeling remains clear that modafinil is not approved for any pediatric use, with highlighted risks of serious rash including SJS/TEN/DRESS and a median onset around two weeks; this is a prime example where regional regulations, informed consent, and specialist oversight must guide practice, and where I must avoid implying U.S. pediatric approval [^111k2c1P] [^117TR1aT] [^1174rn2n] [^114Dir5k] [^115K4dZb].

> Let me consider mechanism now to ensure the clinical rationale is coherent. Modafinil's wake-promoting effect is DAT-dependent with inhibition of the dopamine transporter and associated increases in extracellular dopamine, alongside broader modulation of norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, histamine, and reductions in cortical GABA; unlike amphetamines, its profile is more selective centrally with fewer peripheral sympathomimetic effects, which helps explain utility in hypersomnolence and some fatigue states, while psychiatric activation and cardiovascular effects remain plausible risks that necessitate screening and follow-up [^113VtkGX] [^112MBSXF].

> I need to ensure practical dosing and monitoring are accurate. Typical adult dosing for narcolepsy and OSA-related residual sleepiness is 200 mg once daily, with SWD commonly dosed around work periods in clinical practice, and severe hepatic impairment warrants a 50% reduction; across OSA with residual sleepiness, meta-analyses and RCTs show improvements in ESS and MWT without replacing CPAP, but an increased risk of headache and typical stimulant-like adverse effects requires counseling and surveillance, and any emergent rash, angioedema, psychiatric symptoms, or cardiovascular complaints should prompt reevaluation or discontinuation [^116DVRoU] [^111aQK6Y] [^113bfZXY] [^1134LaoF] [^116PmjVH] [^115HpMgQ] [^111oeYnV] [^113x6jW1] [^115yjXwm] [^115mF9og]. Hold on, let me verify one more limitation so I do not omit a label-critical point: in OSA, modafinil treats residual sleepiness only after a maximal CPAP effort for an adequate period and must not be used as a substitute for airway therapy, which I have now reconfirmed [^115HpMgQ] [^114DnxKB].

> Stepping back, I will now synthesize a final hierarchy so the indication picture is clinically actionable. FDA-approved adult indications are narcolepsy, residual excessive sleepiness in OSA with adequate CPAP effort, and shift work disorder; off-label uses with more substantial signals include adjunctive treatment of bipolar depression-related depressive symptoms and fatigue, hypersomnia secondary to multiple sclerosis, PD-related excessive daytime sleepiness after excluding reversible causes, and post–traumatic brain injury excessive sleepiness, while emerging or limited evidence spans post-stroke fatigue, myotonic dystrophy somnolence, and select fatigue syndromes where replication and safety data are less robust; pediatric use remains non-approved in the U.S. with serious rash risk, and stimulant use disorder applications are guideline-conflicted and should be limited to specialized settings with careful risk–benefit analysis and monitoring [^115HpMgQ] [^114DnxKB] [^115jH3m9] [^114KZYQG] [^116Rrst5] [^112qLpkc] [^1136NNiJ] [^116VvT1N] [^116cKtxW].

## FDA-approved indications

Modafinil is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

- **Narcolepsy**: Improves wakefulness in adults with excessive sleepiness [^115HpMgQ].

- **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**: Treats residual excessive sleepiness in adults despite optimal CPAP or other standard therapy [^1125Ad1h]; it does not treat the airway obstruction, and maximal CPAP use should be maintained [^115HpMgQ] [^1134LaoF].

- **Shift work disorder (SWD)**: Improves wakefulness in adults with excessive sleepiness due to shift work [^115HpMgQ].

---

## Limitations of use

Key limitations of use: in OSA, modafinil treats excessive sleepiness only and **not the underlying obstruction**; maximal CPAP use should be maintained [^115HpMgQ] [^1125Ad1h]. In addition, modafinil is not approved for pediatric use [^1174rn2n].

---

## Off-label indications

Modafinil is sometimes used **off-label** for the following conditions, although evidence varies:

- **Multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue**: Considered for hypersomnia secondary to MS [^115jH3m9].

- **Parkinson's disease (PD)-related hypersomnia**: Considered for excessive daytime sleepiness in PD after excluding reversible causes [^114KZYQG].

- **Traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related hypersomnia**: May improve excessive daytime sleepiness after TBI [^116Rrst5].

- **Bipolar depression**: Adjunctive use may improve depressive symptoms and fatigue [^112qLpkc], but caution is required due to risk of mood destabilization [^112nW33B].

- **Cocaine use disorder**: May be considered to reduce cocaine use and improve treatment retention in the absence of comorbid alcohol use disorder [^116VvT1N].

### A systematic review of modafinil: Potential clinical uses and mechanisms of action [^114Bp3L3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Modafinil is a novel wake-promoting agent that has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and as adjunctive treatment of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. Modafinil has a novel mechanism and is theorized to work in a localized manner, utilizing hypocretin, histamine, epinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate. It is a well-tolerated medication with a low propensity for abuse and is frequently used for off-label indications. The objective of this study was to systematically review the available evidence supporting the clinical use of modafinil.

- **Data sources**: The search term "modafinil OR Provigil" was used on PubMed. Selected articles were mined for further potential sources of data. Abstracts from major scientific conferences were reviewed. Lastly, the manufacturer of modafinil in the United States was asked to provide all publications, abstracts, and unpublished data regarding studies of modafinil.

- **Data synthesis**: There have been 33 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of modafinil. Additionally, numerous smaller studies have been performed, and case reports of modafinil's use abound in the literature.

- **Conclusions**: Modafinil is a promising drug with a large potential for many uses in psychiatry and general medicine. Treating daytime sleepiness is complex, and determining the precise nature of the sleep disorder is vital. Modafinil may be an effective agent in many sleep conditions. At the time of writing, the strongest evidence among off-label uses exists for the use of modafinil in attention-deficit disorders.

### Stimulating meditation: A pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^1139WU9k]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). High credibility.

We show that it is possible to acutely increase state mindfulness using a pharmacological, rather than behavioural, strategy. The absence of differential strategy effects reported here suggests that future studies should employ more distinctive strategy instructions. Although we found no evidence for specific augmentation of mindfulness by modafinil, methodological improvements in future studies may allow such additive/synergistic effects to be detected. Translational studies that test these combined effects in "sub-clinical" participants (e.g. those with impaired attentional performance or low trait mindfulness) are likely to be particularly informative in determining whether MBIs can be supported pharmacologically with modafinil or similar drugs in clinical groups.

### A retrospective review of supratherapeutic modafinil exposures [^112MBSXF]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Modafinil (2-[(diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] acetamide) is a unique non-amphetamine wakefulness-promoting agent first marketed in France in the early 1990s for the treatment of excessive somnolence in patients with narcolepsy. It was subsequently approved in the United States in 1998 under the brand name Provigil® and is used for the treatment of various sleep disorders characterized by excessive sleepiness, including narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder. It has steadily gained popularity among prescribers due to its wakefulness-promoting efficacy, presumed lower potential for abuse, and lack of peripheral sympathomimetic effects commonly observed with amphetamine stimulants. As a result, it has been studied and used off-label to treat sedation and fatigue in neurological and medical conditions including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, HIV infection, cancer, and fibromyalgia. It has also shown promise in the treatment of cocaine dependence and withdrawal, alcoholic organic brain disorder, and in augmentation of antidepressant regimens.

Modafinil appears to have a complex mechanism of action that is not completely understood. It is known to cause an increase in extracellular concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, and histamine and to cause a decrease in extracellular gamma-aminobutyric acid in the neocortex. It has been shown to bind to and inhibit the dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter at clinically relevant doses, which may be responsible in part for its therapeutic effects.

### Stimulating meditation: A pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^111DY5e1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

In this pre-registered study, we used a parsimonious factorial design to examine the pharmacological effects of modafinil separately from the effects of a brief mindfulness training or induction, while also testing their combined effects on mindfulness-relevant outcomes. Across a variety of outcomes, we found no evidence of additive effects of modafinil and mindfulness training, as indicated by the lack of any drug × strategy interactions. However, we did find that increases in state mindfulness, which have been described in some previous studies of brief mindfulness training, can be mimicked using an acute pharmacological intervention. Specifically, a single dose of 200 mg modafinil caused a significant acute increase in state mindfulness prior to any behavioral training. Although this pre- to post-drug (T1–T2) effect of modafinil was small relative to the subsequent T2-to-T3 effect on state mindfulness (in both drug conditions), we attribute this to the brief mindfulness or relaxation strategy-training.

In addition, exploratory post-hoc analysis indicated that participants who received the single dose of modafinil in the lab session spent 53% more time practicing their assigned strategy outside of the lab during the following week, relative to those who received placebo. In line with previous research, we also found that modafinil improved participants' performance on sustained attention (PVT). Our findings on the effects of modafinil on affect, such as higher positive and negative affect relative to placebo at T2, are also broadly consistent with previous literature.

### Indication documentation and indication-based prescribing within electronic prescribing systems: A systematic review and narrative synthesis [^111A7T46]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2023). High credibility.

Despite recommendations, documentation of indication on prescriptions and inpatient medication orders is not routinely practiced. There has been a recent systematic review of indication documentation for antimicrobials, but not for interventions relating to indication documentation for medication more broadly. Our aims were to 1) identify, describe, and synthesize the literature relating to the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving indication documentation and/or indication-based prescribing in both primary and secondary healthcare; 2) synthesize participant perspectives to identify barriers and facilitators to these interventions; and 3) make recommendations for both practice and research.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, and CINAHL with two search concepts: electronic prescribing systems and indication documentation and/or indication-based prescribing. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies were included; outcome measures and results were extracted to produce a narrative synthesis. Quality appraisal by two independent reviewers was undertaken using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.

- **Results**: We identified 21 studies evaluating interventions to aid indication documentation. Indication documentation was either via free-text, selection from a list, or by use of pre-defined indication-based order sentences for individual medications. For a number of outcomes, there was a mostly positive impact, including appropriateness of the medication order (6 of 8 studies), rates of prescribing error (2/2), and similar metrics.

### Effects of modafinil and caffeine on night-time vigilance of air force crewmembers: A randomized controlled trial [^115FPggH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Mean tracking error suggests that there was no significant main effect of treatment (F(1.34, 33.49) = 0.86, p = 0.392). However, there was a significant main effect of the time of assessment on mean tracking error (F(2.24, 55.88) = 9.26, p < 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant interaction effect between time of assessment and treatment on mean tracking error (F(3.73, 93.14) = 3.42, p = 0.014), indicating that the treatment had varying effects on mean tracking error depending on the time of assessment.

Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that performance was less impaired with modafinil than with placebo during assessments at T = +6 and T = +8. No significant differences were found between caffeine and placebo.

- **PVT — 1/reaction time**: There was a significant main effect of treatment on 1/mean reaction time (F(2.00, 54.00) = 11.50, p < 0.001). Post-hoc tests indicated that 1/mean reaction time was significantly higher for both modafinil and caffeine than for placebo (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively).

- **Time of assessment**: A significant main effect of time was also observed on 1/mean reaction time (F(4.65, 125.54) = 44.86, p < 0.001). The interaction between time of assessment and treatment on 1/mean reaction time was significant (F(10.52, 284.02) = 9.73, p < 0.001), indicating different effects of treatment on 1/mean reaction time depending on the time of assessment.

Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that performance was less impaired with both caffeine and modafinil than with placebo during assessments at T = +2, T = +3, and T = +4.

### Neural substrates of impulsive decision making modulated by modafinil in alcohol-dependent patients [^1126vufP]. Psychological Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Impulsive decision-making is a hallmark of frequently occurring addiction disorders, including alcohol dependence (AD). Therefore, ameliorating impulsive decision-making is a promising target for the treatment of AD. Previous studies have shown that modafinil enhances cognitive control functions in various psychiatric disorders. However, the effects of modafinil on delay discounting and its underlying neural correlates have not yet been investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on neural correlates of impulsive decision-making in abstinent AD patients and healthy control (HC) subjects.

- **Method**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects crossover study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted in 14 AD patients and 16 HC subjects. All subjects participated in two fMRI sessions in which they either received a single dose of placebo or 200 mg of modafinil 2 hours before the session. During fMRI, subjects completed a delay-discounting task to measure impulsive decision-making.

- **Results**: Modafinil improved impulsive decision-making in AD patients, which was accompanied by enhanced recruitment of frontoparietal regions and reduced activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, modafinil-induced enhancement of functional connectivity between the superior frontal gyrus and ventral striatum was specifically associated with improvement in impulsive decision-making.

- **Conclusions**: These findings indicate that modafinil can improve impulsive decision-making in AD patients.

### Modafinil-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome [^114epRoW]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with DRESS syndrome often require hospitalization due to its association with a 10% mortality rate. The suspected causative medication should be withdrawn immediately. Treatment of mild cases involves supportive care with emollients, topical steroids, and fluid replacement. Managing DRESS syndrome with multi-organ involvement often necessitates initiating systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be tapered slowly over 4–6 weeks, as there is a risk of relapse with rapid tapering.

Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent initially approved for treating excessive somnolence associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder. Its exact mechanism is unclear, but it has been shown to inhibit γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurotransmission and increase dopamine in the brain by inhibiting dopamine transporters. Modafinil has also been used off-label for treating depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cancer-related fatigue, and prolonged encephalopathy in patients with traumatic brain injury or stroke.

According to clinical trial data of modafinil in 934 patients, the most commonly reported adverse effects were headache (34%), nausea (11%), nervousness (7%), rhinitis (7%), back pain (6%), and diarrhea (6%). A single case of DRESS syndrome was reported in a 15-year-old patient who began taking modafinil for ADHD during postmarket surveillance of the drug. Overall, few cases of severe cutaneous events have been reported with modafinil.

### Nuvigil [^114Dir5k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Serious dermatologic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis, have been associated with the use of NUVIGIL (armodafinil) or modafinil (the racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers). A serious rash requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment has been reported.

NUVIGIL has not been studied in pediatric patients in any setting and is not approved for use in pediatric patients for any indication. In clinical trials of modafinil, the incidence of rash resulting in discontinuation was approximately 0.8% (13 per 1,585) in pediatric patients (age < 17 years). These rashes included one case of possible Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and one case of apparent multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction/Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). Several cases were associated with fever and other abnormalities, such as vomiting and leukopenia. The median time to rash that resulted in discontinuation was 13 days. No such cases were observed among 380 pediatric patients who received a placebo.

Skin and mouth sores, blistering, and ulceration have been reported with modafinil and NUVIGIL in the postmarketing setting. Recurrence of signs and symptoms of serious dermatologic reactions following rechallenge has been reported in some cases. Rare cases of serious or life-threatening rash, including SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in adults and children in worldwide postmarketing experience with modafinil and NUVIGIL.

There are no identifiable factors, including the duration of therapy, that predict these serious reactions.

### Day case general anaesthesia in a patient with narcolepsy [^115y5fef]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

We report a patient suffering from narcolepsy who presented for day case gynecological surgery under general anesthesia. Her symptoms were normally well controlled using modafinil therapy, which she had omitted on the day of surgery. Modafinil is a unique drug that has the potential for many interactions with anesthetic agents; these are discussed in this report. Her anesthetic course was uneventful, and we review previous reports of patients suffering from narcolepsy undergoing anesthesia. We suggest that narcolepsy should not be a contraindication to day case surgery.

### Effects of modafinil and caffeine on night-time vigilance of air force crewmembers: A randomized controlled trial [^1171Kudg]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

The present study demonstrates that 200 mg modafinil and 300 mg caffeine significantly improve vigilance compared with placebo during an extended period of continuous wakefulness (mean 17.3 h), including the WOCL, without causing side effects. The most notable effects occurred in the early morning (between 4:00 and 6:00 AM), although PVT parameters improved as early as 2 h after administration. The increase in vigilance with both modafinil and caffeine was confirmed by the PVT, VigTrack, and SSS parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial to demonstrate the beneficial effects of these pharmaceutical agents after limited sleep deprivation.

Our findings are in line with the literature, although previous studies investigated the effects of caffeine and modafinil after longer periods of sustained wakefulness. Modafinil sustains flight performance and mood state during continuous wakefulness when tested during simulated or in-flight operations, while the results for caffeine were mixed and inconclusive in these studies. The effects of modafinil and caffeine appear almost simultaneously, despite their significantly different T max (30–120 min for caffeine and 2–4 h for modafinil). Performance was less impaired with both modafinil and caffeine than with placebo for all PVT parameters from 2 h after administration. Additionally, from T = +4, subjects had faster reaction times in the VigTrack test and lower SSS scores. This was followed by improvements in the remaining study parameters 6 h after administration.

### Provigil [^114cSom1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In adults, decreases in trough levels of modafinil have sometimes been observed after multiple weeks of dosing, suggesting auto-induction. However, the magnitude of the decreases and the inconsistency of their occurrence suggest that their clinical significance is minimal. Significant accumulation of modafinil sulfone has been observed after multiple doses due to its long elimination half-life of 40 hours. Auto-induction of metabolizing enzymes, most importantly cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4, has also been observed in vitro after incubation of primary cultures of human hepatocytes with modafinil and in vivo after extended administration of modafinil at 400 mg/day.

- **Specific populations**:

	- **Age**: A slight decrease (approximately 20%) in the oral clearance (CL/F) of modafinil was observed in a single-dose study at 200 mg in 12 subjects with a mean age of 63 years (range 53–72 years), but the change was considered not likely to be clinically significant. In a multiple-dose study (300 mg/day) in 12 patients with a mean age of 82 years (range 67–87 years), the mean levels of modafinil in plasma were approximately two times those historically obtained in matched younger subjects. Due to potential effects from the multiple concomitant medications with which most of the patients were being treated, the apparent difference in modafinil pharmacokinetics may not be attributable solely to the effects of aging. However, the results suggest that the clearance of modafinil may be reduced in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Provigil [^113VtkGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The mechanism(s) through which modafinil promotes wakefulness is unknown. Modafinil has wake-promoting actions similar to sympathomimetic agents, including amphetamine and methylphenidate, although its pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines.

Modafinil-induced wakefulness can be attenuated by the α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin; however, modafinil is inactive in other in vitro assay systems known to be responsive to α-adrenergic agonists, such as the rat vas deferens preparation.

Modafinil is not a direct- or indirect-acting dopamine receptor agonist. However, in vitro, modafinil binds to the dopamine transporter and inhibits dopamine reuptake. This activity has been associated in vivo with increased extracellular dopamine levels in some brain regions of animals. In genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT), modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent. However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of amphetamine, were not antagonized by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats. Additionally, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a dopamine synthesis inhibitor, blocks the action of amphetamine but does not block locomotor activity induced by modafinil.

In cats, equal wakefulness-promoting doses of methylphenidate and amphetamine increased neuronal activation throughout the brain. Modafinil, at an equivalent wakefulness-promoting dose, selectively and prominently increased neuronal activation in more discrete regions.

### Provigil [^114DnxKB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Provigil is not approved for use in children for any medical condition. It is not known if Provigil is safe or effective in children under 17 years of age.

Provigil is a prescription medicine used to improve wakefulness in adults who experience excessive sleepiness due to one of the following diagnosed sleep disorders:

- **Narcolepsy**: Provigil may assist individuals suffering from narcolepsy to remain awake during the day.
- **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**: Provigil is used to treat excessive sleepiness associated with OSA, but not the obstruction or underlying medical condition causing OSA. It is important to consult with your doctor about treatment options for OSA before starting and during treatment with Provigil. Provigil should not replace the treatments prescribed by your doctor for OSA; it is crucial to continue using these treatments as directed.
- **Shift work disorder (SWD)**: Provigil is beneficial in managing sleepiness related to SWD.

Provigil will not cure these sleep disorders. While it may help alleviate sleepiness caused by these conditions, it may not completely eliminate all sleepiness. Provigil does not replace the need for sufficient sleep. Follow your doctor's advice regarding good sleep habits and use other prescribed treatments.

Do not take Provigil if you are allergic or have previously developed a rash when taking modafinil, armodafinil (Nuvigil®), or any ingredients in Provigil.

### Provigil [^115mF9og]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Psychiatric symptoms**: Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with modafinil. In the adult Provigil controlled trials, psychiatric symptoms resulting in treatment discontinuation (at a frequency ≥ 0.3%) and reported more often in patients treated with Provigil compared to those treated with placebo were anxiety (1%), nervousness (1%), insomnia (< 1%), confusion (< 1%), agitation (< 1%), and depression (< 1%).

	- Postmarketing adverse reactions associated with the use of modafinil have included mania, delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and aggression, with some cases resulting in hospitalization. Many, but not all, patients had a prior psychiatric history. One healthy male volunteer developed ideas of reference, paranoid delusions, and auditory hallucinations in association with multiple daily 600 mg doses of Provigil (three times the recommended dose) and sleep deprivation. There was no evidence of psychosis 36 hours after drug discontinuation.

	- Caution should be exercised when Provigil is given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania. Consideration should be given to the possible emergence or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms in patients treated with Provigil. If psychiatric symptoms develop in association with Provigil administration, consider discontinuing Provigil.

- **Effects on ability to drive and use machinery**: Although Provigil has not been shown to produce functional impairment, any drug affecting the CNS may alter judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or machinery.

### Midas (modafinil in debilitating fatigue after stroke): A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial [^1136NNiJ]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

- **Trial results on the primary outcome**: The MIDAS trial demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in self-reported fatigue scores among patients randomized to modafinil during the trial period. The primary outcome, as assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), indicated substantial improvement.

Participants also experienced significant enhancement in quality of life, as reflected by the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL) measure. The difference in means between modafinil and placebo was 11.81 (95% CI, 2.31–21.31; P = 0.0148). Within the SSQoL domains, modafinil notably improved the following:

- **Self-reported energy**: Differences in means 1.37 (95% CI, 0.16–2.58; P = 0.0269)
- **Mobility**: Differences in means 2.07 (95% CI, 0.57–3.57; P = 0.0069)
- **Social roles**: Differences in means 1.66 (95% CI, 0.07–3.26; P = 0.0413)
- **Vision**: Differences in means 0.8 (95% CI, 0.11–1.49; P = 0.0234)
- **Thinking**: Differences in means 0.96 (95% CI, 0.09–1.83; P = 0.0314)

However, other SSQoL domains such as family, language, mood, personality, work, self-care, and upper extremity did not show significant improvement with modafinil therapy (P > 0.05).

### Adjunctive use of modafinil in bipolar patients: just another stimulant or not [^116nahwd]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Depression is much more common in the life course of people with bipolar disorder than mania or mixed states. Unfortunately, few established treatments are available, and new ones are needed. Modafinil is a novel stimulant approved for improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift-work sleep disorder. Given that bipolar depression is commonly associated with fatigue and somnolence, modafinil is a logical choice.

In one recent study of moderate size (n = 85), modafinil was shown to be more effective than a placebo in treating bipolar depression. The incidence of cycle induction in this trial was very low (lower than placebo), although isolated case reports of mania, hypomania, or mixed states have been reported. Given the limited options for bipolar depression, modafinil should be considered in patients who have not responded to approved treatments, although more research is needed.

### Comparison of diphenhydramine and modafinil on arousal and autonomic functions in healthy volunteers [^115wYNaY]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Arousal is regulated by the interplay between wakefulness- and sleep-promoting nuclei, with major contributions from the histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus (TMN) of the hypothalamus and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) of the pons, both of which also play roles in autonomic regulation. First-generation antihistamines, like diphenhydramine, are known to cause sedation by blocking excitatory H1 histamine receptors in the cerebral cortex. Conversely, the anti-narcolepsy drug modafinil is thought to promote wakefulness by activating the locus coeruleus.

This study compared the effects of single doses of diphenhydramine (75 mg) and modafinil (200 mg) on arousal and autonomic functions in 16 healthy male volunteers using a placebo-controlled, balanced, double-blind design. Arousal was assessed through critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF), visual analogy scales (VAS), and pupillary fatigue waves using the Pupillographic Sleepiness Test (PST). Autonomic functions measured included resting pupil diameter, light and darkness reflex responses, blood pressure, heart rate, and salivation. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with multiple comparisons.

Diphenhydramine exhibited sedative effects, as evidenced by reductions in CFFF and VAS alertness ratings, along with increases in pupillary fatigue indices. Modafinil demonstrated alerting effects, indicated by reductions in measures of pupillary fatigue. There was a decrease in pupil diameter following diphenhydramine administration and an increase after modafinil. Additionally, diphenhydramine reduced salivation, whereas modafinil increased systolic blood pressure. In conclusion

### Primary care physicians' use of FDA-approved prescription drug labels [^1121Lviu]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). High credibility.

In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration reorganized the approved label format and content for prescription drugs — also known as the prescribing information (PI). This research examines primary care physicians' use of the new PI and how it may influence their perceptions about prescription drugs.

- **Methods**: A total of 500 physicians responded to an Internet survey that displayed an interactive PI for a fictitious combination pain relief/heart attack-reducing drug. The physicians answered questions about perceived risk, perceived benefit, and intention to prescribe that focused on either the treatment indication or the prevention indication.

- **Results**: Physicians viewed PI sections in order, most often viewing sections relevant to safe use, such as Warnings and Precautions, and Dosage and Administration. When asked to think about the drug's efficacy, many viewed the Clinical Studies section. Viewing certain PI sections was associated with greater perceived risk and lower perceived benefits and intention to prescribe.

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that the information in the PI could affect physician decision-making and do not support further reorganization of the PI.

### Stimulating meditation: A pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^112Aqz8t]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Mindfulness meditation offers various benefits for well-being. However, individuals with primary attentional impairments (e.g. attention deficit disorder) or attentional symptoms secondary to anxiety, depression, or addiction may be less likely to benefit and may require additional mindfulness-augmenting strategies.

- **Aims**: To determine whether a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, acutely increases subjective and behavioural indices of mindfulness, and augments brief mindfulness training.

- **Methods**: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 (drug: placebo, modafinil) × 2 (strategy: mindfulness, relaxation control) experiment was conducted. Seventy-nine meditation-naïve participants were assigned to one of four groups: placebo–relaxation, placebo–mindfulness, modafinil–relaxation, or modafinil–mindfulness. Pre-drug, post-drug, and post-strategy state mindfulness, affect, and autonomic activity, along with post-strategy sustained attention and mind-wandering, were assessed within a single lab session. After the session, participants were instructed to practice their assigned behavioural strategy daily for one week, with no further drug administration, after which follow-up measures were taken.

- **Results**: As predicted, modafinil acutely increased state mindfulness and improved sustained attention. Differential acute strategy effects were found following mindfulness on autonomic activity but not state mindfulness. There were no strategy or drug effects on mind-wandering. However, exploratory analyses indicated that participants receiving modafinil engaged in more st

### Indication documentation and indication-based prescribing within electronic prescribing systems: A systematic review and narrative synthesis [^115v7cx9]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2023). Low credibility.

- **Barriers**: Practical workflow considerations were a concern for some participants, with long drop-down lists making selection difficult and risking mis-selection. Indication documentation was perceived as time-consuming and impractical, particularly if prescribers were expected to document indications for all medications. However, participants surveyed by Beardsley et al. reported that indication documentation was only a "minor nuisance" or "occasionally burdensome" and required only an extra 1–10 or 11–20 seconds, despite the intervention requiring a three-step process. In contrast, Beardsley et al. also reported that 21 of 60 participants provided "negative [free-text] comments relating to the additional time and/or lack of perceived benefit". However, this study scored low on MMAT due to insufficient information on its qualitative component.

Regarding indication documentation for the purpose of antimicrobial prescribing approval, Baysari et al. found that junior staff may be pressurized by senior staff to use workarounds to prescribe without approval. Additionally, prescribers were found to struggle to define and clarify indications, particularly junior doctors who frequently transcribe inpatient medication orders without necessarily knowing their indication.

Prescribers in two studies from Baysari et al. felt that the inaccuracy of indication documentation may be due to prescriber tendencies to prioritize dose and frequency over indication when selecting from a list, lack of monitoring of selected indications, and that lack of knowledge and workarounds could lead to poor information.

### Modafinil ameliorates excessive daytime sleepiness after traumatic brain injury [^116Rrst5]. Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and fatigue are common symptoms after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but there is no specific treatment for affected patients. With this pilot study, we aimed at studying the effect of daily modafinil on posttraumatic EDS and fatigue.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in 20 patients with TBI who had fatigue or EDS or both. After baseline examinations (questionnaires including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to assess EDS and the Fatigue Severity Scale to assess fatigue, actigraphy, polysomnography, maintenance of wakefulness test, and psychomotor vigilance test), 10 patients received 100 to 200 mg modafinil every morning, and 10 patients were treated with placebo. After a 6-week treatment period, all examinations were repeated.

- **Results**: EDS improved significantly in patients with TBI who were treated with modafinil, compared with the placebo group. Similarly, the ability to stay awake on the maintenance of wakefulness test improved only in the modafinil group. Modafinil, however, had no impact on posttraumatic fatigue. Clinically relevant side effects were not observed.

- **Conclusion**: This study indicates that modafinil is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of posttraumatic EDS but not of fatigue.

- **Classification of evidence**: This study provides Class I evidence that modafinil (100–200 mg daily) improves posttraumatic EDS compared with placebo. This study provides Class I evidence that modafinil (100–200 mg daily) does not improve posttraumatic fatigue.

### Modafinil reduces excessive somnolence and enhances mood in patients with myotonic dystrophy [^114d3Roe]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the potential of modafinil in reducing excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) and enhancing indexes of quality of life and mood in patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM), a study was conducted using a double-blind, cross-over design. Forty patients with DM were randomized to receive modafinil and placebo for 14 days each. Before and after each trial, subjects completed handgrip strength testing, spirometry, and quality-of-life measures (RAND). On days 7 and 14, each subject completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS).

- **Results**: ESS scores were lower while taking modafinil (mean 248 mm; 95% confidence limit 220 to 276 mm) compared with placebo (309 mm; 281 to 336 mm) (p < 0.001). Mean SSS scores were also lower during the modafinil trial (3.05; 2.77 to 3.33) than during the placebo trial (3.45; 3.18 to 3.71) (p < 0.05). The POMS indicated that modafinil decreased fatigue-inertia (p < 0.001) and increased vigor-activity and tension-anxiety (p < 0.001) indexes. The total mood disturbance score was also decreased during the modafinil trial compared with placebo (p < 0.05). The RAND quality-of-life measures of energy (p < 0.001) and health change (p < 0.05) were significantly enhanced during the modafinil treatment phase. No changes in maximal grip strength or forced expired volume in 1 second were detected over the course of the study.

Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event. Four patients withdrew from the study, three because of side effects (two during the modafinil treatment).

### Severe fatigue in inflammatory bowel disease: Dopaminergic therapy with modafinil or vitamin therapy with thiamine [^116A2T5U]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

We found Moulton et al.'s illustrative case series of 10 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic fatigue, all presenting with depression, particularly interesting. Among the patients, 8 previously underwent treatment with multiple psychotropic medications, and 2 had active IBD as indicated by increased fecal calprotectin levels. Remarkably, all 10 patients responded positively to open-label treatment with modafinil, a central nervous system stimulant that blocks dopamine reuptake transport, which resulted in an impressive improvement in their fatigue symptoms. At baseline, the self-reported mean fatigue score was 16, measured on the IBD Fatigue Assessment Scale (IBD-FAS), which ranges up to 20, with levels higher than 11 indicating severe fatigue. After 6 months of modafinil treatment, the mean fatigue score was 6.7.

### Modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders [^113rdoS7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

People with schizophrenia have a range of different symptoms, including positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal and lack of affect), and cognitive impairment. The standard medication for people with schizophrenia is antipsychotics; however, these medications may not be effective for all symptoms of schizophrenia, as cognitive and negative symptoms are usually hard to treat. Additional therapies or medications are available for the management of these symptoms. Modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent most frequently used in narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder, is one intervention that is theorized to have an effect on these symptoms.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of this review was to assess the effects of modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders.

- **Search methods**: On 27 April 2015, 24 May 2017, and 31 October 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials, which is based on regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for the inclusion of records in the register.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected all randomized controlled trials comparing modafinil with placebo or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently extracted data from the included studies. We analyzed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals.

### Modafinil improves daytime sleepiness in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea not using standard treatments: A randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial [^111Tittc]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) commonly suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has limited effectiveness in reducing sleepiness in milder OSA. Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug licensed to treat residual sleepiness in CPAP-treated OSA. We hypothesized that modafinil may effectively treat sleepiness in untreated mild to moderate OSA.

- **Methods**: Untreated, sleepy men with mild to moderate OSA (age 18–70, apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) 5–30/h, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) ≥ 10) were randomized to receive 200 mg modafinil or a matching placebo daily for 2 weeks before crossing over to the alternative treatment following a minimum 2-week washout. A mixed model analysis of variance was used to compare the changes on modafinil to placebo while classifying all randomized patients as random factors.

- **Results**: Thirty-two patients were randomized (mean (SD) AHI 13 (6.4)/h, age 47 (10.7) years, ESS 13.6 (3.3), body mass index 28.2 (3.6) kg/m²), 29 of whom (91%) completed the trial. The primary outcome (ESS) improved more on modafinil than placebo (3.6 points, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.8, p = 0.003), and the secondary outcome (40-min driving simulator performance) also improved more on modafinil than placebo (steering deviation 4.7 cm, 95% CI 0.8 to 8.5, p = 0.018). The Psychomotor Vigilance Task reciprocal reaction time improved significantly over placebo (0.15 (1/ms), 95% CI 0.03 to 0.27, p = 0.016). Improvements on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire were not significant (5.3 points over placebo, 95% CI -1 to 11.6, p = 0.093).

### Modafinil improves recovery after general anesthesia [^1135hGHy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Recovery from general anesthesia often involves residual sedation, drowsiness, fatigue, and lack of energy that may last from hours to days. Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting drug approved for patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. This study evaluated the effect of single doses of modafinil (200 mg) and placebo in patients recovering from general anesthesia.

Thirty-four subjects participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study approved by our IRB. Preoperatively, patients were asked to rate various symptoms they had experienced over the previous 24 hours using a verbal analog scale (VAS) of 0 to 10, as well as a discrete scale when indicated. Postoperatively, once the patient was able to tolerate oral intake and met our institutional discharge criteria, the study drug (modafinil 200 mg or placebo) was administered with a sip of water. Patients were contacted 24 hours after dosing to evaluate postdischarge symptoms.

Patients in the placebo group reported significantly more postoperative fatigue (4.8 [3.3] versus 1.4 [1.8]), exhaustion (4.3 [3.3] versus 2.4 [3.1]), and degree of feeling worn out (4.7 [3.6] versus 2.9 [2.4]). Significantly more patients reported moderate to severe fatigue in the placebo group (65% versus 12%). Two major themes of "alertness" and "energy" were expressed by 71% of the patients receiving modafinil versus 18% of those receiving placebo. Patients recovering from general anesthesia can significantly benefit from modafinil.

Modafinil significantly reduces fatigue and improves feelings of alertness and energy in patients recovering from general anesthesia.

### Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^1136UmR8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). High credibility.

Mindfulness meditation is increasingly used as a component of psychological treatments for various mental and physical health problems. Clinical trials of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated the strongest evidence for preventing depressive relapse, although MBIs also show promise for other indications.

In addition to clinical trials that have examined this typical, extended format of mindfulness training, single-session experimental studies of very brief training (single session 'mindfulness induction': typically ≤ 20 min) have been conducted in healthy volunteers. Although some studies have demonstrated immediate benefits of brief mindfulness training exercises on negative affect, such studies are typically mechanistic rather than aiming to establish clinical efficacy.

For example, studies of mindfulness inductions have examined the neurophysiological basis of mindful mental states and the association between such states, or their accompanying neurophysiological changes, and adaptive changes in affect, cognition, and behavior. Others have sought to identify active components of more comprehensive treatments by examining isolated mindfulness techniques. Given the brevity of these experimental mindfulness trainings/inductions, it is perhaps unsurprising that the observed effects are typically small (d ≈ 0.2) and short-lived. Despite this, such experimental studies are potentially highly informative in identifying characteristics of participants who might show early treatment gains during a comprehensive/extended mindfulness intervention.

### A method for deciding about the possible safety of modafinil and armodafinil in patients with seizure disorder [^115Y7qFC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Modafinil or armodafinil (ar/mod) may be considered for patients with approved or unapproved indications, including excessive daytime drowsiness, fatigue, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or addictions. Ar/mod is classified as a psychostimulant, and psychostimulants have been associated with a small risk of seizures. There is no guidance about the use of ar/mod in patients who are at risk of seizures. This article suggests how a physician may explore the safety of ar/mod if indicated in a patient at such risk.

In summary, reading the prescribing information, writing to the drug manufacturer, and searching research databases suggest the following:

- **Ar/mod and its metabolites and derivatives have dose-dependent anticonvulsant action in animal models**;
- **Ar/mod is not associated with seizures as an adverse event in populations at risk, such as those with ADHD, head injury, and brain tumors**;
- **Ar/mod is not associated with worsening of seizure disorder in patients with seizure disorder**;
- **Ar/mod is not associated with seizures in overdose**.

These findings are reassuring. However, not all the data are of high quality, and potential ar/mod interactions with antiepileptic drugs (and other medications that affect the seizure threshold) need to be considered because ar/mod can induce the metabolism of some drugs and inhibit the metabolism of others. Decisions should be individualized, and decision-making should be a shared effort between patient and physician.

### Absence of mood switch with and tolerance to modafinil: A replication study from a large private practice [^112qkWM7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Fatigue is a common symptom of depression, especially the bipolar type. Modafinil, a wake-promoting agent, can alleviate fatigue in depressed patients. Many stimulants used to treat fatigue carry the risk of inducing mania or hypomania in bipolar patients, as well as a risk for tolerance or abuse.

- **Method**: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients currently being seen in a large outpatient practice who received modafinil during their treatment. Data collected included patient demographics, MiniSCID diagnoses, clinical diagnoses including history of substance abuse, and length and dosage of treatment with modafinil.

- **Results**: Of the 191 patients who were given modafinil at some point during their treatment, 105 patients remained on it for two months or more, with 37% of these patients being bipolar (18 BPI and 21 BPII). Additionally, 86 patients were on modafinil for less than two months, with 31% being bipolar (16% BPI and 15% BPII). No patients in any group demonstrated a switch into mania or hypomania while on modafinil. There was no significant difference in final modafinil dosage between patients who had a positive history of chemical abuse/dependence (290 mg/day) and those who did not (258 mg/day).

- **Limitations**: Retrospective chart review.

- **Conclusions**: Adult affective disorder patients, whether unipolar or bipolar, can use modafinil to relieve symptoms of depression, including fatigue and sleepiness, without risking a switch in their mood or developing tolerance or abuse of this medication.

### Indirect treatment comparison of solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil for excessive daytime sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea [^112zNuAt]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea affects 9%-22% of continuous positive airway pressure-treated patients. An indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of medications (solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil) approved to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

- **Methods**: Efficacy and safety measures assessed in this indirect treatment comparison included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), 20-minute Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT20), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (any, serious, or leading to discontinuation).

- **Results**: A systematic literature review identified six parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials that randomized 1,714 total participants to placebo, solriamfetol, modafinil, or armodafinil. In this indirect treatment comparison, all comparators were associated with greater improvements than placebo on the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Relative to comparators and placebo at 12 weeks, solriamfetol at 150mg or 300mg had the highest probabilities of improvement in the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C. Modafinil (200 or 400mg) and solriamfetol (150 or 300mg) were associated with greater improvement on the FOSQ than placebo at 12 weeks. Less than 2% of patients using placebo or comparators experienced serious or discontinuation-related treatment-emergent adverse events.

### Stimulating meditation: A pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^1151QaEn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). High credibility.

Mindfulness meditation has a variety of benefits on well-being. However, individuals with primary attentional impairments, such as attention deficit disorder, or attentional symptoms secondary to anxiety, depression, or addiction, may be less likely to benefit and require additional mindfulness-augmenting strategies.

- **Aims**: To determine whether a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, acutely increases subjective and behavioral indices of mindfulness and augments brief mindfulness training.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 (drug: placebo, modafinil) × 2 (strategy: mindfulness, relaxation control) experiment was conducted. Seventy-nine meditation-naïve participants were assigned to: placebo-relaxation, placebo-mindfulness, modafinil-relaxation, or modafinil-mindfulness. Pre-drug, post-drug, and post-strategy state mindfulness, affect, and autonomic activity, along with post-strategy sustained attention and mind-wandering, were assessed within a single lab session. After the session, participants were instructed to practice their assigned behavioral strategy daily for one week, with no further drug administration, after which follow-up measures were taken.

- **Results**: As predicted, modafinil acutely increased state mindfulness and improved sustained attention. Differential acute strategy effects were found following mindfulness on autonomic activity but not state mindfulness. There were no strategy or drug effects on mind-wandering. However, exploratory analyses indicated that participants receiving modafinil engaged in more strategy.

### Modafinil as adjunct therapy for daytime sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea [^116PmjVH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2001). High credibility.

Patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome can experience residual daytime sleepiness despite regular use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study assessed the efficacy and safety of modafinil for the treatment of residual daytime sleepiness in such patients. Patients received modafinil (n = 77) (200 mg/d, Week 1; 400 mg/d, Weeks 2 to 4) or matching placebo (n = 80) once daily for 4 weeks. Modafinil significantly improved daytime sleepiness, with significantly greater mean changes from baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores at Weeks 1 and 4 (p < 0.001) and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test scores at Week 4 (p = 0.001) compared to placebo.

- **Adverse events**: Modafinil was associated with certain adverse events. Headache was reported in 23% of modafinil-treated patients compared to 11% of those receiving placebo (p = 0.044). Nervousness was reported in 12% of modafinil-treated patients compared to 3% of the placebo group (p = 0.024).

During modafinil or placebo treatment, the mean duration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) use was 6.2 hours per night, with no significant change from baseline observed between groups. Modafinil may be a useful adjunct treatment for the management of residual daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome who are regular users of nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy.

### Effects of modafinil and caffeine on night-time vigilance of air force crewmembers: A randomized controlled trial [^111Ss8UL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Regulations limiting flight times and suggesting optimal rosters have been implemented by aviation authorities. Although these cannot completely prevent fatigue, they provide a framework to manage it. The introduction of these regulations in the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) is complicated by the variety of aircraft available and the types of operations performed. Additionally, there is the possibility of deviating from these regulations in the case of operational necessity. These circumstances make it impossible to solely rely on these regulations to manage fatigue and its associated risks. Other countermeasures are therefore needed to enhance the fitness of pilots to fly under these circumstances. Currently, the RNLAF allows its pilots to use certain hypnotics to get sufficient sleep prior to flight operations.

Depending on the scenario, an alternative option is to prescribe stimulants, which are medications that increase vigilance and reduce fatigue. Although caffeine is widely available, both in pills and beverages, aircrew members have reported that caffeine supplements are ineffective, possibly due to the high daily caffeine consumption of many. Additionally, caffeine has a relatively short half-life of 4–6 hours, which might be less favorable when longer periods of vigilance are needed, for example, during long night-time operations.

Modafinil is a relatively new wakefulness-promoting drug that has been approved as an agent to counter fatigue by the air forces of Singapore, the United States, India, and France. Although its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, it has shown efficacy in enhancing vigilance and combating fatigue in operational settings.

### Effects of modafinil and caffeine on night-time vigilance of air force crewmembers: A randomized controlled trial [^116BZM3m]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

There was a significant main effect of treatment on the number of lapses (F(2, 54) = 14.15, p < 0.001). Post-hoc tests revealed that the number of lapses was significantly lower for both modafinil and caffeine than for placebo (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively).

There was a significant main effect of the time of assessment on the number of lapses (F(3.83, 131.35) = 28.53, p < 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant interaction effect between the time of assessment and treatment on the number of lapses (F(9.49, 256.15) = 7.13, p < 0.001), indicating that the treatment had different effects on the number of lapses depending on the time of assessment.

Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that performance was less impaired with caffeine than with placebo during assessments at T = +2, T = +3, T = +4, T = +6, and T = +8. Performance was less impaired with modafinil than with placebo during assessments at T = +2, T = +3, T = +4, T = +6, and T = +8. Additionally, performance was significantly less impaired with modafinil than with caffeine during assessment at T = +8.

- **Sss**: The Friedman test showed that SSS scores significantly differed between the treatments during assessments at T = +4 (χ²(2) = 10.63, p = 0.005), T = +6 (χ²(2) = 9.31, p = 0.009), and T = +8 (χ²(2) = 11.08, p = 0.004). To investigate where the differences occurred, separate Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs analysis revealed significantly lower SSS scores for modafinil than for placebo during assessments at T = +4, T = +6, and T = +8.

### Use of stimulants in bipolar disorder [^112nW33B]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Several international guidelines indicate stimulants, including methylphenidate (MPH), amphetamines and their derivatives, modafinil, and armodafinil, as second- to third-line choices for bipolar depression. The efficacy of stimulants has also been reported for managing residual depressive symptoms, such as fatigue and sleepiness, as well as for managing affective, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms in children and adult bipolar patients with comorbid ADHD. Few case reports show positive results with MPH in treating resistant mania. Additionally, MPH might be an option in some bipolar forms observed in psychiatric presentations of frontotemporal dementia and traumatic brain injury.

Despite these preliminary observations, the use of stimulants in bipolar patients remains controversial. Concerns most frequently reported include the potential for misuse and abuse, mood destabilization with induction of (hypo)manic switches, mixed states, and rapid cycling. Our aims are to summarize available literature on this topic and discuss practical management implications.

### Effect of wakefulness-promoting agents on sleepiness in patients with sleep apnea treated with CPAP: A meta-analysis [^1134LaoF]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The study aimed to perform a meta-analysis on the effect of wakefulness-promoting agents, specifically modafinil and armodafinil, in patients experiencing residual sleepiness after undergoing CPAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea.

We carried out a systematic search using MEDLINE (from 1966 to September 2014), EMBASE (from 1980 to September 2014), and the Cochrane Database, targeting randomized placebo-controlled trials involving modafinil or armodafinil. The participants met established diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea and utilized continuous positive airway pressure appropriately, yet reported ongoing residual sleepiness. We also assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and the mean sleep latencies on the maintenance of wakefulness test. Secondary outcomes included the Clinical Global Impression of Change, changes in daily continuous positive airway pressure usage, and the incidence of headaches.

After screening 118 abstracts and reviewing 12 full-text articles, 6 studies were included in the final meta-analysis, totaling 1,479 participants: three studies evaluated modafinil and three assessed armodafinil. Risk of bias was unclear in at least one key domain for four studies. Compared to placebo, wakefulness-promoting agents reduced the Epworth Sleepiness Scale by 2.51 points (95% CI, 2.00–3.02), increased sleep latency on the maintenance of wakefulness test by 2.73 minutes (95% CI, 2.12–3.34), and showed a 26% increase in reporting minimal improvement on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (RR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.36–1.86). However, they also increased the risk of headaches by 8% (RR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.48–2.63).

### Superior chronic tolerability of adjunctive modafinil compared to pramipexole in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder [^116qm9oZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Suboptimal outcomes are common in bipolar disorder (BD) pharmacotherapy and may be mitigated with novel adjunctive agents such as modafinil, a low-affinity dopamine transport inhibitor, and pramipexole, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist. While uncontrolled long-term effectiveness data have been reported for these treatments, reports specifically assessing their comparative acute versus chronic tolerability in BD are lacking. Such information, particularly in relation to discontinuation causes, has substantial relevance, providing initial indications to clinicians about which treatment may be better tolerated and to researchers about which agent ought to be assessed in longer-term controlled trials.

- **Methods**: BD outpatients assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) Affective Disorders Evaluation and followed with the STEP-BD Clinical Monitoring Form were naturalistically prescribed adjunctive modafinil or pramipexole. Somatic/psychiatric intolerability discontinuation rates were compared.

- **Results**: Among 63 BD outpatients (mean ± SD age 43.5 ± 14.3 years, 60.3% female, 42.9% type I, 44.4% type II, 12.7% type not otherwise specified) taking 3.5 ± 1.5 (median 3) prescription psychotropics, adjunctive modafinil (n = 24) for 626.9 ± 863.9 (286) days versus pramipexole (n = 39) for 473.7 ± 613.4 (214; p = 0.51) days yielded a 26.0% lower somatic/psychiatric intolerability discontinuation rate (12.5% vs. 38.5%; p < 0.05), with most of the difference accounted for by more pramipexole somatic intolerability discontinuation.

### Effects of modafinil and caffeine on night-time vigilance of air force crewmembers: A randomized controlled trial [^116iD95w]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

The Vigilance and Tracking test (VigTrack) is a dual-task designed to measure vigilance performance under the continuous load of a compensatory tracking task. This test, utilized in various studies, is known for its sensitivity in measuring vigilance and alertness. During the tracking portion of the task, participants are required to steer a blue dot using a joystick, keeping it below a red dot in the center of the display. The blue dot is programmed to move continuously from the display's center. While tracking, participants must also perform a vigilance task where a black square alternates with a diamond inside the red dot at one-second intervals. At random moments, a hexagon appears, prompting participants to press an additional key on the joystick. This test lasts 10 minutes, with primary endpoints including root mean square tracking error, percentage omissions, and mean reaction time.

The psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) evaluates the speed at which subjects respond to a red stimulus and is used to assess subject vigilance. The interstimulus interval, or the time between the last response and the appearance of the next stimulus, varies randomly between 2 to 10 seconds. This test also lasts 10 minutes, with primary endpoints including reciprocal (1/mean) reaction time and lapses, where lapses (errors of omission) are defined as reaction times of 500 ms or greater.

To minimize practice bias during actual measurements, a familiarization session lasting 5 minutes per task was scheduled for all subjects at the start of each trial day.

### Provigil [^115K4dZb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Serious rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome**: Serious rash requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment has been reported in association with the use of modafinil. In clinical trials of modafinil, the incidence of rash resulting in discontinuation was approximately 0.8% (13 per 1,585) in pediatric patients (age < 17 years); these rashes included one case of possible Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and one case of apparent multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction. Several of the cases were associated with fever and other abnormalities (e.g. vomiting, leukopenia). The median time to rash that resulted in discontinuation was 13 days. No such cases were observed among 380 pediatric patients who received a placebo.

Rare cases of serious or life-threatening rash, including SJS, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have been reported in adults and children in worldwide postmarketing experience. The reporting rate of TEN and SJS associated with modafinil use, which is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting, exceeds the background incidence rate. Estimates of the background incidence rate for these serious skin reactions in the general population range between 1 to 2 cases per million-person years.

There are no factors that are known to predict the risk of occurrence or the severity of rash associated with Provigil.

### Effects of the atypical stimulant modafinil on a brief gambling episode in pathological gamblers with high vs. low impulsivity [^115NpojU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Pathological gambling (PG) is a serious psychiatric disorder afflicting 1–3% of the general population. Experimental evidence indicates shared neurochemical substrates for PG and psychostimulant addiction. Impulsivity characterizes one key subtype of PG; therefore, medications that ameliorate psychostimulant addiction and impulsive syndromes might also benefit impulsive PG subjects. The atypical stimulant, modafinil, reduces cocaine abuse and impulsivity in patients with ADHD.

The present study sought to determine if modafinil (200 mg) would reduce the reinforcing effects of slot machine gambling in PG subjects, and if this effect was stronger in high (H-I) vs. low (L-I) impulsivity subjects (N = 20). A placebo-controlled, double-blind, counterbalanced, repeated measures design was employed. Apart from bet size, which declined uniformly in both groups under the drug, modafinil had bi-directional effects in the two groups. In H-I subjects, the drug decreased the desire to gamble, salience of gambling words, disinhibition, and risky decision-making. In L-I subjects, modafinil increased scores on these indices. Modafinil also differentially affected blood pressure response to the game in the two groups.

These findings for modafinil appear to fit well with a growing literature demonstrating bi-directional effects of D2 agonists as a function of trait impulsivity. Impulsivity could critically moderate medication response in PG.

- **Angioedema and anaphylaxis reactions**: Angioedema and hypersensitivity (with rash, dysphagia, and bronchospasm) were observed in patients treated with armodafinil, the R enantiomer of modafinil (which is the racemic mixture). No such cases were observed in modafinil clinical trials; however, angioedema has been reported in postmarketing experience with modafinil. Patients should be advised to discontinue therapy and immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema or anaphylaxis, such as swelling of the face, eyes, lips, tongue, or larynx; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; and hoarseness.

- **Multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions**: Multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions, including at least one fatality in postmarketing experience, have occurred in close temporal association (median time to detection 13 days: range 4–33 days) with the initiation of modafinil. Although a limited number of reports exist, multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions may result in hospitalization or be life-threatening. There are no factors known to predict the risk of occurrence or severity of these reactions. Signs and symptoms were diverse; typically, patients presented with fever and rash associated with other organ system involvement. Other associated manifestations included myocarditis, hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, hematological abnormalities (e.g. eosinophilia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), pruritus, and asthenia.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive modafinil treatment on residual excessive daytime sleepiness among nasal continuous positive airway pressure-treated Japanese patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: a double-blind placebo-controlled study [^111fcvKS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of modafinil for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in Japanese patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

- **Methods**: Patients with residual excessive sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] ≥ 11) on optimal nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy (apnea-hypopnea index ≤ 10) were randomized to either 200 mg modafinil (n = 52) or placebo (n = 62) once daily for 4 weeks. Outcomes included baseline-week 4 changes in ESS total score, sleep latency on maintenance of wakefulness test (SL-MWT), nocturnal polysomnography, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and safety.

- **Results**: All 114 randomized patients completed the study. Mean change in ESS total score was -6.6 for modafinil and -2.4 for placebo (p < 0.001). ESS decreased from ≥ 11 to < 11 at the final assessment in 69.2% of modafinil-treated patients and 30.6% of placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). Corresponding rates at week 1 were 57.7% and 33.9%, respectively (p = 0.014). Changes in nocturnal polysomnography, PSQI, and apnea-hypopnea index from baseline to the final assessment were similar in both groups. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 36.5% and 22.6% of patients in the modafinil and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.146).

- **Conclusions**: Once-daily modafinil was effective and well tolerated for managing residual daytime sleepiness in Japanese OSAS patients with residual excessive daytime sleepiness on optimal nCPAP therapy.

### Stimulating meditation: A pre-registered randomised controlled experiment combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief mindfulness training [^116vmqKo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). High credibility.

- **Expectancy, credibility, and within-session strategy compliance**: As expected for closely matched strategies, average credibility ratings for relaxation (mean ± SD: 6.21 ± 1.53) and mindfulness (6.54 ± 1.23) were not significantly different (t(77) = 1.050, p = 0.297). Similarly, expectancy was similar for relaxation (5.79 ± 1.45) and mindfulness (6.10 ± 1.45; t(77) = 0.935, p = 0.353). Compliance did not differ between relaxation (6.03 ± 1.06) and mindfulness (6.08 ± 1.05) strategies (t(77) = 0.208, p = 0.836).

- **Blinding and subjective drug effects**: Twenty-eight participants (of n = 39) in the placebo groups correctly guessed their treatment (72%); in the modafinil group 17/40 (43%) guessed correctly (χ²(1, n = 79) = 1.764, p = 0.184). Researchers guessed at chance levels for placebo (59% correct) and modafinil (50% correct; χ²(1, n = 79) = 0.641, p = 0.423). Overall, this indicated that double blinding was preserved, although participants in the modafinil groups did indicate higher ratings on the 'feel' item of the DEQ (p [FDR-adjusted] = 0.035).

### Effects of modafinil and caffeine on night-time vigilance of air force crewmembers: A randomized controlled trial [^113x54En]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

In 2010, for the first time in an air crash investigation, a recording of snoring was identified on a cockpit voice recorder. This cockpit voice recorder belonged to Air India Express Flight 812, which crashed, killing 158 of the 166 persons onboard. The recording indicated that the captain had been asleep for more than 90 minutes of the 2-hour flight. Residual sleepiness and impaired judgment were identified as contributing factors in this accident. The captain's fatigue was suggested to be due to flying during the Window of Circadian Low (WOCL), the period of the circadian cycle when fatigue and sleepiness are greatest and people are least able to perform mental or physical work.

This is not an isolated instance of an aviation accident being attributed to fatigue. In the last two decades, fatigue has been identified as the probable cause of 21–24% of major aviation accidents, both in civil and military aviation.

As stated in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) definition of fatigue, it can impair one's performance: "A physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss, extended wakefulness, circadian phase, and/or workload (mental and/or physical activity) that can impair a person's alertness and ability to perform safety-related operational duties".

This definition identifies several possible causes of fatigue, with sleep loss probably being the most notable. The optimal method of avoiding fatigue is to have sufficient night-time sleep. However, this is often difficult to achieve.

### A placebo-controlled evaluation of adjunctive modafinil in the treatment of bipolar depression [^112qLpkc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Modafinil is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift-work sleep disorder. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive modafinil in bipolar depression, which is often characterized by excessive sleepiness and fatigue.

- **Method**: Eighty-five patients with bipolar depression that was inadequately responsive to a mood stabilizer, with or without concomitant antidepressant therapy, were randomly assigned to receive adjunctive modafinil (N = 41) or placebo (N = 44) for 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the baseline-to-endpoint change in score on the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms — Clinician Rated (IDS).

- **Results**: The baseline-to-endpoint change in IDS score was significantly greater in the modafinil group (mean dose, 177 mg/day) compared with the placebo group. Improvement in depressive symptoms was significantly greater in the modafinil group by week 2, and this greater improvement was maintained at weeks 4, 5, and 6. Both the response and remission rates were significantly higher in the modafinil group (44% and 39%) compared with the placebo group (23% and 18%). During the 6-week study period, there was no difference between groups in treatment-emergent hypomania or mania (six patients in the modafinil group and five in the placebo group) or hospitalization for mania (one in each group).

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that adjunctive modafinil at doses of 100–200 mg a day may improve depressive symptoms.
