## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which process regenerates NAD+ when oxygen becomes unavailable, allowing respiration to continue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core metabolic constraint: why NAD+ regeneration matters when oxygen is absent. Then, I should verify which pathways actually regenerate NAD+ under anoxic conditions. Next, I will examine each option (glycolysis, chemiosmosis, fermentation, Calvin cycle) and check whether it fulfills the NAD+ regeneration role in the absence of oxygen. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and confirm the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the metabolic constraint. Glycolysis consumes NAD+ at the GAPDH step and must regenerate NAD+ to keep glycolysis running; under aerobic conditions, the mitochondrial electron transport chain reoxidizes NADH to NAD+, but when oxygen is unavailable, the ETC cannot fulfill that role, so cells need an alternative NAD+ regeneration mechanism to sustain glycolytic ATP production and avoid NADH accumulation [^a72e0a67] [^506b3aad].

> Now, I will examine glycolysis itself. Wait, let me verify whether glycolysis regenerates NAD+. Glycolysis is redox-neutral overall; it consumes NAD+ at GAPDH and regenerates NAD+ when pyruvate is reduced to lactate, so the net NAD+ balance depends on the downstream step, not glycolysis per se. Therefore, glycolysis alone does not regenerate NAD+; it requires a coupled NADH-reoxidizing step, which in hypoxia is typically fermentation, to restore NAD+ and sustain glycolysis [^a72e0a67] [^506b3aad].

> Next, I should review chemiosmosis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: chemiosmosis refers to the proton-motive force–driven ATP synthesis at the inner mitochondrial membrane, which requires a functional electron transport chain and thus depends on oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. In the absence of oxygen, the ETC stalls and chemiosmosis cannot regenerate NAD+, so this option is incorrect for anoxic NAD+ regeneration [^fc1db4b5].

> I will now examine fermentation. Fermentation encompasses pathways that reoxidize NADH to NAD+ by reducing organic acceptors such as pyruvate to lactate or acetaldehyde to ethanol, thereby regenerating NAD+ independently of oxygen. This is precisely the mechanism that allows glycolysis to continue when the ETC is inactive, making fermentation the correct answer here [^a72e0a67] [^506b3aad].

> Let me consider the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle is a carbon fixation pathway in photosynthesis that consumes ATP and NADPH; it does not regenerate NAD+ and is not involved in maintaining glycolytic flux under anoxia, so this option is irrelevant to the question of NAD+ regeneration in the absence of oxygen [^3aab40bd].

> But wait, what if the question is trying to trick me by implying that glycolysis "allows respiration to continue" by sustaining ATP when the ETC is off? Hmm, wait a minute, that would conflate glycolysis with respiration; respiration strictly requires oxygen and the ETC, whereas glycolysis is anaerobic and fermentation is the anoxic mechanism that keeps glycolysis going by regenerating NAD+. So the accurate answer remains fermentation, not glycolysis itself [^a72e0a67] [^506b3aad].

> Final answer: C. Fermentation, because it regenerates NAD+ from NADH when oxygen is unavailable, enabling glycolysis to continue and thereby maintaining ATP production in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation [^a72e0a67] [^506b3aad].

---

The correct answer is **C. Fermentation**. When oxygen is unavailable, fermentation regenerates NAD+ by oxidizing NADH to NAD+ (e.g. pyruvate to lactate or acetaldehyde to ethanol), which allows glycolysis to continue producing ATP and maintains cellular respiration in anaerobic conditions [^a72e0a67] [^506b3aad]. Glycolysis does not regenerate NAD+ on its own, chemiosmosis requires oxygen, and the Calvin cycle is a photosynthetic pathway unrelated to NAD+ regeneration in respiration [^a72e0a67] [^fc1db4b5] [^3aab40bd].

---

## Metabolic role of NAD+ in cellular respiration

NAD+ is a **critical coenzyme** in cellular respiration, accepting electrons during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to become NADH. NADH then donates electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) to drive ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation [^fc1db4b5]. This cycle requires continuous NAD+ regeneration to sustain metabolic flux and ATP production [^a72e0a67].

---

## Consequences of oxygen unavailability on NAD+ regeneration

Under aerobic conditions, the ETC regenerates NAD+ by oxidizing NADH back to NAD+ [^fc1db4b5]. When oxygen is unavailable, the ETC halts, causing NADH to accumulate and **NAD+ to decline**, which would stall glycolysis and ATP production without an alternative NAD+ regeneration mechanism [^a72e0a67].

---

## Fermentation: the primary process regenerating NAD+ in the absence of oxygen

Fermentation regenerates NAD+ by oxidizing NADH to NAD+ via reduction of organic substrates, such as pyruvate to lactate or acetaldehyde to ethanol, thereby **maintaining glycolysis and ATP production** without oxygen [^a72e0a67] [^506b3aad]. Common examples include lactic acid fermentation in animals and some bacteria, and alcoholic fermentation in yeast [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of alternative options

| **Option** | **Process description** | **Relevance to nad+ regeneration** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Glycolysis | Breaks glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP and NADH | Does not regenerate NAD+; requires NAD+ and produces NADH [^a72e0a67] |
| B. Chemiosmosis | ATP synthesis driven by proton gradient across membranes | Requires oxygen and functional ETC; does not regenerate NAD+ [^fc1db4b5] |
| D. Calvin cycle | Photosynthetic carbon fixation cycle | Not involved in NAD+ regeneration in cellular respiration [^3aab40bd] |

---

## Conclusion

Fermentation is the **primary process** that regenerates NAD+ when oxygen is unavailable, enabling glycolysis and ATP production to continue in anaerobic conditions [^a72e0a67] [^506b3aad]. Glycolysis does not regenerate NAD+, chemiosmosis requires oxygen, and the Calvin cycle is unrelated to respiration.

The CORE cycle could enable synthetic autotrophy and enhance photosynthesis

Having demonstrated a functional CORE cycle in vivo, we finally analyzed its potential in improving or replacing natural CO 2 fixation (Fig. 1C, D). Using flux balance analysis, we first evaluated the CORE cycle in combination with the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle of photosynthesis. The CORE cycle can replace (or supplement) natural photorespiration,– and circumvent the wasteful decarboxylation of glycine by providing an alternative route to methylene-THF (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig. 26). This converts photorespiration into a process that assimilates CO 2 rather than releasing it, thus doubling its carbon efficiency from 75% to 150%. In terms of energetic efficiency, the CORE cycle requires 27% less ATP and 16% fewer reducing equivalents compared to native photorespiration and outperforms it by 25% in terms of 3PG yield (Supplementary Fig. 27, Supplementary Table 8).

We also assessed the CORE cycle as a CO 2 -fixation pathway for synthetic autotrophy. for which we combined the CORE cycle with different downstream formate-assimilation pathways. We modelled CO 2 -fixation efficiency of the CORE cycle in combination with the serine cycle, the reductive glycine pathway, the formolase pathway, and the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle. This showed that all CORE cycle-based pathways outperformed the CBB cycle in terms of biomass yield (when considering RuBisCO oxygenation, Supplementary Fig. 28). Overall, these results showcase the flexibility of an oxygen-tolerant reduction-first strategy to support or replace natural CO 2 fixation pathways.

### Augmenting the calvin-benson-bassham cycle by a synthetic malyl-CoA-glycerate carbon fixation pathway [^8998a484]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-dependent CBB cycle is the most prevalent CO 2 assimilation mechanism on Earth. The CBB cycle fixes atmospheric CO 2 into a C3 metabolite, which serves as a precursor for all cellular constituents and most of the reduced carbon on Earth. However, the CBB cycle has its limitations. First, the CBB cycle is presumably evolved for optimal synthesis of C3 compound, but not for the production of acetyl-CoA, the C2 building block (Supplementary Table 1). When 3−phosphoglycerate (C3), the product of the CBB cycle, is converted to acetyl-CoA, one fixed carbon is lost as CO 2 (Supplementary Fig. 1 a). Second, the oxygenation reaction of Rubisco causes carbon loss during metabolism of its side product, 2-phosphoglycolate. Improvement of Rubisco specificity has been challenging, and no natural pathway is practically feasible to convert the photorespiration intermediates, such as glycolate or glyoxylate, into acetyl-CoA without carbon loss. Furthermore, the CBB cycle involves significant ATP consumption for CO 2 fixation (Supplementary Table 1). Since acetyl-CoA is one of the central precursor molecules involved in biosynthesis of numerous products –, its inefficient synthesis from the CBB cycle limits the maximum carbon yield of photosynthetic products and presents a major challenge for the development of bio-based economy.

### Augmenting the calvin-benson-bassham cycle by a synthetic malyl-CoA-glycerate carbon fixation pathway [^93f34ba8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle is presumably evolved for optimal synthesis of C3 sugars, but not for the production of C2 metabolite acetyl-CoA. The carbon loss in producing acetyl-CoA from decarboxylation of C3 sugar limits the maximum carbon yield of photosynthesis. Here we design a synthetic malyl-CoA-glycerate (MCG) pathway to augment the CBB cycle for efficient acetyl-CoA synthesis. This pathway converts a C3 metabolite to two acetyl-CoA by fixation of one additional CO 2 equivalent, or assimilates glyoxylate, a photorespiration intermediate, to produce acetyl-CoA without net carbon loss. We first functionally demonstrate the design of the MCG pathway in vitro and in Escherichia coli. We then implement the pathway in a photosynthetic organism Synechococcus elongates PCC7942, and show that it increases the intracellular acetyl-CoA pool and enhances bicarbonate assimilation by roughly 2-fold. This work provides a strategy to improve carbon fixation efficiency in photosynthetic organisms.

### An ATP-sensitive phosphoketolase regulates carbon fixation in cyanobacteria [^3aab40bd]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Main

Terrestrial phototrophic organisms draw down about 120 Gt of carbon from atmosphere annually primarily through the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle. Similar figures have been estimated for marine organisms. This flux is about ten-times higher than that emitted by anthropogenic release of CO 2, Thus, an increase in the biological carbon fixation by even a few percent would greatly influence the carbon balance on earth. Cyanobacteria utilize solar energy to split water and produce NADPH and ATP via photosystems and the electron transport chain to support carbon fixation via the CBB cycle. The CBB cycle accounts for the vast majority of carbon fixation on earth –, in which RuBisCO is the major enzyme catalyzing conversion of CO 2 and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG). Subsequent steps require ATP and NADPH to reduce 3PG to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be metabolized to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) as precursors for glycogen synthesis or to regenerate RuBP to continue the CBB cycle (Fig. 1a). The regulation of CBB cycle involves multiple factors and mechanisms, including light, redox potential and circadian regulation –. As a marine organism, cyanobacteria frequently experience underwater light fluctuation and encounter environmental stress. The cell has to shut down CO 2 fixation rapidly in low-ATP conditions to avoid futile cycling resulting from simultaneous CO 2 fixation and respiration. Although all ATP-dependent reactions proceed slower at low ATP levels, it is desirable to stop the CBB cycle preferentially and immediately to prevent non-productive resource draining; however, such a mechanism has not been discovered. On the other hand, if this mechanism can be exploited, carbon fixation in cyanobacteria could be increased.

One-carbon feedstocks such as formate could be promising renewable substrates for sustainable microbial production of food, fuels and chemicals. Here we replace the native energy-inefficient Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in Cupriavidus necator with the more energy-efficient reductive glycine pathway for growth on formate and CO 2. In chemostats, our engineered strain reached a 17% higher biomass yield than the wild type and a yield higher than any natural formatotroph using the Calvin cycle. This shows the potential of synthetic metabolism to realize sustainable, bio-based production.

### Proteome evolution under non-substitutable resource limitation [^d2efbec5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Metabolic context of the protein expression profiles

Overlaying the protein expression data on KEGG metabolic diagrams shows that the strongest proteome-level changes are clustered around the metabolic pathways of photosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and TCA cycle (Fig. 4). Specifically, the Calvin–Benson cycle and gluconeogenetic pathway are near-consistently upregulated across all treatments, while glycolysis and TCA cycle are downregulated. Strong upregulation is also prominent among ribosomal components and photosynthetic machinery (Supplementary Data 1). Proteins related to glycolysis (Fig. 4) and TCA cycle (Fig. 4; shaded in pink) are generally downregulated under non-substitutable resource limitation and salt stress, suggesting that catabolism of carbohydrates is suppressed relative to the ancestors and controls. On the other hand, Calvin–Benson cycle (Fig. 4; shaded in gray) is active and producing glycerate-3-phosphate (G3P), which is channeled up the gluconeogenetic pathway into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Fig. 4; shaded in brown). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is partly being used to maintain an active Calvin–Benson cycle but is also channeled toward production of α-D-glucose-6-phosphate, which is a starting point of further anabolic reactions such as starch synthesis. The details of further anabolic activity are less clearly supported by our data; for instance the data show no upregulation of the synthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, and nucleotides (Supplementary Data 1), and it remains unclear whether the cells are synthesizing starch (Fig. 4; shaded in cyan). We observe a divergent response in the low-phosphate treatment, which shows an increased conversion of L-methionine to S-adenosyl-L-methionine and the conversion of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine to L-homocysteine (Supplementary Data 1). However, this response has no obvious relation to increased phosphorus uptake or metabolism.

Fig. 4
Core metabolic pathways of C. reinhardtii. The circles represent metabolites, and the rectangular heat maps the enzymes, with blue indicating downregulation, red upregulation, and gray no significant change. The order of the colored boxes within the heat maps correspond to the selection treatments (as in Fig. 3), and the protein expression scale corresponds to the normalized peptide intensities. Metabolic functions are indicated by shading in the following colors: Calvin–Benson cycle (gray); Starch synthesis (cyan); Gluconeogenesis (brown); TCA cycle (pink). The most consistent response among the different selection treatments is the upregulation of anabolic functions including of the photosynthetic machinery, Calvin–Benson cycle and gluconeogenetic pathways. The Calvin–Benson cycle produces glycerate-3-phosphate (G3P), which is likely channeled up the gluconeogenetic pathway into α-D-glucose-6-phosphate. By contrast, catabolic functions of the TCA cycle (for respiration) and the conversion of G3P into glycerate-2-phosphate are being mostly downregulated

To determine whether these evolutionary changes in protein expression influence population-level phenotypes, we grew the ancestors and descendant populations up in the same common garden environment used for the proteomics experiment and measured a number of variables related to carbon and nutrient metabolism: photosynthesis, respiration, the stoichiometry of biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as total biomass production and nutrient uptake per unit biomass. We found that the descendants of the evolution experiment under resource-limitation and salt stress selection treatments tended to have greater biomass carbon to phosphorus and/or carbon to nitrogen molar ratios (Supplementary Figure 6). This finding is consistent with the observed decreased phosphate uptake per unit of biomass produced in the low-phosphate and biotic treatments (although we found no-effect on the uptake of nitrogen) (Supplementary Figure 7). Respiration rates decreased across the selection treatments, in line with the observed decrease in the expression of many mitochondrial proteins. However, we also observed a decrease in photosynthetic carbon assimilation in the low-nitrogen and biotic treatments (Supplementary Figure 8).

### Global metabolic rewiring for improved COfixation and chemical production in cyanobacteria [^0a407e65]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Cyanobacteria have attracted much attention as hosts to recycle CO 2 into valuable chemicals. Although cyanobacteria have been engineered to produce various compounds, production efficiencies are too low for commercialization. Here we engineer the carbon metabolism of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to improve glucose utilization, enhance CO 2 fixation and increase chemical production. We introduce modifications in glycolytic pathways and the Calvin Benson cycle to increase carbon flux and redirect it towards carbon fixation. The engineered strain efficiently uses both CO 2 and glucose, and produces 12.6gl -1 of 2,3-butanediol with a rate of 1.1gl -1 d -1 under continuous light conditions. Removal of native regulation enables carbon fixation and 2,3-butanediol production in the absence of light. This represents a significant step towards industrial viability and an excellent example of carbon metabolism plasticity.

### A ruBisCO-mediated carbon metabolic pathway in methanogenic archaea [^f53d8ca5]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Two enzymes are considered to be unique to the photosynthetic Calvin–Benson cycle: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), responsible for CO 2 fixation, and phosphoribulokinase (PRK). Some archaea possess bona fide RuBisCOs, despite not being photosynthetic organisms, but are thought to lack PRK. Here we demonstrate the existence in methanogenic archaea of a carbon metabolic pathway involving RuBisCO and PRK, which we term 'reductive hexulose-phosphate' (RHP) pathway. These archaea possess both RuBisCO and a catalytically active PRK whose crystal structure resembles that of photosynthetic bacterial PRK. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometric analysis of metabolites reveals that the RHP pathway, which differs from the Calvin–Benson cycle only in a few steps, is active in vivo. Our work highlights evolutionary and functional links between RuBisCO-mediated carbon metabolic pathways in methanogenic archaea and photosynthetic organisms. Whether the RHP pathway allows for autotrophy (that is, growth exclusively with CO 2 as carbon source) remains unknown.

Carbon-negative manufacturing in yeast

To switch to carbon-negative manufacturing, a recent study has suggested a promising metabolic engineering approach by harnessing autotrophic acetogens that uses the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. However, applying acetogenic bacteria or other natural C 1 -utilizers for industrial-scale production is hindered by the limited availability of genetic manipulation tools, slow growth, and/or a narrow product spectrum. Hence, chemical engineering strategies enabling S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris to utilize CO 2, as a carbon source, rather than sugar, are increasingly being considered.

Methylotrophic P. pastoris can obtain all the carbon and energy needed for growth and metabolism from reduced C 1 -molecule methanol. However, it leads to release of CO 2 that cannot be used by P. pastoris. By adding eight heterologous genes and deleting three native genes, Gassler et al. have engineered the peroxisomal methanol-assimilation pathway of P. pastoris into a CO 2 -fixation pathway resembling the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle (hereafter denoted the Calvin cycle). The Calvin cycle is then targeted to either the cytosol or peroxisome. Next, the team have replaced the formaldehyde-assimilating dihydroxyacetone synthase enzyme of P. pastoris with the bacterial ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) enzyme. After introducing phosphoribulose kinase from spinach, the generated yeast strain directly assimilated CO 2 instead of methanol, and converted it to organic acids. Portions of the Calvin cycle have been introduced into the yeast S. cerevisiae. To enhance CO 2 -fixation efficiency via the Calvin cycle in yeast, several optimization routes, for example, expressing RuBisCo derived from various origins have been evaluated. Li et al. have increased the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and relieved the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) imbalance involved in the CO 2 -fixation Calvin cycle. A highly active RuBisCo from the endosymbiont of the deep-sea tubeworm Riftia pachyptila may offer a unique application avenue for creating an efficient artificial photosynthetic pathway. Ultimately, yeast requires conversion of the Calvin cycle's final product, glycerate 3-phosphate (G3P), to precursors for NP manufacturing (Fig. 3a). Kildegaard et al. have optimized the conversion of G3P to acetyl-CoA, required precursor for production monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), by overexpressing native enzymes and heterologous acetyl-CoA synthase. Combining the above engineering efforts may enable establishment of a yeast strain that can efficiently assimilate CO 2 into acetyl-CoA-derived NPs via the Calvin cycle. As an alternative to natural CO 2 fixation, crotonyl-coenzyme A (CoA)/ethylmalonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA (CETCH) has been established for the in vitro fixation of CO 2. The CETCH cycle, based on crotonyl-CoA carboxylases, allows converting CO 2 into glyoxylate at a higher carbon fixation rate than the Calvin cycle. CETCH has been successfully coupled to (i) encapsulated photosynthetic membranes for light-powered CO 2 fixation to glyoxylate, and (ii) the β-hydroxyaspartate cycle, a glyoxylate assimilation cycle from marine bacteria, to convert CO 2 to acetyl-CoA in vitro. Although light-responsive CETCH cycle has not yet been implemented in vivo, it may offer a way to couple CO 2 assimilation pathways with NP-producing pathways in yeast (Fig. 3b). CETCH cycle requires two ATPs and three NADPH cofactors to convert two CO 2 molecules into organic compounds.

### Proteome evolution under non-substitutable resource limitation [^c3d400f8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In phytoplankton, there are several well-known core metabolic functions that are necessary for reproduction, including photosynthesis, respiration, carbon metabolism, transcription, translation, and protein synthesis. Short-term metabolic changes in phytoplankton in response to various types of resource-induced stress, including nitrogen or phosphorus limitation, involve shifts in core carbon metabolism including photosynthesis, the Calvin–Benson cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid synthesis, as well as shifts in the expression of proteins used to protect from heat-shock or photo-oxidative damage. While not universal, resource-induced stress tends to lead to a reduction in photosynthesis and the Calvin–Benson cycle, and a concurrent increase in starch production or fatty acid biosynthesis. More generally, these responses represent tweaks of core metabolism that allow cells to shift resource allocation from growth to storage, given the physiochemical constraints on the cell cycle imposed by the resource limitation. Nevertheless, resource limitation also induces molecular phenotypic changes that are unique and targeted to the specific resource and are functionally targeted at improved resource acquisition. For example, both nitrogenand phosphorus limitationresult in the upregulation of the respective nutrient transporters and organic nutrient assimilation pathways, and low light results in the upregulation of photosynthesis proteins. There may therefore be both convergent and divergent phenotypic adaptations occurring simultaneously in response to selection under unique but non-substitutable resource limitation, with convergent responses occurring in core metabolism and divergent responses occurring in resource acquisition strategies.

### Growth in fluctuating light buffers plants against photorespiratory perturbations [^36d1ad94]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The fixation of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into biomass is one of the most essential processes for life on Earth. The responsible enzyme ribulose biphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase (Rubisco) cannot entirely discriminate between CO 2 and molecular oxygen (O 2) and thus, as a side reaction, fixes O 2 onto the acceptor molecule ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. While the carboxylation reaction of Rubisco results in the production of two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, the oxygenation reaction produces only one of these molecules together with one molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG). 2PG cannot be directly fed back into the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and thus its accumulation drains molecules from the CBB cycle. Additionally, 2PG inhibits several chloroplast enzymes, together leading to the arrest of photosynthetic reactions and lethality of the plant when 2PG accumulates to high levels –.

The photorespiratory pathway (PR) metabolizes 2PG and regenerates intermediates of the CBB cycle. Its reactions span four different compartments, eight core enzymes and multiple transporters that shuttle the intermediates between different compartments (Fig. 1a; reviewed in ref.). The PR reactions result in the release of CO 2 and ammonia and come at a high energy cost. Thus, current plant engineering efforts aim to replace PR through bypasses that retain carbon and/or nitrogen or have lower energy requirements (e.g. refs. –). Metabolic reactions of PR do not only contribute to the recycling of 2PG, but also feed into other metabolic processes, including C 1 metabolism, nitrogen fixation, sulfur metabolism, subcellular re-distribution of energy equivalents, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and respiration.

### A ruBisCO-mediated carbon metabolic pathway in methanogenic archaea [^71f965d5]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

### A ruBisCO-mediated carbon metabolic pathway in methanogenic archaea [^f37c03bb]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Many methanogenic archaea contain conserved genes for enzymes in the RHP pathway, including RuBisCO and PRK, and for the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Supplementary Table 1). These pathways are thus expected to be widely distributed in methanogenic archaea. Hyperthermophilic archaea of the genera Archaeoglobus and Ferroglobus also contain genes for RHP pathway enzymes (Supplementary Table 1). These archaea also have conserved genes for methanogenesis; they can produce trace amounts of methaneand have a reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. This indicates that a metabolic link exists between the RHP pathway and the methanogenesis/reductive acetyl-CoA pathway.

Evolutionary acquisition of the photosynthetic Calvin–Benson cycle has had a major impact on the global carbon cycle. The RHP pathway and the Calvin–Benson cycle only differ in a few steps, namely from F6P to Ru5P. Thus, our results shed light on evolutionary and functional links between carbon metabolic pathways involving RuBisCO in methanogenic archaea and photosynthetic organisms. We speculate that the photosynthetic Calvin–Benson cycle may have originated from a primitive carbon metabolic pathway utilizing RuBisCO, such as the archaeal RHP pathway, by replacement of some steps without release of carbon.

### Autotrophic carbon fixation in archaea [^579dbef9]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

The acquisition of cellular carbon from inorganic carbon is a prerequisite for life and marked the transition from the inorganic to the organic world. Recent theories of the origins of life assume that chemo-evolution took place in a hot volcanic flow setting through a transition metal-catalysed, autocatalytic carbon fixation cycle. Many archaea live in volcanic habitats under such constraints, in high temperatures with only inorganic substances and often under anoxic conditions. In this Review, we describe the diverse carbon fixation mechanisms that are found in archaea. These reactions differ fundamentally from those of the well-known Calvin cycle, and their distribution mirrors the phylogenetic positions of the archaeal lineages and the needs of the ecological niches that they occupy.

### Methanol-dependent Escherichia coli strains with a complete ribulose monophosphate cycle [^5e4d8009]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To generate a fully synthetic methylotrophic E. coli strain, additional limiting metabolic factors must be identified and resolved, including the synthetic pathway efficiency, metabolic regulation and autocatalytic cycle constraints. To improve synthetic pathway efficiency, methanol-dependent strains such as Δ frmA Δ fbp and Δ frmA Δ tpiA provide an ideal screening background to test different RuMP cycle gene variants, as their growth rate depends directly on methanol assimilation efficiency. Hence, monitoring growth can serve as a direct read-out for the efficiency of synthetic pathways in vivo. Metabolic mis-regulation and autocatalytic cycle constraints are complex problems, and we currently lack a targeted engineering strategy that can overcome them. This has been affirmed by a recent study in which an autotrophic E. coli was achieved. Studying several parallel lineages revealed that at least 11 mutations were required to enable the autotrophic phenotype whereby most mutations likely target metabolic regulation and autocatalytic cycle constraints. Since the RuMP cycle and the Calvin cycle show substantial overlap, applying ALE to methanol-dependent ancestor strains with a complete RuMP cycle is a promising strategy, and hence, the two strains represent ideal starting points for long-term chemostat evolution experiments.

### Greater efficiency of photosynthetic carbon fixation due to single amino-acid substitution [^d70f5a9b]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

The C4-photosynthetic carbon cycle is an elaborated addition to the classical C3-photosynthetic pathway, which improves solar conversion efficiency. The key enzyme in this pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, has evolved from an ancestral non-photosynthetic C3 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. During evolution, C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase has increased its kinetic efficiency and reduced its sensitivity towards the feedback inhibitors malate and aspartate. An open question is the molecular basis of the shift in inhibitor tolerance. Here we show that a single-point mutation is sufficient to account for the drastic differences between the inhibitor tolerances of C3 and C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases. We solved high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of a C3 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and a closely related C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The comparison of both structures revealed that Arg884 supports tight inhibitor binding in the C3-type enzyme. In the C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase isoform, this arginine is replaced by glycine. The substitution reduces inhibitor affinity and enables the enzyme to participate in the C4 photosynthesis pathway.

### A ruBisCO-mediated carbon metabolic pathway in methanogenic archaea [^92d86614]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To date, six mechanisms have been identified for carbon fixation. Of these, members of Archaea are believed to be able to use three, namely dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle, hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate cycle, and reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway has been discussed as a model of the primordial CO 2 -fixing mechanism. The Calvin–Benson cycle is the predominant photosynthetic CO 2 -fixing pathway; however, it is considered to be an evolutionary late innovation and has not been reported in Archaea. The Calvin–Benson cycle consists of three phases: carbon fixation, carbon reduction, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration. In this cycle, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) fixes CO 2 with RuBP to yield 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), from which RuBP is regenerated. Phosphoribulokinase (PRK) synthesizes RuBP from ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) in the final step in RuBP regeneration. RuBisCO and PRK are representative and unique enzymes of the photosynthetic Calvin–Benson cycle. Interestingly, approximately half of the members of archaea that have currently been sequenced have a conserved gene for bona fide RuBisCO. Nevertheless, PRK genes and PRK activity have not been detected in Archaea. An alternative pathway distinct from the Calvin–Benson cycle may thus be present in Archaea to synthesize RuBP from either 5-phospho — ribose-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) or nucleoside 5′-monophosphate (NMP) via common ribose-1,5-bisphosphate. These pathways are not cyclic and cannot regenerate RuBP. The pentose bisphosphate pathway to generate RuBP as substrate for RuBisCO from nucleosides or NMP has been especially well characterized in Thermococcus kodakarensis and is thought to be involved in nucleoside assimilation and degradation.

Here, we report a carbon metabolic pathway involving RuBisCO and PRK that can regenerate RuBP in methanogenic archaea.

### Differential depth distribution of microbial function and putative symbionts through sediment-hosted aquifers in the deep terrestrial subsurface [^88cf10be]. Nature Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The shallowest groundwater had a substantially higher capacity for microbial sulfide oxidation, nitrogen fixation and oxygen respiration, probably due to the presence of atmospheric gases. In contrast, the intermediate source and borehole community had the highest microbial capacity for reduction of various nitrogen compounds as well as thiosulfate disproportionation, metal reduction and oxidation. The deepest groundwater was enriched in several bacteria with the capacity for sulfite reduction, with carbon fixation mediated by the Ca. "Altiarchaeum". The capacity for oxygen respiration decreased with increasing depth to the sourced groundwater.

Previously, we reported the operation of three carbon fixation pathways in bacteria and archaea from the Crystal Geyser communities, each of which requires substantially different amounts of energy. While the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway requires approximately 1 mol of ATP for the generation of 1 mol pyruvate, the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle and the reverse TCA cycle require 7 mol and 2 mol, respectively. Here, we show that the three carbon fixation pathways used by Crystal Geyser microorganisms were most abundant in different eruption phases, which reflect varying depths of source water composition (and borehole; Fig. 4e). The reductive TCA cycle was associated with a Sulfurimonas sp. that dominates the shallowest groundwater and also has the capacity for N 2 fixation. The Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle was enriched in bacteria associated with the intermediate groundwater as well as the borehole, and the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway was encoded in Ca. "Altiarchaeum" and Deltaproteobacteria genomes, and thus most highly represented in the deepest groundwater (Fig. 4d).

### Rubisco without the calvin cycle improves the carbon efficiency of developing green seeds [^5d98f8e8]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Efficient storage of carbon in seeds is crucial to plant fitness and to agricultural productivity. Oil is a major reserve material in most seeds, and these oils provide the largest source of renewable reduced carbon chains available from nature. However, the conversion of carbohydrate to oil through glycolysis results in the loss of one-third of the carbon as CO2. Here we show that, in developing embryos of Brassica napus L. (oilseed rape), Rubisco (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) acts without the Calvin cycle and in a previously undescribed metabolic context to increase the efficiency of carbon use during the formation of oil. In comparison with glycolysis, the metabolic conversion we describe provides 20% more acetyl-CoA for fatty-acid synthesis and results in 40% less loss of carbon as CO2. Our conclusions are based on measurements of mass balance, enzyme activity and stable isotope labelling, as well as an analysis of elementary flux modes.

### Proteome evolution under non-substitutable resource limitation [^ff24c088]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Resource limitation is a major driver of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of organisms. Short-term responses to resource limitation include plastic changes in molecular phenotypes including protein expression. Yet little is known about the evolution of the molecular phenotype under longer-term resource limitation. Here, we combine experimental evolution of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under multiple different non-substitutable resource limitation regimes with proteomic measurements to investigate evolutionary adaptation of the molecular phenotype. We demonstrate convergent proteomic evolution of core metabolic functions, including the Calvin-Benson cycle and gluconeogenesis, across different resource limitation environments. We do not observe proteomic changes consistent with optimized uptake of particular limiting resources. Instead, we report that adaptation proceeds in similar directions under different types of non-substitutable resource limitation. This largely convergent evolution of the expression of core metabolic proteins is associated with an improvement in the resource assimilation efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus into biomass.

### The genetic basis for the adaptation of E. coli to sugar synthesis from CO [^65db1dad]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Understanding the evolution of a new metabolic capability in full mechanistic detail is challenging, as causative mutations may be masked by non-essential "hitchhiking" mutations accumulated during the evolutionary trajectory. We have previously used adaptive laboratory evolution of a rationally engineered ancestor to generate an Escherichia coli strain able to utilize CO 2 fixation for sugar synthesis. Here, we reveal the genetic basis underlying this metabolic transition. Five mutations are sufficient to enable robust growth when a non-native Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle provides all the sugar-derived metabolic building blocks. These mutations are found either in enzymes that affect the efflux of intermediates from the autocatalytic CO 2 fixation cycle toward biomass (prs, serA, and pgi), or in key regulators of carbon metabolism (crp and ppsR). Using suppressor analysis, we show that a decrease in catalytic capacity is a common feature of all mutations found in enzymes. These findings highlight the enzymatic constraints that are essential to the metabolic stability of autocatalytic cycles and are relevant to future efforts in constructing non-native carbon fixation pathways.

### Photosynthetic growth despite a broken Q-cycle [^ca42d543]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As any energy-converting enzymes, cytochrome bc 1 and b 6 f are prone to undergo short circuits in their reaction pathways. Although expected on thermodynamic grounds, appropriate mechanistic control can relegate these to extremely slow processes and thus make them negligible with regard to their yield. In keeping with this framework, we propose that a short-circuit reaction between the reduced b l and a semiquinone may occur, but that its rate would make it a poor competitor with the forward-productive electron-transfer reactions. Yet, under conditions inactivating the redox loop, the occurrence of such short circuit would provide an 'emergency exit' pathway bypassing the Q-cycle and making it dispensable. It would thereby rescue its quinol-plastocyanin oxidoreductase activity and thus the function of the entire photosynthetic chain.

As mentioned above, the finding that the Q-cycle is dispensable from a mechanistic point of view also applies to the bc 1 complex, as such complex with an inhibited Q i site can sustain an overall electron-transfer flux. However, it is also dispensable from an energetic standpoint in the oxygenic photosynthetic chain, whereas similar mutants of the bc 1 complex from photosynthetic purple bacteria forbid photosynthetic growth. A rationale behind this physiological difference may lie in the relative contribution of the two complexes to their respective energy-converting chain. With a fully active Q-cycle, the ratio of H + transferred across the membrane per electron transferred through the high potential chain increases from 1 to 2. The total H + /e − ratio being 2 in the photosynthetic chain of purple bacteria and 3 in the oxygenic photosynthetic chain (see Supplementary Fig. S1), inactivating the low-potential chain and its associated H + transfer impacts 'only' a third of the H + /e − in the latter case and up to 50% in the former. In addition, whereas the photosynthetic chain of purple bacteria promotes a cyclic electron transfer, the oxygenic photosynthetic chain allows the linear electron transfer from water to NADP +. As the mechanism we propose preserves linear electron transfer, at least partially, the impaired photosynthetic chain still yields oxygen and reducing power that can fuel the respiratory chain and thereby compensate the decreased production of ATP resulting from the inactivation of the Q-cycle and meet the requirement of the Benson–Calvin cycle in terms of ATP and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).

### Design and implementation of aerobic and ambient CO-reduction as an entry-point for enhanced carbon fixation [^1e13d72e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A critical challenge to establish an oxygen-tolerant reduction-first CO 2 -fixation is the initial step, namely reduction of CO 2 to formate. This reaction requires a redox potential of roughly −460 mV at ambient CO 2 -concentrations (400 ppm CO 2 and physiological pH of 7 (eQuilibrator); E 0 ′ = −432 mV with 1 bar CO 2). Aerobic organisms that do not possess low-redox potential electron donors have to rely on the NAD(P)H/NAD(P) + pair (−320 mV). This constrains the direct reduction of CO 2, with an estimated Gibbs energy change (∆G) of +25 kJ/mol (400 ppm CO 2, pH 7 and 1 mM for all other reactants), which is almost impossible to achieve with physiological NADPH/NADP + ratios – and additionally comes at very high enzyme cost to reach sufficient flux –. This general limitation is supported by a recent study, in which aerobic CO 2 -reduction via an NADH-dependent formate dehydrogenase was successfully implemented in vivo, but only allowed for slow growth at strongly elevated CO 2 concentrations > 10% (i.e. 0.1 bar, 250× atmospheric level) and required an evolved mutation in the respiratory chain, likely increasing the cellular NADH/NAD + ratio.

In this work, we develop a metabolic architecture that is able to convert CO 2 into formate at fully aerobic conditions, and ambient CO 2 -concentrations. To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic bottlenecks associated with CO 2 -reduction, we design several pathways ("mini-cycles") that are energized by ATP-hydrolysis (Fig. 1A, B) and split up the task of CO 2 -reduction into multiple enzymatic steps with favorable thermodynamic driving forces. We use high-throughput in vitro bioprospecting to identify suitable enzyme candidates for our designs and realize one of these cycles, the CORE cycle, which we successfully assemble in a modular fashion in Escherichia coli. Using adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) allows us to achieve a fully functional CORE cycle that supports growth of E. coli by supplying the organism's complete C1-metabolism and serine biosynthesis from CO 2. The CORE cycle provides a flexible design that holds the potential to improve the efficiency of natural CO 2 -fixation pathways, such as photosynthesis (e.g. by augmenting photorespiration, Fig. 1D), and — at the same time — also opens the door for establishing synthetic reduction-first autotrophy in the future (Fig. 1C).

### Order-of-magnitude enhancement in photocurrent generation of synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by outer membrane deprivation [^e12c4a01]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Photocurrent measurements under the presence of a number of photosynthesis inhibitors demonstrated that the electrons stem from the pathway(s) downstream of PSI (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 9–13). Among the effects of the inhibitors, the difference in effects of GA and pCMB appeared to be important; both compounds are suggested to inhibit the Calvin cycle (Supplementary Figs. 10–13), but the former inhibitor abolished the photocurrent, whereas the latter markedly enhanced it (Fig. 2a). One obvious difference in effects between GA and pCMB was that only GA-treated cells exhibited a high P700 oxidation level under FR light illumination (Supplementary Fig. 12), suggesting that GA inhibits respiration- and/or CET-related pathway(s). It is not unreasonable to assume the inhibitors affect pathways other than the Calvin cycle because GA is known to be inherently pleiotropic owing to its electrophilicity; indeed, GA is reported to inhibit yeast growth and fermentation. An additional difference between GA and pCMB was evident from NADPH fluorescence measurement (Supplementary Fig. 13); the pCMB-treated cells showed a slowed decay of NADPH fluorescence after switching off the light and NADPH formation in the subsequent dark period was never observed. The slowed NADPH fluorescence decay may be attributable to Calvin cycle inhibition, but the lack of subsequent NADPH formation in the dark suggests the existence of other inhibitory effects of pCMB on the metabolic pathway(s) that reduces NADP, such as the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. We speculate that inhibition of dark NADPH formation changes cellular metabolism to accumulate alternative reducing equivalents instead of NADPH and this may be linked to the enhanced EET activity. Supporting this speculation, the pCMB-treated cells showed greatly enhanced EET current even in the dark (see the amperometric i-t curve in Fig. 2a). Taken together, the electrons involved in photocurrent generation seem to be derived from intermediates of metabolic pathway(s) that is linked to PQ reduction but not to NADP reduction. Elucidation of the action of GA and pCMB will provide further insights into the EET mechanism.

### Redox-informed models of global biogeochemical cycles [^ae902f03]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Table 1
Simplified equations describing two exemplary metabolic functional types.

For each, half-reactions combine to form the catabolic and anabolic full reactions: the oxidation of an electron donor (R D; here either organic matter or ammonium), the reduction of an electron acceptor (R E), and biomass synthesis (R S). The total reaction (R T) sums each of these three multiplied by a factor of f, the fraction of electrons partitioned into the synthesis reaction vs. respiration. Denominator d represents the number of electron equivalents that correspond to the oxidation states of the inorganic constituents of that synthesis: with a microbial biomass composition of C 5 H 7 O 2 N, d B = 4(5) + 1(7) – 2(2) − 3(1) = 20. Organic matter oxidation and synthesis equations are written without H 2 O on the left- and right-hand side, respectively, for conciseness. Charge balance via speciation of DIC is also neglected for simplicity. Example whole organism metabolic budgets are calculated using the listed example efficiencies for marine organisms, an average marine organic substrate compositionof C 6.6 H 10.9 O 2.6 N, and the above biomass composition.

Fig. 2
Schematic of a single cell represented as a metabolic functional type carrying out the aerobic oxidation of ammonia.

The redox balance informs the elemental ratios of substrates utilized, biomass synthesized, and waste products excreted (Table 1).

The result is a stoichiometric budget of the metabolism of the whole organism (Table 1). These descriptions quantify the elemental ratios of utilized substrates, biomass, and the excretion of waste products. For example, the descriptions account for the CO 2 produced by heterotrophic metabolisms as well as the CO 2 fixed by chemoautotrophic metabolisms (Table 1, Fig. 2, and Supplementary Fig. 2), linking microbial activity directly to global carbon cycling.

To estimate the growth rate of each functional type, the yields from the metabolic budgets are combined with the uptake rates of the required substrates (Box 1). Limiting uptake rates may rely on empirically derived uptake kinetic parameters, or they can be estimated theoretically from diffusive supply, cell size, membrane physiology, and other physical constraints –. If theoretical models of uptake are used, the physical constraints on substrate acquisition and the redox chemical constraints on energy acquisition can provide an entirely theoretical estimate of the growth of each metabolic functional type.

### Co-expression analysis reveals distinct alliances around two carbon fixation pathways in hydrothermal vent symbionts [^b9e3e392]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Most autotrophic organisms possess a single carbon fixation pathway. The chemoautotrophic symbionts of the hydrothermal vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila, however, possess two functional pathways: the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) and the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycles. How these two pathways are coordinated is unknown. Here we measured net carbon fixation rates, transcriptional/metabolic responses and transcriptional co-expression patterns of Riftia pachyptila endosymbionts by incubating tubeworms collected from the East Pacific Rise at environmental pressures, temperature and geochemistry. Results showed that rTCA and CBB transcriptional patterns varied in response to different geochemical regimes and that each pathway is allied to specific metabolic processes; the rTCA is allied to hydrogenases and dissimilatory nitrate reduction, whereas the CBB is allied to sulfide oxidation and assimilatory nitrate reduction, suggesting distinctive yet complementary roles in metabolic function. Furthermore, our network analysis implicates the rTCA and a group 1e hydrogenase as key players in the physiological response to limitation of sulfide and oxygen. Net carbon fixation rates were also exemplary, and accordingly, we propose that co-activity of CBB and rTCA may be an adaptation for maintaining high carbon fixation rates, conferring a fitness advantage in dynamic vent environments.

### Genome sequence of the ultrasmall unicellular red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D [^df4eedcd]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Small, compact genomes of ultrasmall unicellular algae provide information on the basic and essential genes that support the lives of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including higher plants. Here we report the 16,520,305-base-pair sequence of the 20 chromosomes of the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D as the first complete algal genome. We identified 5,331 genes in total, of which at least 86.3% were expressed. Unique characteristics of this genomic structure include: a lack of introns in all but 26 genes; only three copies of ribosomal DNA units that maintain the nucleolus; and two dynamin genes that are involved only in the division of mitochondria and plastids. The conserved mosaic origin of Calvin cycle enzymes in this red alga and in green plants supports the hypothesis of the existence of single primary plastid endosymbiosis. The lack of a myosin gene, in addition to the unexpressed actin gene, suggests a simpler system of cytokinesis. These results indicate that the C. merolae genome provides a model system with a simple gene composition for studying the origin, evolution and fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic cells.

### An ATP-sensitive phosphoketolase regulates carbon fixation in cyanobacteria [^aa84f81e]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Regulation of CO 2 fixation in cyanobacteria is important both for the organism and global carbon balance. Here we show that phosphoketolase in Synechococcuselongatus PCC7942 (SeXPK) possesses a distinct ATP-sensing mechanism, where a drop in ATP level allows SeXPK to divert precursors of the RuBisCO substrate away from the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Deleting the SeXPK gene increased CO 2 fixation particularly during light-dark transitions. In high-density cultures, the Δxpk strain showed a 60% increase in carbon fixation and unexpectedly resulted in sucrose secretion without any pathway engineering. Using cryo-EM analysis, we discovered that these functions were enabled by a unique allosteric regulatory site involving two subunits jointly binding two ATP, which constantly suppresses the activity of SeXPK until the ATP level drops. This magnesium-independent ATP allosteric site is present in many species across all three domains of life, where it may also play important regulatory functions.

### Cyclic electron flow is redox-controlled but independent of state transition [^9c70ecda]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Photosynthesis is the biological process that feeds the biosphere with reduced carbon. The assimilation of CO2 requires the fine tuning of two co-existing functional modes: linear electron flow, which provides NADPH and ATP, and cyclic electron flow, which only sustains ATP synthesis. Although the importance of this fine tuning is appreciated, its mechanism remains equivocal. Here we show that cyclic electron flow as well as formation of supercomplexes, thought to contribute to the enhancement of cyclic electron flow, are promoted in reducing conditions with no correlation with the reorganization of the thylakoid membranes associated with the migration of antenna proteins towards Photosystems I or II, a process known as state transition. We show that cyclic electron flow is tuned by the redox power and this provides a mechanistic model applying to the entire green lineage including the vast majority of the cases in which state transition only involves a moderate fraction of the antenna.

### Physiological and genomic features of highly alkaliphilic hydrogen-utilizing betaproteobacteria from a continental serpentinizing site [^97373345]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

While partial gene clusters related to sulphur oxidation were detected (only sox YZ) in all three genomes (Fig. 4), other putative sox genes were not seen. Although only strain A1 showed the thiosulphate oxidation accompanied with autotrophic growth, potential genes related to thiosulphate oxidation were not detected in the strain (Table 2).

With regard to inorganic carbon fixation, all three strains have most of the genes and gene clusters encoding enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cyclewhile the key genes that are essential for the reverse TCA cycle (Citryl-CoA synthetase)and reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Acetyl-CoA synthase)are not present, suggesting that carbon dioxide fixation is occurring via the Calvin-Benson cycle (Fig. 4). In addition, the genes encoding carboxysome shell proteins and a carbonic anhydrase are present in all three genomes, which also support the usage of the Calvin-Benson cycle for carbon fixation. Only strain A1 has putative cox genes (form I) that encode a carbon-monoxide (CO) dehydrogenase (CODH), which was also seen in the Tablelands metagenome. Similar cox genes were detected in Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava that utilizes CO as an energy source, suggesting that strain A1 also may utilize CO as energy source. No physiological tests of growth on CO were attempted.

The genes required for carbon fixation were located in a particular region in the genomes or contigs (Supplementary Fig. 10). The sequence comparisons of this region in the genomes between strains A1 and B1 as well as contigs from the strain H1 and the metagenome of Tablelandsindicate that the region is highly conserved. In concert with the genomic similarities between strain A1 and the Tablelands metagenomic contig noted above, the carbon fixation region also showed the highest similarities among the four compared sequences for these two. The region including CODH was also presumably an indel sequence, although the contigs from strain H1 and Tablelands were not long enough for a detailed comparison.

With regard to aromatic organic carbon metabolism, genes encoding benzene degradation and phenylalanine/phenyl-acetate degradation were also detected but only in strain A1. As aromatic compounds and cyclohexane were detected in BS5 water, the feature also may contribute to support the life there.

### Thermodynamic dissipation constrains metabolic versatility of unicellular growth [^e18707c5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our work is inevitably affected by several limitations. First, a large part of the data we parsed lacks information on time-scales and individual fluxes. To circumvent this limitation, we quantified growth and energetics using yields instead of fluxes and defining the dissipation per electron donor, σ. Furthermore, in Supplementary Fig. 8 we show data from continuous cultures, where the rates are known, with a median dissipation rate of 1 Watt per gram of dry biomass grown. Second, in most experiments only a subset of the exchanges necessary to account for the dissipation was measured. Therefore, we relied on element conservation to estimate the missing yields, with associated loss of accuracy. Third, our definitions of metabolic type and biomass composition were overly simplistic, as they ignored micronutrients and essential elements (such as phosphorous and sulfur). Despite being indispensable to life, we assumed that these contributions are small and would marginally affect the thermodynamic balances.

Given the importance of fluxes in cellular physiologyand energetics, it is crucial that future experimental studies of cellular energetics perform comprehensive measurements of all fluxes. We expect that a combination of novel experimental techniques, with coarse-grained as well as microscopic predictive models, will shed mechanistic insight into the origin of our empirical findings.

To conclude, our work constitutes a step towards connecting non-equilibrium thermodynamics with cellular physiology. The progress we made in this direction has implications in broadly different fields. For example, the dataset can be used as the basis for models of biogeochemical cycles, but it can also guide research linking mammalian metabolism, growth, and thermodynamics in healthy and diseased systems. Furthermore, as the dataset is open, it can be augmented to include other metabolic types, such as photosynthesis, thus expanding ecological studies of energetics. Finally, while we made no reference to intracellular processes, our approach can be bridged with thermodynamics of metabolic or signaling networks. Overall, the two empirical rules we established constitute a long sought-after connection between metabolism and thermodynamics.

### Photosynthetic growth despite a broken Q-cycle [^7ed1d526]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

To conclude, the present data show that, as in the bc 1 complex case, a disabled Q i site does not completely inhibit the function of the Q o site, which can still sustain an electron-transfer flux. In addition, we show that, at odds with the bc 1 complex case, this flux is large enough to allow photosynthetic growth, thus demonstrating that, in the oxygenic photosynthetic chain, the Q-cycle is dispensable from an energetic standpoint.

### The origin of carbon isotope vital effects in coccolith calcite [^fd4812cb]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Equilibrium limit special case

At the limit where CA activity is infinitely high in all compartments, complete chemical and isotopic equilibrium with respect to carbon can be assumed. In this scenario, the total [DIC] (D) in each compartment and its isotopic composition, along with (prescribed) pH, completely specifies the concentrations and isotopic compositions of the different inorganic carbon species in each compartment.

The dynamic equations for total DIC (D) in the three different compartments are:

In steady state all three equations must equal 0, which implies:

Inserting these into equation (37), the expression for cytoplasm total DIC, gives:

The four fluxes across the cell membrane equal:

where the permeability forrelates to the permeability for CO 2 through background utilization:

As a result, all cross-membrane fluxes are proportional to P C SA and equation (42) can be divided through by this factor. With chemical equilibrium and prescribed pH c in the cytoplasm, B c is proportional to C c for any compartment c ∈{e, i, x, v}:

whereis the temperature and salinity-dependent chemical equilibrium constant, and H c the H + concentration (H c =). Thus equation (42) can be rewritten as:

Isolating C i and divide through by C e gives:

Thus, concentrations and fluxes of carbon species in all compartments are known.

Following the same process, two additional fluxes across the chloroplast membrane equal:

where f x is the ratio of the product of cellular membrane permeability and surface area to that of the chloroplast. Equation (40) can therefore be rewritten:

and inserting equation (50) becomes:

Similarly, two additional fluxes across the coccolith vesicle membrane equal:

where f v is the ratio of the product of cellular membrane permeability and surface area to that of the coccolith vesicle. Equation (41) can therefore be rewritten:

### Continuous dynamic adjustment of the plant circadian oscillator [^81c7d1b5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In an alternative model, starch is not measured. Instead a molecule, or signal, that reflects the available C-status (from photosynthesis and released by starch degradation) adjusts the phase of a circadian-regulated starch degrading activity (β; Fig. 5c). The measured available C pool is the C that is not in a storage pool such as starch and instead is the pool that is available for allocation to respiration, growth or storage. In the model, this pool was described as "sucrose" to distinguish it from starch but recognises that sucrose represents only a subset of the available C pool and might not be the sugar that is measured. Here, we will refer to homoeostasis of available C, unless the effects of specific sugars are being described. β could represent the activity of one or several starch degrading enzymes, which increase activity through the night to peak near dawn and decrease activity to a trough near dusk (Fig. 5d). β ensures that sufficient sugars are released to maintain available C homoeostasis. A first version of this model considered the starch degrading activity (β) as a simple sinusoidal that adjusted phase in response to available C status and was optimised to minimise starvation of the plant. This was later revised to consider that the homoeostasis of available C is optimised, rather than starvation, because starvation rarely occurs in normal conditions. In these models, an aspect of the circadian system is dynamically adjusted to regulate the phase of β and starch is not measured.

### A shared core microbiome in soda lakes separated by large distances [^cf476ca9]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In alkaline soda lakes, concentrated dissolved carbonates establish productive phototrophic microbial mats. Here we show how microbial phototrophs and autotrophs contribute to this exceptional productivity. Amplicon and shotgun DNA sequencing data of microbial mats from four Canadian soda lakes indicate the presence of > 2,000 species of Bacteria and Eukaryotes. We recover metagenome-assembled-genomes for a core microbiome of < 100 abundant bacteria, present in all four lakes. Most of these are related to microbes previously detected in sediments of Asian alkaline lakes, showing that common selection principles drive community assembly from a globally distributed reservoir of alkaliphile biodiversity. Detection of > 7,000 proteins show how phototrophic populations allocate resources to specific processes and occupy complementary niches. Carbon fixation proceeds by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, in Cyanobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and, surprisingly, Gemmatimonadetes. Our study provides insight into soda lake ecology, as well as a template to guide efforts to engineer biotechnology for carbon dioxide conversion.

### Phototrophic extracellular electron uptake is linked to carbon dioxide fixation in the bacterium rhodopseudomonas palustris [^7a1d9b53]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Extracellular electron uptake (EEU) is the ability of microbes to take up electrons from solid-phase conductive substances such as metal oxides. EEU is performed by prevalent phototrophic bacterial genera, but the electron transfer pathways and the physiological electron sinks are poorly understood. Here we show that electrons enter the photosynthetic electron transport chain during EEU in the phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1. Cathodic electron flow is also correlated with a highly reducing intracellular redox environment. We show that reducing equivalents are used for carbon dioxide (CO 2) fixation, which is the primary electron sink. Deletion of the genes encoding ruBisCO (the CO 2 -fixing enzyme of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle) leads to a 90% reduction in EEU. This work shows that phototrophs can directly use solid-phase conductive substances for electron transfer, energy transduction, and CO 2 fixation.

### Co-evolution of primitive methane-cycling ecosystems and early earth's atmosphere and climate [^b84e447f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Biological model

In the following section, we present the biological model. Parameters' definition, unit and default value are given in Supplementary Tables 1, 2, and 3.

The biological model describes the dynamics of one or several biological populations of chemotrophic organisms, driven by the growth, birth (division) and death of individual cells. The individual cell life cycle is controlled by catabolic and anabolic reactions occurring within cells. Catabolism produces energy used by anabolism for biomass production, which determines cell growth and division; a fraction of energy produced by catabolism is used for cell maintenance. Energy thus flows from catabolism to maintenance and anabolism, and these processes can be described as follows:where S i and P i are the substrates and products of the metabolic reactions, and the's are the corresponding stoichiometric coefficients. We follow ref.and assume that the average organic compoundis a plausible approximation for the living biomass B. The energy E m (in kJ d −1) measures the cost of maintenance for a single cell per unit of time. The ∆ G terms measure the oxidative power released or consumed by the catabolic and anabolic reactions; they are given by the Nernst relationship:where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature (in K) and ∆ G 0 (T) (in kJ) is the Gibbs energy of the reaction. ∆ G 0 (T) is obtained from the Gibbs–Helmholtz relationship:where T S is the standard temperature of 298.15 K. Note that equations (E2) and (E3) describes how the thermodynamics of any given metabolism (i.e. the combination of catabolism and anabolism) vary with temperature.

### Metabolic reconfiguration enables synthetic reductive metabolism in yeast [^346d381e]. Nature Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Cells have evolved to possess multiple energy-producing pathways to maintain growth in response to varying conditions. Because energy metabolism is very important to the cell, molecular regulators of energy metabolism have essential roles in stem cells, nuclear reprogramming and cancer cell fate. In the heterotroph Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are two mechanisms by which ATP is produced: substrate-level and oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs during cellular respiration, and this process can utilize the oxidation of NADH/FADH 2 to NAD + /FAD to generate ATP/GTP, whereas NADH/FADH 2 is generated by the native reductive metabolism of cells, which involves both glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Through the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, the cell releases all the energy in glucose by generation of CO 2.

Metabolic reactions must be highly coordinated to ensure a defined ratio between different building blocks and a defined ratio between energy generation and these building blocks. We therefore wondered whether it is possible to create a synthetic energy system for the cell. What would happen if the cell was overcharged with NADH or NADPH? For heterotrophs, the TCA cycle is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy from glucose by the oxidation of acetyl-CoA to CO 2 and NADH, which further charges the electron transfer chain in the mitochondrial membrane for ATP generation. The TCA cycle performs repeated decarboxylation to generate energy. Is this system universal, or can it be replaced? From an evolutionary perspective, every component or module of the cell, including energy metabolism, has been optimized for self-reproduction rather than production of a single chemical. Therefore, is it possible to create a synthetic energy system that can be used for optimized chemical production? Traditionally most strategies in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, such as biosensor-based dynamic regulation, overexpression of pathways or deletion of specific enzymes, mainly focus on biosynthetic or anabolic processes.

### Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) [^c6c95fbb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The other names frequently used for calcitriol are 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-DHCC, 1,25(OH)2D3and 1,25-diOHC.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Man's natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to vitamin D3(cholecalciferol). Vitamin D3must be metabolically activated in the liver and the kidney before it is fully active as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism at target tissues. The initial transformation of vitamin D3is catalyzed by a vitamin D3-25-hydroxylase enzyme (25-OHase) present in the liver, and the product of this reaction is 25-hydroxyvitamin D3[25-(OH) D3]. Hydroxylation of 25-(OH) D3occurs in the mitochondria of kidney tissue, activated by the renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase (alpha-OHase), to produce 1,25-(OH)2D3(calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D3. Endogenous synthesis and catabolism of calcitriol, as well as physiological control mechanisms affecting these processes, play a critical role regulating the serum level of calcitriol. Physiological daily production is normally 0.5 to 1.0 mcg and is somewhat higher during periods of increased bone synthesis (e.g., growth or pregnancy).

### Futile cycles: emerging utility from apparent futility [^036eba2f]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Futile cycles are biological phenomena where two opposing biochemical reactions run simultaneously, resulting in a net energy loss without appreciable productivity. Such a state was presumed to be a biological aberration and thus deemed an energy-wasting "futile" cycle. However, multiple pieces of evidence suggest that biological utilities emerge from futile cycles. A few established functions of futile cycles are to control metabolic sensitivity, modulate energy homeostasis, and drive adaptive thermogenesis. Yet, the physiological regulation, implication, and pathological relevance of most futile cycles remain poorly studied. In this review, we highlight the abundance and versatility of futile cycles and propose a classification scheme. We further discuss the energetic implications of various futile cycles and their impact on basal metabolic rate, their bona fide and tentative pathophysiological implications, and putative drug interactions.

### Synthetic non-oxidative glycolysis enables complete carbon conservation [^507dd97f]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Glycolysis, or its variations, is a fundamental metabolic pathway in life that functions in almost all organisms to decompose external or intracellular sugars. The pathway involves the partial oxidation and splitting of sugars to pyruvate, which in turn is decarboxylated to produce acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) for various biosynthetic purposes. The decarboxylation of pyruvate loses a carbon equivalent, and limits the theoretical carbon yield to only two moles of two-carbon (C2) metabolites per mole of hexose. This native route is a major source of carbon loss in biorefining and microbial carbon metabolism. Here we design and construct a non-oxidative, cyclic pathway that allows the production of stoichiometric amounts of C2 metabolites from hexose, pentose and triose phosphates without carbon loss. We tested this pathway, termed non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG), in vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli. NOG enables complete carbon conservation in sugar catabolism to acetyl-CoA, and can be used in conjunction with CO2 fixation and other one-carbon (C1) assimilation pathways to achieve a 100% carbon yield to desirable fuels and chemicals.

### A framework for understanding collective microbiome metabolism [^800bcecf]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Microbiome metabolism underlies numerous vital ecosystem functions. Individual microbiome members often perform partial catabolism of substrates or do not express all of the metabolic functions required for growth. Microbiome members can complement each other by exchanging metabolic intermediates and cellular building blocks to achieve a collective metabolism. We currently lack a mechanistic framework to explain why microbiome members adopt partial metabolism and how metabolic functions are distributed among them. Here we argue that natural selection for proteome efficiency-that is, performing essential metabolic fluxes at a minimal protein investment-explains partial metabolism of microbiome members, which underpins the collective metabolism of microbiomes. Using the carbon cycle as an example, we discuss motifs of collective metabolism, the conditions under which these motifs increase the proteome efficiency of individuals and the metabolic interactions they result in. In summary, we propose a mechanistic framework for how collective metabolic functions emerge from selection on individuals.

### When the metabolism meets the cell cycle in bacteria [^a67c4822]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nutrients availability is the sinews of the war for single microbial cells, driving growth and cell cycle progression. Therefore, coordinating cellular processes with nutrients availability is crucial, not only to survive upon famine or fluctuating conditions but also to rapidly thrive and colonize plentiful environments. While metabolism is traditionally seen as a set of chemical reactions taking place in cells to extract energy and produce building blocks from available nutrients, numerous connections between metabolic pathways and cell cycle phases have been documented. The few regulatory systems described at the molecular levels show that regulation is mediated either by a second messenger molecule or by a metabolite and/or a metabolic enzyme. In the latter case, a secondary moonlighting regulatory function evolved independently of the primary catalytic function of the enzyme. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the complex cross-talks between metabolism and cell cycle in bacteria.

### A blueprint for designing the next-generation of synthetic cmicrobes [^987df48f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Engineering O 2 -dependent lifestyles

As noted in the bioprocess design, O 2 availability during fermentation must be defined from the outset. Anaerobic C 1 assimilation pathways, including the ancestral Wood–Ljungdahl pathway and the reductive TCA cycle, involve O 2 -sensitive enzymes, e.g. CO dehydrogenase and ferredoxin-dependent carboxylases. Anoxic growth inherently links biomass formation to by-product synthesis. For instance, acetogenic bacteria reduce part of the carbon substrate to acetate to dissipate excess reducing equivalents. Acetogenesis through the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway operates near the thermodynamic limit of life, which ensures highly efficient C 1 -to-product conversion. However, transferring such systems into alternative hosts remains largely unexplored due to obstacles that include energy conservation, cofactor redox balance and proper maturation of O 2 -sensitive enzymes. Native acetogens currently represent the only industrial-scale non-phototrophic C 1 -trophic systems for CO 2 fixation.

Engineering obligate aerobes to function under anaerobic conditions has proven challenging. Recently, however, E. coli was engineered to perform oxic fermentation (respirofermentation). The required deletion of genes encoding seven NAD(P) + /quinone oxidoreductases and twelve quinone-linked dehydrogenases to redirect metabolism toward a fermentative regime enabled lactate and isobutanol production under oxic conditions. To mitigate redox imbalance, specific respiratory modules were introduced to allow controlled use of O 2 for redox balancing. Such seminal work demonstrates that fermentative metabolism can be imposed under O 2 -rich environments through extensive rewiring, bypassing the limitations of anaerobiosis while supporting robust product formation — including from C 1 substrates. Although the product portfolio from anaerobic C 1 assimilation remains relatively narrow due to energetic constraints, synthetic and native systems offer promising routes for the sustainable synthesis of platform chemicals –.

An emerging strategy has further pushed the boundaries of anoxic limitations by enabling CO 2 reduction to formate under oxic conditions and at atmospheric CO 2 levels — reactions typically exclusive to anaerobes using the Wood–Ljungdahl route or the rGlyP. This goal was achieved through the so-called CORE pathway, which harnesses O 2 -tolerant CO 2 reduction via a novel reaction catalyzed by a β-ketoacid cleavage enzyme, requiring only one molecule of ATP and NADPH each. This case exemplifies how pathway conceptualization combined with the discovery or engineering of enzymes for new-to-nature chemistries can unlock biochemical transformations traditionally restricted to anoxic conditions.

### Folic acid, vitamin d3 (dotremin) [^2c406698]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The in vivo synthesis of the major biologically active metabolites of Vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of ergocalciferol takes place in the liver (to 25-hydroxyvitamin D) and the second in the kidneys (to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). Vitamin D metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the small intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and

phosphate levels sufficiently to permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules.

There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is responsible for the regulation of this metabolism in the kidneys.

### Whole genome comparison of thermus sp. NMX2. A1 reveals principle carbon metabolism differences with closest relation thermus scotoductus SA-01 [^63aecea7]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

Genome sequencing of the yellow-pigmented, thermophilic bacterium Thermus sp. NMX2. A1 resulted in a 2.29 Mb draft genome that encodes for 2312 proteins. The genetic relationship between various strains from the genus Thermus was assessed based on phylogenomic analyses using a concatenated set of conserved proteins. The resulting phylogenetic tree illustrated that Thermus sp. NMX2 A.1 clusters together with Thermus scotoductus SA-01, despite being isolated from vastly different geographical locations. The close evolutionary relationship and metabolic parallels between the two strains has previously been recognized; however, neither strain's genome data were available at that point in time. Genomic comparison of the Thermus sp. NMX2. A1 and T. scotoductus SA-01, as well as other closely related Thermus strains, revealed a high degree of synteny at both the genomic and proteomic level, with processes such as denitrification and natural cell competence appearing to be conserved. However, despite this high level of similarity, analysis revealed a complete, putative Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle in NMX2. A1 that is absent in SA-01. Analysis of horizontally transferred gene islands provide evidence that NMX2 selected these genes due to pressure from its HCO3 (-) rich environment, which is in stark contrast to that of the deep subsurface isolated SA-01.

### Self-organization of primitive metabolic cycles due to non-reciprocal interactions [^7e63850a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

One of the greatest mysteries concerning the origin of life is how it has emerged so quickly after the formation of the earth. In particular, it is not understood how metabolic cycles, which power the non-equilibrium activity of cells, have come into existence in the first instances. While it is generally expected that non-equilibrium conditions would have been necessary for the formation of primitive metabolic structures, the focus has so far been on externally imposed non-equilibrium conditions, such as temperature or proton gradients. Here, we propose an alternative paradigm in which naturally occurring non-reciprocal interactions between catalysts that can partner together in a cyclic reaction lead to their recruitment into self-organized functional structures. We uncover different classes of self-organized cycles that form through exponentially rapid coarsening processes, depending on the parity of the cycle and the nature of the interaction motifs, which are all generic but have readily tuneable features.

### Calcitriol [^87b65c22]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism

In vivo and in vitro studies indicate the presence of two pathways of metabolism for calcitriol. The first pathway involves the 24-hydroxylase as the first step in catabolism of calcitriol. There is definite evidence of 24-hydroxylase activity in the kidney; this enzyme is also present in many target tissues which possess the vitamin D receptor such as the intestine. The end product of this pathway is a side chain shortened metabolite, calcitroic acid. The second pathway involves the conversion of calcitriol via the stepwise hydroxylation of carbon-26 and carbon-23, and cyclization to yield ultimately 1α, 25R(OH)2–26, 23S-lactone D3. The lactone appears to be the major metabolite circulating in humans, with mean serum concentrations of 131 ± 17 pg/mL. In addition, several other metabolites of calcitriol have been identified: 1α, 25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3; 1α, 23,25(OH)3-24-oxo-D3; 1α, 24R,25(OH)3D3; 1α, 25S,26(OH)3D3; 1α, 25(OH)2-23-oxo-D3; 1α, 25R,26(OH)3-23-oxo-D3; 1α, (OH)24,25,26,27-tetranor-COOH-D3.

Excretion

Enterohepatic recycling and biliary excretion of calcitriol occur. The metabolites of calcitriol are excreted primarily in feces. Following intravenous administration of radiolabeled calcitriol in normal subjects, approximately 27% and 7% of the radioactivity appeared in the feces and urine, respectively, within 24 hours. When a 1 mcg oral dose of radiolabeled calcitriol was administered to normal subjects, approximately 10% of the total radioactivity appeared in urine within 24 hours. Cumulative excretion of radioactivity on the sixth day following intravenous administration of radiolabeled calcitriol averaged 16% in urine and 49% in feces. The elimination half-life of calcitriol in serum after single oral doses is about 5 to 8 hours in normal subjects.

### Continuous dynamic adjustment of the plant circadian oscillator [^e584e6d6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dynamically plasticity contributes to carbon homoeostasis

Many of the hormones, metabolites and ions that regulate the period of the circadian oscillator (Table 1) do not have obvious associations with the timing of the dawn or dusk and are therefore unlikely to contribute to ensuring synchronisation of the circadian oscillator to external cues. More likely they provide feedback from the physiological and metabolic status of the plant to fine tune components of the circadian oscillator to ensure the oscillator regulates physiological and metabolic pathways appropriately. The "metabolic dawn" hypothesis is an example in which the oscillator is proposed to entrain to the varying rate of photosynthetic production of sugars dependent on prevailing weather conditions, possibly to adjust the timing of the production of transcripts and regulation of pathways involved in photosynthesis and metabolism. Feedback from endogenous sugar levels to the circadian oscillator was shown by the altered circadian period and phase in low CO 2, or following treatment with the inhibitor of photosynthesis, DCMU. An extension of this concept proposed that the circadian oscillator might contribute to the homoeostatic management of transient carbon reserves associated with the light and dark of the diel cycle. C3 and C4 plants fix carbon (C) during the day by photosynthesis. A percentage of the fixed C is allocated to a C reserve for consumption at night to survive the dark. In Arabidopsis, the transitory reserve is starch, which is consumed completely by dawn, with the rate of accumulation and loss being dependent on day length and near linear (Fig. 5a). The circadian clock is a regulator of the starch reserve, and if this regulation is compromised, there is a severe impact on growth.

### Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative [^a97c5cf1]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The biochemical pathways of central carbon metabolism are highly conserved across all domains of life, and largely control the productivity of life on the Earth. Yet it remains unknown whether these pathways are the result of historical contingency during early evolution, or are instead optimal solutions to the problem of energy and biomass production. Put simply, are there alternative biochemically feasible pathways that could perform the same function, and if so, how do they perform compared with those found in nature?

Previous studies have mainly addressed this question either by constructing simplified artificial metabolic networks, or by mining databases of biochemical compounds and reactions for known organisms. Both of these approaches have drawbacks: the former does not capture real biochemistry, whereas the latter is limited to metabolites and reactions found in well-studied organisms. Nevertheless, this work has led to suggested optimality principles including maximizing biochemical flux or yield, minimizing biochemical steps or protein costsand ensuring that function is maintained in a changing environment. Only a few studies have attempted to explore the full universe of possible metabolic pathways, using realistic rules of biochemistry. In particular, using this approach, Noor et al.recently suggested that central carbon metabolism, taken as a whole, uses the minimal number of enzymatic steps needed to generate a predefined set of biochemical precursors.

Here, we perform an exhaustive computational search for all possible biochemically feasible alternatives to one of the most ancient and most highly conserved sections of central carbon metabolism, the trunk pathway of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glycolysis breaks down glucose to pyruvate, generating ATP, NADH and biosynthetic precursors, whereas gluconeogenesis uses ATP and NADH to generate glucose from pyruvate. The glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway is almost linear and can be divided into two parts: an 'upper' chain of reactions involving 6-carbon molecules, which connects glucose to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), and a 'lower' chain of reactions involving 3-carbon molecules, which connects G3P to pyruvate (Fig. 1). This lower reaction chain is known as the trunk pathway. In prokaryotes, the glycolytic and gluconeogenic trunk pathways consist of almost the same set of five reactions, differing only in one step. In glycolysis, the exergonic conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate is coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, whereas in gluconeogenesis the reverse reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP, either with release of inorganic phosphate (the phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (pps) route) or via consumption of inorganic phosphate and release of pyrophosphate (the phosphate dikinase (ppdk) route).

### The cyanobacterial clock and metabolism [^b1b464ed]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Cyanobacteria possess the simplest known circadian clock, which presents a unique opportunity to study how rhythms are generated and how input signals from the environment reset the clock time. The kaiABC locus forms the core of the oscillator, and the remarkable ability to reconstitute oscillations using purified KaiABC proteins has allowed researchers to study mechanism using the tools of quantitative biochemistry. Autotrophic cyanobacteria experience major shifts in metabolism following a light-dark transition, and recent work suggests that input mechanisms that couple the day-night cycle to the clock involve energy and redox metabolites acting directly on clock proteins. We offer a summary of the current state of knowledge in this system and present a perspective for future lines of investigation.

### Controlled oxygen delivery to power tissue regeneration [^fc1db4b5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Oxidative phosphorylation, ROS generation, pathology, and redox signaling.

a During oxidative phosphorylation, electron carriers NAD+ and FAD feed electrons to the ETC at either complex I or II. The electrons are shuttled through four membrane-bound protein complexes, referred to as complexes I-IV, which undergo a series of redox reactions. Through this process electrons from complexes I and II also enter the ' ', where they are passed to another electron carrier, ubiquinone (Q), to facilitate transfer to cytochrome c (via complex III as an intermediary). Diatomic oxygen binds to Complex IV, where it accepts the electrons carried by cytochrome C and is reduced to water. Energy released through these reactions facilitates an electrochemical proton gradient, or mitochondrial membrane potential, within the intermembrane space. To relieve this membrane potential, protons can reenter into the mitochondrial matrix through another protein complex, ATP synthase, which harnesses the mechanical energy generated by the movement of protons to overcome energy constrictions limiting the conversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP. "Leaky" electrons result in the generation of ROS. Adapted from ref. b Oxygen is involved in both redox signaling and pathology in the form of ROS. A number of sources, both endogenous and exogenous, are capable of generating cellular ROS. H 2 O 2 is involved in the signal transduction of pathways that control cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. However, most ROS species, particularly HO•-, facilitate oxidative stress, cell damage, inflammation and, subsequently, disease.

### Temporal segregation of biosynthetic processes is responsible for metabolic oscillations during the budding yeast cell cycle [^7f585558]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Many cell biological and biochemical mechanisms controlling the fundamental process of eukaryotic cell division have been identified; however, the temporal dynamics of biosynthetic processes during the cell division cycle are still elusive. Here, we show that key biosynthetic processes are temporally segregated along the cell cycle. Using budding yeast as a model and single-cell methods to dynamically measure metabolic activity, we observe two peaks in protein synthesis, in the G1 and S/G2/M phase, whereas lipid and polysaccharide synthesis peaks only once, during the S/G2/M phase. Integrating the inferred biosynthetic rates into a thermodynamic-stoichiometric metabolic model, we find that this temporal segregation in biosynthetic processes causes flux changes in primary metabolism, with an acceleration of glucose-uptake flux in G1 and phase-shifted oscillations of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanges. Through experimental validation of the model predictions, we demonstrate that primary metabolism oscillates with cell-cycle periodicity to satisfy the changing demands of biosynthetic processes exhibiting unexpected dynamics during the cell cycle.

### Climate extremes and the carbon cycle [^e1328880]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

The terrestrial biosphere is a key component of the global carbon cycle and its carbon balance is strongly influenced by climate. Continuing environmental changes are thought to increase global terrestrial carbon uptake. But evidence is mounting that climate extremes such as droughts or storms can lead to a decrease in regional ecosystem carbon stocks and therefore have the potential to negate an expected increase in terrestrial carbon uptake. Here we explore the mechanisms and impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle, and propose a pathway to improve our understanding of present and future impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon budget.

### Pyruvate into lactate and back: from the warburg effect to symbiotic energy fuel exchange in cancer cells [^c5ca5495]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Tumor cells fuel their metabolism with glucose and glutamine to meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferation. Hypoxia and oncogenic mutations drive glycolysis, with the pyruvate to lactate conversion being promoted by increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase A and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The NAD+ pool is consecutively regenerated and supports the high glycolytic flux required to produce anabolic intermediates. Glutaminolysis provides metabolic intermediates such as alpha-ketoglutarate to feed and thereby maintain the tricarboxylic acid cycle as a biosynthetic hub. Glycolysis and glutaminolysis share the capacity to generate NADPH, from the pentose phosphate pathway and through the malate conversion into pyruvate, respectively. Both pathways ultimately lead to the secretion of lactate. More than a waste product, lactate was recently identified as a major energy fuel in tumors. Lactate produced by hypoxic tumor cells may indeed diffuse and be taken up by oxygenated tumor cells. Preferential utilization of lactate for oxidative metabolism spares glucose which may in turn reach hypoxic tumor cells. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 regulates the entry of lactate into oxidative tumor cells. Its inhibition favors the switch from lactate-fuelled respiration to glycolysis and consecutively kills hypoxic tumor cells from glucose starvation. Combination with radiotherapy renders remaining cells more sensitive to irradiation, emphasizing how interference with tumor cell metabolism may complement current anticancer modalities.

### Scaling metabolism from organisms to ecosystems [^0a08665d]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Understanding energy and material fluxes through ecosystems is central to many questions in global change biology and ecology. Ecosystem respiration is a critical component of the carbon cycle and might be important in regulating biosphere response to global climate change. Here we derive a general model of ecosystem respiration based on the kinetics of metabolic reactions and the scaling of resource use by individual organisms. The model predicts that fluxes of CO2 and energy are invariant of ecosystem biomass, but are strongly influenced by temperature, variation in cellular metabolism and rates of supply of limiting resources (water and/or nutrients). Variation in ecosystem respiration within sites, as calculated from a network of CO2 flux towers, provides robust support for the model's predictions. However, data indicate that variation in annual flux between sites is not strongly dependent on average site temperature or latitude. This presents an interesting paradox with regard to the expected temperature dependence. Nevertheless, our model provides a basis for quantitatively understanding energy and material flux between the atmosphere and biosphere.

As mitochondrial respiration is primarily responsible in most cell types for provision of ATP, this organelle is likely integral to the process of metabolic shutdown through a reduction in energy availability.

In excess, however, ROS have a direct inhibitory effect on mitochondrial respiration, either through direct inhibition of the electron transport chain or damage to the organelle when mitochondrial antioxidant defences are overwhelmed. Routinely used treatments in the critically ill, such as bacteriocidal antibiotics, catecholamines and sedatives, may also inhibit mitochondrial respiration.
Tissue hypoxia, especially before adequate resuscitation. This hypoxia is of insufficient magnitude to trigger cell death pathways yet severe enough to compromise normal functioning of the cells. Consequential to the ongoing oxygen debt, the cell responds by an adaptive compensatory reduction in metabolism to balance supply and demand. There are further corollaries of tissue hypoxia. As oxygen and nitric oxide compete for the same binding site on complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), the last component of the electron transport chain, a decrease in local oxygen concentration will enhance the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide described above.
Mitochondrial respiration, which is modulated by various hormones and transcription factors. Thyroid hormone, for example, has profound effects on ATP synthesis and turnover. It can also activate uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (see below); this mechanism may be responsible for some of its hypermetabolic effects. Complex relationships are reported between mechanisms of mitochondrial proton leak, production of reactive oxygen species and thyroid status. However, with prolonged and severe illness, there is decreased availability of active thyroid hormone (low T3 syndrome, sick euthyroid syndrome, non-thyroidal illness syndrome), the degree of which is prognostic. This may impact on mitochondrial function and ATP turnover during critical illness.
Decreased turnover of healthy, functional mitochondria (biogenesis). Mitochondrial biogenesis must keep pace with mitophagy (processes that eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria) to maintain mitochondrial density. Several mechanisms may all conspire to decrease mitochondrial biogenesis in sepsis. In a pioneering study, Calvano and colleagues administered endotoxin to healthy volunteers and noted a generalized downregulation of gene transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins, including those within the electron transport chain. Transcription factors such as PGC-1alpha, the 'master regulator' of biogenesis, is reduced in animal models of sepsis and in eventual human non-survivors. Of note, the reduction in mitochondrial turnover may be iatrogenically compounded by bacteriostatic antibiotic therapy that impacts negatively upon biogenesis through decreasing protein synthesis.
Uncoupled respiration with production of heat rather than ATP. Most of the oxygen used by the body is consumed by mitochondria, predominantly for generation of ATP — so-called 'coupled' respiration. A proportion is uncoupled, whereby the proton gradient created by electron transfer down the electron transport chain is dissipated, and the energy is 'lost' as heat. The precise amount of oxygen utilised by uncoupled respiration is uncertain. Ex vivo studies in different rat tissues suggests this proton leak varies from 15% in heart to as high as 50% in skeletal muscle. Whether this increases in sepsis and other critical illness is not yet established, although a recent study showed an increase in uncoupling protein-1 in white adipose tissue after human burn injury. This may explain, at least in part, pyrexia, especially as other mechanisms of heat production, such as muscular activity and food breakdown, are reduced in a sick patient. However, two corollaries of increased uncoupling are a reduction in ATP for fuelling metabolism yet also a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential that may decrease production of damaging ROS and thus offer protection.

### Design principles for enhancing phase sensitivity and suppressing phase fluctuations simultaneously in biochemical oscillatory systems [^d97bf897]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Biological systems need to function accurately in the presence of strong noise and at the same time respond sensitively to subtle external cues. Here we study design principles in biochemical oscillatory circuits to achieve these two seemingly incompatible goals. We show that energy dissipation can enhance phase sensitivity linearly by driving the phase-amplitude coupling and increase timing accuracy by suppressing phase diffusion. Two general design principles in the key underlying reaction loop formed by two antiparallel pathways are found to optimize oscillation performance with a given energy budget: balancing the forward-to-backward flux ratio between the two pathways to reduce phase diffusion and maximizing the net flux of the phase-advancing pathway relative to that of the phase-retreating pathway to enhance phase sensitivity. Experimental evidences consistent with these design principles are found in the circadian clock of cyanobacteria. Future experiments to test the predicted dependence of phase sensitivity on energy dissipation are proposed.

### A family of NADPH / NADPbiosensors reveals in vivo dynamics of central redox metabolism across eukaryotes [^c30ae122]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), in its reduced (NADPH) and oxidised (NADP +) states, constitutes a central metabolic redox couple, which is found in all living organisms. NADPH plays a crucial role as an electron donor in numerous, typically anabolic, pathways, for example fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and photosynthetic carbon assimilation, and for the enzymatic reduction of certain reactive oxygen species, including H 2 O 2. NADPH also serves as the source of electrons for NADPH oxidases. This family of enzymes is central to the respiratory burst in immune responses and the generation of H 2 O 2 as a second messenger in cellular signalling, development, and environmental sensing across kingdoms.

Since its discovery in the early 1930s, NADP, together with its cellular counterpart, NAD, has been extensively investigated. However, our understanding of subcellular NAD(P) redox dynamics is still remarkably incomplete, mainly due to a lack of techniques allowing specific monitoring in defined subcellular compartments in vivo.

The use of novel genetically encoded sensors allowed accurate measurements of the subcellular dynamics of numerous metabolites, metals ions including free Ca 2+, H 2 O 2, and pH –. Such sensors have revolutionised our understanding of countless previously intractable biological processes, particularly when dealing with small subcellular compartment-specific dynamics, and have underpinned numerous novel discoveries. Genetically encoded sensors for pyridine nucleotides were relative latecomers; however, significant progress has been made over the past decade in developing sensors for NADH, NAD +, NADH/NAD + –, NADPH, and NADP +. Nonetheless, existing NADPH sensors face major limitations, including sensitivity to pH, a lack of responsiveness to NADP +, a low signal-to-noise ratio, and a lack of compatibility with alternative measurement techniques like FLIM. A recently created sensor, NERNST, was developed, which purported to be the first NADP redox state sensor, i.e. a sensor of the NADPH/NADP + ratio. Nonetheless, considerable concerns arise regarding the specificity of NERNST due to its dependence on a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP2) reporter, which is known to efficiently equilibrate with the glutathione redox couple in vivo –.

### Single-cell measurements and modelling reveal substantial organic carbon acquisition by prochlorococcus [^0c8ab257]. Nature Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Simulations in a dynamic water column

To investigate the implications of mixotrophy on biogeochemical dynamics, we employed an individual-based modelling approach (for details, see Methods), simulating trajectories of individual Prochlorococcus cells (or super-agents representing many cells) through light and nutrient environments in a two-dimensional, highly resolved turbulent fluid flow (see Supplementary Video 1). Inorganic nutrients and a DOC-like tracer are represented by density-based equations. Briefly, individuals fix carbon by photosynthesis and take up inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. Two idealized types of individuals are simulated separately, one with a strict photo-autotrophic lifestyle and the other which is mixotrophic and able to assimilate carbon from the DOC-like substance. The mixotrophic individual cannot live strictly heterotrophically, as suggested by Coe et al. which we parameterize as requiring at least 1% of the incorporated C to come from photosynthesis (Extended Data Fig. 3). In Fig. 3a, we illustrate horizontally averaged profiles of cell density from the purely autotrophic and mixotrophic simulations, illustrating how mixotrophy supports a population of Prochlorococcus below ~75 m. The simulated daily division rate of ~0.2 day −1 at depth (Fig. 3b) is consistent with the published cell-cycle profiles from the subtropics and the equatorial Pacific, and is a bit higher than the aforementioned inferred division rate in the Mediterranean that is based on NH 4 uptake. Mixotrophs and autotrophs share the same division rate (~0.3 day −1) in the mixed layer (surface 50 m) where the inorganic nutrient is the limiting factor in the simulations. The autotrophs then reach a maximum daily division rate of ~0.5 day −1 at 60 m depth where the transition of N to C limitation happens, and then decrease rapidly to zero at 90 m depth owing to light limitation. In contrast, the mixotrophs have a deeper maximum growth rate of ~0.5 day −1 at 80 m depth where the transition of N to C limitation occurs and gradually decrease to ~0.2 day −1 at 125 m depth (Fig. 3b). The deeper maximum division depth of the mixotrophs and their ability to maintain a population at depths where photosynthesis is not sufficient are supported by the DOC utilization, which is presented as a black line in Fig. 3b. In the mixotrophic simulation, the contribution of DOC uptake to the vertically integrated total production is ~12%, and ~43% when light becomes the limiting factor, below the red stripe in Fig. 3b. The contribution of DOC and the maximal depth at which Prochlorococcus can grow are broadly consistent with the division rate profile model and are sensitive to parameter values that control the nutritional value of the DOC-like substance (and that cannot be a priori constrained by empirical data at this point; Methods). Notably, the horizontal stripes in Fig. 3b indicate the depth at which limitation shifted from nutrients to C in the two ensembles of simulations. The simulated mixotrophic cells grow deeper than the purely autotrophic ones, taking up inorganic nutrients and leading to a notably deeper nutricline (Fig. 3c).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^7e2a755d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — populations needing different management and alternatives to testing: These recommendations should not be extrapolated to individuals with conditions known to substantially impact vitamin D physiology, including malabsorption (eg, from gastric bypass), increased vitamin D catabolism, renal loss of vitamin D metabolites, and decreased vitamin D activation. With regard to 25(OH)D screening, the panel noted that 2 risk scoring systems can predict serum 25(OH)D concentrations lower than 20 ng/mL and 12 ng/mL (< 50 and < 30 nmol/L), respectively, with reasonable accuracy, and thus may be useful in clinical practice to identify persons aged 55 to 85 years at high risk for low vitamin D without the need for 25(OH)D testing. Risk factors in these scoring systems include low sunlight exposure, alcohol use, smoking, season, medication use, no vitamin use, and limited outdoor activities such as gardening and bicycling.

### NMR-based evaluation of the metabolic profile and response to dichloroacetate of human prostate cancer cells [^206958a7]. NMR in Biomedicine (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Simplified diagram containing the cellular anaerobic glycolytic pathway and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: note the regeneration of NAD + through the glycolysis process. Some of the steps between fructose 1,6-phosphate (fructose 1,6-PO 4) and phosphoenolpyruvate have been omitted for clarity.

In contrast with normal cells, cancer cells derive a higher proportion of their energy from lactic acid fermentation, even in the presence of oxygen, despite the fact that it is a highly inefficient process. A high rate of aerobic glycolysis, followed by lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol, was first described in cancer cells by Otto Warburg in the 1920s, and is now known as the Warburg effect. Conversion of pyruvate to lactate regenerates the oxidised form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +), necessary as a co-factor for continued glycolysis and associated anabolic pathways, which are needed for tumour cell proliferation. Thus, the altered metabolism seen in cancer cells is thought to confer a survival advantage to the cells.

A number of other metabolic changes have been reported in cancer cells. For example, the MYC gene that regulates mitochondrial glutamine metabolism is frequently dysregulated in human cancers. Thus, cancer cells exhibit increased glutamine metabolism, and the resulting products are used as precursors for the synthesis of other amino acids, such as proline, arginine and ornithine. Other studies have estimated that around 60% of glutamine in cancer cells is used to promote lactate and alanine production. Cancer cells have also been shown to have elevated de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which has been associated with evasion from cellular apoptosis. However, certain cancer cells may display signs of increased fatty acid oxidation, as it can provide an alternative energy source. There is good evidence that increased lactate metabolism is associated with a higher rate of metastasis formation, and that the targeting of lactate production with drugs, such as dichloroacetate (DCA) (see below), could be effective against metastases.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^21c9521d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Calcium balance in CKD — rationale and evidence: Approximately 99% of total-body calcium is found in the skeleton and the rest is present in the extracellular and intracellular spaces, and serum calcium concentration is maintained in the normal range until very late in CKD, when it decreases slightly. Serum calcium levels do not reflect overall body calcium balance and may not be very informative except at extremes. The evidence review included 3 small short-term clinical trials in CKD patients not receiving dialysis that investigated the effect of calcium intake in the form of food or supplements on mineral bone biomarkers and calcium balance. In an NRCT, 51 patients in the early stage of CKD (creatinine clearance, 66–82 mL/min) were placed on a low-protein (40 g/d) and low-phosphorus (600 mg/d) diet supplemented with or without 0.5 g/d of elemental calcium for 10 days, and a decrease in intact PTH level was observed only in the group receiving calcium supplementation with no changes in serum calcium, phosphorus, and calcitriol levels in the other groups.

### Endogenous clock-mediated regulation of intracellular oxygen dynamics is essential for diazotrophic growth of unicellular cyanobacteria [^4b051e65]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Living organisms constantly need to adapt to rhythmic changes in their environment that are generated by the Earth's rotation. To adapt to such constantly changing conditions, most organisms have evolved to develop an endogenous time-keeping system that proactively synchronizes physiological processes to the external light-dark cycle. Over the years, studies have established intimate connections between this time-keeping clock and cellular metabolism across all phylogenetic groups, with the endogenous rhythms orchestrating key parameters like growth, development, stress response, and reproductive fitness –.

Concerted efforts over decades have unraveled various facets of the circadian clock in different model systems. The simplest model organisms to possess a bona fide and fully functional internal clock are cyanobacteria, oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes. Cyanobacteria have inhabited our planet for billions of years and have successfully transitioned through the extremely harsh environmental and geophysical conditions that prevailed during different phases of Earth's evolutionary history. Some of the key events that shaped Earth's early biome and its evolution thereafter include the nitrogen crisis, which led to the emergence of nitrogen-fixing organisms, and cyanobacteria-mediated transformation of Earth's initial reducing geochemical environment into an oxidizing one, that resulted in the burgeoning of aerobic life on our planet. Moreover, due to various geophysical events, the earth's rotation period changed significantly over the history of our planet, subjecting evolving microbes to major day-length changes. Central to the coping mechanisms deemed necessary for survival and fitness under these changing circumstances, was the evolution of a timekeeping mechanism that would orchestrate the physiological processes of microbes in response to the environment.

### Branched tricarboxylic acid metabolism in plasmodium falciparum [^92f0166e]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

A central hub of carbon metabolism is the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which serves to connect the processes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, respiration, amino acid synthesis and other biosynthetic pathways. The protozoan intracellular malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), however, have long been suspected of possessing a significantly streamlined carbon metabolic network in which tricarboxylic acid metabolism plays a minor role. Blood-stage Plasmodium parasites rely almost entirely on glucose fermentation for energy and consume minimal amounts of oxygen, yet the parasite genome encodes all of the enzymes necessary for a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle. Here, by tracing (13)C-labelled compounds using mass spectrometry we show that tricarboxylic acid metabolism in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is largely disconnected from glycolysis and is organized along a fundamentally different architecture from the canonical textbook pathway. We find that this pathway is not cyclic, but rather is a branched structure in which the major carbon sources are the amino acids glutamate and glutamine. As a consequence of this branched architecture, several reactions must run in the reverse of the standard direction, thereby generating two-carbon units in the form of acetyl-coenzyme A. We further show that glutamine-derived acetyl-coenzyme A is used for histone acetylation, whereas glucose-derived acetyl-coenzyme A is used to acetylate amino sugars. Thus, the parasite has evolved two independent production mechanisms for acetyl-coenzyme A with different biological functions. These results significantly clarify our understanding of the Plasmodium metabolic network and highlight the ability of altered variants of central carbon metabolism to arise in response to unique environments.

### NAD (H) homeostasis underlies host protection mediated by glycolytic myeloid cells in tuberculosis [^a1dd0850]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Glycolysis is of particular interest – since it is the pathway in central carbon metabolism by which cells oxidize glucose to pyruvate, simultaneously converting ADP and NAD + to ATP and NADH, respectively. While glycolysis is often thought of as coupled with mitochondrial respiration under aerobic conditions, myeloid cells maintain high levels of flux through this anaerobic pathway even in the presence of oxygen to drive inflammation across many systems, referred to as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect. Initial studies using nonvirulent Mtb (i.e. killed or attenuated) suggest that Mtb infection prompts macrophages, a myeloid subset, to carry out aerobic glycolysis, but a growing body of literature indicates that live, virulent Mtb decreases the glycolytic capacity of macrophages following infection. Other studies associate glycolytic flux in macrophages with bacillary control both in vitro and in vivo. However, causally implicating glycolysis in these studies has been confounded by using experimental manipulations that lead to large-scale disruption of glycolysis and connected pathways, such as the use of 2-deoxy- D -glucose (2DG), an inhibitor of glucose uptake, and deletion of Hif1A, the gene encoding the highly conserved transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α). Consequences of inhibition with 2DG are a complete inhibition of glycolysis and dysregulation of the linked pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the TCA cycle, which uses the end-product of glycolysis, i.e. pyruvate, as a substrate. Similarly, HIF1α has been shown to broadly regulate the expression of enzymes involved in glycolysisas well as transcriptional regulation, cytoskeletal organization, and other essential cellular processes. Therefore, an experimental approach that selectively targets a distinct step in glycolysis during Mtb infection would provide compelling evidence for its role in the control of TB.

### Inborn disorders of the malate aspartate shuttle [^a72e0a67]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic flux through NAD + ‐dependent pathways affects cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD + /NADH ratios. Glycolysis is an important NAD + dependent pathway that both affects and is affected by the cytosolic NAD + /NADH ratio. For glycolysis to continue, a high NAD + /NADH ratio is required for the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate into 1,3‐bisphosphoglycerate by glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12), in which NAD + is converted into NADH. Re‐oxidation of NADH can either be accomplished via the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) or by the conversion of oxaloacetate into malate by MDH1 (Figure 2). Converting glucose into lactate consumes and regenerates an equal amount of NAD +, and additionally results in the production of 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. However, re‐oxidation of NADH via MDH1, and the subsequent transfer of reducing equivalents to the ETC, coupled with the transfer of pyruvate across the mitochondrial membrane and its subsequent full oxidation to CO 2 and H 2 O, results in the production of 36 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Therefore, re‐oxidation of NADH via the MAS provides more energy as it supports both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. In addition, sufficient NAD + regeneration is also necessary for oxidative synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids, such as serine. The first step of serine biosynthesis is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH, EC 1.1.1.95), another NAD + ‐dependent enzyme. The synthesis of serine from glucose includes two oxidative steps catalyzed by GAPDH and PHGDH, requiring two molecules of NAD +. Therefore, other metabolic pathways that need serine, including synthesis of cysteine, glycine, but also one‐carbon metabolism, indirectly require NAD +. The MAS plays an essential role in redox balance and consequently in the continuation of the metabolic pathways mentioned earlier.

### A redox cycle within the cell cycle: ring in the old with the new [^73693cea]. Oncogene (2007). Low credibility.

In recent years, the intracellular oxidation-reduction (redox) state has gained increasing attention as a critical mediator of cell signaling, gene expression changes and proliferation. This review discusses the evidence for a redox cycle (i.e., fluctuation in the cellular redox state) regulating the cell cycle. The presence of redox-sensitive motifs (cysteine residues, metal co-factors in kinases and phosphatases) in several cell cycle regulatory proteins indicate periodic oscillations in intracellular redox state could play a central role in regulating progression from G0/G1 to S to G2 and M cell cycle phases. Fluctuations in the intracellular redox state during cell cycle progression could represent a fundamental mechanism linking oxidative metabolic processes to cell cycle regulatory processes. Proliferative disorders are central to a variety of human pathophysiological conditions thought to involve oxidative stress. Therefore, a more complete understanding of redox control of the cell cycle could provide a biochemical rationale for manipulating aberrant cell proliferation.

### New clarity on the warburg effect | Frederick national laboratory… [^506b3aad]. frederick.cancer.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

Increased glucose uptake permits higher production of the reducing equivalent NADPH by the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, and fermentation involves regeneration of the oxidizing equivalent NAD+ via the action of lactate dehydrogenase. Other models have suggested that aerobic glycolysis optimizes for ATP production, or results from molecular crowding. A definitive explanation for why aerobic glycolysis is associated with cell growth has been lacking and is an area of active investigation. We found that endowing cells with various means to regenerate NAD+ independently of LDH restored proliferation rates in cells in which aerobic glycolysis was suppressed, confirming that fermentation supports proliferation by promoting NAD+ regeneration. However, these results were surprising since the mitochondrial electron transport chain can regenerate NAD+ when oxygen is available.

Given that our experiments were performed in normoxia, we faced an unanticipated question: why is the ETC inadequate to maintain NAD+ homeostasis in some rapidly proliferating cells. While fermentation allows for NAD+ regeneration uncoupled from ATP synthase, glycolysis is redox neutral and does not net regenerate NAD+. Thus, why increased glucose uptake and glycolysis are also often associated with proliferation remains an open question. Nevertheless, our model to explain why many proliferating cells engage in aerobic glycolysis is consistent with other observations in cancer. Aerobic glycolysis is best characterized by a shift of pyruvate carbons away from the TCA cycle and towards fermentation, rather than an upregulation of glycolysis at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation. This distinction is a subtle but important one, as ETC activity has been showed to be required for tumorigenesis and cell proliferation.

Proliferating cells have high requirements for NAD+, as this cofactor is needed to catabolize reduced nutrients and to synthesize oxidized biomolecules. Our study shows that in regimes of high NAD+ demand, ATP synthase activity constrains NAD+ regeneration by the ETC and fermentation, rather than pyruvate oxidation, is preferred as a supplementary NAD+ producing pathway. Therefore, aerobic glycolysis reflects a metabolic state in which the demand for NAD+ for oxidation reaction supersedes the cellular demand for ATP.

### Cooperative transport mechanism of human monocarboxylate transporter 2 [^6748015c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pyruvate and lactate are the end products of glycolysis and major substrates for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. They constitute critical branch points in cellular metabolism, lying at the intersection of catabolic pathways with anabolic pathways for lipid synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and gluconeogenesis. Indeed, dysregulated carbon metabolism becomes emerging hallmarks of diabetes, obesity, and cancer –. Under aerobic conditions, glucose was generally assumed to be fully catabolized to carbon dioxide in cells via the concerted action of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. However, in recent years, there is an increased awareness of the metabolic flexibility, in which glycolysis and the TCA cycle are uncoupled, thus allowing independent cell-specific regulation of both processes. Notably, circulating lactate was recently demonstrated to be a major source of carbon for the TCA cycle both in normal and cancerous tissues, highlighting the physiological significance of monocarboxylate transport.

In human, the rapid exchange of both cellular lactate and pyruvate with the circulation is mainly mediated by MCTs encoded by the SLC16 family members. The aim of this study is to address two fundamental questions surrounding this process. The first question is related to the cellular environment in which MCTs operate. When the cellular lactate concentration is high, such as that in glycolytically active cells, MCTs transport monocarboxylate efficiently to facilitate lactate efflux, maintaining an intracellular pH and monocarboxylate homeostasis. While in glycolytically inactive cells with low cellular monocarboxylate concentration, MCTs transport monocarboxylates slowly or even shut down to maintain a physiological monocarboxylate concentration inside the cell, especially that of pyruvate. Maintaining cellular pyruvate above a minimum concentration is important to ensure that pyruvate is reduced to L-lactate, regenerating cytosolic NAD + from NADH and thus allowing glycolysis to continue. To understand the properties of MCTs, we should first address whether MCTs can adjust their transport activities in response to monocarboxylate concentration. If the answer for the first question is yes, then the second question is how MCTs sense the difference in monocarboxylate concentration.

To address the above questions, we performed pyruvate transport assay and cryo-EM structural analysis on MCT2. The cryo-EM structure, as well as the detailed functional assay, reveal a striking switch-like behavior arising from the strong inter-subunit cooperativity of the MCT2 dimer during transport, and provide insights into substrate recognition, energy coupling, and the transport mechanism of MCT2.

Fig. 4
Hyperglycaemia may affect ten-eleven translocation (TET) and Jumonji C (JmjC) activity by altering Fe 2+ availability. a Hyperglycaemia increases flux through the polyol pathway, which consumes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Reduced glutathione (GSH) and vitamin C levels may decrease as a result, decreasing the regeneration of Fe 2+ which is required by TET and JmjC enzymes. Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hyperglycaemia may also affect Fe 2+ regeneration. b An increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in hyperglycaemia may increase the intracellular labile Fe 2+ pool and thus increase TET and JmjC activity. Abbreviations: glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6P2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3 BPG)

Steady-state cellular redox is often measured by ratios of oxidised and reduced forms of NAD and glutathione (NADH/NAD+ and GSH/GSSG respectively). The delicate balance of these agents determines the ability of a cell to undergo oxidation and reduction reactions which are crucial for many cellular processes including iron metabolism. When ECs are exposed to hyperglycaemia, excess glucose is utilised by the polyol pathway, which consumes NADPH and generates NADH, resulting in an abnormal NADH/NAD+ balance. Furthermore, this impairs generation of the reduced form of glutathione by glutathione reductase, which requires NADPH for its activity. Glutathione is a major cellular redox buffer which, amongst many other functions, is responsible for regenerating the reduced form of vitamin C, necessary for optimal 2-OGDD activity (Fig. 4 a).

### Sucrose-driven carbon redox rebalancing eliminates the crabtree effect and boosts energy metabolism in yeast [^4caf3ec9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used as a model organism in industrial production due to its well-characterised genetic background and strong robustness. However, it prioritises alcoholic fermentation over respiration for energy production when glucose is abundant, a phenomenon known as the Crabtree effect. In S. cerevisiae, one glucose molecule can yield 32 molecules of ATP through respiration, whereas fermentation produces only two molecules of ATP. The low energy efficiency of the fermentation pathway limits biomass production and the synthesis of non-ethanol chemicals, particularly when abundant redox power is required. The metabolic shift induced by the Crabtree effect is generally attributed to the higher enzymatic efficiency of glycolysis. The ability to synthesise ATP per unit mass is significantly higher for glycolytic enzymes than for respiratory enzymes. Additionally, the high glycolytic flux suppresses respiration-related genes, causing pyruvate to be rapidly converted to ethanol rather than entering the mitochondria. Several strategies have been explored to engineer Crabtree-negative strains, each with distinct advantages and limitations (Supplementary Data 1). For instance, engineering Crabtree-negative yeast involves deleting the genes PDC1/5/6, which encode pyruvate decarboxylase, thereby preventing ethanol accumulation. However, this approach leads to insufficient acetyl-CoA supply and inadequate NAD + regeneration, leading to an imbalance in the NADH/NAD + ratio, which impairs cell growth. Pyruvate decarboxylase-negative strains cannot grow in glucose-rich media. An alternative approach for overcoming the Crabtree effect is to increase NADH oxidation for ATP synthesis. However, this approach cannot completely eliminate overflow metabolism, leading to carbon wastage. Therefore, we believe that the principal strategy to overcoming the Crabtree effect is to rewire central carbon metabolism without disrupting the NADH/NAD + balance. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to adjust the relationship between glycolytic flux and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle while ensuring efficient NAD + regeneration.

### Inborn errors of metabolism with hyperammonemia: urea cycle defects and related disorders [^4a32d815]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on urea cycle disorders:

- **Definition**: UCDs are a group of rare inborn metabolic errors caused by deficiencies in enzymes or transporters of the urea cycle, leading to the accumulation of ammonia and other toxic metabolites in the body. These disorders include deficenies of N-acetylglutamate synthase, carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1, ornithine transcarbamylase, arginosuccinate synthetase (citrullinemia type 1), argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinic aciduria), arginase, ornithine translocase (hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome), and citrin (citrullinemia type 2).
- **Pathophysiology**: The urea cycle is the primary pathway for converting excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, into urea for excretion. Deficiencies in specific enzymes or transporters disrupt this cycle, leading to the accumulation of ammonia (with a normal anion gap and normal blood glucose) and other metabolites (such as glutamine, alanine, and asparagine). Hyperammonemia disrupts potassium homeostasis and water transport in the brain, resulting in cytotoxic cerebral edema.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of UCDs in the US is estimated at 1 per 35,000 births.
- **Disease course**: Complete enzyme or transporter deficiencies typically present with severe hyperammonemia within the first week of life, causing symptoms such as vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, hypothermia, and coma. Partial deficiencies usually present later in life with milder symptoms, including protein aversion, food refusal, frequent vomiting, poor appetite, and adverse reactions to high-protein foods. Hyperammonemic episodes may be triggered by infections, high protein intake, certain drugs, or other stressors, leading to acute metabolic decompensation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of UCDs varies according to the specific disorder, the severity of enzyme deficiency, and the timing of diagnosis and intervention. Early detection through newborn screening and prompt management can improve outcomes and reduce the risk of severe neurological damage. Fatality during the first hyperammonemic episode in neonatal-onset UCDs has been reported at 27%, but it is declining with the widespread use of RRT.

Box 1 Oxygen and ROS in cell signaling and pathology

The primary cellular organelle that utilizes oxygen is the mitochondrion during oxidative phosphorylation, the ETC and ATP synthesis (see Fig. 3). Consequently, it is considered a major producer of ROS within the cell. It is hypothesized that singular electrons that leak from Complex I and III are available to then reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide (O 2
- -). Notably, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases are also a significant source of cellular O 2
- -. There are a number of antioxidant systems that sequester ROS, such as by superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyzes the dismutation of O 2
- - into a more stable product - hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). H 2 O 2 is then reduced to water by catalase (CAT) or glutathione peroxidase (GPX). H 2 O 2 is an important signal transduction molecule involved in the activation and regulation of a number of different metabolic pathways. This includes regulation of HIFs, cellular proliferation and differentiation pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, cellular growth through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway and cellular apoptosis through the nuclear factor- κ B (NF- κ B) pathway. Furthermore, an increase in ROS production as a result of NADPH oxidase activation upon infection has been linked to the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines.

Antioxidant safeguards are overwhelmed when there is mitochondrial damage or increased activation of NADPH oxidase, such as in the case of ischemic/ reperfusion injury. The accumulation of O 2
- - and/or H 2 O 2 can lead to the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl free radicals (HO•-) via a Haber-Weiss reaction, which in turn cause severe oxidative stress through lipid, protein and DNA oxidation. It is also well-established that hypoxia induces oxidative stress. The precise mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced ROS production remains unknown. However, one hypothesis is that a higher ratio of NADH/NAD+ under these conditions in turn increases electron transport through protein complex I, thus promoting O 2
- - production. Additionally, unstable intermediates (e.g. ubisemiquinone) of the Q-cycle are also believed to contribute to O 2
- - production under non-phosphorylating conditions. This highlights the need to maintain the oxygen homeostasis within engineered tissues, as there is evidence that both hyperoxic and hypoxic environments can lead to pathologic ROS generation.
