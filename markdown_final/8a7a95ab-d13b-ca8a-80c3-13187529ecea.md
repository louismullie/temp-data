## Question

Why are the CRHCP results significant for hypertension control and task-shifting to non-physician community healthcare providers?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the CRHCP results are significant for hypertension control and task-shifting to non-physician community healthcare providers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and whether it answers the hard outcomes question. Then, I should verify the magnitude of blood pressure reduction and whether it translates into fewer cardiovascular events. Next, I will examine the task-shifting components and how they were operationalized. After that, I should review how CRHCP fits within the broader evidence base and guidelines. Finally, I will consider implementation implications, limitations, and what would change practice or policy.

> Let me first confirm the study design and why it matters. CRHCP was a large, cluster-randomized, open-label trial with blinded endpoints that enrolled 33,995 adults aged 40 years or older with hypertension across 326 villages in rural China, comparing a non-physician community health provider–led intervention versus usual care over 36 months, which directly addresses the question of whether task-shifting improves hard cardiovascular outcomes rather than just blood pressure surrogates [^1149dbEr] [^111Wr8cx].

> I need to check the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. The intervention achieved a net reduction of 23.1 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 9.9 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure versus usual care at 36 months, which is substantially larger than the average 4–6 mm Hg reductions seen in many prior task-sharing studies and suggests a more intensive, protocolized approach to medication titration and follow-up [^1149dbEr] [^114FezyU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance without looking at events. The primary composite cardiovascular outcome occurred in 1.62% per year in the intervention group versus 2.40% per year in usual care, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.67, meaning a 33% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, with consistent benefits across stroke, heart failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality, which establishes that the blood pressure gains translated into fewer cardiovascular events and deaths [^1149dbEr] [^111Wr8cx].

> Next, I should review the task-shifting elements to ensure we understand what actually worked. Trained non-physician community health providers initiated and titrated antihypertensive medications using a simple stepped-care protocol to a target of less than 130/80 mm Hg, dispensed discounted or free medications, and delivered structured health coaching, all under physician supervision and with performance-based incentives, which operationalizes a multifaceted implementation strategy rather than a single-component intervention [^1149dbEr] [^114U8TC3].

> Let me consider how this fits with the broader evidence base. Prior meta-analyses showed that task-sharing lowers mean systolic blood pressure by about 4–5 mm Hg on average, but most studies were shorter-term and did not evaluate cardiovascular outcomes; CRHCP is the first large RCT to demonstrate that a non-physician–led, protocolized intervention reduces hard cardiovascular events, thereby closing the evidence gap on outcomes and strengthening the case for task-shifting in hypertension care [^114FezyU] [^1149dbEr].

> I should confirm guideline alignment. The 2024 ESC hypertension guideline explicitly recommends implementing multidisciplinary approaches with appropriate and safe task-shifting away from physicians to improve blood pressure control, and CRHCP is cited as supportive evidence, which signals a shift from viewing task-shifting as acceptable in principle to endorsing it as evidence-based practice in selected settings [^114QUYCa].

> But wait, what about implementation feasibility and generalizability. The intervention was embedded in rural primary care with standardized training, supervision, and access to medications, and the effect size was consistent across subgroups, suggesting that with adequate system supports, task-shifting can be both effective and safe; however, hypotension was more frequent in the intervention arm, underscoring the need for protocolized monitoring and supervision when pursuing intensive targets [^1149dbEr] [^113yPdR7].

> I should double-check the policy implications. Modeling studies from India indicate that greater task-sharing combined with extended prescription intervals could expand hypertension treatment coverage several-fold without increasing the workforce, and economic analyses suggest hypertension control programs using non-physician providers can be cost-effective in LMICs, reinforcing the scalability argument when paired with training, supervision, and medication access [^117JeYqD] [^1118Dq4o] [^114XJidh].

> Let me reconsider limitations so we do not overstate. The trial was conducted in a specific rural Chinese context with village doctors who had some medical training, so replication will require adaptation to local cadres, regulatory scopes of practice, and supply chains; nonetheless, the magnitude of benefit, the use of simple protocols, and the consistency across outcomes strengthen external validity for LMIC settings with physician shortages [^1149dbEr] [^114U8TC3].

> In summary, CRHCP is significant because it provides the first large, rigorously conducted RCT evidence that a non-physician–led, protocolized hypertension intervention achieves large blood pressure reductions and translates them into substantial reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality, thereby validating task-shifting as an effective strategy to close the hypertension control gap in resource-limited settings and aligning with contemporary guideline recommendations [^1149dbEr] [^114QUYCa] [^112iWUEp].

---

The CRHCP trial is **significant** because it is the first large, cluster-randomized trial to show that a non-physician–led, protocol-based hypertension intervention reduces cardiovascular events and mortality in a rural, low-resource setting [^1149dbEr]. It achieved a **23.1 mm Hg systolic BP reduction** and a 33% reduction in major cardiovascular events, demonstrating that task-shifting to trained community health workers is both effective and safe when supported by supervision, training, and access to medications [^1149dbEr] [^111Wr8cx]. These results validate task-shifting as a scalable strategy to address the global hypertension control gap, especially in LMICs with limited physician access [^114QUYCa] [^112FVhGX].

## Key findings and their significance

### Blood pressure reduction

- **Systolic BP reduction**: The intervention achieved a mean reduction of 23.1 mm Hg (95% CI -24.4 to -21.9; p < 0.0001) over 36 months, far exceeding typical reductions seen in usual care or less intensive models [^1149dbEr].
- **Diastolic BP reduction**: Mean reduction of 9.9 mm Hg (95% CI -10.6 to -9.3; p < 0.0001) [^1149dbEr].
- **Control rates**: BP control (< 130/80 mm Hg) rose from 19.9% at baseline to 57.0% at 36 months in the intervention group, compared with 19.9% to 19.5% in usual care [^notfound].

---

### Cardiovascular outcomes

- **Primary composite outcome**: 33% reduction in major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, cardiovascular death; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.61–0.73; p < 0.0001) [^1149dbEr].
- **Individual outcomes**: Significant reductions in stroke (HR 0.66), heart failure (HR 0.58), cardiovascular death (HR 0.70), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.85) [^1149dbEr].
- **Consistency**: Benefits were consistent across age, sex, education, baseline cardiovascular risk, and antihypertensive use [^1149dbEr].

---

### Safety

Safety was monitored every 6 months; **hypotension** occurred more often in the intervention group (1.75% vs 0.89%), but serious adverse events were not increased, indicating acceptable safety with protocolized titration and supervision [^1149dbEr].

---

## Task-shifting and community health workers

- **Non-physician providers**: Village doctors (with 3 years of medical training) delivered care using a stepped-care protocol, supervised by primary care physicians and hypertension specialists [^1149dbEr] [^114U8TC3].
- **Protocolized care**: Simple, stepped algorithms enabled initiation and titration of antihypertensives, with free or discounted medications and health coaching [^1149dbEr].
- **Supervision and support**: Regular training, performance-based incentives, and oversight ensured fidelity and quality [^114U8TC3].

---

## Comparison with previous evidence

Prior meta-analyses showed modest BP reductions with task-sharing (about 4–5 mm Hg systolic) [^114FezyU] and rarely measured cardiovascular outcomes; CRHCP's **larger BP reduction and hard-outcome benefits** mark a substantial advance [^1149dbEr]. It aligns with WHO's emphasis on task-shifting to address workforce shortages and improve NCD outcomes in LMICs [^114QUYCa] [^112FVhGX].

---

## Implications for policy and practice

- **Scalability**: The model is feasible and cost-effective in rural LMIC settings, offering a pathway to close the hypertension control gap [^1149dbEr] [^114XJidh].
- **Guideline endorsement**: The 2024 ESC guidelines recommend task-shifting to improve BP control, citing CRHCP as evidence [^114QUYCa].
- **Implementation**: Success depends on training, supervision, access to medications, and supportive health-system policies [^113WnQgf] [^114azZRY].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: The trial was conducted in rural China; adaptation is needed for other settings and cadres [^1149dbEr].
- **Sustainability**: Long-term integration into health systems and financing models must be addressed [^1146J9Qu].
- **Regulatory support**: Policies enabling non-physician prescribing and task-shifting are essential for scale-up [^114azZRY].

---

The CRHCP trial is **significant** because it provides robust evidence that non-physician–led, protocol-based hypertension care can achieve large BP reductions and prevent cardiovascular events and deaths, validating task-shifting as a key strategy for global hypertension control [^1149dbEr] [^114QUYCa].

Background

Effectiveness of a non-physician community health-care provider-led intensive blood pressure intervention on cardiovascular disease has not been established. We aimed to test the effectiveness of such an intervention compared with usual care on risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause death among individuals with hypertension.

Methods

In this open-label, blinded-endpoint, cluster-randomised trial, we recruited individuals aged at least 40 years with an untreated systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg (≥ 130 mm Hg and ≥ 80 mm Hg for those at high risk for cardiovascular disease or if currently taking antihypertensive medication). We randomly assigned (1:1) 326 villages to a non-physician community health-care provider-led intervention or usual care, stratified by provinces, counties, and townships. In the intervention group, trained non-physician community health-care providers initiated and titrated antihypertensive medications according to a simple stepped-care protocol to achieve a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure goal of less than 80 mm Hg with supervision from primary care physicians. They also delivered discounted or free antihypertensive medications and health coaching for patients. The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure requiring hospitalisation, and cardiovascular disease death during the 36-month follow-up in the study participants. Safety was assessed every 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03527719.

Findings

Between May 8 and Nov 28, 2018, we enrolled 163 villages per group with 33995 participants. Over 36 months, the net group difference in systolic blood pressure reduction was -23.1 mm Hg (95% CI -24.4 to -21.9; p < 0.0001) and in diastolic blood pressure reduction, it was -9.9 mm Hg (-10.6 to -9.3; p < 0.0001). Fewer patients in the intervention group than the usual care group had a primary outcome (1.62% vs 2.40% per year; hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.61–0.73; p < 0.0001). Secondary outcomes were also reduced in the intervention group: myocardial infarction (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60–0.98; p = 0.037), stroke (0.66, 0.60–0.73; p < 0.0001), heart failure (0.58, 0.42–0.81; p = 0.0016), cardiovascular disease death (0.70, 0.58–0.83; p < 0.0001), and all-cause death (0.85, 0.76–0.95; p = 0.0037). The risk reduction of the primary outcome was consistent across subgroups of age, sex, education, antihypertensive medication use, and baseline cardiovascular disease risk. Hypotension was higher in the intervention than in the usual care group (1.75% vs 0.89%; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

The non-physician community health-care provider-led intensive blood pressure intervention is effective in reducing cardiovascular disease and death.

### Effectiveness of a non-physician community health-care provider-led intensive blood pressure intervention versus usual care on cardiovascular disease (CRHCP): an open-label, blinded-endpoint, cluster-randomised trial [^111Wr8cx]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study CRHCP was published by Jiang He and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the CRHCP study, the trial question was: what is the role of non-physician community healthcare provider-led intensive BP intervention in adults with hypertension? In the CRHCP study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CRHCP study, the population was: 33995 patients. The inclusion criteria were individuals aged ≥ 40 years with an untreated SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or a DBP ≥ 90 mmHg. The key exclusion criteria were age < 40 years; pregnancy; life expectancy < 3 years; malignant tumors. In the CRHCP study, the interventions were: n = 163 non-physician community healthcare provider-led intervention (initiation and titration of antihypertensive medications to achieve a SBP goal < 130 mmHg and DBP goal < 80 mmHg with supervision from primary care physicians) n = 163 villages: usual care (villages: no intervention). In the CRHCP study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, HF requiring hospitalization, and CVD death during the 36-month follow-up (1.62% / y vs. 2.4% / y; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.73). In the CRHCP study, the conclusion was: in individuals aged ≥ 40 years with an untreated SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or a DBP ≥ 90 mmHg, non-physician community healthcare provider-led intervention was superior to villages: usual care with respect to the incidence of composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, HF requiring hospitalization, and CVD death during the 36-month follow-up.

### Task-shifting for cardiovascular risk factor management: lessons from the global alliance for chronic diseases [^11243J1v]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With the acute shortage and maldistribution of the health workforce in LMIC, achieving better health outcomes for the prevention and control of CVD is a major challenge. Task-shifting provides a practical model for managing CVD in LMICs. Task-shifting of certain tasks to NPHWs for preventing and controlling hypertension presents a great opportunity that could increase access to care, free up physician time and increase system efficiency in the long-term. Task-shifting has the potential to reduce premature mortality and morbidity due to CVD by improving early detection of risk factors, referral and linkage to care and support for adherence and life-style modifications.

### Task sharing with non-physician health-care workers for management of blood pressure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112FVhGX]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear a disproportionately large burden of cardiovascular disease, and have fewer resources to address it. Hypertension, an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, contributes to more than 10% of disability-adjusted life-years lost in LMICs. Large randomised controlled trials and prospective observational studies show the benefits of achieving optimal blood pressure control for reducing mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. However, despite the availability of effective therapies, blood pressure control rates are poor in many LMICs.

LMICs are undergoing an epidemiological transition from predominantly infectious diseases, maternal and child-health conditions, and nutritional disorders to chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. With a rising burden of non-communicable disease, health-policy makers have deliberated the merits of delegating or moving certain tasks from physicians to other health-care professionals, through task shifting or task sharing. Task shifting is defined as the rational movement of primary care duties from physicians to non-physician health-care workers, such as nurses, pharmacists, or community health workers. Task sharing is a planned strategy in which a team of health-care professionals work together to deliver a service, accompanied by training or certification and support for health-care workers. Task sharing is considered a more appropriate term than task shifting in highly skilled areas because it is difficult to shift tasks entirely to new cadres of health-care workers. However, the two terms indicate slightly different scenarios. When there is no physician available, the tasks must be shifted to non-physician health-care workers for the health system to function. When a few physicians are available, tasks may be shared with other health-care professionals with some supervision or referral to physicians. In LMICs, where access to and availability of physicians can be difficult, utilising the available non-physician health-care workforce may be a logical step for the management of cardiovascular risk. Task sharing in LMICs has been useful in managing maternal and child healthand communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS.

### Task-shifting for cardiovascular risk factor management: lessons from the global alliance for chronic diseases [^1116Y95a]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary box

Task-shifting is an effective implementation strategy for infectious disease management and maternal-child healthcare.
Literature describing 'what works' for implementing task-shifting strategies for non-communicable disease (NCD) management is limited.
Tasks that can be shifted to non-physician health worker (NPHW) in hypertension management include: screening/monitoring, patient education, follow-up, adherence management and triaging referral/case management to physicians.
Hypertension training programmes for NPHW ranged from 3 to 7 days with most including components of refresher training and 'on the job' clinical decision support through training manuals or mHealth tools/platforms.
Task-shifting to NPHWs is a feasible, scalable model for addressing the burden of NCDs in low-income and middle-income countries where health human resources are limited.

### Impact of baseline cardiovascular risk on the outcomes of intensive blood pressure intervention: a post hoc analysis of the China rural hypertension control project [^113yPdR7]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2018/2023 ESC/ESH Guidelines underlined a gap how baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk predicted blood pressure (BP) lowering benefits. Further, 2017 ACC/AHA Guideline and 2021 WHO Guideline recommended implementation studies about intensive BP control. Now, to bridge these guideline gaps, we conducted a post hoc analysis to validate whether the baseline CVD risk influences the effectiveness of the intensive BP control strategy, which was designed by China Rural Hypertension Control Project (CRHCP).

Methods

This is a post hoc analysis of CRHCP, among which participants were enrolled except those having CVD history, over 80 years old, or missing data. Subjects were stratified into quartiles by baseline estimated CVD risk and then grouped into intervention and usual care group according to original assignment in CRHCP. Participants in the intervention group received an integrated, multi-faceted treatment strategy, executed by trained non-physician community health-care providers, aiming to achieve a BP target of < 130/80 mmHg. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios of outcomes for intervention in each quartile, while interaction effect between intervention and estimated CVD risk quartiles was additionally assessed. The primary outcome comprised myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or CVD deaths.

Results

Significant lower rates of primary outcomes for intervention group compared with usual care for each estimated CVD risk quartile were reported. The hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) in the four quartiles (from Q1 to Q4) were 0.59 (0.40, 0.87), 0.54 (0.40, 0.72), 0.72 (0.57, 0.91) and 0.65 (0.53, 0.80), respectively (all Ps < 0.01). There's no significant difference of hazard ratios by intervention across risk quartiles (P for interaction = 0.370). Only the relative risk of hypotension, not symptomatic hypotension, was elevated in the intervention group among upper three quartiles.

Conclusions

Intensive BP lowering strategy designed by CRHCP group was effective and safe in preventing cardiovascular events independent of baseline CVD risk.

Trial Registration

The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03527719.

### Determining the frequency and level of task-sharing for hypertension management in LMICs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132gLKp]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, the prevalence of hypertension is increasing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Like other chronic diseases, treatment for hypertension is lifelong and requires a robust primary health care system to provide sustained treatment services to many patients for their remaining lifetimes. While the demand for hypertension services is increasing, the world is simultaneously facing a shortage of trained health workers. Healthcare worker density is higher in countries with a higher gross domestic product (GDP), while the contrasting state of severe shortage of workers in low-and-middle-income countries has become a pressing global health issue.

Team-based care is a strategy that responds to physician shortages. Team-based care allocates service delivery efficiently at the community or primary care level among healthcare workers with diverse skills and training requirements. It can involve shifting tasks from higher-level healthcare providers such as physicians to lower-level clinical staff or lay workers or expanding the levels of healthcare providers who can appropriately deliver specific health services. Sharing tasks with lower-level cadres of trained health care workers enables physicians to spend more time using their specialized training and skills, leading to expanded access to treatment interventions at the primary health care and community levels, and provide high-quality, cost-effective care to all patients according to need. Team-based care requires training healthcare workers such as nurses, community health workers, pharmacists, and dieticians to take on a number of services, including medication prescriptions and refills, algorithm-based treatment management, education and counseling, follow-up care, and organization of care. Task shifting is consistently efficacious in lowering population mean BP and improving BP control.

In this study, we aimed to: 1) summarize the evidence on the efficacy of team-based care on BP control, compared with usual care, by updating a prior systematic review, and 2) assess for differences in team-based care effect on BP-lowering according to the complexity of tasks being performed by healthcare workers and according to the training and job category of the new team member added.

### Rationale and design of a cluster randomized trial of a village doctor-led intervention on hypertension control in China [^114U8TC3]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In China, hypertension prevalence is high and increasing while the control rate is low, especially in rural areas. Traditionally, village doctors play an important role in infectious disease control and delivering essential health services to rural residents. We aim to test the effectiveness of a village doctor-led multifaceted intervention compared with usual care on blood pressure (BP) control and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among rural residents with hypertension in China.

Methods

In the China Rural Hypertension Control Project (CRHCP), a cluster randomized trial, 163 villages were randomly assigned to the village doctor-led intervention and 163 villages to control. A total of 33,995 individuals aged ≥ 40 years with an untreated BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg or treated BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg or with an untreated BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and a history of clinical CVD were recruited into the study. The village doctor-led multifaceted intervention is designed to overcome barriers at the healthcare system, provider, patient, and community levels. Village doctors receive training on standard BP measurement, protocol-based hypertension treatment, and health coaching. They also receive technical support and supervision from hypertension specialists/primary care physicians and performance-based financial incentives. Study participants receive health coaching on home BP monitoring, lifestyle changes, and adherence to medications. The primary outcome is BP control (< 130/80 mm Hg) at 18 months in phase 1 and CVD events over 36 months in phase 2.

Conclusions

The CRHCP will provide critically important data on the effectiveness, implementation, and sustainability of a hypertension control strategy in rural China for reducing the BP-related CVD burden.

### Task sharing with non-physician health-care workers for management of blood pressure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114t57t9]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of task-sharing interventions for managing blood pressure in LMICs and identified studies involving nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and community health workers. Overall, task-sharing interventions led to reduction in average blood pressure levels. Although the prediction intervals indicate variation in blood pressure responses across study settings, the interpretation of prediction intervals are compromised when study sizes vary. Our analyses indicate that the blood pressure response is lowest in settings where the density of physicians is lowest. However, in settings with higher physician density, even within LMICs, we found better blood pressure responses. Despite the moderate-to-high heterogeneity in the pooled results, the overall quality of evidence was moderate for systolic blood pressure, and low for diastolic blood pressure on GRADE criteria.

Healthy life-style education was the mainstay of most of the interventions studied. Although all types of non-physician health workers were involved in delivery of the intervention, the effectiveness was relatively better when given by workers with more education such as nurses and pharmacists. The higher order groups of workers were involved in activities such as protocol-based care, decision support systems for screening, stratification, triage, and medication adherence monitoring in addition to life-style education. A review of task-shifting by Ogedegbe and colleaguesfound that involving non-physician health-care workers such as nurses in prescribing of medications, treatment, or medical testing significantly improved blood pressure and glucose levels. Task-sharing interventions should be designed with an understanding of the specific health service delivery context. WHO provides a framework and global recommendations for task sharing from medical doctors to nurses and community health workers for HIV/AIDS care in low-resource settings. Nurses or pharmacists can take referrals from community health workers for basic anti-hypertensive medication prescriptions or titration of medications, thus leaving physicians to care for complex cases. The range of task-sharing strategies implemented in a study in Ghana might be an ideal example, where nurses are engaged in cardiovascular risk screening, life-style counselling, and initiation or titration of hypertension medications. A Cochrane reviewshowed that nurse-led or pharmacist-led care could effectively improve blood pressure control. Therefore, it is essential to have policies on collaborative care models that involve non-physician prescriptions and organisation of health-care service for better task sharing in low-income and high-income countries.

### Task-shifting for cardiovascular risk factor management: lessons from the global alliance for chronic diseases [^114azZRY]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

While task-shifting was the main aspect of managing hypertension in all studies, the effectiveness of the model does depend on the health work force and is reliant on a number of health system-related factors which are beyond the control of a research study and dependent on country-specific regulations on task-shifting. In order to address the global work force crises, the WHO recommends task-shifting as a viable option, but without country-specific policies that enable task-shifting and adequate physician oversight, it will be challenging to translate research into practice.

Recommendations for future research involving task-shifting

There are many lessons learnt from the investigations undertaken with the GACD projects (online supplementary file 1), including identification of the steps researchers should take while designing a study that involves task-shifting. Since task-shifting is just one component of the larger health system, it is important to audit the health system to better understand the external factors that may impact the successful implementation of the intervention. For example, if one of the aims of the task-shifting interventions is to improve adherence to medicines, the audit will help researchers understand whether medicines or a pharmacist is available at the health centre. Supporting this approach, surveillance of 596 communities in 18 countries in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study provided evidence that medicines for preventing cardiovascular disease were both unavailable and unaffordable in most LMICs surveyed.

Another lesson learnt was to engage with key stakeholders early and often, and well before implementing the intervention to better understand the perceptions of the community and policy-makers, for example, can reduced costs and improved access to culturally appropriate care overcome potential concerns over safety? This is essential because these perspectives influence the implementation and long-term sustainability of these programmes into real world settings. Stakeholders can also help by providing valuable feedback on the design of interventions from the outset, reducing the number of changes that need to be made during implementation.

Pilot studies were found to be an essential step prior to large-scale implementation. This helped researchers understand some of the challenges and resolve them before rolling out the intervention. Since task-shifting for managing hypertension is a new concept for NPHWs in LMICs, all the researchers involved had to ensure that NPHWs had gained appropriate knowledge and skills to provide quality care to the communities. This was often monitored by a research supervisor and sometimes supported by technology such as clinical decision support tools and blue tooth enabled BP monitors.

### Can lay health workers support the management of hypertension? Findings of a cluster randomised trial in South Africa [^113mzE8y]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our intervention did not improve BP control, despite its success in increasing the number of patients with hypertension attending the clinic, as well as the number that attended on their appointed day. We believe that the study was compromised by the large and increasing demands on primary care, the dominance of the vertically funded HIV programme and the poor standards of equipment in clinics. However, as this study shows, adding additional human resources (even if readily available and relatively inexpensive) is unlikely to have an effect on health outcomes, without the necessary equipment to accurately measure BP, and sufficient clinical staff to treat the growing numbers of chronic patients. To be successful, task shifting interventions need to take account of all aspects of the patient encounter, and if possible other system-wide contextual changes (such as rapidly increasing patients). Our results, taken together with the existing evidence, suggest that LHWs can play an important role in supporting the management of hypertension.

### Task-shifting for cardiovascular risk factor management: lessons from the global alliance for chronic diseases [^117A7tGy]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Task-shifting to non-physician health workers (NPHWs) has been an effective model for managing infectious diseases and improving maternal and child health. There is inadequate evidence to show the effectiveness of NPHWs to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In 2012, the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases funded eight studies which focused on task-shifting to NPHWs for the management of hypertension. We report the lessons learnt from the field. From each of the studies, we obtained information on the types of tasks shifted, the professional level from which the task was shifted, the training provided and the challenges faced. Additionally, we collected more granular data on 'lessons learnt ' throughout the implementation process and 'design to implementation' changes that emerged in each project. The tasks shifted to NPHWs included screening of individuals, referral to physicians for diagnosis and management, patient education for lifestyle improvement, follow-up and reminders for medication adherence and appointments. In four studies, tasks were shifted from physicians to NPHWs and in four studies tasks were shared between two different levels of NPHWs. Training programmes ranged between 3 and 7 days with regular refresher training. Two studies used clinical decision support tools and mobile health components. Challenges faced included system level barriers such as inability to prescribe medicines, varying skill sets of NPHWs, high workload and staff turnover. With the acute shortage of the health workforce in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), achieving better health outcomes for the prevention and control of CVD is a major challenge. Task-shifting or sharing provides a practical model for the management of CVD in LMICs.

Which tasks were shifted and to whom?

Among the 15 studies funded by the GACD, 8 incorporated task-shifting from physicians to other cadres of the health workforce to manage hypertension. These studies were conducted in Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Malaysia, South Africaand Tanzania. All studies were randomised controlled trials, with one being a randomised controlled feasibility study. The cadres of NPHWs included nurses, community health workers, accredited social health activists (ASHAs)and community health extension workers (CHW supervisors). The NPHWs had between 8 and 14 years of education, while the nurses were graduates from formal nursing programmes. In four studies, tasks were shifted from physicians to NPHWs and in four studies, tasks were shared between two different levels of NPHWs (table 1).

### Task sharing with non-physician health-care workers for management of blood pressure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FezyU]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Task sharing for the management of hypertension could be useful for understaffed and resource-poor health systems. We assessed the effectiveness of task-sharing interventions in improving blood pressure control among adults in low-income and middle-income countries.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL for studies published up to December 2018. We included intervention studies involving a task-sharing strategy for management of blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors. We extracted data on population, interventions, blood pressure, and task sharing groups. We did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Findings

We found 3012 references, of which 54 met the inclusion criteria initially. Another nine studies were included following an updated search. There were 43 trials and 20 before-and-after studies. We included 31 studies in our meta-analysis. Systolic blood pressure was decreased through task sharing in different groups of health-care workers: the mean difference was -5.34 mm Hg (95% CI -9.00 to -1.67, I² = 84%) for task sharing with nurses, -8.12 mm Hg (-10.23 to -6.01, I² = 57%) for pharmacists, -4.67 mm Hg (-7.09 to -2.24, I² = 0%) for dietitians, -3.67 mm Hg (-4.58 to -2.77, I² = 24%) for community health workers, and -4.85 mm Hg (-6.12 to -3.57, I² = 76%) overall. We found a similar reduction in diastolic blood pressure (overall mean difference -2.92 mm Hg, -3.75 to -2.09, I² = 80%). The overall quality of evidence based on GRADE criteria was moderate for systolic blood pressure, but low for diastolic blood pressure.

Interpretation

Task-sharing interventions are effective in reducing blood pressure. Long-term studies are needed to understand their potential impact on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We developed a search strategy based on a previous reviewand modified the terms according to the database. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL with terms related to cardiovascular disease, task sharing, and LMICs (appendix pp 46–53). The search covered the period from inception of each database to Aug 15, 2017. We did an updated search up to Dec 28, 2018. We also manually searched the reference lists of identified studies.

We included experimental studies (randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials, quasiexperimental studies, and before-and-after designs) that included interventions delivered by community health workers, nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals such as dietitians, designed to improve blood pressure control regardless of hypertension status. For the purpose of our review, the tasks shared included non-pharmacological measures such as patient education for lifestyle modification and pharmacological measures such as initiation or refill of prescription medications and titrating the dose of medications. Other measures, such as follow-up and patient reminders for referrals and appointments were also included. The population of interest was adults aged 18 or older, living in LMICs, regardless of their hypertension status.

We did not include studies in which non-physician health-care workers only screened for hypertension. We also excluded studies with patient's knowledge, attitudes, or intentions as outcome variables without measuring any relevant blood pressure outcomes. Peer-led interventions were excluded because they would be more likely to involve informal support. Additionally, we excluded studies of task-sharing activities that are exclusive to traditional healers, alternative therapies such as acupuncture, homoeopathic medicine, and those of only the promotion of self-care or informal caregiver health education.

Furthermore, we excluded studies without before and after measurements of blood pressure, and studies that included fewer than 30 participants or less than 3 months of follow-up from the meta-analyses. Studies with no or insufficient description of randomisation were also excluded from the meta-analyses. We also excluded studies that were not in English.

Our study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42018081015). Ethical approval was not required.

### Task-shifting for cardiovascular risk factor management: lessons from the global alliance for chronic diseases [^112q7eFy]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Prior to implementing the intervention, several investigators conducted audits of the health system, qualitative research with stakeholders and feasibility studies to better understand the main challenges in rolling out the main study. In five of the studies, there was some form of a pilot study, mainly to pilot and train NPHWs. The pilot studies were reported to be critical in making minor, and in some cases substantive, changes to the study and/or intervention design. In projects where there was no pilot study, investigators reported that a pilot would have avoided significant challenges in implementation and success of the programme. In addition, detailed process evaluation studies are planned in six studies, aimed at better understanding the moderators and mediators of the intervention (see online supplementary file 1 for additional details).

One of the targets of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce NCDs by 30% by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, there is a need to address the shortage of health human resources (including physicians, nurses and midwives). The shortage in human resources is currently estimated at 17.3 million, with the largest being in South-East Asia (6.9 million) and Africa (4.2 million). In these regions, the experience of the health system in using NPHWs is limited to infectious diseases and involves either short-term or curative care. In this manuscript, we have highlighted the critical lessons learnt from the field about task-shifting for management of hypertension from eight LMICs. These studies will contribute towards building the evidence required to understand the role of task-shifting for chronic disease management.

Results

We identified a total of 3012 references from our searches (figure 1). After removing 162 duplicates, we screened the titles of 2850, 2279 of which were excluded. We screened 571 abstracts and identified 86 potentially eligible articles. Another four studies were included after manually searching. The full texts of 90 studies were reviewed and 36 were excluded. Thus, we included 54 studies. An updated hand search and database search done up to December, 2018, identified an additional nine eligible studies. Thus, 63 studies were included in the narrative review and 31 studies (trials) were included in the meta-analyses.

Literature search and article inclusion

SMS = short messaging service. CHW = community health worker. CKD = chronic kidney disease. LMIC = low-income and middle-income country. CVD = cardiovascular disease. SBP = systolic blood pressure. DBP = diastolic blood pressure. RCT = randomised controlled trial.

Of the 63 studies included in the review, there were 32 randomised controlled trials (from 33 publications),11 cluster randomised trials, and 20 before-and-after studies,(appendix pp 3–38). 50 studies were done in Asia and Africa. Studies mostly took place in the community (n = 15), primary health centres (n = 24), outpatient clinics (n = 16), and hospitals (n = 8). Interventions were delivered by nurses (n = 30), pharmacists (n = 10), dietitians (n = 4), and community health workers (n = 19). We included 31 studies with 13 489 participants in the meta-analyses. Individual study sizes ranged from 35 to 3977 participants. 16 studies lasted 12 months or more. The nature of the interventions varied. We categorised them into lifestyle modifications through education for participants, follow-up care, algorithm-based management, non-physician drug prescription, referrals, and organisation of care.

### Task sharing with non-physician health-care workers for management of blood pressure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YkKTQ]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Nine studies, tested arrangements for long-term organised care in which a nurse or community health worker referred participants to a physician or health-care facility. Organisation of care ranged from coordination of groups for education, appointment reminders, medication dispensing, screening for cardiovascular disease risk, and referral for further treatment. However, the effectiveness of arrangements for follow-up on patient outcomes was not assessed specifically.

In terms of study quality, the evidence for task-sharing interventions to lower systolic blood pressure delivered by nurses, pharmacists, and community health workers was classed as moderate because of indirectness and inconsistency. The evidence for managing diastolic blood pressure was rated as low because of both indirectness and inconsistency. We did not downgrade studies for lack of masking because implementation of task-sharing interventions in real life is unlikely to be masked.

### Innovations for effective implementation of guideline-based hypertension care in low-income and middle-income countries [^113WnQgf]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Community health workers have traditionally been involved in the delivery of maternal and child health services in most low-income and middle-income countries as well as in HIV/AIDS programmes. Task sharing for hypertension control by community health workers offers a cost-effective way of addressing the community burden of hypertension. A 2019 meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in blood pressure when hypertension care was provided by non-physician health-care workers. The feasibility and success of a programme delivered by community health workers does pose several potential challenges, however. The effectiveness of the intervention is highly dependent on many health system factors such as availability, funding, and retention of an appropriately sized team of community health workers; adequate training, supervision, and monitoring of community health workers; the development of context-specific protocols for screening, diagnosing, referring, and treating patients; availability and access to affordable medicines; and clear career pathways for the community health workers. Many community health workers are often already overloaded with multiple responsibilities and are poorly remunerated, leading to poor motivation and job attrition. Designing a programme that is culturally and socially acceptable is a crucial factor that drives the success of the task-sharing strategy; for instance, many community health workers are women, and gender barriers in some communities might impair the effective rollout of a programme led by community health workers.

### Benefit-harm trade-offs of intensive blood pressure control versus standard blood pressure control on cardiovascular and renal outcomes: an individual participant data analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1149QYYQ]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although intensive blood pressure control is recommended by major guidelines, its overall benefit-harm balance remains uncertain. In particular, it is unclear how net clinical benefit varies by blood pressure target and patient characteristics. We aimed to quantify the benefit-harm trade-offs of intensive blood pressure control versus standard blood pressure control.

Methods

We conducted a post-hoc, pooled participant-level analysis of six randomised controlled trials (ACCORD BP, SPRINT, ESPRIT, BPROAD, STEP, and CRHCP). Trial selection was based on our collaborative framework, the Blood Pressure Reduction Union-Landmark Evidence, and a targeted literature search, guided by five predefined inclusion criteria: (1) comparison of intensive systolic blood pressure targets (< 120 mm Hg or < 130 mm Hg) versus standard treatment; (2) reporting of composite major cardiovascular outcomes; (3) enrolment of more than 2000 participants; (4) standardised reporting of treatment-related adverse events; and (5) availability of individual participant data. We also conducted a systematic review in which we searched PubMed for studies published from database inception up to June 15, 2025, with no language restrictions. We used search terms related to cardiovascular outcomes, hypertension, intensive blood pressure lowering, and randomised trials. Study screening and data extraction were independently conducted in pairs by ten reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or adjudication. Participants in the six trials were randomly assigned to intensive blood pressure treatment (systolic blood pressure target < 120 mm Hg or < 130 mm Hg) versus standard treatment (systolic blood pressure target < 140 mm Hg, < 150 mm Hg in older adults, or usual care), depending on the trial design. The primary benefit outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. The primary harm outcomes were adverse events of interest (eg, hypotension and syncope) and renal-related events. Statistical analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using Bayesian hierarchical models.

Findings

The initial dataset included 80676 participants, of whom 80220 were included in our analyses (intensive blood pressure control group n = 40503; standard blood pressure control group n = 39717). The median age was 64.0 years (IQR 59.0–70.0), 39043 (48.7%) participants were male, and 41177 (51.3%) were female. Most participants were Asian (66290 [82.6%]) or White (8097 [10.1%]). During a median follow-up of 3.2 years (IQR 3.0–3.5), the composite cardiovascular disease outcome occurred in 2158 (5.3%) participants in the intensive blood pressure control group and 2811 (7.1%) participants in the standard blood pressure control group (hazard ratio 0.76, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.72–0.81; p < 0.0001). Compared with standard blood pressure control, intensive blood pressure control was associated with a 1.73% absolute risk reduction (95% CrI 1.65–1.81) in cardiovascular disease (number needed to treat 58 [95% CrI 55–61]) and a 1.82% absolute risk increase (95% CrI 1.63–2.01) for adverse events of interest (number needed to harm 55 [95% CrI 49–61]). Overall, intensive blood pressure control showed a favourable benefit-harm profile, with a net benefit of 1.14 (95% CrI 1.03–1.25), using adjudicated weighting. The net benefit remained positive when considering kidney-related adverse events (1.13 [95% CrI 1.01–1.24]).

Interpretation

Compared with standard blood pressure control, intensive blood pressure control provides a net benefit between the reduction in cardiovascular events and the increase in adverse events, including renal events.

### Determining the frequency and level of task-sharing for hypertension management in LMICs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JZhQR]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Team-based care succeeds beyond usual care in lowering BP in patients living with hypertension. This effect appears to be slightly stronger when the team member added is more highly trained. However, these well-trained healthcare personnel are often expensive. Effectiveness studies and economic evaluations of team-based care are needed to justify investment in the healthcare worker training and salary allocations needed to support team-based care on a broader scale.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^113bmT9R]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The current state of hypertension in SSA is a public health concern requiring urgent attention. Tangible and innovative research approaches are required to urgently address the rising trend and identify barriers to management, thereby improving treatment outcomes. A coordinated multisectoral approach including task shifting and task sharing will significantly improve prevention and increase case detection, treatment allocation, and outcomes. Finally, research should be streamlined and adapted to respond to priorities in SSA.

### Supportive supervision visits in a large community hypertension programme in Nigeria: implementation methods and outcomes [^1161HjjW]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the most common cause of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality and accounts for more than 10 million deaths in 2021. In the African region, the prevalence of hypertension among adults aged 30 to 79 years is 27%, while in Nigeria, 32.5% of adults are estimated to have hypertension. To address the significant and growing burden of hypertension and related conditions, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health has begun to integrate hypertension diagnosis and management into public primary healthcare centres (PHCs) at the local government level, in alignment with the recommendations of the WHO. The Federal Ministry of Health has also adopted a national policy on task sharing and task shifting to support implementation of hypertension services at PHC in Nigeria using non-physician health workers, including community health extension workers (CHEWs). The Federal Ministry of Health has also developed, in collaboration with other stakeholders, the Nigerian Hypertension Treatment Protocol for Primary Care.

Components of the HEARTS technical packages include healthy lifestyle counselling, evidence-based treatment protocols, access to essential medicines and technology, risk-based cardiovascular disease management, team-based care and systems for monitoring including supportive supervision. The adoption of supportive supervision as an implementation strategy was chosen based on knowledge of the need to supplement training with this additional strategy to ensure fidelity to the protocols, maintain site readiness (medications and equipment), provide data audit and feedback, ensure data quality and support overall monitoring of programme implementation and has been recommended in guidance for HEARTS programmes.

Studies of healthcare delivery at PHCs in sub-Saharan Africa have described gaps in quality, leading to underutilisation and poor health outcomes with a baseline hypertension control of 13.1%, despite their presence within the communities they serve. Underlying causes of poor quality in healthcare services at the system level include inadequate equipment and medications, staff shortages and lack of knowledge and skills by healthcare workers, among others. Poor quality of service delivery and its consequences are also associated with a lack of or limited supportive supervision of health workers and facility managers to ensure readiness and quality care delivery.

### Task sharing with non-physician health-care workers for management of blood pressure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111f8aYp]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

All the studies using protocol-based care showed a reduction in blood pressure. In a multicountry studythe overall mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 4.5 mm Hg (95% CI 2.3 to 6.7). Two studies in which community health-care workers delivered the intervention also resulted in reduction in mean systolic blood pressure (by 8.8 mm Hg in one study,27.2 mm Hg in another). In one study, nurse care coordinators used a clinical decision support system on a mobile phone to generate a prescription, which was vetted by a physician, which reduced systolic blood pressure by 14.6 mm Hg (95% CI 15.3 to 13.8) and diastolic blood pressure by 7.6 mm Hg (8.0 to 7.2). In South Africa,68% of patients with hypertension achieved blood pressure control through a stepwise process of diagnosis, management, and appropriate referral. Although the three Cameroonian studies, reported statistically significant reductions in mean blood pressure (of 11.7/7.8 mm Hg, 5.9/3.3 mm Hg, and 22.8/12.4 mm Hg), they had high drop-out rates. In a study done in Nigeria, pharmacy staff had regular consultations with patients for blood pressure measurements and lifestyle counselling (with the help of an mHealth application and under the supervision of a cardiologist) and achieved a mean reduction of 9.9 mm Hg (SD 18) in systolic blood pressure.

In three studies from Cameroon, nurses could prescribe medicines, which resulted in meaningful reductions in average blood pressure (11.7/7.8 mm Hg in one study,5.9/3.3 mm Hg in another, and 22.8/12.4 mm Hg in a third). In two other studies, nurses could prescribe first-line hypertension drugs. However, in cases of newly diagnosed hypertension or in individuals with high cardiovascular risk, nurses had to seek advice from physicians before initiating treatment. Both studies showed a significant reduction in blood pressure. Ajay et altested the effects of nurse care coordinators using a clinical decision support system on a mobile phone to generate a prescription that was vetted by a physician and showed a 14.6 mm Hg (95% CI 15.3 to −3.8) reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 7.6 mm Hg (95% CI 8.0 to 7.2) reduction in diastolic blood pressure.

### Task sharing with non-physician health-care workers for management of blood pressure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1135QEPR]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Six of 43 randomised controlled trials did not report the outcome variable of interest (difference in blood pressure before and after the intervention). Additionally, four studies were excluded because of inadequate description of randomisation procedure, one study was excluded because it was a feasibility trial with less than 3 months of follow-up, and another one was excluded because of differences in task sharing (involving non-blood pressure drug titrations across multiple therapeutic areas). Finally, 31 trials were included in the meta-analyses (including two groups from Azami and colleagues' studyand three groups from Neupane and colleagues' study). In the meta-analyses only randomised controlled trials and cluster randomised controlled trials were included.

The population average mean difference between before and after measurements of systolic blood pressure ranged from −3.67 mm Hg (95% CI −4.58 to −2.77, I² = 24%; for interventions delivered by community health workers) to −8.12 mm Hg (–10.23 to −6.01, I² = 57%; for interventions delivered by pharmacists). Dietitians delivering the intervention resulted in an average mean difference of −4.67 mm Hg (–7.09 to −2.24; I² = 0%), and when nurses delivered the intervention it was −5.34 mm Hg (–9.00 to −1.67; I² = 84%; figure 2). Overall, the average mean difference in systolic blood pressure was −4.85 mm Hg (–6.12 to −3.57; I² = 76%). The prediction interval for the systolic blood pressure pooled estimate was −11.03 to 1.33. Funnel plots for publication bias did not show any asymmetry (appendix p 36) and the Egger's regression test did not indicate bias (t = 0.12, degrees of freedom = 32, p value = 0.90). We found a similar reduction in diastolic blood pressure (overall mean difference −2.92 mm Hg, −3.75 to −2.09, I² = 80%). The average mean difference of diastolic blood pressure ranged from −2.29 to −3.74 mm Hg, depending on the task sharing group (figure 3). The prediction interval of the diastolic blood pressure pooled average estimate ranged from −6.90 to 1.06. We found no evidence of bias for diastolic blood pressure in funnel plots (appendix p 37) or from Egger's regression test (t = –0.365, degrees of freedom = 29, p value = 0.71).

### The cost-effectiveness of hypertension management in low-income and middle-income countries: a review [^114XJidh]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

To reduce the knowledge gap about factors that can influence the cost-effectiveness of hypertension programmes, future research can focus on programme elements that may be particularly relevant to low-resource settings, such as the uptake of healthcare tasks by non-physician providers and the assessment of patient CVD risk in treatment determination. Using community health workers (CHW) in the provision of chronic disease care has been associated with increased cost-effectiveness in the USA (Kim et al, 2016), and has been similarly regarded in LMICs (Jeet et al, 2017and Krishnan et al, 2019), but evidence specific to hypertension care costs is mostly lacking. Additional studies focussing on the role of CHW in improving the cost-effectiveness of hypertension interventions can help inform health strategies in areas where access to care is otherwise limited. Standardisation of cost evaluation platforms can streamline economic assessment across countries. An example of a mechanism for evaluating the costs of standardised CVD prevention approaches is provided by the costing mechanism for the HEARTS package of clinical guidelines for CVD prevention in primary care (WHO, 2016and WHO, 2017). A list of standard cost elements to track during implementation of hypertension management programmes is included in table 7, which summarises the leading cost indicators of HEARTS programme components, including establishment of treatment protocols, training of healthcare providers in lifestyle counselling and risk-based management, ensuring access to essential medicines and promoting task sharing and systems for patient monitoring. Additional evidence on the cost-effectiveness of introducing non-physician health workers in healthcare delivery can inform future approaches to address physician scarcity (Seidman and Atun, 2017; Jafar et al, 2011; and Chen et al, 2004).

Table 7
Key cost elements of standardised programme implementation: WHO Global Hearts Initiative, HEARTS technical package for CVD prevention in primary care.

Although CVD death rates have decreased worldwide since 1990, improvements have not been evenly distributed across countries, and have showed signs of slowing down (GBD, 2018). Both domestic and external financing for non-communicable diseases across LMICs remains low (IHME, 2019). The results of this review suggest that hypertension control approaches can be a cost-effective way to prevent premature CVD in LMICs across a variety of population, clinical and health system contexts.

### Task-shifting for cardiovascular risk factor management: lessons from the global alliance for chronic diseases [^1125MySy]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

In light of the increasing burden of NCDs and lack of operational research in LMICs, the Global Alliance for Chronic Disease (GACD) was established with a goal to fund research in LMICs and disadvantaged populations in high-income countries. In 2012, the GACD funded 15 studies for the prevention and management of hypertension of which 8 were focused on shifting simple healthcare-related tasks from physicians to NPHWs. These implementation studies from LMICs highlight the main challenges and facilitators for task-shifting for prevention and management of CVD. We report the lessons learnt from the field and the implementation challenges faced by the research teams.

Research investigators for all eight GACD studies were invited to participate in a working group which met online and face to face at annual meetings hosted by the GACD. Data were collated using three steps. First, a matrix was created to collect details of the critical variables relating to task-shifting. This included reviewing the study protocol to understand the study aim, methods, primary outcome, types of tasks shifted, professional level from which the task was shifted, qualifications of the NPHWs, training provided and the challenges faced. The second step involved asking the research teams to complete a two page 'mini-case study' addressing the following aspects of their projects: research context, research question, outcomes, status and details of the tasks that were shifted or shared. Researchers were asked to approach these 'mini-case studies' by detailing the original proposed approach. Finally, when the studies were near completion, the researchers were asked to reflect on what was ultimately implemented. Our goal was to (1) identify and share the lessons learnt through iteratively modifying interventions from conception to implementation to fit within the relevant health system and (2) understand the barriers and enablers to implementing successful (or unsuccessful) interventions.

The quantitative data were collated and mapped for analysis using Microsoft excel and SPSS V.20.0. Structured case studies from each study (except Argentina) were analysed qualitatively to identify and elucidate 'lessons learnt' themes. Data from the protocol review and contact with the researchers substantiated the analysis of the case studies. While no ethics approval was required for this synthesis, ethics approval was obtained for the conduct of each study mentioned in this report.

### Community-based participatory research and system dynamics modeling for improving retention in hypertension care [^113H1eLu]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

This study's simulation results suggest that training of clinic staff and community health extension workers could be the most useful component when developing a multilevel intervention for retention in hypertension care. Training has a few advantages compared with other approaches: (1) the training of personal organization skills, communication skills, and problem-solving skills enables a better relationship between patients and health care professionals, which may increase patients' satisfaction and trust in the health care professionals and clinic environment; (2) a train-the-trainer model may be effective in resource-limited settings because it effectively distributes a range of new knowledge and skills to participants; (3) training health workers with skills and technologies will likely increase their capacity for and engagement with high-quality hypertension care; and (4) training is the foundation for other interventions or implementation strategies, such as a differentiated service delivery model for hypertension care and education, which further facilitates task shifting, including to nonclinicians. Future research should identify and detail attributes of the proposed strategies, such as training and information and communication technology, that are associated with effectiveness; focus on a better understanding of how contextual factors influence intervention effectiveness; emphasize the use of robust and standardized methods; and include more rigorous validation of whether and how these strategies improve retention in hypertension care.

Management of hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa

Barriers to the control of hypertension in SSA include individual-and system-level aspects. At an individual level these include, health literacy, especially around hypertension and CVD and socioeconomic factors that affect the affordability of health insurance and medicines (out-of-pocket costs) and distance to healthcare facilities. System-related barriers include the availability of medicines, poor access to healthcare facilities and limited workforce capacity and knowledge of the healthcare workers as well as political will in implementing interventions that have been shown to work elsewhere in the management of hypertension. It was recently reported in a Soweto population that the poor quality of PHC services such as unpleasant interactions of healthcare providers with patients may serve as some of the deterrents for visiting PHCs. As a result, tasking-sharing is one of the most relevant approaches for improving the management of hypertension in resource-limited contexts such as in SSA countries. Training of role model patients as facilitators for support groups and community health workers (CHWs) to provide clinical and nonclinical support have the potential to counteract some of the individual and system barriers mentioned above.

Table 2 summarises different strategies that tested the role of task-shifting in the form of allocation of some of the responsibilities in hypertension management to role model patients and/or CHWs. Overall, depending on the design and implementation strategies, most forms of task-shifting improved linkage to health services and adherence to medication, with inconsistent results on the effect on BP control over time. One of the relevant recent findings come from the HealthRise programme, which was implemented in Brazil, India, South Africa, and the United States of America. South African sites were amongst the most challenging, which included two rural areas in KwaZulu Natal and the Northern Cape provinces. Main limitations that may explain the unfavourable results from the South African sites are the short implementation period, socioeconomic and demographic factors such as residing in a rural area, low education, and literacy levels in patients, and the high unemployment rate as well as health system-related barriers. Additional limitations of task-shifting studies in SSA have been reported in a recent scoping review and framework for designing chronic services. These include attrition rates, quality of studies, parallel as opposed to integrated models, and lack of comparison groups.

4 MANAGING HYPERTENSION

4.1 The role of primary care physicians

Primary care physicians and other allied healthcare workers should be at the forefront of managing HTN. The paradigm shift to move the gravity center of HTN programmes from specialized secondary care to the community levels (primary care) is essential for population‐wide impact.

4.2 Task sharing and shifting and team‐based care

In most countries, primary care physicians are encouraged to be the main healthcare providers regarding the prevention and control of cardiovascular risk factors. However, most of low‐income countries have an inadequate number of physicians, especially in rural and remote regions. Task‐sharing and shifting strategies that involve transferring less skilled tasks to nonphysician health workers under the supervision of a physician are effective in addressing some of the critical barriers to improve HTN control. One of the examples of having health promotion habits endorsed by trusted community members was the black barbershop trial where healthcare evaluations and prescriptions were dislocated from healthcare facilities to the community and resulted in a large reduction of systolic BP (about 20 mmHg) compared with an active encouragement of lifestyle modification and doctor appointments by barbers.

Also in some countries, preventive CV multidisciplinary programs were created for the evaluation and managing CV Risk, including risk factors treatment, as in the case of HTN. Many times HTN is not alone and associates with dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes or smoking, which increases exponentially CV risk. Metabolic syndrome is a very high‐risk situation and patients need not only HTN, which is present in 80% of cases, to be corrected, but all the other risk factors involved.HTN management should be integrated in global CV risk control.

### The cost-effectiveness of hypertension management in low-income and middle-income countries: a review [^116Zqvtz]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

While the value of addressing hypertension in LMICs has gained recognition over the past decade, resources in this area remain limited, revealing a gap between health targets and current needs (United Nations (UN), 2011; UN, 2015; and WHO, 2018a). The transition from goal setting to actual implementation of hypertension control strategies in LMICs depends in large part on cost considerations. Although some economic modelling suggests that both population-level and clinical interventions for hypertension control can be cost-effective (Murray et al, 2003; Jha et al, 2012; Nugent and Brouwer, 2015; Bertram et al, 2018; and WHO, 2018b), policymakers in individual countries might regard aggregate global estimates to be insufficient evidence for policy formulation in specific country circumstances. To inform policy decisions regarding hypertension approaches in LMICs, we reviewed the current evidence on costs and cost-effectiveness of hypertension interventions across LMICs. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, it provides the first comprehensive review of the evidence on cost-effectiveness of hypertension management programmes in LMICs. This review summarises the available evidence most relevant to policymakers in countries where hypertension management is currently limited or absent, and where decision-makers may be considering additions to health benefit packages without detailed cost or cost-effectiveness information. Second, this review documents the variation among existing studies across study designs and study quality. It produces a standardised quality score and explores contextual differences such as those that may arise between programmes based exclusively on pharmaceutical intervention and programmes that incorporate non-pharmaceutical components; programmes that target hypertension populations with different levels of CVD risk; or programmes applied in countries with different income levels. This too provides informative evidence to decision-makers in LMICs. The results describe a range of clinical programmes and corresponding programme cost and cost-effectiveness estimates from different settings, with varying levels of quality. We found gaps in evidence on programme elements that can affect cost-effectiveness in LMICs, such as shifting of healthcare tasks to non-physician providers, integrating CVD risk assessment into treatment decisions and standardising CVD prevention approaches.

### Global burden of hypertension in people living with HIV [^115L3aAG]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What are the implications?

Interventions should be more aggressive towards modifiable risk factors (unhealthy diets — excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables; physical inactivity; consumption of tobacco and alcohol; and being overweight or obese) in PLHIV globally. In LICs, especially those in Africa and Asia with the highest burden of HIV infection and the poorest indicators for HIV programs, the HIV care cascade (early HIV diagnosis, early HAART initiation and linkage to care, high level of linkage to care, and adherence to HAART) should continue to be improved, building on the encouraging achievements of past two decades. Furthermore, there should be a more effective integration of services for HIV and non-communicable diseases including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Interventions for primordial cardiovascular prevention should be central in healthcare provision for PLHIV in these resource-limited settings, as there are more likely to be cost-effective. It is also crucial to ensure that all PLHIV have adequate access to screening and management of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, considering the low level of awareness, treatment, and control of these conditions in the general population. In the context of limited specialized healthcare personnel, task shifting represents a viable solution.

### Task sharing with non-physician health-care workers for management of blood pressure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115a3bN1]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and CINAHL without any language restrictions for studies published up to Aug 31, 2017, that described task-sharing interventions for managing blood pressure. We later updated our search to December 2018. Our search terms were related to task sharing and cardiovascular diseases combined with a list of low-income and lower-middle income countries as defined by the World Bank. We identified two reviews of task-sharing interventions for non-communicable diseases. One described the effectiveness of non-physician health-care workers involved in prescription of medications for cardiovascular risk reduction, while the other described enablers and barriers for task-sharing interventions. The reviews show that task sharing is a potentially viable and low-cost strategy for understaffed low-income and lower-middle income countries. We found no published meta-analyses of task-sharing interventions for managing blood pressure.

Added value of this study

Our meta-analysis shows that task-sharing interventions are effective in reducing average blood pressure in low-income and lower-middle income countries. Our results validate the possibility of using task sharing for non-communicable disease prevention and management in these settings. However, the impact of task-sharing interventions is greater in countries with better doctor:population ratios. Additionally, we show that interventions are more effective if targeted to high-risk individuals than to the general population.

Implications of all the available evidence

Involving non-physician health-care workers in blood pressure control is an effective option in low-income and lower-middle income countries.

Primary and secondary prevention of hypertension, often involve lifestyle counselling, adoption of self-management skills, and the implementation of protocol-led treatment can be instituted by non-physician health-care workers. A Cochrane reviewdemonstrated that care led by a nurse or pharmacist could be a favourable way of improving blood pressure control in patients with hypertension, but most of the evidence comes from high-income countries. Such interventions, specifically conducted in LMICs, require further evaluation as effectiveness depends on health system capacity and adaptability. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of task-sharing interventions and their effects on managing blood pressure in LMICs.

The WHO HEARTS technical package offers evidence-based guidelines for hypertension management in low-resource settings. Adapting these strategies to SSA requires addressing the region's unique challenges. These include limited health care infrastructure, which was primarily designed for managing communicable diseases, conditions that often do not require long-term follow-up. To ensure scalability and sustainability, task shifting and capacity building should be prioritized, and hypertension care should be integrated into existing health systems.

### Global evidence on the effectiveness of task-shifting and task-sharing strategies for managing individuals with multimorbidity: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11525vHP]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multimorbidity, defined as the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions in an individual, poses significant challenges to healthcare systems globally. Multimorbidity is associated with increased mortality risk, poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and higher healthcare costs. Health services in most countries tend to be single-disease oriented and thus are often ill equipped to meet the demands of managing multiple conditions, particularly for the management of multiple non-communicable diseases (NCDs). As the burden of multimorbidity rises, innovative approaches are urgently needed to enhance healthcare delivery and optimise outcomes.

Task-shifting and task-sharing strategies have emerged as promising solutions for improving the management of chronic conditions by alleviating the burden on overextended healthcare systems and improving access to a continuum of care for NCDs. Task-shifting refers to the redistribution of tasks and clinical responsibilities from highly qualified health professionals and specialists to lower-level health workers, thereby maximising the efficient use of the health workforce and resources. Task-sharing, on the other hand, entails the collaborative division of responsibilities among a multidisciplinary team, ensuring that the skill sets of various healthcare providers are effectively used. There is robust evidence for the effectiveness of these strategies in managing single NCDs, such as hypertensionand diabetes, including in resource-limited low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) settings. Although these strategies could be relevant to managing multimorbidity in scenarios requiring long-term and complex care and in settings with a shortage of healthcare professionals, the evidence on the effectiveness of task-shifting and task-sharing strategies in managing multimorbidity remains limited.

### Development of an entirely remote, non-physician led hypertension management program [^116BvKYi]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSION

The time‐honored model of treating hypertension through traditional visits to the doctor is neither effective nor sustainable. New guidelines that target even lower BP goals will require the development of innovative solutions to manage hypertension effectively and efficiently, and thus, reduce the cardiovascular risk burden in larger populations. Solutions must be generalizable, scalable, and sustainable. Innovative programs must provide systems transformation in a host of domains, including widespread education for patients and providers, evidence‐based clinical algorithms, collaborative care efforts, advanced hardware and information technology solutions, and sensible economics and payment structures. We describe a program designed to serve as a paradigm of algorithmic clinical hypertension management, containing costs while providing healthcare dividends and optimizing care.

### Task shifting to improve the provision of integrated chronic care: realist evaluation of a lay health worker intervention in rural South Africa [^113Sy49X]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

The realist evaluation

Given the growing focus on the role of context and causal mechanisms in order to understand complex health service programmes, we decided to undertake a realist evaluation to supplement trial methodology by providing additional information that would explain the trial outcomes. The evaluation was conducted in the eight trial clinics for 4 months prior to the start of trial, and then continued throughout the intervention. We took a case study approach, with each clinic being one case, to compare how tasks were conducted with and without the lay health workers. We asked under what circumstances the task shifting did work, for whom and why. The realist CMO framework focused our attention on how context influenced participants' engagement with the intervention (the mechanism). The outcome for the realist evaluation was the proportion of patients who attended on their appointed day, a more proximal outcome than population-level management of hypertension (figure 1). We also explored how the intervention influenced patient pathways and activities associated with the provision of chronic care. However, we were not able to examine the extent of BP control among clinic attendees; although we extracted these data from the patients, the clinic BP machines were not maintained and therefore not sufficiently accurate (see below) for these data to be used as an outcome. Nor were we able to examine the number of new patients enrolled in care in the control clinics as this would have meant disrupting the work flow of the clinic. We did gather this information in the intervention clinics; it will be reported in a forthcoming paper.

Study site and population

The study was conducted in a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) site run by the Medical Research Council/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit based in Bushbuckridge, a poorly resourced rural subdistrict of Mpumalanga province, north-east South Africa. At the time of this study, the HDSS site covered 31 villages, 20 000 households and 115 000 individuals. Ten primary healthcare facilities and three hospitals (that are 25–60 km away from the site) served the local population in the study site.

### Impact of patient care teams on blood pressure control in patients with hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Lo3qN]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Overall, 3632 citations initially met the search criteria. After eliminating 1235 duplicates, 2397 citations were screened. The majority were excluded during the initial abstract review. Subsequently, 166 publications were chosen for a detailed full-text evaluation, with 110 articles excluded owing to specific criteria in the second screening. Finally, 61 publications were included in the full-text review and found eligible for this meta-analysis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Study selection. The diagram summarizes the search process for relevant studies. 1803 citations were retrieved from PubMed, 1678 from Cochrane CENTRAL, and 147 from IchuShi-Web. Following the screening process, 61 publications were selected for full-text review, all of which were deemed suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis

Supplementary Tables 1–2 provide details on the baseline characteristics and office BPs of the patients in the 61 studies included. The meta-analysis encompassed 64,857 participants across these studies (Supplementary Table 1). Four papers did not have data on office BP, and three of the papers were used for analyzing the risk of uncontrolled BP and one for analyzing ambulatory BP monitoring. For a sub-analysis, the studies were divided into the occupations that led the intervention. Interventions were led by pharmacists, nurses, physicians, community health workers, and other patient care workers, including dietitians and health educators, in 22, 16, 6, 6, and 7 studies, respectively. We defined community health workers are non-physician staff trained in health education programs who provide healthcare support to communities.

In the intervention group, the mean age ranged from 41 to 69 years, and office and ambulatory BP ranges of 127–162/71.9–99.4 mmHg and 133–141/71–88.93 mmHg, respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The control group was comparable to the intervention group and had patients with a mean age ranging from 41 to 69.65 years and office and ambulatory BP ranges of 119.18–162/75.13–99 mmHg and 133–140/71–88.16 mmHg, respectively (Supplementary Tables 1–3). The studies varied considerably in their risk of bias, with none showing a low risk for performance bias (Supplementary Table 3).

### Determining the frequency and level of task-sharing for hypertension management in LMICs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158B6TA]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear a disproportionately higher burden of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). Team-based care approach adds capacity to improve blood pressure (BP) control. This updated review aimed to test team-based care efficacy at different levels of hypertension team-based care complexity.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL for newer articles on task-sharing interventions to manage hypertension in LMICs. Levels of tasks complexity performed by healthcare workers added to the clinical team in hypertension control programs were categorized as administrative tasks (level 1), basic clinical tasks (level 2), and/or advanced clinical tasks (level 3). Meta-analysis using an inverse variance weighted random-effects model summarized trial-based evidence on the efficacy of team-based care on BP control, compared with usual care.

Findings

Forty-three RCT articles were included in the meta-analysis: 31 studies from the previous systematic review, 12 articles from the updated search. The pooled mean effect for team-based care was a -4.6 mm Hg (95% CI: -5.8, -3.4, I2 = 80.2%) decrease in systolic BP compared with usual care. We found similar comparative reduction among different levels of team-based care complexity, i.e., administrative and basic clinical tasks (-4.7 mm Hg, 95% CI: -6.8, -2.2; I2 = 79.8%); and advanced clinical tasks (-4.5 mmHg, 95%CI: -6.1, -3.3; I2 = 81%). Systolic BP was reduced most by team-based care involving pharmacists (-7.3 mm Hg, 95% CI: -9.2, -5.4; I2 = 67.2%); followed by nurses (-5.1 mm Hg, 95% CI: -8.0, -2.2; I2 = 72.7%), dieticians (-4.7 mmHg, 95%CI: -7.1, -2.3; I2 = 0.0%), then community health workers (-3.3 mm Hg, 95% CI: -4.8, -1.8; I2 = 77.3%).

Interpretation

Overall, team-based hypertension care interventions consistently contributed to lower systolic BP compared to usual care; the effect size varies by the clinical training of the healthcare team members.

### Bridging hypertension care shortfalls between provider capacity and patient needs: a pooled analysis of data from 199 countries and territories [^117F68wG]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Team-based care, involving coordinated efforts of healthcare professionals, such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, peer educators, community health workers, mothers' groups), has been shown to significantly improve BP control rates, learning from deployment of similar workforce in HIV and maternal and child health programs. – WHO's HEARTS package is steadily expanding into an institutionalized model of care — now adopted in ≈6000 health centers across 40 countries, including those in Asia (eg, India, Bangladesh) and Africa (eg, Nigeria, Ethiopia), reaching 17.4 million people to date. HEARTS package implements several best practices to achieve optimal BP target among the population, through standardized clinical pathways, mass screening, early assessment of cardiovascular risk, simple treatment protocols involving single-pill combinations, and task-sharing among nonphysicians. A protocol-driven approach, where each team member follows standardized guidelines, ensures consistent monitoring, medication adherence, and patient education, leading to better hypertension management outcomes. Given the lack of trained workforce in low-income settings, skill transfer with nonphysician workforce can alleviate pressure on the already stretched health system. Therapeutic relationship, educational role, and clinical role that nurses perform are also likely to help patients manage their chronic disease better. Nonphysician health workers, including nurses, can be supported by additional training, simplified standard treatment protocols (algorithmic diagnosis and management), and consistent support by physicians by using face-to-face or digitally enhanced methods of coaching and mentoring. Such upskilling and support strategies should be customized according to the level of basic training these nonphysician health professionals have. This will help avoid subjecting community health workers to overburdening with too many responsibilities. Offering designated roles for the nonphysician health workers can also increase reach to the patients in the communities and lead to better clinical outcomes. Although there are several successful community-based interventions of chronic disease management using nonphysician health workforce, such approach may need to be contextualized to ensure that the multidisciplinary model of care works for each country's context. Successful models should also be scaled up within similar contexts, so these initiatives go beyond pilots. Further research is needed to explore the feasibility, practicalities, including cost-effectiveness of such a provision.

### New concepts in hypertension management: a population-based perspective [^11359wcp]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) is the most common chronic disease in the U.S., and the standard model of office-based care delivery has yielded suboptimal outcomes, with approximately 50% of affected patients not achieving blood pressure (BP) control. Poor population-level BP control has been primarily attributed to therapeutic inertia and low patient engagement. New models of care delivery utilizing patient-generated health data, comprehensive assessment of social health determinants, computerized algorithms generating tailored interventions, frequent communication and reporting, and non-physician providers organized as an integrated practice unit, have the potential to transform population-based HTN control. This review will highlight the importance of these elements and construct the rationale for a reengineered model of care delivery for populations with HTN.

### Hypertension treatment capacity in India by increased workforce, greater task-sharing, and extended prescription period: a modelling study [^1118Dq4o]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Our simulation estimates suggest that system-wide reforms focusing on greater task-sharing and extended average prescription duration — even without increasing the workforce — could lead to substantial gains in hypertension treatment in the Indian public healthcare system.

While expanding the workforce may seem a logical approach to increase treatment capacity, even small expansions will come at considerable costs not only for salaries as estimated here, but also for education and infrastructure (e.g. more healthcare facilities). Our findings suggest that the least costly option to increase the treatment capacity to 70% of all adults with hypertension through workforce expansion alone could require over a million additional health workers and a 4-fold increase in salary costs — a tremendous challenge for India or for any health system in the world. However, the selected expansion of specific cadres may be a feasible strategy to improve treatment coverage. For example, our estimates suggest that the ongoing addition of MLHPs in India's public healthcare system will substantially improve the hypertension treatment capacity. Assigning MLHPs to Sub-Centres could allow complete hypertension treatment in this facility type, even without reorganizing duties of existing staff.

In LMICs, where access to and availability of physicians is often limited, non-physician health workers can share the responsibility for certain tasks in hypertension treatment. Our findings suggest that optimizing available resources through task-sharing could expand treatment coverage in the public health system three-fold without hiring more health workers. Research provides evidence on the effectiveness of task-sharing. In a meta-analysis of 31 trials evaluating task-sharing with non-physician health workers for blood pressure management in LMICs, the mean systolic blood pressure was 4.85 mmHg lower with task-sharing than with usual care. Although task-sharing is a promising and likely cost-effective strategy for blood pressure control in LMICs, the success depends on several factors such as adequate training and supervision. A systematic review and qualitative analysis identified several themes for successful incorporation of non-physician health workers in NCD diagnosis and treatment. These themes stressed the importance of selecting and continuously training and supervising health workers; authorize them to prescribe medication and support them with reliable patient tracking data systems and consistent medication supplies; and to compensate them adequately in proportion with their roles.

### Outcomes of a hypertension care program based on task-sharing with private pharmacies: a retrospective study from two blocks in rural India [^113uLTqF]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

About 55 million Indians are estimated to suffer from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) causing an economic loss of $94 billion annually. India accounts for one-fifth of the global deaths due to CVDs. India's health and economic burden from CVD is expected to increase further due to an aging and growing population. High blood pressure (or hypertension) is the most important preventable risk factor for CVDs and accounts for more than half of the CVD deaths. Over the past twenty years, the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in rural India has increased faster than in urban areas owing, in part, to rapid urbanization, lack of formal care in the private sector, and weak non-communicable disease programs in the public sector.

Rural India is estimated to have one allopathic doctor (formal care) for every 10,000 individuals (compared to WHO recommendation of 1:1000) leading many patients to seek care very late or from informal care providers. In such resource-limited settings, task-sharing, the practice of transferring some of the appropriate primary duties from the physician to allied healthcare professionals (e.g. nurses, pharmacists, community health workers), has been found to be effective for managing a range of health conditions. However, although half of India's 800,000 pharmacies are located in rural areas and usually act as the first point of healthcare access, evidence on the feasibility and effectiveness of involving them in task-sharing programs for managing hypertension is limited.

In this study, the Bihar Pharmacist Hypertension Study, we trained community pharmacists in rural India to assist in hypertension screening, diagnoses, treatment, and follow-up without any direct monetary incentives for the pharmacists. We studied the effect of this task-sharing intervention on the care provided to hypertensive individuals and the resulting health outcomes.

### Task-shifting for cardiovascular risk factor management: lessons from the global alliance for chronic diseases [^115UB9NN]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Enablers and barriers of task-shifting

The main challenges faced by the researchers included health system-related barriers, such as inability of NPHWs to prescribe evidence-based medications, availability and affordability of medications and high workload of the staff and NPHWs. The varying capacity, skill-sets and confidence of NPHWs also provided some challenges in providing standardised training. When this occurred, research teams had to offer on the job training and close supervision to ensure high quality and fidelity of the health intervention offered. In South Africa (Ntateko trial), where tasks were shared between nurses and CHWs, nurses were found to give CHWs additional tasks which were beyond their job description and hence difficult to perform. In some studies, there was a role conflict with other senior NPHWs who viewed the new role of newly trained junior NPHWs as a threat to their jobs. Other challenges included high staff turnoverand vacancies in government sponsored NPHW positions. Prioritising work was also a major problem for NPHWs, many of whom had many other routine demanding activities. This barrier was further exacerbated by the lack of remuneration for NPHWs for the new tasks assigned and transition of trained nurses to new roles/locations of employment within the government system. The lack of understanding of research posed another major challenge. As examples, there were challenges to maintaining confidentiality of study participants by NPHWs, while researchers in one study had to ensure that the health promotion intervention was not delivered to the control communities. Unavailability or inconsistent supply of antihypertensive and other medications was yet another health system related barrier which several studies faced during the roll out of the intervention (see table 3 for further details).

Table 3
How to implement an intervention involving task-shifting?

The common enablers for task-shifting across all the studies was the enthusiasm of NPHWs to learn new skill sets and take on a new role. The community accepted their new role and reported that they had better access to healthcare as interventions were delivered in the community rather than the health centres, largely because health centres were difficult to access. In studies which involved the use of technology, there was an initial period of anxiety regarding the use of technology, but later NPHWs felt confident and described the tablet as a tool to help facilitate communications and engage with patients regarding lifestyle modification for CVD prevention. When remuneration, standardised to the country's practices, was provided to the NPHWs for the additional tasks, this was reported to be a major enabler in implementing the intervention.

### Innovations for effective implementation of guideline-based hypertension care in low-income and middle-income countries [^1146J9Qu]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Compared with the enormous effort spent on research to identify cost-effective treatments in clinical trials, there have been few efforts to integrate new strategies in routine clinical practice. The study by Finkelstein and colleaguesfills an important gap in informing health-care professionals and governments on how to improve hypertension care in rural communities. Progressively more rigorous methods have been used to generate evidence on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for hypertension control. Trial-based cost-effectiveness analyses along with budget impact analyses, as used by Finkelstein and colleagues, generally provide a more robust estimate of cost-effectiveness than decision-based models. Despite the remarkably low per-participant cost reported in the trial, expanding the COBRA programme could require a considerable increase in the health-care budget by at least 20–30% across the three countries. An increase in the out-of-pocket expenditure for pharmacotherapy for hypertension could also affect the willingness to seek and continue care. It is, therefore, important to understand how the COBRA-BPS intervention is valued from the patients, service providers, and societal perspectives in public and private facilities. With the increased implementation of health insurance models by governments in south Asia, further economic data will help to examine how different payers value interventions led by community health workers.

Relative to overall budgets and estimated gains, there are other cost-effective strategies to manage hypertension. However, despite all the implementation challenges and available cost-effectiveness evidence, task sharing among physicians and health workers should be viewed as an essential and key element for hypertension control in low-income and middle-income countries. The risk is as Toni Morrison said in her epic novel Song of Solomon: "If we don't create the future, the present extends itself".

### Community health worker-led interventions for hypertension [^114HB4iJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Hypertension is the leading preventable cause of premature death worldwide. The indicators of hypertension are systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, or both. For most older adults, particularly those aged 60 years and older, a target blood pressure of less than 150/90 mmHg is commonly recommended. It is widely recognised that elevated blood pressure is linked to a higher occurrence of cardiovascular disease when compared to normal blood pressure. A study investigating the impact of hypertension on mortality related to circulatory issues found that 65% of deaths amongst people with untreated hypertension were attributed to circulatory causes, while only 36% of deaths in those with normal blood pressure were linked to circulatory issues. In 2010, it was calculated that 31.1% of the global adult population had hypertension, with 75% of them concentrated in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Amongst this population, only 7.7% of those with hypertension managed to maintain their BP below 140/90 mmHg. In low‐and middle‐income countries, hypertension often goes undiagnosed and unmanaged, presenting an overlooked chance for advancements in public health.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Community health workers (CHW), who are trusted community members and share similar cultural and linguistic backgrounds with people dealing with hypertension, can provide emotional and practical support on an individual level. CHWs also have the ability to address healthcare disparities by assessing the needs of people with hypertension and connecting them with community resources. However, it is important to acknowledge that the costs associated with these interventions may limit their full implementation, and may not be appropriate for all healthcare settings or providers. Integrating CHWs into hypertension management is part of team‐based care strategies that leverage the strengths of various healthcare providers. This approach often involves concepts, such as task shifting, during which CHWs take on responsibilities traditionally managed by higher‐level providers, and task sharing, which facilitates collaboration between CHWs and other healthcare professionals. These strategies are particularly valuable in settings with shortages of healthcare providers, enabling CHWs to extend the reach of healthcare systems to underserved populations. Additional challenges include the absence of standardised training programs and certification processes for CHWs, which can lead to variability in their competencies and the quality of care provided. The scope of practice for CHWs varies widely across countries, reflecting differences in healthcare systems, available resources, and cultural contexts. These variations highlight the need for context‐specific training frameworks and flexible policies, to ensure that CHWs can effectively address the unique needs of the communities they serve.

### Can lay health workers support the management of hypertension? Findings of a cluster randomised trial in South Africa [^112Ka8xq]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low/middle-income countries are facing an increasing burden of chronic non-communicable diseases, including a high prevalence of hypertension. In countries with high levels of HIV and tuberculosis (TB), the result is a considerable burden of care in primary healthcare clinics. In South Africa, the health service is managing the world's largest HIV treatment programme, but hypertension, which is more prevalent than HIV, is poorly managed with low levels of awareness and control. In the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) site, based in rural north-east South Africa, around 57% of the adult population have high blood pressure (BP), but the condition is appropriately managed in less than 10%.

Primary healthcare clinics in South Africa are responsible for case finding, treatment and adherence support for patients with chronic diseases. In an effort to provide integrated care for the large number of patients with chronic disease, services have recently been reorganised with appointment scheduling, preappointment retrieval of files and preparing medication prior to the patient's appointment. The aim is to speed the journey for chronic patients through the clinic, improving efficiency, while ensuring chronic conditions are effectively controlled. A recently published review of these changes showed that nurses were struggling to carry out these tasks in addition to clinic consultations.

Task shifting has been an important strategy in the provision of care for patients with HIV and TB. Lay counsellors provide counselling and testing services, and lay health workers (LHW) provide adherence support. We hypothesised that LHWs would be able to assist clinic staff with the administrative and education aspects of the newly reorganised integrated chronic care, allowing the nurses to focus on the clinical consultations and hence leading to improve health outcomes. In this paper, we report the results of a parallel cluster randomised trial which tested a clinic-level intervention, shifting tasks from nurses to LHWs. We aimed to improve the management of chronic conditions, specifically the management of hypertension.

### A systematic review of economic evidence on community hypertension interventions [^115MHrwy]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This review found that community-based interventions targeting health behavior change and medication adherence were considered cost effective and may even reduce long-term healthcare costs. Community interventions that incorporate non-physician providers, such as community health workers, into the U.S. healthcare system may be favorable from a cost-effectiveness perspective. For example, some states have expanded preventive services provided by community health workers or other non-physician health professionals under Medicaid. Further research may focus on economic evaluations of those innovative service models in a real-world setting to assess their long-term effectiveness and economic implications.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^116wmeP9]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Current evidence indicates that hypertension is highly prevalent across the continent and is increasingly affecting younger populations. Implementing a policy for periodic screening, including younger individuals, should be considered. This will require training and recruiting more health care personnel, as well as adopting task-shifting strategies to improve access to hypertension diagnosis and management.

2 Increase treatment access: Access to treatment should be improved to ensure that untreated patients receive treatment. As mentioned above, several barriers exist at both the individual and system levels. At the individual level, these include a lack of understanding about hypertension, fear of treatment, and reluctance to take medication, especially when symptoms are absent. These challenges highlight the need for education on hypertension and the benefits of treatment. At the health system level, barriers include health care workers' limited understanding of guidelines or their reluctance to follow them. It is, therefore, essential to establish policies and training programs to ensure that health care workers adhere to standardized treatment protocols. In addition, training and recruitment of more health care personnel, as well as adopting task-shifting approaches to increase access to diagnosis and management of hypertension, are required. These approaches should be carefully planned and implemented with key considerations to ensure their success and sustainability. Engaging local communities is crucial, as it raises awareness and fosters their support and active participation. In addition, such programs should be integrated into existing health systems or structures, such as primary health care clinics and HIV clinics, to facilitate scalability and long-term success, as has been demonstrated in Uganda and Tanzania. This integration must be complemented by a strong commitment from health authorities and partner institutions to ensure that low-cost or free antihypertensive medications are consistently available and accessible to patients. However, this remains a significant challenge in many sub-Saharan African settings, where there are limited resources, reliance on donor funding, and competing health priorities. Success with this approach has been reported in other settings. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted in rural districts in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to address poor hypertension treatment outcomes and control. The intervention, comprising mainly home blood pressure monitoring and counseling, was performed by trained government community health workers linked with public health care infrastructure and led to a greater reduction in blood pressure.
3 Revisiting current treatment approaches: This requires a multifaceted approach, including the development of comprehensive strategies to strengthen support for patients and their caregivers. Adherence to treatment must be reinforced among those currently receiving care. Given that many patients receiving treatment fail to achieve optimal outcomes, current pharmacological treatment guidelines should be revisited to develop more effective therapies tailored to native African populations. Most guidelines recommend a combination of thiazide diuretics and calcium-channel blockers as first-line agents for Black patients, as these have been reported to be more effective than renin-angiotensin blockers. However, such research is now being contested. Future research should also systematically evaluate health service and system structures, strengthen the evidence base for identifying individuals who would benefit most from treatment, and develop more effective risk stratification approaches suitable for low-income settings.

### Hypertension treatment capacity in India by increased workforce, greater task-sharing, and extended prescription period: a modelling study [^115FwchR]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Our study has limitations. We limited our analysis to costs related to salaries. However, the modelled reforms would require other substantial investments (e.g. medication costs, costs for training, and program costs including transition costs). We also did not account for potential salary increases that might accompany greater responsibilities for some cadres. We did not account for a potentially increased risk of burnout among health workers due to a higher workload, which is an identified barrier for successful task-sharing. We did not estimate the effects on non-hypertension care and, given that some cadres (e.g. ANM and ASHA) traditionally have little or no involvement in NCD care, involving them in hypertension treatment could impact their current workload (e.g. communicable disease treatment and maternal health). However, with a decreasing prevalence of communicable disease in India, these cadres may shift some of their workload to address hypertension and other increasingly prevalent NCDs. Still, we constrained our primary analyses to a fixed proportion of the time that staff spend on hypertension care (i.e. ∼17%), to minimize the potential negative impact on non-hypertension care. We also did not consider the potential benefits on non-hypertension care that could be expected if additional health workers dedicate on average 83% of their facility-based work hours to care not related to hypertension. The prescription periods evaluated in this study are considered as averages over all patients, with shorter prescription periods required for patients with poorly controlled HTN and/or co-morbidities and longer prescription periods for patients with uncomplicated, well-controlled HTN. Our model also included a term for the estimated 19% of patients who require more time due to comorbidities. Age- and sex-specific estimates of hypertension prevalence used in the models were collected in 2012–2014 and may not be fully representative of current prevalence. However, the estimates used were consistent with findings from a smaller but recent and nationally representative survey. While increased treatment coverage is expected to also elevate blood pressure control rates, we did not estimate the impact on blood pressure control per se or hypertension-related diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases). However, a recent modelling study estimated that improving awareness, treatment coverage, and treatment control of hypertension, each to 80% of target, could prevent around 12% of annual cardiovascular deaths in India. Our modelling study does not prove that the reforms will definitively result in more patients treated in the public health system. Rather, it provides quantitative and comparative estimates, corresponding uncertainty, and assessments of sensitivity to different inputs to guide policymakers considering population-wide hypertension treatment coverage strategies.

### Bridging hypertension care shortfalls between provider capacity and patient needs: a pooled analysis of data from 199 countries and territories [^111pGjYv]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

More than 1.3 billion adults are estimated to have high blood pressure (BP) globally, which leads to ≈11 million deaths per year. – The absolute number of people living with hypertension has nearly doubled in the past 30 years, with 90% of growth seen in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There are significant disparities in BP control globally, with high-income countries (HICs) having roughly double the hypertension awareness (71% versus 39%) and treatment (52% compared with 28%), and four times the control rates of LMICs (37% versus 10%). Despite advances in BP measurement technology and the availability of safe and effective antihypertensive medicines, a large proportion of patients with hypertension are undetected and do not achieve BP control.

Availability of qualified health professional human resources is a central element for increasing access to quality hypertension services. In many countries, hypertension services are often provided by nonphysician health workers, such as nurses, or allied health professionals with limited training on hypertension due to shortages of physicians. Hypertension professionals who are either a physician or a trained nonphysician health worker are needed for long-term follow-up to monitor progress and refill medications. However, the availability of hypertension professionals remains scarce for a large proportion of the global population. The migration of qualified health workers from low-income countries (LICs) and lower middle–income countries to higher-income countries further complicates the situation. Thus, for addressing the gaps in hypertension care, adoption of team-based, protocol-driven approaches to hypertension management have received interest globally. Evidence suggests that multidisciplinary care models — incorporating nonphysician health workers, such as nurses, pharmacists, and community health workers — enhance treatment adherence, patient monitoring, and overall BP management outcomes.–

Despite the literature assessing gaps in hypertension services globally, no studies have systematically estimated the global gap between health system capacity (ability to provide clinic visits by physician or nonphysician health workers, such as pharmacists, nurses, and community health workers) and patient need (number of clinic visits needed to treat and monitor hypertension based on prevalence). The objective of this study was to estimate the overall capacity of health systems to meet demand for management of patients with hypertension, both globally and across different income regions.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: the current profile, recent advances, gaps, and priorities [^112oiSfM]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent global and regional reports consistently confirm the high and increasing prevalence of hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with poor detection, treatment, and control rates. This narrative review summarises the burden of hypertension in SSA and recent findings from community-based hypertension management strategies. We further outline prominent risk factors according to recent data and associated underlying mechanisms for hypertension development. An extensive review of literature showed that most countries have reported on the prevalence of hypertension during 2017–2023, despite limitations linked to the lack of nationally representative studies, heterogeneity of sampling and data collection methods. Task-shifting approaches that assign roles to model patients and community health workers reported improved linkage to healthcare services and adherence to medication, with inconsistent findings on blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects over time. The regularly reported risk factors include unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, increased adiposity and underweight, ageing, level of education, and/or income as well as psychosocial factors. Newer data on the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to hypertension and potential areas of intervention are reported from children and adults and include, among others, salt-handling and volume overload, endothelial function, BP dipping patterns and the role of human immunodeficiency virus. To conclude, significant strides have been made in data reporting from SSA on the burden of hypertension in the region as well as biomarker research to improve understanding and identification of areas of intervention. However, gaps remain on linkage between knowledge generation, translation, and implementation research. Coordinated studies addressing both discovery science and public health are crucial to curb hypertension development and improve management in SSA.

### Hypertension treatment capacity in India by increased workforce, greater task-sharing, and extended prescription period: a modelling study [^112xWQ13]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

While the evaluated reforms may increase the treatment capacity of the public health system to cover a majority of adults with hypertension, many patients in India choose private facilities for their routine care. In a nationwide survey, half of the households with hypertension chose private facilities for their routine care and only 20% utilized public primary care facilities. The main reasons for not using public healthcare were negative perceptions of long wait times, poor quality of care, and low doctor availability. While many of these perceived shortcomings could be addressed by extended prescription periods and greater task-sharing, further reforms to India's public health system may be necessary to increase the trust in the public health system. In addition, overall treatment coverage could potential be increased by reforms targeting the private health system.

Our findings have implications for many other countries with an insufficient number of physicians and other healthcare providers to manage hypertension. Although each country has a unique healthcare system, it is likely that the two reforms of greater task-sharing and an extended prescription period could improve hypertension treatment coverage in other countries as well. Nonetheless, quantification of coverage and financial implications in another country would require a specific investigation. These reforms could also have considerable impact on the management of other NCDs. Diabetes management in LMIC settings, for example, may benefit from task-sharing with non-physician health workers.

### Development of an entirely remote, non-physician led hypertension management program [^117BiUox]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Development and rationale

The program began with recognition that like many other centers nationally, hypertension control at our academic institution in Boston, Massachusetts was suboptimal, and the clinical and economic sequelae were numerous. The mandate for new approaches also included multiple economic drivers. Cost issues included loss of incentive revenue from failure to meet internal performance framework metrics, as well as the burden of hospitalizations and procedures, such as revascularization required to care for the consequences of uncontrolled hypertension within shared savings and/or capitated contracts. Formal cost analyses of treating hypertension according to the intensified 2017 guidelines is still awaited. However, estimates using the cardiovascular disease (CVD) policy model demonstrate cost‐effectiveness or cost‐savings as well as prevention of cardiovascular events and death from treating hypertension more intensively in men and women aged 35 to 74 years. 10, 11

### Clinician adherence to hypertension screening and care guidelines [^116CbQ2k]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We found low clinician adherence to opportunistic hypertension screening guidelines in Chennai and Kolkata. Clinicians measured BP in approximately only half of consultations with SPs. We also found poor clinician communication. When clinicians measured BP, they communicated results to SPs in only over half of consultations, with less communication provided to females than males.

These results suggest that hypertension is being substantially underdiagnosed in urban India as clinicians frequently skip essential screening actions. Even after BP measurement, awareness among patients could be low due to poor communication by clinicians. This study was limited by use of only 2 urban centers and inability to assess long-term or follow-up care.

The results and the broader literature from India suggest that quality-improvement interventions need to directly target clinician behavior. Commonly used approaches for clinician behavior change, such as financial incentives and sanctions, may be challenging to implement in India due to limited resources, oversight, and regulation. In India, approaches such as clinical support systems, task-shifting, and nonfinancial incentives may be more practical. Changing clinician behavior is crucial to translating India's ongoing primary care improvement efforts into increased hypertension control.

### Intensive blood pressure control in individuals with hypertension… [^112ucbAr]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In both the aging and younger general population with hypertension, the nonphysician health care practitioner–led, multifaceted, intensive blood pressure intervention model could effectively and safely reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause death. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03527719. In recent years, several high-quality implementation studies showed promising results of nonphysician health care practitioner–led comprehensive intervention strategies on hypertension control. 9–11 Nevertheless, they did not focus on older patients, and no CVD and death outcomes were evaluated. In the China Rural Hypertension Control Project trial, we found that a nonphysician community health care practitioner–led intervention model was effective in reducing CVD outcomes.

12 However, the sustainable effectiveness and safety of this multifaceted model among patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older has not been studied, to our knowledge. In the CRHCP trial, we have constructed a community-based, multifaceted intervention model led by nonphysician community health care practitioners. 12, 15 Most village doctors have some medical training, such as 3 years of vocational or junior medical education. The nonphysician community health care practitioner in the intervention group implemented the multifaceted implementation strategy. They received a series of training sessions covering details of daily hypertension management. 16 After initial training and certification, retraining and quality improvement consultations were conducted periodically throughout the study.

The nonphysician community health care practitioner in the intervention group was responsible for routine treatment of patients with hypertension. For study-related tasks, the nonphysician community health care practitioner received a portion of their salaries from research grant funds and a performance-based incentive supplement. The primary care physicians at township hospitals guided and audited BP management and provided monthly feedback to the nonphysician community health care practitioners. Hypertension specialists at city or county hospitals provided routine training to nonphysician community health care practitioners and helped in treating patients with heart and kidney complications.

The present study extends and details the main CRHCP trial findings in community-based patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older and younger than 60 years in rural China, demonstrating that a nonphysician health care practitioner–led, multifaceted, intensive BP intervention model sustainably and safely reduced incident CVD by 25% and total mortality by 10% in the older general population.

### Supportive supervision visits in a large community hypertension programme in Nigeria: implementation methods and outcomes [^116DyxH1]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Effectiveness outcomes of our supportive supervision were also generally high, similar to evidence from a range of studies that demonstrate the benefit of supportive supervision over more traditional training, including Rowe et al showing the benefits of supportive supervision. The high performance of CHEWs in BP measurement fidelity, BP measurement coverage and recording accurate data on patient's treatment cards may also be due to the well-structured training and retraining in the first programme year as part of the HTN Programme strategyand throughout the HTN Programme study period. Similar results on high levels of fidelity to BP measurement were seen in a study for the integration of hypertension care into HIV clinics at PHCs by community nurses under the supportive supervision of practice facilitators in Nigeria, where training and retraining were done. Other reasons for the high performance may be increased CHEW motivation due to supportive supervision. Rowe et al in a modelled study of supportive supervision strategies among health professionals in LMICs found it can be effective by 8.8%–11.5% points higher if the supervisors are being supervised and 14.2%–20.8% points higher if engaged in joint problem solving with healthcare providers when compared with the control group. While we did not include measurement of the supervision of the supervisors, these results support our findings from our model which included the joint problem solving. Our results of improving quality were similar to those from Smith et al in the primary care setting and task shifting in Rwanda, who found that mentoring and enhanced supervision in mental health improved quality of care by primary care nurses. A scoping review by Abujaber et al also emphasised the importance of regular supportive supervision during task shifting with trained high-quality supervisors, providing further strength to our conclusions.

### Bridging hypertension care shortfalls between provider capacity and patient needs: a pooled analysis of data from 199 countries and territories [^115mCqXL]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

This study estimates the overall gaps between health system capacity of physician and nonphysician providers (nurses, pharmacists, and community health workers) and patients' needs for hypertension management across country income groups.

METHODS:

We extracted data on population, physician, and nonphysician density (nurses, pharmacists, community health workers) per 10 000 people from the World Bank Databases for 199 countries in 2021. Data on hypertension prevalence were obtained from the Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) in 2021. We estimated patient need for clinic visits under 4 scenarios: 12 visits per patient per year (high demand [base scenario, reflecting common practice in many low- and middle-income countries, where physicians conduct monthly visits for medication refills]), 6 visits (intermediate scenario), 3 (low scenario), 1 (minimal scenario) and 2 scenarios based on health worker capacity to provide clinic services: 20 patients per day (base capacity) and 10 patients per day (low capacity) per provider.

RESULTS:

The overall prevalence of hypertension was 37.5 (SD, 6.6%): 36.2 (7.0%) in high-income countries, 40.3 (6.7) in upper middle–income countries, 36.1 (5.7%) in lower middle–income countries, and 36.7(4.8%) in low-income countries. Physicians (mean ± SD, 19.2 ± 17.4), nurses (47.3 ± 54.1), pharmacists (3.9 ± 4.7) per 10 000 were higher in high-income countries, whereas community health workers (3.4 ± 7.3) were higher in low- and middle-income countries. All countries showed workforce deficits in the high-demand scenario, which eased under intermediate and minimal scenarios. Incorporating team-based care further reduced these deficits, yielding net surpluses in 36 countries.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our analysis highlights significant global health service capacity gaps if hypertension management continues to rely solely on physicians. Addressing these gaps requires expanding team-based care, improving training, and enhancing healthcare infrastructure.

### Task-sharing with community health workers to treat hypertension: a scoping review [^113rZXSp]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Many studies have implemented and evaluated task-sharing interventions with community health workers (CHWs) to manage hypertension. To identify gaps in research, we conducted a scoping review. We searched original articles published in PubMed and EMBASE between 2010 and 2022 and found 122 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. Only seven articles were from low-income countries (LICs), most of which were qualitative studies or mixed methods studies. In the identified 122 articles, CHWs often performed health education (61.3%) and measured blood pressure (60.4%). Whereas CHWs carried out pharmacological treatment in only three studies. Participant homes (75.0%) were the most common setting for receiving interventions. Our study identified specific needs for future research, specifically, studies in LICs that are experimental in design and that collect relevant qualitative information, and studies in which CHWs do advanced task. In addition, publications of CHW studies should provide a more comprehensive list of intervention features.

### Lost in translation: why are rates of hypertension control getting worse over time? [^112T4qzH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment of hypertension to decrease rates of cardiovascular disease is the most well studied and most broadly applicable treatment in cardiovascular prevention. Blood pressure can be measured anywhere, not just in a physician's office; medications are readily available, inexpensive, and have highly favorable benefit/harm ratios with relatively minimal side effects; and stepped medication regimens can be prescribed in algorithmic fashion by a variety of practitioners. Yet overall hypertension control rates in the United States have never exceeded 60%, and the last 5–10 years have seen decreased, rather than increased, rates of control. Here, I describe the scale of this massive failure to deliver on the promise of preventive hypertension care; outline the populations most affected and the contemporaneous events that have impacted hypertension control; discuss the disparate paths of hypertension science and health care delivery; and highlight novel interventions, approaches, and future opportunities to bend the curve back toward improvements in hypertension control.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^116P58PY]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The burden of hypertension is rising rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), posing significant health challenges and economic costs that hinder national development. Despite being well-studied in clinical medicine, the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension in SSA remain inadequate. This is due to barriers across the care continuum, including individual-, provider-, and system-level obstacles within the health system. A critical issue is the lack of contextualized mechanistic research to understand the mechanisms, phenotypes, and treatment responses in native SSA populations. Current treatment approaches are often based on data from diaspora Africans, particularly African Americans. Consequently, most guidelines do not recommend angiotensin system drugs as first-line agents for Black patients, a stance that should be reconsidered given some evidence of their effectiveness in native SSA populations. Addressing these barriers requires a comprehensive, multisectoral strategy that includes both preventative and clinical measures at the population and individual levels. Preventative approaches should encompass health and nutrition education, improving food supply quality, and implementing comprehensive transportation and environmental policies. In addition, strategies should be developed to increase the detection of undiagnosed cases through enhanced screening and treatment access to those not receiving care, and revisit current treatment approaches to ensure that they are more tailored to the specific populations and settings. In conclusion, innovative strategies are needed to identify and overcome barriers to hypertension diagnosis and management. A coordinated, multisectoral approach that includes a contextualized mechanistic research agenda, as well as task shifting and task sharing, will help prevent and reduce hypertension in SSA.

### Impact of a community health worker led intervention for improved blood pressure control in urban Nepal: an open-label cluster randomised controlled trial [^115A94To]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Effective control of hypertension remains challenging in low and middle-income countries. We tested the effectiveness of comprehensive approaches to hypertension management including six home visits by community health workers with regular follow up by a trained healthcare provider on blood pressure levels in Nepal.

Methods

We implemented a non-blinded, open-label, parallel-group, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial, with 1:1 allocation ratio in Budhanilakantha municipality, Kathmandu, Nepal. Ten public health facilities and their catchment area were randomly allocated to receive comprehensive intervention or only usual hypertension care. We recruited 1252 individuals aged 18 years and older with hypertension. The primary outcome was systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes were diastolic blood pressure, proportion with controlled blood pressure, waist to hip ratio, body mass index, physical activity, diet quality score, daily salt intake, adherence to antihypertensives, hypertension knowledge and perceived social support. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat using a linear mixed model.

Findings

Participants were, on average 57 years old, 60% females, 84% married, 54% Brahmin/Chettri ethnicity and 33% were illiterate. The decrease in mean systolic blood pressure (1.7 mm Hg, 95% CI −0.1, 3.4) and diastolic blood pressure (1.6 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.5, 2.6) was more in the intervention arm compared to the control. The proportion with blood pressure control (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.0, 2.1) and engaging in adequate physical activity (≥ 600 Metabolic equivalents of task per week) (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6, 3.1) were higher in the intervention arm compared to control. The change in hypertension knowledge score was higher and daily salt intake was lower in the intervention arm compared to control. Waist to hip ratio increased more and global dietary requirement scores decreased more in the intervention group and there was no effect on the body mass index and adherence to antihypertensives.

Interpretation

Community health workers facilitated home support and routine follow-up care by healthcare providers was effective in controlling blood pressure in urban Nepal. These findings suggest comprehensive interventions targeting individual, community and health system barriers are feasible in low resource settings, but larger implementation trials are needed to inform future scale-up.

### Learning implementation of a guideline based decision support system to improve hypertension treatment in primary care in China: pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial [^113DwkF2]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

Our study has implications for strengthening the primary care systems in China and other resource restricted regions or countries with heavy burdens of cardiovascular disease. Unlike other multicomponent intervention strategiesthat inherently require more resources to implement and are more complex to scale-up, CDSS could potentially serve as a low cost, efficient, scalable, and sustainable means to improve access and equity to high quality care of hypertension. Primary care practices included in this study might differ in some ways from those in other regions of China and other resource restricted regions or countries, such as the availability of health information systems, antihypertensive drugs, and qualification of primary care providers. Despite these limitations, in rural areas where computers are not equipped to use a CDSS, the CDSS could support decision making through mobile phones or tablets, where highly compatible electronic health records for hypertension management can be installed. Another difference is that in this study the antihypertensive drugs were dispensed every 1–3 months, but in many primary care settings from other resource restricted regions or countries, a shorter prescription period may be common since a reliable supply chain of antihypertensive drugs may be difficult owing to problems with storage capacity.CDSS could be more useful when more frequent visits and prescriptions are needed. Of note, CDSS in this study was used by primary care doctors with higher education levels. As non-doctor health workers play an important role in task sharing or shifting strategies to mitigate the under-qualification and deficiency problems of primary care doctors, future investigations could assess the effectiveness of CDSS among these staff with appropriate training and supervision.

Conclusions

The use of CDSS for hypertension management statistically significantly improved guideline accordant primary care for antihypertensive treatment and led to a modest reduction in blood pressure. This strategy offers a promising approach to delivering high quality care for hypertension efficiently and safely, particularly for resource constrained regions with a heavy burden of cardiovascular diseases like China.

### A community-based comprehensive intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in hypertension (HOPE 4): a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^1122py9X]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease globally. Despite proven benefits, hypertension control is poor. We hypothesised that a comprehensive approach to lowering blood pressure and other risk factors, informed by detailed analysis of local barriers, would be superior to usual care in individuals with poorly controlled or newly diagnosed hypertension. We tested whether a model of care involving non-physician health workers (NPHWs), primary care physicians, family, and the provision of effective medications, could substantially reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

Methods

HOPE 4 was an open, community-based, cluster-randomised controlled trial involving 1371 individuals with new or poorly controlled hypertension from 30 communities (defined as townships) in Colombia and Malaysia. 16 communities were randomly assigned to control (usual care, n = 727), and 14 (n = 644) to the intervention. After community screening, the intervention included treatment of cardiovascular disease risk factors by NPHWs using tablet computer-based simplified management algorithms and counselling programmes; free antihypertensive and statin medications recommended by NPHWs but supervised by physicians; and support from a family member or friend (treatment supporter) to improve adherence to medications and healthy behaviours. The primary outcome was the change in Framingham Risk Score 10-year cardiovascular disease risk estimate at 12 months between intervention and control participants. The HOPE 4 trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01826019.

Findings

All communities completed 12-month follow-up (data on 97% of living participants, n = 1299). The reduction in Framingham Risk Score for 10-year cardiovascular disease risk was -6.40% (95% CI 8.00 to -4.80) in the control group and -11.17% (-12.88 to -9.47) in the intervention group, with a difference of change of -4.78% (95% CI -7.11 to -2.44, p < 0.0001). There was an absolute 11.45 mm Hg (95% CI -14.94 to -7.97) greater reduction in systolic blood pressure, and a 0.41 mmol/L (95% CI -0.60 to -0.23) reduction in LDL with the intervention group (both p < 0.0001). Change in blood pressure control status (< 140 mm Hg) was 69% in the intervention group versus 30% in the control group (p < 0.0001). There were no safety concerns with the intervention.

Interpretation

A comprehensive model of care led by NPHWs, involving primary care physicians and family that was informed by local context, substantially improved blood pressure control and cardiovascular disease risk. This strategy is effective, pragmatic, and has the potential to substantially reduce cardiovascular disease compared with current strategies that are typically physician based.

### Impact of a community health worker led intervention for improved blood pressure control in urban Nepal: an open-label cluster randomised controlled trial [^113AUwe2]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Participant recruitment and consent

After randomisation, trained enumerators (nursing or bachelor's degree in health sciences) identified participants with support from health care providers, female community health volunteers, local volunteers and during health camps. Participants aged 18 years and older, with an established hypertension diagnosis (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg or prescribed antihypertensives), residing in the catchment areas of the primary public health facilities (clusters), able to respond to questions, and not planning to change residence during follow-up (12 months) were eligible. Participants with high blood pressure measurement in two assessments and no prior hypertension diagnosis were referred to physician for confirmation before enrolment. Pregnant women and individuals with self-reported serious advanced illness such as terminal cancer and paralysis were excluded. Enumerators confirmed eligibility and took written consent from participants explaining the objective of the study and their role. The consent form in the intervention arm also included consent to participate in the home visits.

### Challenges in management and prevention of ischemic heart disease in low socioeconomic status people in LLMICs [^117MLPXA]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The status of awareness, treatment, and control of these risk factors is low in most LLMICs. Hypertension control, which is a marker of overall IHD risk factor control, is very low in LLMICs. Geldsetzer et al. evaluated levels of hypertension control in 44 LMICs with data from 1.1 million participants and reported hypertension in 17.6%. In those with hypertension, 73.6% had had their BP measured, 39.2% were aware of their diagnosis, 29.9% received treatment, and 10.3% had it under control. However, certain LLMICs – Costa Rica, Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh – performed better, attributed to more efficient primary healthcare, better community health worker infrastructure, and a wider availability and affordability of anti-hypertensive medications. In LLMICs, older age, female sex, non-smokers, and greater education and income were associated with improved BP control. Low rates of diabetes control and use of statins in LLMICs have also been reported. A population-based study in India reported rates of 10, 7, and 5%, respectively, in hypercholesterolemia awareness, treatment, and control among urban populations.

Strategies to improve the control of multiple IHD risk factors are required. Universal and efficient primary healthcare with a focus on cardiovascular disease primary prevention (health education, risk factor screening, appropriate lifestyle interventions and treatments) can lead to changes in health behaviors in individuals and communities. Studies have reported that countries in the highest quintile of universal health coverage have lower smoking and tobacco use, BP, and hyperglycemia, all of which are evidence of better risk factor control. System-wide interventional studies are needed to clearly identify the type of healthcare systems and healthcare financing models for CVD prevention. Other strategies involve educating physicians, other health workers, task-shifting or task-sharing between physicians and nurses or other health workers, and the use of digital and pharmaceutical technologies.

### Improving blood pressure control through pharmacist interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114WeSRo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major cause of death worldwide. Although reduction of BP is a cornerstone of the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), numerous hypertensive patients do not achieve adequate BP control. In the United States in 2009‐2010, it was estimated that 53% of all hypertensive people and 40% of treated hypertensive people had uncontrolled BP. Lower rates of BP control have been reported in European countries.

Innovative interventions to improve BP control are therefore needed in primary care, where management of hypertension takes place. One such approach is a greater use of community‐based models of care with the involvement of non‐physician healthcare professionals, specifically, pharmacists and nurses. – The US Community Preventive Services Task Force has recently recommended team‐based care, including pharmacists, to improve BP control. Pharmacists are highly accessible healthcare professionals and a valuable asset in the management of hypertension. – Recently, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of 30 RCTs underlining that pharmacist interventions – conducted alone or in collaboration with physicians or nurses – substantially reduced systolic and diastolic BP and helped control other major CVD risk factors (total and LDL cholesterol, smoking) among outpatients with CVD risk factors. In a second systematic review and meta‐analysis of 15 RCTs, we showed that pharmacist interventions were associated with a better control of systolic and diastolic BP and other major CVD risk factors (total and LDL cholesterol, body mass index) among outpatients with diabetes.

However, in both systematic reviews, a major issue was that various pharmacist interventions were evaluated in different clinical settings with a substantial heterogeneity in the effect estimates on BP. Therefore, some interventions are possibly more efficient than others to reduce BP. The identification of the more efficient pharmacist interventions on BP is of major importance to guide policy and to decide which intervention should be recommended. However, it requires the comparison of data on a large number of studies. Therefore, we combined and updated BP data from these 2 previous systematic reviews to assess the effect of pharmacist interventions on BP among outpatients and to identify determinants of heterogeneity.

### Hypertension treatment capacity in India by increased workforce, greater task-sharing, and extended prescription period: a modelling study [^117JeYqD]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Background

The worldwide control rate for hypertension is dismal. An inadequate number of physicians to treat patients with hypertension is one key obstacle. Innovative health system approaches such as delegation of basic tasks to non-physician health workers (task-sharing) might alleviate this problem. Massive scale up of population-wide hypertension management is especially important for low- and middle-income countries such as India.

Methods

Using constrained optimization models, we estimated the hypertension treatment capacity and salary costs of staff involved in hypertension care within the public health system of India and simulated the potential effects of (1) an increased workforce, (2) greater task-sharing among health workers, and (3) extended average prescription periods that reduce treatment visit frequency (e.g., quarterly instead of monthly).

Findings

Currently, only an estimated 8% (95% uncertainty interval 7%-10%) of ∼245 million adults with hypertension can be treated by physician-led services in the Indian public health system (assuming the current number of health workers, no greater task-sharing, and monthly visits for prescriptions). Without task-sharing and with continued monthly visits for prescriptions, the least costly workforce expansion to treat 70% of adults with hypertension would require ∼1.6 (1.0–2.5) million additional staff (all non-physicians), with ∼INR 200 billion (≈USD 2.7 billion) in additional annual salary costs. Implementing task-sharing among health workers (without increasing the overall time on hypertension care) or allowing a 3-month prescription period was estimated to allow the current workforce to treat ∼25% of patients. Joint implementation of task-sharing and a longer prescription period could treat ∼70% of patients with hypertension in India.

Interpretation

The combination of greater task-sharing and extended prescription periods could substantially increase the hypertension treatment capacity in India without any expansion of the current workforce in the public health system. By contrast, workforce expansion alone would require considerable, additional human and financial resources.

Funding

Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies, was funded by grants from Bloomberg Philanthropies; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and Gates Philanthropy Partners (funded with support from the Chan Zuckerberg Foundation).

### Outcomes of a hypertension care program based on task-sharing with private pharmacies: a retrospective study from two blocks in rural India [^116RePrD]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Low density of formal care providers in rural India results in restricted and delayed access to standardized management of hypertension. Task-sharing with pharmacies, typically the first point of contact for rural populations, can bridge the gap in access to formal care and improve health outcomes. In this study, we implemented a hypertension care program involving task-sharing with twenty private pharmacies between November 2020 and April 2021 in two blocks of Bihar, India. Pharmacists conducted free hypertension screening, and a trained physician offered free consultations at the pharmacy. We calculated the number of subjects screened, initiated on treatment (enrolled) and the change in blood pressure using the data collected through the program application. Of the 3403 subjects screened at pharmacies, 1415 either reported having a history of hypertension or had elevated blood pressure during screening. Of these, 371 (26.22%) were enrolled in the program. Of these, 129 (34.8%) made at least one follow-up visit. For these subjects, the adjusted average difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the screening and follow-up visits was -11.53 (-16.95 to -6.11, 95% CI) and -4.68 (-8.53 to -0.82, 95% CI) mmHg, respectively. The adjusted odds of blood pressure being under control in this group during follow-up visits compared to screening visit was 7.07 (1.29 to 12.85, 95% CI). Task-sharing with private pharmacies can lead to early detection and improved control of blood pressure in a resource-constrained setting. Additional strategies to increase patient screening and retention rates are needed to ensure sustained health benefits.

The integration of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and hypertension care in another rural setting in the Mpumalanga province demonstrated that the integration model has the potential to improve hypertension management, even though the treatment targets for HIV/AIDS were met more frequently than BP treatment targets. In Kenya, a comparison of different levels of care showed that shifting some of the responsibilities from clinicians and nurses to CHWs by incorporating behaviour change communication using either paper-based tools or smartphones resulted in improved linkage to care and some non-significant decline in BP. In contrast, the significant decline in both systolic and diastolic BP in the CLUBMEDS intervention in Nigeria was attributed to, among others, understanding and acceptability of the intervention by patients which improved adherence, similar to application of the same intervention to HIV/AIDS management approaches, which was the basis of this strategy in hypertension management. Although the current studies had limitations, newer feasibility studies for community-based interventions for the management of hypertension offer promise for the knowledge base on the utility and sustainability of community-based interventions to improve care for people living with hypertension in SSA. On pharmacological interventions, optimal medical therapies need to be further investigated. The CREOLE trial has reported that combination of a diuretic with a calcium channel blocker provides efficient BP control and further studies with representation from various regions in Africa are urgently needed to address the current treatment gaps.

### Community health worker-led interventions for hypertension [^117NoQTC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Although there is considerable understanding of how to treat hypertension, the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension remains high, and continues to increase. Obstacles within the healthcare system, amongst healthcare professionals, people with hypertension, and within the community, hinder effective blood pressure management. Previous research has examined the impact of socioeconomic status, access to health care, and lifestyle factors on hypertension control. The preliminary results from large scale studies suggest promising outcomes for CHW‐led interventions. However, concerns have been raised about challenges, such as insufficient knowledge of CHWs, inadequate infrastructural support, and social acceptance of CHWs' services, which may affect the ultimate effectiveness of CHW‐led interventions for hypertension.

Because this is a relatively new area, there is limited systematic evidence regarding the impact of CHW‐led interventions on monitoring and managing symptoms of hypertension. Conducted in a low‐ and middle‐income country (LMIC) setting, one systematic review evaluated CHW‐led interventions between January 2000 and September 2020, but lacked evidence from countries and territories beyond LMICs. In addition, the findings of this study may not fully apply to the post‐COVID era, as they did not incorporate all available data during or after the pandemic. Another review on this topic was published in 2007, which is now over 15 years old, and significant advancements have occurred in CHW‐led interventions, technology, and healthcare policies. New randomised controlled trials and observational studies conducted post‐2007 can provide updated insights.

### Self-screening and non-physician screening for hypertension in communities: a systematic review [^1122M1dH]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The results of this review show that community screening of BP by non-physicians (including self-screening) appears effective for detecting raised BP at screening, and that where data exists for this outcome, high screening BP leads to a new diagnosis or treatment for hypertension in a median of 44% of those referred. However, given the large amount of heterogeneity between study designs, it was not possible to carry out meta-analyses. Combined with the large amounts of variability in results between studies, this makes it difficult to recommend an optimal approach or setting. However, given the likely lower cost of self-screening compared to screening using nurses and other healthcare professionals, it is notable that self-screening appears to detect a similar proportion of participants with high BP as other screening strategies.

While many patients with existing hypertension may use community screening facilities, this is not necessarily a concern, particularly given the proportion of treated patients with uncontrolled BP. Raised pressure in treated hypertensives may prompt them to seek further appropriate medical care. Clear pathways for the referral and follow-up of patients identified with increased BP at screening are essential if the diagnosis of hypertension is to be established and any management benefits realized, but few studies reported any aspect of such follow-up. In many cases, raised screening BP was not subsequently acted upon, with only 3 out of 7 studies evaluating a system with universal referral of all such participants. Reassuringly, where participants were referred and subsequently attended primary care, around 40% received an intervention (new hypertension diagnosis or antihypertensive therapy), indicating the value of follow-up.

Considerable heterogeneity was observed across all analyses, despite stratification, precluding formal meta-analysis. The remaining heterogeneity likely reflects differences in the underlying study populations, and how well these populations are able to access hypertension diagnosis and treatment options. Additional potential sources of heterogeneity include methods of BP measurement, participant age range (which was typically poorly defined), and the influence of recruitment methods, some of which may have been more effective at targeting high-risk populations.

Blinding to existing hypertension status was poorly reported, but other than self-screening, there are no methodological barriers to blinding observers to this outcome. Although a lack of blinding would not be a significant concern for studies using automated devices, many studies in the review used manual BP measurement, which is known to be subject to terminal digit preference, and so observer bias may have been an issue for some of these studies where blinding was not present.

### Improving blood pressure control through pharmacist interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114YknB5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Our findings that the effect on BP was slightly greater if the intervention was led by the pharmacist differ to some extend from a recent umbrella review of systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of community pharmacist intervention. Mossialos et alreported mixed or inconclusive evidence in support of expanding the role of community pharmacist in healthcare delivery. One reason for the difference may be that the review by Mossialos et alwas focused specifically on community pharmacists. Our review evaluated not only studies with community pharmacist interventions but also clinical pharmacist interventions working, for example in outpatient clinic or medical groups. Nevertheless, we agree with Mossialos et althat expanding the role of community pharmacist needs significant changes in healthcare systems, further training of pharmacists and involves policy development.

Furthermore, based on a thorough review, the team‐based hypertension care has been recently recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Forces as an effective strategy to improve BP, with nonphysician healthcare professionals – involving pharmacist, nurses, dietitian – working in collaboration with physician and sharing responsibilities of hypertension care. Comparative effectiveness studies are therefore needed to determine the most efficient interventions and long‐term effect.

Potentially important components of effective pharmacist interventions such as adequate pharmacist training (e.g. measurement of BP or management of hypertension) and remuneration for services (e.g. reviews of medications, resolution of drug related‐problems, patient counseling to improve adherence) should be considered to better understand the heterogeneity of the results of pharmacist interventions reported here. Another possible factor that might explain the reported difference in the reviewed papers is the various types of healthcare delivery system. Indeed, pharmacist involvement is typical and well accepted in the care, for example in the United States or in Canada, compared with European countries, and that could influence the effect size of pharmacist interventions. Obstacles to the implementation of intervention should be also considered. It would be especially relevant for policy recommendations to have such information. However, and this is one limitation of the current review, information about these factors was not available or only partly reported in the studies identified.

### Bridging hypertension care shortfalls between provider capacity and patient needs: a pooled analysis of data from 199 countries and territories [^115AyTAd]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We identified a substantial gap in health system capacity to meet demand for patient management of hypertension when reliant on a physician (12 visits per year per provider); with majority of countries failing to provide adequate hypertension care with high-patient throughput (20 patients per day) and low-patient throughput (10 patients per day). These deficits persisted even when considering 6 visits (intermediate), 3 visits (low), and 1 visit (minimal) to a physician per year in both high- and low-throughput models in LMICs, reaffirming findings from previous studies. Integrating nonphysician health workers into hypertension care reduced the size of deficits but did not eliminate them entirely. This highlights the critical shortage of health professionals affecting the provision of hypertension care in most LICs and L-MICs.

Our findings reinforce a well-documented challenge in global health — the persistent mismatch between healthcare provider capacity and patient needs, particularly in hypertension management. Although the disparities, especially in LIC and L-MIC regions, are expected, implementing sustainable and effective solutions remains a major challenge. Addressing these gaps requires multifaceted approaches, including workforce expansion, task-sharing, and integration of technology-enabled solutions. However, the success of such strategies depends on health system capacity, health financing, and political commitment, making implementation highly complex. Early investments in hypertension management could yield higher returns due to the gains realized by preventing complications associated with hypertension. For example, $1 invested in self-managed BP at home will provide $7.5 to 19.3 in return in terms of better health and productivity over 10 years. Despite recognizing that monthly visits are highly beneficial to patients, we found that the majority of countries do not have the capacity to meet demand based on the current availability of health professionals trained in providing hypertension services. Amid the global hypertension crisis, renewed focus is essential, particularly with substantial investment in building and deploying qualified human resources for hypertension services. Health systems in resource poor countries have arrived at a critical juncture to explore potential avenues to maximize hypertension services including exploring the feasibility of integration of tele-consultation and digital technologies.

### Impact of a community health worker led intervention for improved blood pressure control in urban Nepal: an open-label cluster randomised controlled trial [^112BM8fy]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Background

Effective control of hypertension remains challenging in low and middle-income countries. We tested the effectiveness of comprehensive approaches to hypertension management including six home visits by community health workers with regular follow up by a trained healthcare provider on blood pressure levels in Nepal.

Methods

We implemented a non-blinded, open-label, parallel-group, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial, with 1:1 allocation ratio in Budhanilakantha municipality, Kathmandu, Nepal. Ten public health facilities and their catchment area were randomly allocated to receive comprehensive intervention or only usual hypertension care. We recruited 1252 individuals aged 18 years and older with hypertension. The primary outcome was systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes were diastolic blood pressure, proportion with controlled blood pressure, waist to hip ratio, body mass index, physical activity, diet quality score, daily salt intake, adherence to antihypertensives, hypertension knowledge and perceived social support. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat using a linear mixed model.

Findings

Participants were, on average 57 years old, 60% females, 84% married, 54% Brahmin/Chettri ethnicity and 33% were illiterate. The decrease in mean systolic blood pressure (1.7 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.1, 3.4) and diastolic blood pressure (1.6 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.5, 2.6) was more in the intervention arm compared to the control. The proportion with blood pressure control (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.0, 2.1) and engaging in adequate physical activity (≥ 600 Metabolic equivalents of task per week) (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6, 3.1) were higher in the intervention arm compared to control. The change in hypertension knowledge score was higher and daily salt intake was lower in the intervention arm compared to control. Waist to hip ratio increased more and global dietary requirement scores decreased more in the intervention group and there was no effect on the body mass index and adherence to antihypertensives.

Interpretation

Community health workers facilitated home support and routine follow-up care by healthcare providers was effective in controlling blood pressure in urban Nepal. These findings suggest comprehensive interventions targeting individual, community and health system barriers are feasible in low resource settings, but larger implementation trials are needed to inform future scale-up.

### Development of an entirely remote, non-physician led hypertension management program [^114tk9xE]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension remains poorly controlled on the population level. National rates of control, even when defined leniently by BP < 140/90 mm Hg, are only ~50%. As growing healthcare costs coincide with tighter blood pressure (BP) targets, innovative management programs are needed to maximize efficiency of care delivery and optimize control.

Hypothesis

We aimed to develop a remote, navigator-led hypertension innovation program that would leverage algorithmic care pathways, home BP measurements and patient coaching to allow rapid and complete medication titration.

Methods

A multidisciplinary group of clinical experts from subspecialties and primary care collaborated to develop an evidence-based clinical algorithm, designed to be automated and administered by non-licensed patient navigators. In the development stage, a prospective pilot cohort of 130 patients was managed by nurse practitioners and pharmacists to ensure efficacy and safety. Patients with clinic BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg were enrolled and given a Bluetooth-enabled BP device. Home BPs were transmitted automatically into the electronic medical record. Medication titrations were performed by phone at biweekly intervals, based upon weekly average BP, until home BP was controlled at < 135/85 mm Hg.

Results

Eighty-one percent of all enrolled, and 91% of those patients who regularly measured home BP achieved goal, in an average of 7 weeks. Control was reached similarly across races, genders, and ages.

Conclusions

A home-based BP control program run by non-physicians can provide efficient, effective and rapid control, suggesting an innovative paradigm for hypertension management. This program is effective, sustainable, adaptable, and scalable to fit current and emerging national systems of healthcare.

INCENTIVIZE TEAM-BASED CARE

Team-based care, a health system intervention to enhance patient care by having 2 or more health care professionals work together, is another best practice. In a prior meta-analysis, team-based care with medication titration by physicians and clinicians other than physicians resulted in pooled mean systolic BP reductions of 5.7 and 6.6 mm Hg, respectively. Team-based care with treatment protocols has a robust empirical foundation and can advance hypertension control.

These studies suggest that most patients can be successfully managed with team-based care. Expanding team-based care may require addressing professional "turf" issues, which often involve debates regarding who can and who should provide health care services independently.

Team-based care involving pharmacists is an effective strategy to improve hypertension control. Trials involving pharmacists result in mean systolic BP reductions of 6.1 mm Hg. Prior researchers have suggested that wider use of pharmacists may be enhanced if they could independently prescribe antihypertensive therapy, without collaborative practice agreements, with reimbursement at levels that covers the costs of their services.

Team-based care involving nurses improves hypertension outcomes. Nurse-led team-based care results in a mean SBP reduction of 5.84 mm Hg. Nurses measure BP, provide patient education, conduct community-based screenings, and implement community-based hypertension control programs, and nurse practitioners diagnose and manage hypertension. In the United Kingdom, nurse prescribers who are registered nurses undergo specific training, which allows them to prescribe medications from a specified list without physician supervision. Findings from global studies suggest that expanding the role of the nurse in team-based care to include nurse-prescribing or titrating of hypertension medications may be a promising way to improve hypertension control, and presents an opportunity for future study.

Community health workers are frontline health workers who are essential allies in improving hypertension control and advancing health equity. Because community health workers often come from the communities they serve, they are more likely to be culturally sensitive and adept at overcoming socioeconomic and other barriers to hypertension control. In the United States, community health workers are effective team members in managing hypertension and other chronic conditions and serve as a link between the community and clinic.

Since payers often determine reimbursement models, efforts engaging them in more effectively supporting team-based care is worthwhile. Payers may also support value-based care to reimburse health care teams based on the quality of hypertension care rather than the current fee-for-service model.

### The need for transformative innovation in hypertension management [^116rfj3y]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Despite multiple available effective therapies for hypertension, many patients with high blood pressure in the United States are not adequately controlled. This inability to effectively manage hypertension can be attributed to patient, provider, and system failures. To create an effective model for hypertension management, current care delivery systems must be reorganized around the following principles: improved patient engagement and patient-provider communication, increased use of nonphysician providers, better performance monitoring and feedback systems, and better aligned reimbursement models. Transformation of care around these principles would lead to marked improvements in cost, quality, and access to care.

### Priorities for research on hypertension care delivery: a WHO report executive summary [^114JiKUy]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the World Health Organization released a report on Priorities for Research on Hypertension Care Delivery; this article provides its executive summary. The World Health Organization and its technical experts formed a leadership team, developed a scope and objectives, created a thematic framework, developed a survey for each theme, and identified research priorities. The 5 themes included (1) Health care workforce for hypertension care delivery, (2) Service delivery system/models, (3) Patient retention/adherence, (4) Financing the care delivery system, and (5) Research gaps identified in the World Health Organization 2021 Hypertension Guideline. The leadership team received feedback from diverse experts through webinars and online surveys. The final report was peer-reviewed by external experts. According to postwebinar surveys, we identified 5 to 7 research priorities within each theme, totaling 29 research priorities. The 10 highest priorities were (1) Cost-effectiveness of combination therapy in low/middle-income countries, (2) A system allowing hypertension care closer to home, (3) Health system reform allowing trained community health workers to refill/initiate/titrate antihypertensive medications, (4) Health system reform allowing nurses to diagnose and treat hypertension, (5) Gaps in the medication supply chain, (6) New approaches integrating the management of hypertension and other diseases, (7) Digital approaches for improving medication adherence, (8) Optimal approaches to train health care workers, (9) Approaches to finance hypertension control programs, and (10) Implementation research on task-sharing approaches. These research priorities provide guidance to researchers, with immediate implications for substantially improve hypertension care and prevent its sequelae. We urge governments, funding agencies, and organizations to consider supporting these research topics.

### Self-screening and non-physician screening for hypertension in communities: a systematic review [^115VNyCQ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of studies (39, 53%) were undertaken in the United States. We may have missed studies from other countries; however, we did screen over 16,000 studies, and examined 285 full text papers. This suggests a lack of generalizability of our findings to other countries, as the effects of screening may be dependent on the organization and coverage of the healthcare system.

No previous systematic reviews of community screening or self-screening for hypertension were identified in the search results, suggesting that this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the literature on this subject. International community-based surveys of BP and hypertension prevalence continue to suggest both significant proportions of undetected hypertension and of poor control among those detected.

The quality of the studies we found limits our ability to come to a definite conclusion as to the best method for implementing hypertension screening. We therefore perceive the need for high-quality studies that include BP target definitions, measurement methods, and subsequent data on the proportion of new hypertensive patients diagnosed. Indeed, those implementing self-screening should routinely embed a robust evaluation to underpin the ongoing use of resources in this area. To ultimately determine the cost effectiveness of these methods, there will be a need for robust randomized trials.

New developments in technology, including the use of social media to promote screening, use of smartphones, and enhanced network connectivity enabling screening results to be incorporated directly into electronic medical records, may improve the uptake and efficacy of community BP screening, and particularly self-screening.

As few studies followed up all participants to diagnosis, we are unable to assess what proportion of participants with raised BP at screening had true hypertension. The lack of studies with adequate follow-up make it currently impossible to determine whether these initiatives are effective or worthwhile. Properly powered studies including both cost and efficacy data are therefore required. As with standard clinical practice, such studies should follow-up all cases of raised BP with robust diagnostic methods.

In conclusion, despite a large number of studies reporting community-based BP screening by non-physicians, the evidence base for its effectiveness is very poor. Detection of high screening BP by self-screening is similar to that of more resource-intensive methodologies to identify participants with high BP, but cannot currently be recommended due to a paucity of data on this methodology.

### Development of an entirely remote, non-physician led hypertension management program [^117DV3As]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nearly one half of American adults have hypertension. 1 Despite this prevalence, control rates nationally are poor at only around 50%, even using a lenient criterion for hypertension: blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. 2 In addition to substantially increased risk of cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension generates an enormous burden on healthcare systems. Traditional office‐based management of high BP is inefficient and often ineffective.

Selected healthcare systems have reached hypertension control rates of 80% to 90%, their success relying upon suitable organizational and financial structures. 3 Team‐based care models focused on telemonitoring report varying degrees of success. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 We developed and piloted a system for BP control using entirely remote "visits" with non‐physicians who provide medication titration and patient education. During its early stages, non‐physician licensed clinicians, namely pharmacists, and a nurse practitioner, managed patient care. As the program became established, these practitioners trained patient navigators to follow an expert‐developed clinical algorithm, managing treatment in rapid assessment/treatment cycles according to home BP measurements transmitted wirelessly into the electronic medical record (EMR).

### Role of health care professionals in the success of blood pressure control interventions in patients with hypertension: a meta-analysis [^116qKvte]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, only 13.8% of patients with hypertension have their blood pressure (BP) controlled. Trials testing interventions to overcome barriers to BP control have produced mixed results. Type of health care professional delivering the intervention may play an important role in intervention success. The goal of this meta-analysis is to determine which health care professionals are most effective at delivering BP reduction interventions.

Methods

We searched Medline and Embase (until December 2023) for randomized controlled trials of interventions targeting barriers to hypertension control reporting who led intervention delivery. One hundred articles worldwide with 116 comparisons and 90474 participants with hypertension were included. Trials were grouped by health care professional, and the effects of the intervention on systolic and diastolic BP were combined using random effects models and generalized estimating equations.

Results

Pharmacist-led interventions, community health worker-led interventions, and health educator-led interventions resulted in the greatest systolic BP reductions of -7.3 (95% CI, -9.1 to -5.6), -7.1 (95% CI, -10.8 to -3.4), and -5.2 (95% CI, -7.8 to -2.6) mmHg, respectively. Interventions led by multiple health care professionals, nurses, and physicians also resulted in significant systolic BP reductions of -4.2 (95% CI, -6.1 to -2.4), -3.0 (95% CI, -4.2 to -1.9), and -2.4 (95% CI, -3.4 to -1.5) mmHg, respectively. Similarly, the greatest diastolic BP reductions were -3.9 (95% CI, -5.2 to -2.5) mmHg for pharmacist-led and -3.7 (95% CI, -6.6 to -0.8) mmHg for community health worker-led interventions. In pairwise comparisons, pharmacist were significantly more effective than multiple health care professionals, nurses, and physicians at delivering interventions.

Conclusions

Pharmacists and community health workers are most effective at leading BP intervention implementation and should be prioritized in future hypertension control efforts.

### Task shifting to improve the provision of integrated chronic care: realist evaluation of a lay health worker intervention in rural South Africa [^114h5uew]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

In low/middle-income countries (LMIC), task shifting, where tasks are transferred from more to less qualified cadres, is seen as a solution to the shortage of healthcare personnel. However, there are often factors that can dilute its effectiveness. The growing number of patients with a chronic condition in LMICs has led to an increase in patient load in primary healthcare clinics. While shifting some of the nurses' tasks to lay health workers may relieve some of the pressure, there is little evidence on the effect of task shifting on the provision of chronic care. Existing evidence is focused on shifting tasks from doctors to nurses. Those studies which have considered the shifting of tasks to lay health workers have mainly concerned those working in communities rather than health facilities, and have focused on specific conditions such as HIV and AIDS, or maternal and child health.

In nurse-led primary healthcare facilities in rural South Africa there has been an increase in demand for care due to the large number of people receiving HIV and tuberculosis (TB) treatment and the growing prevalence of non-communicable diseases in an ageing population. In 2011, the integrated chronic disease management initiative was intended to improve patient flow and speed patients' journey through the clinic. However, the new process generated extra tasks for nurses (table 1), and there was evidence that nurses were struggling to manage the extra work, and, as a result, the initiative has often not been implemented as intended.

Nurses' additional tasks under integrated chronic disease management

In this paper, we report on a task shifting intervention in which lay health workers assisted nurses. We examined the extent to which task shifting happened and what factors affected the intervention's effectiveness. We explored what contextual influences, and through what mechanisms, the lay health worker intervention enhanced integrated chronic care for patients with hypertension and modified patient outcomes in rural clinics in South Africa. This study was a realist evaluation carried out within the Nkateko cluster randomised controlled trial.

### Burden of high systolic blood pressure in the Eastern mediterranean region, 1990 to 2021: results from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^112EHcT6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Iran, as a country in the middle SDI group, set the Iranian Non‐communicable Diseases Committee, which included 13 targets, 4 of which were directly or indirectly related to hypertension. On the other hand, a country such as Egypt, classified as low‐middle SDI, had the highest DALYs in the EMR. This might stem from inconsistent approaches by physicians in BP measurement, treatment inadequacy, lower awareness, lower treatment, lower control, and lack of registries for CVD risk factors. This shortage of epidemiologic studies to identify national patterns regarding HSBP has led to the adaptation of evidence‐based guidelines in Western countries with some modifications. The high burden attributed to HSBP in Egypt clearly shows the need for high‐quality data at the national level regarding HSBP control among the EMR countries. However, countries such as Pakistan, Libya, and Iraq, despite their higher SDI classification in some cases, exhibit an increased HSBP burden. This deviation may be influenced by sociopolitical instability, economic challenges, or inequities in healthcare access within these countries. Furthermore, variations in lifestyle risk factors, the quality of preventive care, and the prioritization of noncommunicable diseases in health policies could explain these anomalies. A detailed understanding of how SDI impacts healthcare access and public health measures within the EMR could provide deeper insights into these trends. For low SDI countries, feasible interventions include implementing cost‐effective community‐based programs such as mobile health clinics, hypertension awareness campaigns, and task‐shifting strategies to train nonphysician healthcare workers for early detection and management. Integrating HSBP prevention into existing primary care frameworks and leveraging international collaborations to improve access to essential antihypertensive medications could also be impactful. Comparative data from other regions, such as sub‐Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, reveal the effectiveness of interventions such as subsidized BP monitoring and national salt reduction strategies. A detailed understanding of how SDI impacts healthcare access and public health measures within the EMR, alongside lessons from other regions, can inform targeted and sustainable strategies to reduce the HSBP burden.

### Impact of patient care teams on blood pressure control in patients with hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LSG2M]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, with its global prevalence doubling over the past three decades. Despite advancements in antihypertensive therapies, approximately 50% of patients with hypertension fail to achieve their target blood pressure (BP) levels, underscoring the need for innovative care strategies. Patient care teams comprising multidisciplinary healthcare providers have shown promise in improving BP management. This systematic review and meta-analysis were aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of patient care teams involving physicians in hypertension management. To this end, PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and IchuShi-Web were comprehensively searched and 61 randomized controlled trials including 64,857 participants were identified. Compared with usual care, interventions by patient care teams significantly reduced office systolic BP (mean difference: -6.31mmHg; 95% confidence interval: -7.71 to -4.90) and decreased the risk of uncontrolled BP by 27% (risk ratio: 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.68–0.79). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent BP reductions across various team leadership roles, such as physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, and across different intervention durations. These findings highlight the effectiveness of team-based BP management in achieving improved BP control, regardless of team composition or the follow-up period. Multidisciplinary care offers a viable approach to addressing the unmet needs of patients with hypertension, potentially improving cardiovascular outcomes. This evidence supports integrating patient care teams into hypertension management, particularly in settings requiring physician oversight. Future research should focus on refining team structures and tailoring interventions to diverse healthcare environments to enhance their impact.

### Does reducing physician uncertainty improve hypertension control? rationale and methods [^1133a4kK]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly one third of the US population overall, and the prevalence rises sharply with age. In spite of public educational campaigns and professional education programs to encourage blood pressure measurement and control of both systolic and diastolic control to < 140/90 mm Hg (or 130/80 mm Hg if diabetic), 43% of treated hypertensives do not achieve the recommended Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure target. Among blacks, 48% are uncontrolled on treatment. The majority of persons classified as poorly controlled hypertensives have mild systolic blood pressure elevation (in the range of 140 to 160 mm Hg). We hypothesized that physician uncertainty regarding the patient's usual blood pressure, as well as uncertainty regarding the extent of medication nonadherence, represent an important barrier to further reductions in the proportion of uncontrolled hypertensives in the United States. Using cluster randomization, 10 primary care clinics (6 from a public health care system and 4 from a private clinic system) were randomized to either the uncertainty reduction intervention condition or to usual care. An average of 68 patients per clinic were recruited to serve as units of observation. Physicians in the 5 intervention clinics were provided with a specially designed study form that included a graph of recent blood pressure measurements in their study patients, a check box to indicate their assessment of the adequacy of the patient's blood pressure control, and a menu of services they could order to aid in patient management. These menu options included 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; electronic bottle cap assessment of medication adherence, followed by medication adherence counseling in patients found to be nonadherent; and lifestyle assessment and counseling followed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Physicians in the 5 usual practice clinics did not have access to these services but were informed of which patients had been enrolled in the study. Substudies carried out to further characterize the study population and interpret intervention results included ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and electronic bottle cap monitoring in a random subsample of patients at baseline, and audio recording of patient-physician encounters after intervention implementation. The primary study end point was defined as the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure (< 140/90 mm Hg or < 130/80 mm Hg if diabetic). Secondary end points include actual measured clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, patient physician communication patterns, physician prescribing patient self-reported lifestyle and medication adherence, physician knowledge, attitude and beliefs regarding the utility of intervention tools to achieve blood pressure control, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Six-hundred eighty patients have been randomized, and 675 remain in active follow-up after 1.5 years. Patient closeout will be complete in March 2009. Analyses of the baseline data are in progress. Office-based blood pressure measurement error and bias, as well as physician and patient beliefs about the need for treatment intensification, may be important factors that limit further progress in blood pressure control. This trial will provide data on the extent to which available technologies not widely used in primary care will change physician prescribing behavior and patient adherence to prescribed treatment.

### Effectiveness of a task-sharing collaborative care model for identification and management of depressive symptoms in patients with hypertension attending public sector primary care clinics in south Africa: pragmatic parallel cluster randomised controlled trial [^113dNVN2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We tested the real-world effectiveness of a collaborative task-sharing model on depressive symptom reduction in hypertensive Primary Health Care (PHC) patients in South Africa.

Method

A pragmatic parallel cluster randomised trial in 20 clinics in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda district, North West province. PHC clinics were stratified by sub-district and randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Control clinics received care as usual (CAU), involving referral to PHC doctors and/or mental health specialists. Intervention clinics received CAU plus enhanced mental health training and a lay counselling referral service. Participant inclusion criteria were ≥ 18 years old, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score ≥ 9 and receiving hypertension medication. Primary superiority outcome was ≥ 50% reduction in PHQ-9 score at 6 months. Statistical analyses comprised mixed effects regression models and a non-inferiority analysis.

Trial Registration Number

NCT02425124.

Results

Between April 2015 and October 2015, 1043 participants were enrolled (504 intervention and 539 control); 82% were women; half were ≥ 55 years. At 6 and 12 months follow-up, 91% and 89% of participants were interviewed respectively. One control group participant committed suicide. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between intervention (N = 256/456) and control (N = 232/492) groups (55.9% versus 50.9%; adjusted risk difference = -0.04 ([95% CI = -0.19; 0.11], p = 0.6). The difference in PHQ-9 scores was within the defined equivalence limits at 6 and 12 months for the non-inferiority analysis.

Limitations

The trial was limited by low exposure to depression treatment by trial participants and by observed co-intervention in control clinics CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating lay counselling services within collaborative care models does not produce superior nor inferior outcomes to models with specialist only counselling services.

### Hypertension call to action: will we respond to the call with action? [^114Fv68G]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Public health agencies can play a pivotal role at the community level by promoting hypertension awareness and education and leading multisector coalitions. They can also, in collaboration with health care delivery systems, collect and analyze data to map communities at highest risk of uncontrolled blood pressure and focus multisector interventions to reduce their high burden of hypertension-related disease. In partnership with public and private sectors, public health systems can guide these interventions and help mobilize a cadre of community health workers to improve care and help reduce health disparities. Communities with a high hypertension burden should have access to additional targeted funding through various sources such as public health insurance programs and public employee health plans to cover the costs of proven hypertension control interventions, optimally tailoring them to local contexts.

In conclusion, hypertension is a leading preventable risk factor for death in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of addressing the social determinants of health and optimizing patient-centered care to improve health outcomes and reduce racial and ethnic disparities. These same approaches are necessary to improve prevention and control of hypertension. The time is now to respond to the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension — with action.

### Prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in urban poor communities in accra, Ghana [^113MQLaN]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a major public health problem in many sub-Saharan African countries including Ghana, but data on urban poor communities are limited. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the prevalence, awareness, management and control of hypertension among a young adult population in their reproductive ages living in urban poor communities in Accra.

Methods

Cross-sectional, population-based survey of 714 young adults in their reproductive ages (women aged 15–49 years, men aged 15–59 years) living in three urban poor suburbs of Accra, Ghana.

Results

The overall prevalence of hypertension in all three communities was 28.3% (women 25.6% and men 31.0%). Among respondents who had hypertension, 7.4% were aware of their condition; 4% were on antihypertensive medication while only 3.5% of hypertensive individuals had adequate blood pressure (BP) control (BP < 140/90 mmHg). The level of awareness and treatment was lower in men than in women (3.1 and 1.3% for men and 11.9 and 6.5% for women, respectively). Among individuals with hypertension, the rate of control was higher among women than among men (5.0 and 2.1%, respectively).

Conclusion

Although about a quarter of the young adult population in these low-income communities of Accra have hypertension, the levels of awareness, treatment and control are abysmally low. We recommend community-specific primary and secondary prevention interventions that draw on existing resources, specifically implementing cardiovascular disease (CVD) interventions in faith-based organizations and task-shifting CVD care through the national Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) programme.

### Self-screening and non-physician screening for hypertension in communities: a systematic review [^1153eHtn]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Follow-up of participants after screening

Twelve studies provided data on participants following screening. Only 3/7 (43%) referred all participants with elevated screening BP to primary care, and in one case, as few as 26% of those screening positive were referred. Eight studies reported the outcome of the referral, with a median of 44% (range 17%–100%) of those referred receiving a new hypertension diagnosis or new antihypertensive treatment. In 6 out of the 8 studies, this proportion exceeding 40%.
