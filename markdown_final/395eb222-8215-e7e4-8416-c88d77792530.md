## Question

A 68-year-old man is referred to your vascular clinic after a carotid duplex ultrasound reveals a 75% asymptomatic stenosis of his right internal carotid artery. He has no history of stroke or TIA. He is on optimal medical therapy for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. His life expectancy is estimated to be more than 10 years. He is considered to be at average surgical risk. Further imaging shows the presence of a large, ulcerated plaque. The multidisciplinary team discusses management options. The patient asks whether carotid artery stenting is appropriate for him. Additionally, his daughter asks if a carotid intervention could help prevent future cognitive decline, as she is concerned about his memory.

Based on current guidelines, how would you address the appropriateness of carotid artery stenting in this patient, and what would you advise regarding carotid intervention for the prevention of cognitive impairment?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether carotid artery stenting (CAS) is appropriate for a 68-year-old man with 75% asymptomatic right internal carotid artery stenosis and an ulcerated plaque, and whether carotid intervention can prevent cognitive decline. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk category and whether he meets criteria for intervention. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about CAS versus carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in asymptomatic patients. Next, I will examine the evidence on procedural risks and how modern medical therapy alters the risk–benefit balance. After that, I need to check whether ulceration changes the calculus. Finally, I will address the daughter's question about cognitive outcomes and outline a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: this is asymptomatic carotid stenosis at 75%, with good life expectancy and average surgical risk, and the plaque is described as ulcerated. Ulceration is a high-risk plaque feature that increases embolic potential, but I should confirm whether that alone shifts the threshold for revascularization in current guidance before jumping ahead [^49a0a1f4] [^a304d274].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality guidelines. The 2023 ESVS guideline allows considering CAS as an alternative to CEA in average-risk patients with 60–99% asymptomatic stenosis only when there are additional high-risk imaging or clinical features and when the center can achieve a 30-day stroke/death rate under 3% with life expectancy over 5 years, which this patient meets, so CAS is not ruled out categorically [^49a0a1f4]. The 2024 ESC guidance similarly permits considering CAS in asymptomatic 60–99% stenosis when high-risk features are present and procedural risk is low, again emphasizing selective use rather than routine application [^a304d274]. Hold on, I should verify the opposite stance: the European Stroke Organisation explicitly recommends against routine CAS as an alternative to best medical therapy in asymptomatic patients, underscoring that any consideration of CAS should be exceptional and evidence-limited in this setting [^a36b666c].

> I will now examine the comparative effectiveness and safety. High-certainty data show CAS has higher periprocedural stroke or death risk than CEA in symptomatic patients, and in asymptomatic cohorts there is a non-significant increase in periprocedural events with CAS versus CEA, with overlapping long-term stroke prevention once past the perioperative window, so the net composite still favors CEA when both are reasonable options [^bfb28d0b]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: in symptomatic trials the periprocedural stroke/death excess with CAS is about 1.7-fold, and in asymptomatic pooled analyses the point estimate is around 1.7 as well, though confidence intervals cross 1, reflecting uncertainty and the need for careful patient selection and operator expertise [^bfb28d0b].

> But wait, what if modern medical therapy has so reduced stroke risk that even a small periprocedural hazard negates benefit? Contemporary data suggest medically managed asymptomatic severe stenosis carries an ipsilateral stroke risk near 0.9–1.2% per year, which is substantially lower than in the era of the classic trials, shrinking the absolute benefit of prophylactic revascularization and making procedural risk the decisive factor [^88466798] [^a7eae345]. I should double-check that this applies to patients on optimized therapy like this man's, and yes, these figures reflect current medical management contexts, reinforcing caution about routine intervention [^88466798].

> Now, regarding the ulcerated plaque, I initially thought this might automatically qualify as a high-risk feature justifying CAS. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the guideline language. ESVS lists features such as silent infarction, contralateral symptoms, rapid progression, echolucency or intraplaque hemorrhage, and severe stenosis as high-risk markers, but ulceration is not explicitly named as a standalone indication for revascularization in asymptomatic patients, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting it as an indication by itself [^49a0a1f4]. That said, ulceration is associated with increased embolic risk and could reasonably be considered by a multidisciplinary team among imaging features, but it is not a validated standalone trigger in current guidance, so I should correct my earlier assumption and frame ulceration as supportive but not definitive [^4107c636].

> Next, I should review the cognitive question. The daughter's concern is understandable, but I need to ensure we do not overstate unproven benefits. The ESVS 2023 guideline explicitly recommends against performing carotid interventions for the purpose of preventing cognitive impairment in 70–99% asymptomatic stenosis until a causal link is established, so there is no evidence-based role for CAS to prevent cognitive decline at this time [^5d01e170] [^4ba711c7]. Let me reconsider whether any contemporary data contradict this; current reviews and guidelines emphasize association rather than causation, and no randomized evidence demonstrates cognitive benefit from revascularization in asymptomatic patients, so counseling should be clear on this point [^5d01e170] [^4ba711c7].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. CAS is not routinely indicated here, but in a carefully selected asymptomatic patient with 75% stenosis and additional high-risk features, and with a center that can document perioperative stroke/death under 3% and a life expectancy over 5 years, CAS may be considered as an alternative to CEA after multidisciplinary review and shared decision-making that incorporates the small absolute benefit and the higher periprocedural risk of CAS compared with CEA [^49a0a1f4] [^a304d274]. Given average surgical risk and no clear anatomic contraindications to CEA, CEA remains the first-line revascularization option if intervention is pursued, whereas continued best medical therapy with surveillance is entirely reasonable given the low annual stroke risk on modern therapy [^7a05a0a0] [^88466798].

> Practically, I would recommend the following: continue aggressive medical therapy with high-intensity statin, blood pressure control to guideline targets, antiplatelet therapy unless contraindicated, and diabetes optimization. Discuss that CEA has stronger evidence and lower periprocedural risk than CAS in asymptomatic patients, and that CAS may be considered only if high-risk plaque or patient-specific factors are present and the procedural team can meet safety benchmarks. Emphasize that neither CEA nor CAS has proven benefit for preventing cognitive decline. And align the decision with the patient's preferences and the local team's outcomes, documenting that the 30-day stroke/death risk is under 3% if intervention is chosen [^49a0a1f4] [^a304d274] [^5d01e170] [^f6fa58f4].

---

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is **not routinely recommended** for asymptomatic 75% carotid stenosis [^a36b666c], even with ulcerated plaque, because the stroke risk on modern medical therapy is low (~1% per year) [^88466798] and CAS does not clearly improve outcomes over best medical therapy alone [^8b97dcf5]. CAS may be considered only if there are **high-risk features** (e.g. rapid progression, silent infarct, or contralateral symptoms) [^49a0a1f4] and the procedural risk is < 3% with life expectancy > 5 years [^f6fa58f4]. There is **no evidence** that CAS prevents cognitive decline [^5d01e170]; thus, it should not be offered for that purpose [^4ba711c7]. Shared decision-making is essential, and CEA remains the preferred option if revascularization is pursued [^7a05a0a0].

## Current guideline recommendations

### Major society guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation for cas in asymptomatic patients** |
|-|-|
| European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 | Consider CAS only if there are high-risk features (e.g. rapid progression, silent infarct, contralateral symptoms) and the procedural risk is < 3% with life expectancy > 5 years [^49a0a1f4] [^4df69a38] |
| European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2024 | Consider CAS only in the presence of high-risk features and when procedural risk is low [^a304d274] |
| European Stroke Organisation (ESO) 2021 | Do not perform CAS routinely as an alternative to best medical therapy in asymptomatic patients [^a36b666c] |
| Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) 2022 | CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients; CEA is preferred if revascularization is indicated [^notfound] |

---

### Summary of recommendations

- **Routine CAS**: Not recommended for asymptomatic patients without high-risk features [^a36b666c].
- **High-risk features**: Rapid progression, silent infarct, contralateral symptoms, or severe stenosis with high-risk plaque [^49a0a1f4] [^a304d274].
- **Procedural risk**: Must be < 3% and life expectancy > 5 years [^f6fa58f4].
- **Preferred intervention**: CEA remains the first-line revascularization option if indicated [^7a05a0a0].

## Evidence supporting medical management

Contemporary data show that with modern medical therapy (high-dose statins, strict blood pressure control, antiplatelet therapy, and lifestyle modifications), the annual stroke risk in asymptomatic carotid stenosis is approximately 1% [^88466798] [^a7eae345]. This low risk significantly narrows the absolute benefit of prophylactic revascularization, making medical therapy the default strategy for most patients [^8b97dcf5].

---

## Risks and benefits of carotid artery stenting

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include a **reduced long-term stroke risk** in carefully selected patients with high-risk features [^49a0a1f4], though the absolute benefit remains small given the low stroke risk on medical therapy [^8b97dcf5]. CAS is less invasive than CEA and may be preferred in patients with high surgical risk or unfavorable anatomy [^c28129f5].

---

### Potential risks

- **Periprocedural stroke**: Higher than CEA, especially in older adults [^bfb28d0b].
- **Restenosis**: More frequent after CAS than CEA [^bfb28d0b].
- **Cognitive effects**: No evidence that CAS prevents cognitive decline [^5d01e170].

---

## Cognitive decline considerations

There is **no established evidence** that CAS prevents cognitive decline in asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^5d01e170]. Current guidelines explicitly advise against performing carotid interventions solely for the prevention of cognitive impairment until a causal relationship is proven [^4ba711c7].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

- **Age and comorbidities**: Younger patients with longer life expectancy may benefit more from revascularization if high-risk features are present [^49a0a1f4].
- **Plaque characteristics**: Ulcerated plaque alone is not sufficient to mandate intervention; rapid progression or silent infarcts are more compelling [^notfound].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering the small absolute benefit and potential risks [^2705021c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

CAS is **not routinely indicated** for asymptomatic 75% carotid stenosis, even with ulcerated plaque, given the low stroke risk on modern medical therapy and the lack of proven cognitive benefit [^8b97dcf5] [^5d01e170]. Consider CAS only if there are high-risk features, the procedural risk is < 3%, and life expectancy is > 5 years [^49a0a1f4]. CEA remains the preferred revascularization option if intervention is pursued [^7a05a0a0]. Shared decision-making is crucial to align treatment with patient values and preferences [^2705021c].

### Time to rethink management strategies in asymptomatic carotid artery disease [^8f1c0cd1]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Despite level I evidence, no worldwide consensus of opinion exists on how best to manage patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease. In this article, I present the evidence supporting intervention in these patients, highlighting a number of 'inconvenient truths' that challenge the current 'one size fits all' approach to treatment. I will demonstrate that, even if one could identify and treat every individual with a 60–99% asymptomatic stenosis, > 95% of all strokes will still occur. Evidence shows that 94% of all carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting procedures in asymptomatic patients in the US are ultimately unnecessary, costing health-care providers US$2 billion annually. Evidence also exists that the risk of stroke in patients treated medically is lower than when the asymptomatic trials were recruiting, challenging the appropriateness of basing contemporary guidelines upon historical data. A small cohort of 'high-risk for stroke' patients will undoubtedly benefit from intervention and our goal must be to identify and treat these individuals, rather than continuing with a policy of mass intervention that benefits very few patients in the long term.

With rapid evolution of endovascular techniques, carotid artery stenting has emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Several investigations have been performed that examine the roles of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting and some trials have sought to compare the two treatment modalities. There have also been advances in the understanding of optimal medical management of carotid artery stenosis. The obvious question that arises is what is the most appropriate treatment option for patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis? The answer is not straightforward and requires an understanding of differential outcomes in select subgroups. A review of the major studies, including some of the most recent trials, will help to elucidate the optimal therapy.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^2bb66a0f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for extracranial carotid disease — treatment selection and thresholds are as follows: The committee recommends carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the first-line treatment for most symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 60% to 99%. The periprocedural risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons, and CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as the first-line therapy. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

Stroke is a persistent leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and carotid artery atherosclerosis remains a treatable cause of future stroke. Although most patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease may be at a relatively low risk for future stroke, most completed strokes are unheralded; thus, the identification and appropriate treatment of patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease remains a critical part of overall stroke prevention. Select patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with an increased risk of future stroke based on the degree of stenosis and other imaging or patient-related characteristics are appropriate to consider for carotid artery intervention.

### Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: time to rethink our therapeutic options? [^1823b2c3]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is a well-recognized risk factor for ischemic stroke, and its prevalence increases with age. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s, well-designed randomized trials established a definite advantage for carotid endarterectomy in reducing the risk of ipsilateral stroke when compared with medical therapy alone. However, medical treatment of cardiovascular disease has improved significantly over the past 2 decades, and this has, in turn, resulted in a decline of the stroke risk in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis treated medically. This improvement in medical therapy casts doubts on the effectiveness of large-scale invasive treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Several studies have been conducted to identify possible subgroups of patients with asymptomatic stenosis who are at higher risk of stroke in order to maximize the potential benefits of invasive treatment. Ongoing large-scale trials comparing best current medical therapy to available invasive treatments, such as carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting, are likely to shed some light on this debated topic in the near future. In this review, the authors summarize the current controversy surrounding the ideal management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

### Does the 'high risk' patient with asymptomatic carotid stenosis really exist? [^4e85aeba]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Recent evidence indicates that the risk of stroke symptoms in non-operated medically managed patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis has fallen significantly over the last 25 years. This suggests concurrent improvements in vascular disease medical intervention efficacy. If the latest estimates of average annual stroke rate for non-operated patients are reflective of contemporary medical intervention and surgical stroke/death rates match those of the randomised trials, the current implication is that carotid surgery will not offer a stroke prevention advantage over medical intervention alone. Furthermore, it is still not possible to identify patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis with a higher than average ipsilateral stroke risk despite current medical intervention. Even if such patients were one day reliably identified, they could also be at higher risk of stroke/death from instrumental intervention (surgery, angioplasty or stenting) and randomised trials will be required before being justification in routine clinical practice.

### Clinical considerations in the management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis [^b6de06d7]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Incidental findings pose considerable management dilemmas for the treating physician and psychological burden for the respective patient. With an aging population, more patients will be diagnosed with asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis. Patients will have to be counseled with regard to treatment options according to their individual risk profile and according to professionals' knowledge of evidence-based data derived from large randomized control trials. Treatment consensus has long been lacking for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis prior to any randomized controlled trials. Additionally, an individual's risk profile may be hard to assess according to knowledge gained from randomized controlled trials. Moreover, while earlier studies compared carotid endarterectomy and medical therapy, in the past years, a new therapeutic modality, carotid artery angioplasty and stenting, has emerged as a possible alternative. This has been evaluated in a recent randomized controlled trial, the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST), which compared carotid endarterectomy with angioplasty and stenting in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The following review summarizes current knowledge of the natural history, diagnosis, and treatment strategies to counsel patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

### Asymptomatic carotid stenosis: what to do [^872c4931]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis are at increased vascular risk but optimal treatment is controversial. We reviewed the current evidence for medical and surgical intervention in these patients.

Recent Findings

Optimal medical treatment is the most important aspect of management of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. On the basis of previous trials, endarterectomy is only of overall benefit in men, and this benefit may now be obviated by improved medical treatment. There is insufficient evidence to advocate the routine use of carotid angioplasty or stenting in patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Inaccuracy in the measurement of carotid stenosis may contribute to conflicting estimates of stroke risk in relation to the degree of asymptomatic stenosis. Advances in noninvasive imaging of plaque morphology and inflammation and the detection of microembolic signals may help to risk stratify patients but data on clinical usefulness are lacking.

Summary

Absolute benefit from endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis is small, but can sometimes be justified in men. Further research is required to determine long-term benefit in women and to risk stratify patients, particularly in the light of advances in medical treatment.

### Ischemic stroke in patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis… [^88466798]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the stroke rate in patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis without surgical intervention. Findings This retrospective cohort study included 3737 participants with 70% to 99% asymptomatic carotid stenosis identified between 2008 and 2012 and followed-up through 2019 who did not undergo surgical intervention. The estimated rate of ipsilateral carotid-related acute ischemic stroke was 4. 7% over 5 years. Meaning These findings may inform decision-making regarding treatment for patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis. Importance Optimal management of patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis is uncertain, due to advances in medical care and a lack of contemporary data comparing medical and surgical treatment. Objective To estimate stroke outcomes among patients with medically treated asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis who did not undergo surgical intervention. Exposures Imaging diagnosis of asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 70% to 99%.

Main Outcomes and Measures Occurrence of ipsilateral carotid-related acute ischemic stroke. Censoring occurred with death, disenrollment, or ipsilateral intervention. Results. Among 94 822 patients with qualifying imaging studies, 4230 arteries in 3737 patients met selection criteria including 2539 arteries in 2314 patients who never received intervention. The mean follow-up in this cohort was 4. 1 years. Prior to any intervention, there were 133 ipsilateral strokes with a mean annual stroke rate of 0. 9%. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of ipsilateral stroke by 5 years was 4. 7%. Conclusions and Relevance In a community-based cohort of patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis who did not undergo surgical intervention, the estimated rate of ipsilateral carotid-related acute ischemic stroke was 4. 7% over 5 years.

These findings may inform decision-making regarding surgical and medical treatment for patients with asymptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis. Since the publication of several randomized clinical trials in 1995 and 2010, optimal treatment of asymptomatic carotid disease has involved selective intervention. 1, 2 Since then, medical therapy has progressed, and reports have demonstrated improved outcomes with medical therapy alone, raising questions about the absolute incremental benefit of intervention to prevent stroke in asymptomatic patients. 3–5. The stroke risk of asymptomatic carotid disease without surgical revascularization is difficult to ascertain because data sources have been limited to nonsurgical groups of clinical trials, rare prospective studies, or smaller intervention-based studies. 6–8 Furthermore, given the age of these studies, they do not account for the recent advances in cardiovascular risk reduction in the population.

The objective of this study was to describe the long-term risk of stroke among patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis who do not undergo intervention in a more contemporary and racial and ethnically diverse community population. The mean age of the cohort was 73. 8 years,
58. 1% were male, and 73. 0% were White. Of the 3737 patients, 2314 patients with 2539 included arteries did not undergo intervention prior to the study end point. Among patients not meeting the primary end point or undergoing intervention, 1553 patients died, and 268 patients disenrolled from the health plan during the study period. The crude annual ipsilateral stroke rate was 0. 9%. Among the 133 ipsilateral stroke events, 35 patients underwent subsequent intervention and 86 patients died including 15 within 30 days and 19 additional patients within 1 year of stroke.

### Surgical advances for extracranial carotid stenosis [^122623d8]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy is a commonly performed operation to prevent stroke in patients who have asymptomatic or symptomatic internal carotid artery atherosclerotic stenosis. Carotid angioplasty and stenting has also been advocated for treatment of these patients. In this article, we address a number of questions for which a review of available data will advance our understanding of the role of carotid endarterectomy in stroke prevention. These include the following: Are carotid endarterectomy and carotid angioplasty and stenting equivalent procedures for the treatment of carotid artery disease? Which patients should be deemed at high risk for carotid endarterectomy? Should carotid endarterectomy be an urgent procedure in symptomatic patients with severe internal carotid artery stenosis? Finally, what is the role of carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients? We also review the senior author's personal experience with > 2000 consecutive carotid endarterectomies, with special attention to his present approach to this operation. We believe that carotid endarterectomy, in experienced hands, is a minimally invasive operation that remains the procedure of choice for most patients with carotid artery disease who will benefit from invasive treatment.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^fa9082c1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery carotid stenosis management — In symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with low-grade disease, we recommend optimal medical therapy rather than revascularization for (< 50% in symptomatic and < 60% in asymptomatic patients) (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (more than 50%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 50%) and high perioperative risk, we suggest carotid artery stenting as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy (GRADE 2 recommendation, low quality evidence). In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as the perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). We recommend against carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe (≥ 60%) carotid artery stenosis (GRADE 1 recommendation, low quality evidence), with a possible exception for patients with ≥ 80% carotid artery stenosis and high anatomic risk for carotid endarterectomy. Strength-of-recommendation and evidence-quality categories follow the GRADE scheme (GRADE 1 for strong recommendations; GRADE 2 for weak recommendations; high, moderate, low, and very low quality).

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis — carotid artery stenting recommendation: We recommend against carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis (GRADE 1, low quality evidence). Supporting evidence is limited: Paucity of evidence hampers evaluation, no randomized controlled trials compare stenting with medical management in asymptomatic patients, and in two trials comparing stenting with endarterectomy the composite of death, stroke, and nonfatal myocardial infarction was very imprecise (RR0.52, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.33) due to small numbers of patients (323) and events (18).

### Clinical need, design, and goals for the carotid revascularization and medical management for asymptomatic carotid stenosis trial [^3826e893]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Prior clinical trials produced evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis that may not be appropriate for clinical decision-making today. High-quality patient outcomes data to allow informed decision making regarding the optimal management of high-grade asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis is lacking. The results of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study were published in 1995 based on a randomized patient enrollment in the 1990s. Outcomes after endarterectomy, stenting, and medical treatment for these patients have all improved in the subsequent 2 decades. Therefore, the time has come to test whether contemporary intensive medical therapy is an acceptable alternative to contemporary endarterectomy or stenting and is the rationale for the Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis (CREST-2) trial. This National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-sponsored prospective, multicenter clinical trial has the investigators, study teams, asymptomatic patients, and robust study design needed to provide these answers. Two randomized clinical trials are planned: carotid revascularization and intensive medical management versus medical management alone in patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis randomize in a 1:1 ratio; the other trial will randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio to carotid stenting with embolic protection versus no stenting.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^47861d98]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis is a cornerstone of stroke prevention and has been the subject of extensive clinical investigation, including multiple controlled randomized trials. The appropriate treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to the community of vascular surgeons. In 2008, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, only one randomized trial, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS), had been published. Since that publication, four major randomized trials comparing CEA and CAS have been published, and the role of medical management has been re-emphasized. The current publication updates and expands the 2008 guidelines with specific emphasis on six areas: imaging in identification and characterization of carotid stenosis, medical therapy (as stand-alone management and also in conjunction with intervention in patients with carotid bifurcation stenosis), risk stratification to select patients for appropriate interventional management (CEA or CAS), technical standards for performing CEA and CAS, the relative roles of CEA and CAS, and management of unusual conditions associated with extracranial carotid pathology. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, as has been done with other Society for Vascular Surgery guideline documents The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. CAS should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons. CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as the first-line therapy.

### Stenting in high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis: 2-dimensional operative video [^9c86a737]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis is implicated in up to 40% of all ischemic strokes. Accordingly, symptomatic, high-grade carotid artery stenosis portends an especially high risk of future stroke. Intervention via open or endovascular approaches drastically reduces this risk. Under the appropriate conditions, carotid artery stenting serves as a safe and effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy. We present the case of a 57-yr-old male with symptomatic, high-grade stenosis of his right internal carotid artery, for whom a history of radiation to the head and neck represented a relative contraindication to carotid endarterectomy, and thus endovascular treatment with angioplasty and stenting was performed. Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. Intraprocedurally, stent delivery past the area of stenosis proved somewhat challenging. However, by employing several nuanced maneuvers, we utilized our guiding catheter in a nonconventional manner in order to successfully perform the procedure. As the field of neuroendovascular surgery evolves, each case provides us unique lessons, which in turn expands our interventional capabilities and adds to the armamentarium of neuroendovascular techniques. We present this surgical video both as a means to provide a general overview of carotid artery stenting, and to share a lesson learned through the implementation of an interesting technical nuance.

### Carotid stenting for asymptomatic carotid stenosis: trial it [^29f96fb6]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Angioplasty and stenting should not be performed for patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid bifurcation stenosis, except in the context of randomized clinical trials. Surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been proven effective over medical therapy in select asymptomatic patient populations. The benefit in these patients is small and easily overcome by procedural complication rates over 3%, owing to the relatively low risk for stroke on medical therapy. Until a randomized controlled clinical trial demonstrates reasonable equivalence of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) to CEA for stroke risk reduction in asymptomatic low-surgical risk patients, there is no rationale for its use in this setting. Furthermore, there is no evidence that revascularization by either CEA or CAS is superior to medical therapy for patients that are not good surgical candidates owing to medical comorbidities or anatomic factors. Randomized trials in this high surgical risk patient population must include a medical treatment arm. In this article, we will review the existing data for CAS in patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis.

### How recent data have impacted the treatment of internal carotid artery stenosis [^e95a4313]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Carotid atherosclerosis accounts for approximately 10% of ischemic stroke cases. Multifaceted medical therapy reduces the risk of stroke in patients with carotid stenosis. Revascularization with endarterectomy or stenting can benefit select patients. In recent years, new information has been obtained regarding optimal selection of revascularization candidates. In addition, new concepts have been formulated regarding the relationship between carotid stenosis and vascular cognitive impairment. Finally, the declining rate of stroke with improved medical therapy has led to the launch of new clinical trials to determine the contemporary risk/benefit ratio of revascularization relative to aggressive medical therapy.

### Management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^6b2e6366]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) appointed a committee of experts to formulate evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of carotid stenosis. In formulating clinical practice recommendations, the committee used systematic reviews to summarize the best available evidence and the GRADE scheme to grade the strength of recommendations (GRADE 1 for strong recommendations; GRADE 2 for weak recommendations) and rate the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low quality). In symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with low-grade carotid stenosis (< 50% in symptomatic and < 60% in asymptomatic patients), we recommend optimal medical therapy rather than revascularization (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (more than 50%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 50%) and high perioperative risk, we suggest carotid artery stenting as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy (GRADE 2 recommendation, low quality evidence). In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (≥ 60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as the perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). We recommend against carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe (≥ 60%) carotid artery stenosis (GRADE 1 recommendation, low quality evidence). A possible exception includes patients with ≥ 80% carotid artery stenosis and high anatomic risk for carotid endarterectomy.

### Medical management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis [^af7ddf0a]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major risk factor for both stroke and cardiovascular disease. Appropriate management of asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) remains unclear. Although several randomized clinical trials support revascularization in asymptomatic patients with severe CAS to reduce stroke risk, the participants in these trials did not receive optimal medical therapy (OMT) by today's standards. For many individuals, medical therapy may provide excellent risk reduction without the periprocedural risk of endarterectomy or stenting. In this review, we discuss the risk factors for CAS and stroke and examine the data for each component of OMT in these patients.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease: executive summary [^5be3c8b5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In 2008, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid bifurcation stenosis. Since that time, a number of prospective randomized trials have been completed and have shed additional light on the best treatment of extracranial carotid disease. This has prompted the Society for Vascular Surgery to form a committee to update and expand guidelines in this area. The review was done using the GRADE methodology The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be below 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be reserved for symptomatic patients with stenosis 50% to 99% at high risk for CEA for anatomic or medical reasons. CAS is not recommended for asymptomatic patients at this time. Asymptomatic patients at high risk for intervention or with < 3 years life expectancy should be considered for medical management as first line therapy. In this Executive Summary, we only outline the specifics of the recommendations made in the six areas evaluated. The full text of these guidelines can be found on the on-line version of the Journal of Vascular Surgery at http://journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/ymva.

### Prediction of severe baseline asymptomatic carotid stenosis and subsequent risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease [^8b6f6553]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Carotid-specific interventions, such as carotid surgery and stenting, are also available. These interventions do not prevent all future strokes but approximately half the long-term risk of incidence of stroke. However, with declining risks of ipsilateral stroke over time (without intervention), these interventions should only be restricted to selected patients in whom the procedural risks are outweighed sufficiently. Previous studies showed comparable long-term outcomes after carotid surgery and stenting but higher procedural risks of carotid stenting. Risk models to select those patients at high risk of ipsilateral stroke under medical therapy that might warrant a carotid intervention have not been validated. Validated models will help identifying a subset of patients in whom there might be a benefit of a carotid procedure but also to refrain from unnecessary procedures in patients with low risks of ipsilateral stroke. The latest Society for Vascular Surgery and European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for the management of carotid disease have acknowledged a validated risk model as a research priority. If clear indications for carotid interventions in patients with ACAS are established, this will reinforce the need for selective screening.

### Strategies for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis [^e81672c0]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

The treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS) has continued to evolve for the past 3 decades. With rapidly advancing technology, the results of old trials have become obsolete. While there has been little change in the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy, there have been vast improvements in both medical management and carotid angioplasty with stenting. Finding the best therapy for a given patient can therefore be difficult. In this article, the authors review the current literature regarding treatment options for ACAS and the methods available for stratifying patients who would benefit from surgical versus medical treatment.

### Recommendations from the ESO-karolinska stroke update conference, stockholm 13–15 November 2016 [^967e3c44]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Update on carotid surgery and stenting

Given the recent improvements in medical therapy, should we continue to base our treatment decisions on data from 'old' symptomatic carotid trials?

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and a high risk of recurrent stroke (e.g. > 70% carotid stenosis, ischaemic event < 2 weeks previously) should be offered timely intervention with carotid intervention (Grade A).

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and lower-risk of recurrent stroke (e.g. moderate carotid stenosis, retinal symptoms only, event > 2 weeks previously) may be randomised to trials comparing carotid intervention plus medical therapy vs. medical therapy alone (ECST-2/CREST-2) if clinician and patient substantially uncertain about the benefits of intervention (Grade B).
Is it ever appropriate to intervene on a < 50% symptomatic stenosis?

Almost all patients with < 50% symptomatic carotid stenosis should not be treated with intervention. However, intervention in certain patients may be considered if the stenosis causes recurrent symptoms despite optimal medical therapy (Grade C).
Does gender matter – Do women really derive less benefit from carotid intervention than men?

Decisions on whether or not to intervene on patients with carotid stenosis should not be based on gender (Grade A).
With more experience, better case selection and technological advances, can CAS compete with carotid endarterectomy?

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an effective alternative intervention in selected cases (e.g. not recently symptomatic, age < 70 years, no prior ischaemic brain damage) when done by experienced interventionists. Technological advances in cerebral protection, access and stent design should be considered in patients treated with CAS (Grade A).

The advance of therapies to reduce the stroke impact of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis has proved difficult over the last decade. Disagreement concerning the underlying randomized control trials has limited entry into the care arena of endovascular therapies. Recently, advances in percutaneous therapies for carotid artery disease have been reported and provide a substantial database supporting the further incorporation of endovascular-based therapies in patients who need revascularization and meet selection criteria. With a second randomized control trial now published, it is time for a re-evaluation of endovascular therapy as a component of carotid artery care. This review describes the advances in the field in the last 5 years, clarifying the current position of these therapies in the care of the patient with asymptomatic carotid artery disease.

Description

Update of the 2007 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for carotid artery stenosis.

Methods

The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to synthesize the evidence on the accuracy of screening tests, externally validated risk-stratification tools, the benefits of treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAAS), the benefits from medications added to current standard medical therapy, and the harms of screening and treatment with CEA or CAAS.

Population

This recommendation applies to adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population. (D recommendation).

Level Of Evidence

B). The term "alternative" may easily be misinterpreted as "equivalent" to justify the widespread use of CAS. However, current evidence indicates that for symptomatic patients, CAS produces inferior outcomes compared with CEA. It is likely that with technical improvements, better patient selection, and better physician experience, CAS outcomes will improve in the future. CAS may then become a fair alternative to CEA, at least in certain patient subgroups. Based on current evidence, however, we are not there yet and it seems unfair to spin the AHA/ASA guidelines to conclude that we are.

### Systematic review of guidelines for the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis [^c91f6e37]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We systematically compared and appraised contemporary guidelines on management of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Methods

We systematically searched for guideline recommendations on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty/stenting (CAS) published in any language between January 1, 2008, and January 28, 2015. Only the latest guideline per writing group was selected. Each guideline was analyzed independently by 2 to 6 authors to determine clinical scenarios covered, recommendations given, and scientific evidence used.

Results

Thirty-four eligible guidelines were identified from 23 different regions/countries in 6 languages. Of 28 guidelines with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis procedural recommendations, 24 (86%) endorsed CEA (recommended it should or may be provided) for ≈50% to 99% average-surgical-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, 17 (61%) endorsed CAS, 8 (29%) opposed CAS, and 1 (4%) endorsed medical treatment alone. For asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients considered high-CEA-risk because of comorbidities, vascular anatomy, or undefined reasons, CAS was endorsed in 13 guidelines (46%). Thirty-one of 33 guidelines (94%) with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis procedural recommendations endorsed CEA for patients with ≈50% to 99% average-CEA-risk symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, 19 (58%) endorsed CAS and 9 (27%) opposed CAS. For high-CEA-risk symptomatic carotid artery stenosis because of comorbidities, vascular anatomy, or undefined reasons, CAS was endorsed in 27 guidelines (82%). Guideline procedural recommendations were based only on results of trials in which patients were randomized 12 to 34 years ago, rarely reflected medical treatment improvements and often understated potential CAS hazards. Qualifying terminology summarizing recommendations or evidence lacked standardization, impeding guideline interpretation, and comparison.

Conclusions

This systematic review has identified many opportunities to modernize and otherwise improve carotid stenosis management guidelines.

### Management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis in patients undergoing general and vascular surgical procedures [^75bf88c3]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Current available data do not seem to support the strategy for carotid endarterectomy prior to surgical intervention in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. However, in patients with coronary artery disease, synchronous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting should be considered where there is a proven surgical risk of < 3% with unilateral asymptomatic stenosis > 60% or bilateral carotid stenosis > 75% on the same side as the most severe stenosis. Clarification of the optimal strategy requires an adequately powered, multicentre, randomised clinical trial.

### An analysis of the recommendations of the 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^10550a0e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis currently account for the majority of carotid interventions performed in the United States; therefore, the following article will review the 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) clinical practice guidelines perspective in treating patient with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Methods

A systemic review and meta-analysis were conducted by the evidence practice center of the Mayo Clinic using a specified population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) framework.

Results

Based on published randomized trials and related supporting evidence, the following were noted: the SVS recommends that patients with asymptomatic ≥ 70% stenosis can be considered for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), or transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TFCAS) for the reduction of long-term risk of stroke, provided the patient has a life expectancy of 3 to 5 years with risk of perioperative stroke and death not exceeding 3%. The type of carotid intervention should be based on the presence or absence of high-risk criteria for each specified intervention. Data from CREST, ACT, and the Vascular Quality Initiative suggest that certain properly selected asymptomatic patients can be treated with carotid stenting with equivalent outcome to CEA in the hands of experienced interventionalists. The institutions and operator performing carotid stenting must exhibit expertise sufficient to meet the established American Heart Association guidelines for treatment of patient with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ie, combined stroke/death rate of less than 3%).

Conclusions

SVS recommends that low surgical risk patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis of ≥ 70% to be treated with CEA with best medical therapy over medical therapy alone for the long-term prevention of stroke/death (GRADE 1B). Carotid intervention should also be based on the presence or absence of high-risk criteria for each specified intervention (ie, CEA, TCAR, and TFCAS).

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^121f9c4c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis in stroke prevention has been the subject of extensive investigations, including multiple randomized controlled trials. The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS), were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas: (1) is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of > 50%; (3) the timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke; (4) screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) the optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease. A separate implementation document will address other important clinical issues in extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (grades of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation) approach, as was used for other Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines. The committee recommends CEA as the first-line treatment for symptomatic low-risk surgical patients with stenosis of 50% to 99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 70% to 99%. The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be < 3% to ensure benefit for the patient. In patients with recent stable stroke (modified Rankin scale score, 0–2), carotid revascularization is considered appropriate for symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis and should be performed as soon as the patient is neurologically stable after 48 hours but definitely < 14 days after symptom onset. In the general population, screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors for carotid artery disease is not recommended. In selected asymptomatic patients with an increased risk of carotid stenosis, we suggest screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis as long as the patients would potentially be fit for and willing to consider carotid intervention if significant stenosis is discovered. For patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% to 99%, who require both CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting, we suggest CEA before, or concomitant with, coronary artery bypass grafting to potentially reduce the risk of stroke and stroke/death. The sequencing of the intervention depends on the clinical presentation and institutional experience.

### Carotid artery stenting versus endarterectomy for treatment of carotid artery stenosis [^bfb28d0b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Carotid artery stenting is an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis. This review updates a previous version first published in 1997 and subsequently updated in 2004, 2007, and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of stenting compared with endarterectomy in people with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched August 2018) and the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index to August 2018. We also searched ongoing trials registers (August 2018) and reference lists, and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing stenting with endarterectomy for symptomatic or asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. In addition, we included RCTs comparing carotid artery stenting with medical therapy alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. A second review author independently validated trial selection and a third review author independently validated data extraction. We calculated treatment effects as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with endarterectomy as the reference group. We quantified heterogeneity using the I² statistic and used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 22 trials involving 9753 participants. In participants with symptomatic carotid stenosis, compared with endarterectomy stenting was associated with a higher risk of periprocedural death or stroke (the primary safety outcome; OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.19; P < 0.0001, I² = 5%; 10 trials, 5396 participants; high-certainty evidence); and periprocedural death, stroke, or myocardial infarction (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.80; P = 0.002, I² = 0%; 6 trials, 4861 participants; high-certainty evidence). The OR for the primary safety outcome was 1.11 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.64) in participants under 70 years old and 2.23 (95% CI 1.61 to 3.08) in participants 70 years old or more (interaction P = 0.007). There was a non-significant increase in periprocedural death or major or disabling stroke with stenting (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.91; P = 0.08, I² = 0%; 7 trials, 4983 participants; high-certainty evidence). Compared with endarterectomy, stenting was associated with lower risks of myocardial infarction (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.94; P = 0.03, I² = 0%), cranial nerve palsy (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; P < 0.00001, I² = 0%), and access site haematoma (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.68; P = 0.003, I² = 27%). The combination of periprocedural death or stroke or ipsilateral stroke during follow-up (the primary combined safety and efficacy outcome) favoured endarterectomy (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.85; P < 0.0001, I² = 0%; 8 trials, 5080 participants; high-certainty evidence). The rate of ipsilateral stroke after the periprocedural period did not differ between treatments (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.47; P = 0.77, I² = 0%). In participants with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, there was a non-significant increase in periprocedural death or stroke with stenting compared with endarterectomy (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.97; P = 0.05, I² = 0%; 7 trials, 3378 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The risk of periprocedural death or stroke or ipsilateral stroke during follow-up did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.84; P = 0.22, I² = 0%; 6 trials, 3315 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Moderate or higher carotid artery restenosis (50% or greater) or occlusion during follow-up was more common after stenting (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.60; P = 0.02, I² = 44%), but the difference in risk of severe restenosis was not significant (70% or greater; OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.00; P = 0.33, I² = 58%; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Stenting for symptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with a higher risk of periprocedural stroke or death than endarterectomy. This extra risk is mostly attributed to an increase in minor, non-disabling strokes occurring in people older than 70 years. Beyond the periprocedural period, carotid stenting is as effective in preventing recurrent stroke as endarterectomy. However, combining procedural safety and long-term efficacy in preventing recurrent stroke still favours endarterectomy. In people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, there may be a small increase in the risk of periprocedural stroke or death with stenting compared with endarterectomy. However, CIs of treatment effects were wide and further data from randomised trials in people with asymptomatic stenosis are needed.

Society for Vascular Surgery carotid artery disease — areas without consensus note that we could not completely agree on the role of carotid stenting in asymptomatic patients and that data supporting stenting in this setting were of poor quality because of the absence of a medically managed control group; a minority felt that patients with acceptable medical risk, high anatomic risk, and compelling carotid pathology should be considered candidates for stenting, whereas a minority felt that in the absence of trials comparing medical therapy with stenting in this cohort, such a recommendation, even as GRADE 2 was ill advised. We also failed to reach consensus over many details in the technical performance of endarterectomy and stenting, and supporting data were inconsistent and generally of low quality and that all recommendations were GRADE 2 (at best), including whether protamine reversal of heparin after carotid clamping should be recommended or not recommended and optimal cerebral monitoring and protection during endarterectomy or the preferred patch for use in carotid closure.

In most patients with carotid stenosis who are candidates for intervention, CEA is preferred to CAS for reduction of all-cause stroke and periprocedural death (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B), though data from CREST suggest patients aged < 70 years may be better treated by CAS but need further confirmation. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with ≥ 60% diameter stenosis should be considered for CEA to reduce long-term stroke risk, provided a 3- to 5-year life expectancy and periprocedural stroke/death rates ≤ 3% (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A).

In the past, management of symptomatic carotid stenosis was uncertain. The results of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) in 1991 demonstrated a significant advantage of Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) compared to medical management with Aspirin (ASA). Since the publishing of the NASCET results, there have been advances in both the medical management of patients with peripheral arterial disease as well as the introduction and improvement of the technique of minimally invasive carotid angioplasty and stenting. With this progress, the question has to be raised about what is the most appropriate treatment option for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. A review of the prospective clinical trials regarding the medical, surgical and endovascular management will help to elucidate the optimal therapy for symptomatic carotid stenosis.

The recent 130-center, international, second ACST trial (Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial) involving 3625 patients found that regardless of whether a patient underwent stenting or endarterectomy, the periprocedural risk of disabling or fatal stroke was about 1% and the 5-year estimated risk of nonprocedural disabling or fatal stroke was 2.5%. With advances in technique, technology, and patient selection, stenting done by appropriately trained and experienced operators can achieve safety and efficacy comparable to endarterectomy for asymptomatic patients. The ongoing CREST-2 trial (Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial) will clarify whether revascularization, by either stenting or endarterectomy, remains an important therapeutic goal in the setting of modern intensive medical therapy.

### Management of atherosclerotic extracranial carotid artery stenosis [^f8f2e6fe]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Atherosclerosis leading to stenosis of the internal carotid artery is the underlying cause of 8–15% of ischaemic strokes (symptomatic carotid stenosis). 1–2% of the adult population have asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Clinical trials in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis showed a higher procedural risk of non-disabling stroke with stenting versus endarterectomy, but a higher risk of myocardial infarction, cranial nerve palsy, and access site haematoma with endarterectomy. Apart from procedural complications, both treatments are equally effective in preventing stroke and recurrent severe carotid stenosis in the medium-to-long term. Endarterectomy has a modest effect in preventing stroke among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, whereas the role of stenting remains to be established. With advances in medical therapy against atherosclerosis, benefit from invasive therapy has become uncertain. Risk modelling, with the inclusion of brain and carotid plaque imaging, will become increasingly important in selecting patients for interventions.

Carotid artery disease

Approximately 10%–20% of thromboembolic stroke is thought to be from significant extracranial carotid artery disease. Generally, significant stenosis refers to a > 50% stenosis estimated using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method. In clinical trials, patients are often stratified to 50%–69% stenosis and 70%–99% stenosis. Revascularisation is not indicated for a near-occluded or occluded carotid artery. A carotid stenosis is defined as 'symptomatic' if there is ischaemic symptoms within preceding 6 months. Abnormalities on brain imaging studies without symptoms are generally not considered 'symptomatic'.

Early revascularisation is well-established as the standard of care for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (figure 2). Multiple randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have consistently found carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to be superior to medical therapy alone in this population. Clinical features associated with higher benefits from CEA are more severe carotid lesions (70%–99%), male sex, older age (> 75 years) and hemispheric and cortical strokes (as opposed to retinal or lacunar strokes). The benefits of CEA are greatest within 14 days of the ischaemic event and decline as time passes.

Figure 2
Diagnostic algorithm for patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease. *Symptoms of stroke/transient ischaemic attack within 6 months.

The management of asymptomatic carotid disease is more controversial. Early trials found better outcomes with CEA compared with medical therapy for significant carotid disease in asymptomatic patients. However, medical therapy has evolved greatly since the 1990s and early 2000s when there were little statin use, no antithrombotic option other than aspirin and no specific goal for treating blood pressure and diabetes. Lacking newer data, the ESC/ESVS guideline only recommends revascularisation in asymptomatic patients with 60%–99% who have additional risk factors, such as a history of contralateral transient ischaemic attack/stroke, ipsilateral silent infarction or anatomically high-risk findings on imaging (lipid-rich core or intraplaque haemorrhage on MRA, large echolucent and hypoechogenic plaque on ultrasound or rapid stenosis progression) (Figure 3). The ongoing CREST-2 (carotid revascularization for primary prevention of stroke) trial will help determine whether CEA, carotid artery stenting (CAS) or modern medical therapy is the best strategy for patients with asymptomatic significant carotid stenosis.

### Best evidence for medical therapy for carotid artery stenosis [^a09567c9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Carotid atheromatous disease is an important cause of stroke and represents a key target in stroke prevention. Randomized trials have shown the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in secondary stroke prevention. Carotid stenting presents a less invasive alternative to surgical intervention. Advances in medical management, if compliance can be ensured, are leading to improvement in outcomes when implemented as sole therapy in the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. This includes lifestyle modification, blood pressure control, and antiplatelet and statin therapy. Over the last 20 years, the annual rate of ipsilateral stroke associated with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has decreased from 2% to 4% to less than 1%. This is largely due to improvements in medical therapy. However, despite numerous trials and years of clinical research, the optimal management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease remains controversial. This article presents and summarizes the evidence supporting best medical treatment for carotid artery stenosis.

### Management of asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis [^8b97dcf5]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Optimal management of patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis remains unclear. Although 2 high-quality randomized clinical trials demonstrated reductions in ispsilateral stroke rates in patients without symptoms after carotid endarterectomy, medical therapy of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis has reduced rates of stroke to approximately 1% per year, raising questions about the generalizability of these previous trials to current medical practice. However, reductions in adverse events after revascularization can make revascularization more attractive. The emergence of percutaneous revascularization for carotid artery stenosis has raised further questions about optimal management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. This Grand Rounds summarizes the factors to consider when counseling patients and making clinical decisions regarding medical therapy and revascularization for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. This information should provide clinicians with the knowledge base to counsel patients about the risks and benefits of treatment options.

### Misconceptions regarding the adequacy of best medical intervention alone for asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^4107c636]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Medical intervention (risk factor identification, lifestyle coaching, and medication) for stroke prevention has improved significantly. It is likely that no more than 5.5% of persons with advanced asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) will now benefit from a carotid procedure during their lifetime. However, some question the adequacy of medical intervention alone for such persons and propose using markers of high stroke risk to intervene with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and/or carotid angioplasty/stenting (CAS). Our aim was to examine the scientific validity and implications of this proposal.

Methods

We reviewed the evidence for using medical intervention alone or with additional CEA or CAS in persons with ACS. We also reviewed the evidence regarding the validity of using commonly cited makers of high stroke risk to select such persons for CEA or CAS, including markers proposed by the European Society for Vascular Surgery in 2017.

Results

Randomized trials of medical intervention alone versus additional CEA showed a definite statistically significant CEA stroke prevention benefit for ACS only for selected average surgical risk men aged less than 75 to 80 years with 60% or greater stenosis using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. However, the most recent measurements of stroke rate with ACS using medical intervention alone are overall lower than for those who had CEA or CAS in randomized trials. Randomized trials of CEA versus CAS in persons with ACS were underpowered. However, the trend was for higher stroke and death rates with CAS. There are no randomized trial results related to comparing current optimal medical intervention with CEA or CAS. Commonly cited markers of high stroke risk in relation to ACS lack specificity, have not been assessed in conjunction with current optimal medical intervention, and have not been shown in randomized trials to identify those who benefit from a carotid procedure in addition to current optimal medical intervention.

Conclusions

Medical intervention has an established role in the current routine management of persons with ACS. Stroke risk stratification studies using current optimal medical intervention alone are the highest research priority for identifying persons likely to benefit from adding a carotid procedure.

Conclusion

Carotid artery stenting is a minimally invasive and efficacious approach for the management of carotid artery disease, a primary contributor to the incidence of stroke.

Based on extensive review of existing evidence and established guidelines, the SOP writing group has identified the key recommendations for carotid artery stenting:

Patient selection: Carotid artery stenting is indicated for patients presenting with symptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis for a variety of reasons, and in certain instances of asymptomatic stenoses.

Procedural technique: The technique refers to a systematic and structured approach that is used to accomplish a specific task or objective. It involves a series of steps or actions that are taken in a particular order so that the task is completed efficiently and effectively, with minimal errors or deviations from the intended process. It is recommended that the procedure be carried out by trained operators who have received adequate training in the field of carotid artery stenting. The utilisation of embolic protection devices is advised as a means of mitigating the likelihood of stroke incidence during the intervention.

It should be noted that the objective of CAS endpoint is not to achieve maximal luminal gain, but rather to attain complete plaque coverage.

Post-treatment care: Immediate post-procedural monitoring and long-term follow-up is recommended in order to observe and assess for potential complications.

It is recommended that patients be provided with continuous medical management in order to reduce the risk of future cerebrovascular events.

### Evidence-based treatment of carotid artery stenosis [^945791b0]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Carotid atheromatous disease is an important cause of stroke. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a well-established option for reducing the risk of subsequent stroke due to symptomatic stenosis (> 50%). With adequately low perioperative risk (< 3%) and sufficient life expectancy, CEA may be used for asymptomatic stenosis (> 60%). Recently, carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) has emerged as an alternative revascularization technique. Trial design considerations are discussed in relation to trial results to provide an understanding of why some trials were considered positive whereas others were not. This review then addresses both the original randomized studies showing that CEA is superior to best medical management and the newer studies comparing the procedure to stent insertion in both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. Additionally, recent population-based studies show that improvements in best medical management may be lowering the stroke risk for asymptomatic stenosis. Finally, the choice of revascularization technique is discussed with respect to symptom status. Based on current evidence, CAS should remain limited to specific indications.

### Screening for carotid artery stenosis: recommendation… [^f7c79aa6]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale. Importance. Good evidence indicates that although stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, a relatively small proportion of all disabling, unheralded strokes is due to carotid artery stenosis. Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention. Good evidence indicates that in selected, high-risk trial participants with asymptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy by selected surgeons reduces the five-year absolute incidence of all strokes or perioperative death by approximately 5 percent. These benefits would be less among asymptomatic persons in the general population. For the general population, the benefits are judged to be no greater than small. Harms of Detection and Early Intervention. Good evidence indicates that both the testing strategy and the treatment with carotid endarterectomy can cause harms. A testing strategy that includes angiography will itself cause some strokes.

A testing strategy that does not include angiography will cause some strokes by leading to carotid endarterectomy in persons who do not have severe carotid artery stenosis. In excellent centers, carotid endarterectomy is associated with a 30-day stroke or mortality rate of about 3 percent; some areas have higher rates. These harms are judged to be no less than small. USPSTF Assessment. The USPSTF concludes that for individuals with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, there is moderate certainty that the benefits of screening do not outweigh the harms. Clinical Considerations Patient Population. This recommendation applies to adults without neurologic signs or symptoms, including a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. If otherwise eligible, an individual who has a carotid-area transient ischemic attack should be evaluated promptly for consideration of carotid endarterectomy. Risk Assessment.

In a setting of excellent surgical care and low complication rates, screening may benefit patients who have a very high risk for stroke. 2, 3Based on population-based studies and the accuracy of carotid duplex ultrasonography, the estimated prevalence of severe carotid artery stenosis in the general population 65 years and older is about 1 percent. Studies have found that carotid artery stenosis is more prevalent in older adults, smokers, those with hypertension, and those with heart disease. Research has not found any risk factor or clinically useful risk-stratification tool that can reliably and accurately distinguish persons who have clinically important carotid artery stenosis from those who do not. *. In 1996, the USPSTF concluded that evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against screening of asymptomatic patients for carotid artery stenosis by physical examination or carotid ultrasonography.

To update its recommendation, the USPSTF examined high-quality evidence on the natural history of carotid artery stenosis, systematic reviews of the accuracy of screening tests, and randomized controlled trials of the benefits of treatment with carotid endarterectomy. 6, 7The ACAS projected a five-year rate of ipsilateral stroke and any perioperative stroke or death that was lower in the carotid endarterectomy group than in the medical management group:

5. 1 percent versus
11. 0 percent. The ACST projected a lower five-year rate of any stroke or perioperative death in the carotid endarterectomy group than in the medical management group:

6. 4 percent versus
11. 8 percent. About one half of the strokes prevented by carotid endarterectomy were disabling.

### Recurrent carotid stenosis after CEA and CAS: diagnosis and management [^932a7773]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the preferred method for cerebral revascularization in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic high-grade extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has recently emerged as a less invasive alternative to endarterectomy. Carotid stenting has been demonstrated to be technically feasible and safe in high-risk patients. It has been approved as an acceptable method for revascularization in circumstances where CEA yields suboptimal results. While the final role of CAS in carotid revascularization will be determined on the basis of ongoing randomized trials, it is clear that stenting will continue to be performed in subgroups of patients with carotid stenosis. Therefore, it is anticipated that there will be a corresponding increase in the number of in-stent restenosis cases. Considerable controversy exists regarding the clinical significance, natural history, threshold for management, and appropriate intervention of recurrent carotid stenosis after endarterectomy and after stenting. This review analyzes current information on this important clinical problem and presents evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of recurrent carotid stenosis.

### ESVS guidelines. invasive treatment for carotid stenosis: indications, techniques [^24c89b8a]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The European Society for Vascular Surgery brought together a group of experts in the field of carotid artery disease to produce updated guidelines for the invasive treatment of carotid disease. The recommendations were rated according to the level of evidence. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is recommended in symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis if the perioperative stroke/death rate is < 6% [A], preferably within 2 weeks of the patient's last symptoms [A]. CEA is also recommended in asymptomatic men < 75 years old with 70–99% stenosis if the perioperative stroke/death risk is < 3% [A]. The benefit from CEA in asymptomatic women is significantly less than in men [A]. CEA should therefore be considered only in younger, fit women [A]. Carotid patch angioplasty is preferable to primary closure [A]. Aspirin at a dose of 75–325 mg daily and statins should be given before, during and following CEA. [A] Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be performed only in high-risk for CEA patients, in high-volume centres with documented low peri-operative stroke and death rates or inside a randomized controlled trial [C]. CAS should be performed under dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel [A]. Carotid protection devices are probably of benefit [C].

### Management of carotid stenosis in women [^30525bae]. JAMA Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

The management of carotid stenosis in women remains a topic of controversy. In this review article, we aimed to define carotid disease burden in women, review outcomes of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in women, discuss differences in practice patterns based on sex, and provide guidelines for management of women with carotid stenosis. Symptomatic women with high-grade stenosis derive benefit from carotid endarterectomy, although they have different risk profiles than men and are often not taking appropriate medical therapy. Women with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis have less stroke risk reduction with CEA than their male counterparts; therefore, they should be screened for other treatable risk factors for stroke, with the institution of lifestyle changes and the appropriate medical therapy. After medical optimization, the decision to proceed with CEA in asymptomatic women must be made by carefully assessing that the benefits of stroke risk reduction outweigh perioperative risks.

### Carotid artery stenting [^545551f3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has achieved clinical equipoise with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), as evidenced by 2 large U.S. randomized clinical trials, multiple pivotal registry trials, and 2 multispecialty guideline documents endorsed by 14 professional societies. The largest randomized trial conducted in patients at average surgical risk of CEA, CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial) found no difference between CAS and CEA for the combined endpoint of stroke, death, and myocardial infarction (MI) after 4 years of follow-up. The largest randomized trial comparing CAS and CEA in patients at increased surgical risk, SAPPHIRE (Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy), looked at 1-year stroke, death, and MI incidence and found no difference in symptomatic patients, but a significantly better outcome in asymptomatic patients for CAS (9.9% vs. 21.5%; p = 0.02). Given that > 70% of carotid revascularization procedures are performed in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention of stroke, it is incumbent upon clinicians to demonstrate that revascularization has an incremental benefit over highly effective modern medical therapy alone.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^2705021c]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and future research — management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis: The efficacy of best medical management alone compared with carotid revascularization to reduce risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis > 70% should be assessed. The role of carotid revascularization in patients considered high-risk surgical candidates should be defined, and enhanced imaging modalities could provide detailed insights into plaque morphology, stability, and risk of rupture to aid risk stratification and decision-making. Sex-specific studies in women with asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis are needed. Early evidence suggests that transcarotid artery revascularization might have a role in patients with ACS, but no RCT data exist comparing its outcomes with either transfemoral carotid stenting or CEA. Ultimately, shared decision-making is paramount in determining the best treatment approach for ACS, and there are no validated tools to precisely determine the optimal frequency of carotid duplex surveillance for patients with more severe stenosis, rapid progression, or high-risk plaque characteristics.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to carotid artery stenting, symptomatic patients, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider performing carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting after multidisciplinary team review in symptomatic patients with carotid near occlusion and distal vessel collapse with recurrent carotid territory symptoms despite best medical therapy.

### The urgent need for contemporary clinical trials in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^23e7e2a2]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery atherosclerotic stenosis increases with age and is more common in men. Studies performed more than 2 decades ago showed that carotid endarterectomy reduced the rate of stroke in carefully selected patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis compared with medical therapy in the long term. Those trials were completed more than 20 years ago and with advances in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease, the question has been raised to as to whether endarterectomy is still of value for patients with asymptomatic narrowing. Perioperative risk of carotid revascularization procedures has also declined. Due to improvements in both medical and surgical treatments for carotid artery stenosis, it is timely to reevaluate the efficacy of carotid intervention relative to medical treatment for patients with asymptomatic stenosis.

### Carotid endarterectomy: still the standard of care for carotid bifurcation disease [^b3cb5d40]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Current treatment guidelines of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis are based on studies performed over a decade ago. Since that time, significant advances have been made in medical management, namely high dose statin therapy and improved antiplatelet agents, and in carotid interventions, namely the advent of carotid artery stenting. Especially with carotid stenting, the technology has grown by leaps and bounds and continues to advance at a rapid pace. These advances have necessitated new studies to compare these treatments with the gold standard of carotid endarterectomy. In asymptomatic patients, the current data does not justify medical management alone for severe (> 80%) carotid stenosis. Furthermore, in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients current studies have failed to demonstrate equivalence of CAS to CEA for significant carotid stenosis. Clearly additional studies comparing CAS, CEA, and medical management are needed to further clarify this issue. In the future, advances in CAS technology and techniques may greatly expand the role of CAS beyond its current role in certain high-risk patient subsets. However, for the time being CEA still remains the gold standard for carotid intervention.

### USPSTF recommendations for screening for carotid stenosis to prevent stroke… [^496ca175]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

A total of 34% of strokes are ischemic strokes resulting from carotid artery disease, with the remaining strokes coming from the vertebrobasilar territory, intracranial vessels, or the heart. 2 However, most individuals who experience these strokes do not have a moderate or higher stenosis that could have been detected and treated in advance of the stroke; only 14% of strokes result from thromboembolism from a previously asymptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery. 3 The remaining strokes occur in individuals with at most minor carotid narrowing who would not have been candidates for intervention. Furthermore, some of these 14% of individuals will experience a warning transient ischemic attack, leaving about 11% of individuals whose stroke is due to thromboembolism from a previously asymptomatic stenosis. 3 These are the individuals with stroke who could potentially benefit from prior carotid screening.

Given that only 11% of strokes are associated with previously undiagnosed carotid stenosis, the impact of ultrasonographic screening on overall stroke prevention is limited, but preventing stroke in individuals with previously undiagnosed carotid stenosis is important, particularly when effective therapies are available. The 11% of potentially preventable strokes would need be identified among individuals who have antecedent carotid narrowing. Overall, only 1% to 3% of individuals with stenosis have severe narrowing, 4, 5 so many individuals would have to be screened to identify the few who would potentially benefit from treatments. should be changed based on new interval evidence. 6, 7 Interval studies of treatment of greater than 70% carotid stenosis continue to suggest small benefit or no benefit compared with best medical therapy, and both procedures are associated with meaningful short-term.

harms of postoperative stroke or death, estimated as occurring in 0. 5% to
5. 1% of patients from the methodologically diverse studies that were reviewed. 6, 7 No externally validated risk stratification tools were identified that could reliably distinguish between individuals who have asymptomatic but clinically important carotid artery stenosis vs individuals who do not, or that could assess the risk of stroke in an individual associated with carotid artery stenosis. All reviewed studies included patients with higher risk, making extrapolation of results to asymptomatic, typical-risk populations difficult. 6, 7 The USPSTF found that the interval evidence did not provide a basis to change their recommendation against screening and issued the D recommendation based on evidence that the harms of screening for carotid artery stenosis in adults who are asymptomatic outweigh the benefits. 6, 7.

The crux of the USPSTF rationale in this recommendation hinges on the harms of treatment, 6, 7 an important consideration given the large number of people who would have to be screened to identify a relatively small group of individuals with stenosis and the inevitable potential for some rate of overdiagnosis leading to overtreatment. While the D grade is not surprising given this consideration, what continues to be striking is the overall absence of direct evidence that screening itself is actually beneficial. 6, 7. Without a true randomized clinical trial to directly answer the question, there is a lack of consensus and clarity on the role of carotid ultrasonographic screening for prevention of stroke in individuals who are asymptomatic in clinical practice. Nearly all of the specialty societies actually agree with the USPSTF and recommend against screening with carotid ultrasonography.

Background and Purpose

Many medical societies now recommend carotid stenting as an alternative to endarterectomy which raises the question of whether the ESVS guidelines are still valid. This review addresses the validity of the ESVS guidelines that refer to carotid stenting based on the evidence available today.

Methods

We conducted a review and meta-analysis based on the original ESVS guidelines paper and articles published over the past 2 years.

Results

For symptomatic patients, surgery remains the best option, since stenting is associated with a 61% relative risk increase of periprocedural stroke or death compared to endarterectomy. However, centres of excellence in carotid stenting may achieve comparable results. In asymptomatic patients, there is still no good evidence for any intervention because the stroke risk from an asymptomatic stenosis is very low, especially with the best modern medical treatment. CREST and CAVATAS have verified that mid-term stroke prevention after successful stenting is similar to endarterectomy. EVA-3S, SPACE, ICSS and CREST have provided additional evidence regarding the role of age in choosing therapeutic modality. The role of the cerebral protection devices is challenged by the imaging findings of small randomised trials but supported by large systematic reviews.

Conclusions

The ESVS guidelines that refer to carotid stenting not only remain valid but also have been further strengthened by the latest available clinical data. An update of these guidelines including all of the recent evidence is needed to provide an objective and up-to-date interpretation of the data.

### Best medical therapy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis: imminent or ineffective? [^68ad8af2]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Carotid artery disease accounts for approximately 20% of all ischemic strokes, a major cause of morbidity, and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Landmark trials in the 1990s, such as Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial, establish carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plus best medical therapy (BMT) as the standard of care for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis over 60%. However, advances in medical therapy and the emergence of carotid artery stenting (CAS) have prompted a reevaluation of treatment efficacy. Recent studies have questioned the superiority of CEA over BMT alone in reducing stroke risk, suggesting no significant difference in outcomes with contemporary medical management. In addition, analysis from the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicated minimal net benefit of CEA over BMT when accounting for all-cause mortality. Comparative studies have found no significant difference in long-term stroke-free survival between CEA and CAS. However, procedural risks vary, with higher myocardial infarction rates associated with CEA and higher stroke rates with CAS. Identifying high-risk plaques and patient-specific risk factors remains crucial. Meta-analyses have highlighted features such as neovascularization and lipid rich cores as predictors of stenosis progression and ischemic events. Ongoing research, particularly the CREST-2 trial, aims to provide clear guidance on the optimal treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. This trial emphasizes stringent adherence to modern BMT protocols and includes comprehensive lifestyle modification programs. The evolving landscape of medical and surgical interventions necessitates continuous evaluation to optimize treatment strategies for asymptomatic carotid stenosis, which is the impetus for this review. Future findings from ongoing trials are expected to refine current guidelines and improve patient outcomes.

### Carotid interventions and evidence-based medicine: not always an easy marriage [^0329c01a]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Other challenges include the intense debate about whether reductions in annual stroke rates in asymptomatic patients on modern medical therapy mean that fewer patients might now benefit from CEA/CAS (generating considerable neurologist schadenfreude once again). This is being tested in CREST-2, which is likely to be the last major RCT to compare CEA/CAS with best medical therapy in asymptomatic patients. It is unlikely that the RCTs including symptomatic patients will be repeated, mainly because of the greatly increased benefit conferred by intervening in the first 7–14 days after symptom onset. There is currently no equipoise for randomizing patients in this 'high-risk for stroke' period, which is when most carotid interventions are now performed. Although carotid stenosis of at least 50 per cent is present in one in five patients presenting with stroke or transient ischaemic attack, the UK National Vascular Registryhas reported a 25 per cent decline in annual CEA numbers in symptomatic patients over the past decade. This is most likely due to a proportional reduction in ischaemic strokes owing to thromboembolism from extracranial carotid stenoses, possibly because a greater proportion of patients with cardiovascular disease are now prescribed better antiplatelet and statin therapy than before.

There are also important clinical governance issues to be addressed, not least the fact that CAS practitioners in the USA perform fewer than two CAS interventions on average per year, which may account for some specialties reporting 30-day death/stroke rates of 6 per cent in asymptomatic patients (twice the accepted threshold), without anyone acknowledging that, at this level of risk, interventions are harmful rather than beneficial to the patient. Another controversial issue is the relationship between asymptomatic carotid stenosis and cognitive dysfunction. Evidence suggests that there is an association, but this may simply mean that both conditions share similar risk factors. Given the controversy about the optimal management of asymptomatic patients (in general), it would be inappropriate to expand indications uncritically to include preventing cognitive decline without better evidence.

In the past, surgeons and interventionists have been guilty of promoting a 'one victor only' concept, whereas it is clear that CEA and CAS will evolve complementary roles. It is essential, however, that these roles are determined by evidence and collaboration, rather than by returning to a bygone era of intuitive reasoning, turf wars, and schadenfreude.

### Asymptomatic embolisation for prediction of stroke in the asymptomatic carotid emboli study (ACES): a prospective observational study [^a7eae345]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis remains controversial, and practices vary between different clinicians and in different countries. Data from large randomised trials have shown a significant effect of endarterectomy in preventing future stroke, but with a small absolute benefit. Recent analyses, have reported that, with improved medical treatment, the annual risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is lower than that reported in the carotid endarterectomy trials (nearer to 1% in these trials compared with 2.3% in ACAS), which further reduces the benefit of surgical intervention. This is consistent with the annual risk of ipsilateral stroke of 1.2% (ten ipsilateral strokes over 2 years) reported in ACES. This improvement in natural history with better medical therapy might make surgical intervention hazardous. Carotid stenting has been suggested as an alternative to endarterectomy, but as yet there are no data showing it is safer than endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
