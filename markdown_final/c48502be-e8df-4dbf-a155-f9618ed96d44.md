## Question

indications of profilaxis abx for dental procedure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the two distinct clinical pathways that commonly drive this question: prevention of infective endocarditis in high‑risk cardiac patients and prevention of prosthetic joint infection in patients with orthopedic implants. Then, I should verify which dental procedures actually trigger prophylaxis in the cardiac pathway. Next, I will examine who specifically counts as high risk and who does not. After that, I need to check the recommended timing and drug choices, and correct myself if any regimen I recall is outdated. Finally, I should synthesize guideline disagreements (ESC/AHA vs NICE) and emphasize special situations where prophylaxis is not indicated, so the clinical message is precise and actionable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical split. Hold on, I should verify that most authoritative guidance treats endocarditis prevention separately from prosthetic joint infection prevention. Yes, current cardiology guidelines focus on high‑risk cardiac conditions for endocarditis prophylaxis with invasive dental procedures, whereas dental and orthopedic guidelines explicitly advise against routine prophylaxis to prevent prosthetic joint infection in patients with hip or knee arthroplasty, so I need to keep these lanes separate to avoid conflating indications [^notfound] [^1119a7SY] [^117XUgB3].

> Next, I will clarify who is "high risk" for infective endocarditis and thus eligible for prophylaxis when undergoing invasive dental procedures. Let me think about the 2023 ESC specifics: prior infective endocarditis, any prosthetic valve (surgical or transcatheter), surgically implanted valve‑repair materials, certain congenital heart diseases such as untreated cyanotic disease or repaired lesions with residual defects within the first 6 months after repair, ventricular assist devices, and selected transplant recipients with valvulopathy are considered high risk; I should confirm that transcatheter mitral or tricuspid repairs and heart transplant recipients are indeed included in ESC 2023, which they are, and I should also remember that low‑risk lesions like isolated mitral valve prolapse are explicitly not indications for prophylaxis [^114BRUvb] [^112HGKiF].

> I now need to check which dental procedures count as "invasive" and therefore warrant prophylaxis in those high‑risk cardiac patients. Wait, let me verify the examples: extractions, oral surgical procedures such as implant or periodontal surgery, and any procedure manipulating gingival or periapical tissues qualify; whereas purely noninvasive activities like radiographs, denture adjustments, orthodontic appliance adjustments without tissue manipulation, and routine exams without significant probing do not require prophylaxis; ESC also emphasizes general prevention measures and oral hygiene optimization, which I should not overlook [^115bEAhR] [^114SYay3].

> Before I state indications as dogma, I should examine whether the link between dental procedures and infective endocarditis, and the effect size of antibiotic prophylaxis, are supported by data. Let me review: case‑crossover and cohort analyses show a temporal association between invasive dental procedures, especially extractions and oral surgery, and endocarditis in high‑risk individuals, and observational analyses report that prophylaxis attenuates this association; a contemporary meta‑analysis synthesizes these nonrandomized data and supports a risk signal and a protective association of prophylaxis in the highest‑risk strata, though residual confounding and misclassification must be acknowledged, so I should be careful not to overstate causality [^115bEAhR] [^1122GqJG] [^1157HKtf] [^111Hegjy].

> Now, about the prophylaxis regimen and timing, I should be precise. The traditional regimen I recall is a single pre‑procedure dose of amoxicillin 2 g taken 30–60 minutes before the invasive dental procedure, and for penicillin allergy, clindamycin 600 mg as an alternative; wait, let me verify this because some recent guidance discourages clindamycin due to adverse event risk, so region‑specific recommendations may favor azithromycin, clarithromycin, or cephalexin depending on allergy phenotype; given this variability and the lack of a single universal regimen across the cited sources, I should instruct to follow local cardiology/dental guidance for the exact agent while maintaining the single pre‑procedure dose principle without post‑procedure continuation [^114BRUvb].

> Switching lanes, I will now examine prosthetic joint infection prevention. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite historic practice, contemporary dental and orthopedic guidelines state that routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures is not recommended for patients with total hip or knee arthroplasty, as evidence does not show a reduction in subsequent periprosthetic joint infection and there are stewardship and harm concerns; a recent arthroplasty cohort also failed to demonstrate benefit, reinforcing the guidance to avoid routine antibiotics for this indication [^1119a7SY] [^117XUgB3] [^116ZcYQs].

> I should also confirm peri‑arthroplasty dental timing considerations that sometimes get conflated with antibiotic decisions. The 2025 AAOS/AAHKS guidance suggests deferring many elective dental procedures for defined intervals after arthroplasty and prioritizing eradication of active dental infection pre‑arthroplasty, which is a procedural‑timing strategy rather than a mandate for prophylactic antibiotics, and helps frame expectations in the first postoperative months [^115sGqUu] [^117VQykX].

> But wait, what about regions where NICE previously advised stopping dental prophylaxis altogether for endocarditis prevention; did cases rise after cessation? I need to double‑check: English before‑and‑after studies showed a large fall in prescribing without a clear immediate change in overall endocarditis incidence, while later analyses and cost‑effectiveness models, as well as Scandinavian data exploring high‑risk cohorts, suggest that small to moderate effects cannot be excluded and may be more discernible in the very high‑risk strata; these mixed signals underpin why ESC and many international societies still support prophylaxis for the highest‑risk patients while acknowledging uncertainty and the lack of randomized trials [^117H7Qjf] [^113dUVRX] [^115bsbKf] [^1153sXRS].

> I will now delineate who explicitly does not require prophylaxis so we avoid overuse. Let me reconsider: low‑risk cardiac lesions, patients with pacemakers or implantable cardioverter‑defibrillators without valvular disease, and individuals with indwelling venous catheters do not warrant antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures; similarly, outside the dental domain, GI endoscopy generally does not require prophylaxis for endocarditis except narrow scenarios like ERCP with predicted incomplete biliary drainage where antibiotics target biliary flora for procedure‑related infection prevention, not cardiac endocarditis prevention [^116tJsFK] [^1166bFdn] [^112M9juY] [^116wgrGg].

> I should double‑check special populations that often prompt questions. Immunocompromised states and poorly controlled diabetes increase general infection risk, but there is no robust evidence base supporting routine dental antibiotic prophylaxis solely on that basis; individualized decisions can be considered in exceptional circumstances with multidisciplinary input, but defaulting to prophylaxis is not endorsed by major guidelines cited here, so I should emphasize optimization of glycemic control, oral hygiene, and definitive dental source control rather than preemptive antibiotics [^116tJsFK] [^112LhUQu].

> To synthesize the indications succinctly, I need to ensure I'm not missing any key caveat. In short, give antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive dental procedures that manipulate gingival or periapical tissues in patients at highest cardiac risk such as those with prior infective endocarditis, prosthetic valves or valve‑repair material, selected congenital heart disease with cyanosis or residual defects early after repair, ventricular assist devices, and certain transplant recipients with valvulopathy; do not give prophylaxis for routine noninvasive dental care, for low‑risk cardiac lesions, or for prevention of prosthetic joint infection in patients with arthroplasties, and align any chosen drug and dose with local guideline regimens and a single pre‑procedure administration [^114BRUvb] [^115bEAhR] [^1119a7SY] [^117XUgB3].

---

Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is indicated only for patients at **highest risk of infective endocarditis** [^114BRUvb] undergoing procedures involving manipulation of gingival or periapical tissues [^115bEAhR] or perforation of the oral mucosa [^115bEAhR]. It is **not recommended for patients with prosthetic joints** [^1119a7SY] [^117XUgB3] or immunocompromised individuals [^116tJsFK] unless they have specific high-risk cardiac conditions [^116tJsFK]. Routine prophylaxis is not indicated for healthy patients [^116tJsFK] or those with low-risk cardiac conditions [^116tJsFK].

### Infective endocarditis among high-risk individuals before and after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry: A national cohort study [^111gMMFA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

As shown by Figure 1, the cohorts consisted of 76,762 high-risk individuals and 396,048 low-risk individuals. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the prevalent cohort and Table 2 those of the incident cohort. The prevalent cohort comprised 36,158 high-risk individuals, of whom 20,569 (57%) were male. At the end of the 10-year study period, 395 (1.1%) had developed infective endocarditis (IE) at a mean follow-up of 7.5 years. The incident cohort comprised 36,363 high-risk individuals, of whom 21,983 (61%) were male. Following the study subjects for a maximum of 2 years, with a mean follow-up of 1.6 years, 516 (1.4%) had developed IE at the end of the study period.

The crude incidence of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis (VGS-IE) increased among prevalent high-risk individuals, from 33.6 cases per 100,000 individuals per year (95% confidence interval, 25.4–44.3) before October 2012, to 40.5 (95% CI, 30.6–53.6) after October 2012. Among incident high-risk individuals, there was also an increase in the incidence, from 240 cases (95% CI, 190–310) before to 250 cases (95% CI, 200–310) after. For completeness, Figures 3 and 4 show nonparametric smoothed hazard estimates for IE and VGS-IE across the study period. Adjusted hazard risk ratios (HRRs) increased from 15.4 (95% CI, 8.3–28.5) to 20.7 (95% CI, 10.0–42.7) among the prevalent high-risk individuals and decreased from 66.8 (95% CI, 28.7–155.6) to 44.6 (95% CI, 22.9–86.9) among incident high-risk individuals.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^112bY3Si]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The probability of IE following a high-risk dental procedure was based on an analysis of recent English data, which estimated that reduced use of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) was associated with 34.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.9–61.9) additional IE cases per month. The incidence of IE with AP use was derived from 2007, the year immediately before the introduction of NICE guidance, with data showing 1486 cases, or 28.91 per million.

- **Parameter estimates**: Table 1 reports the parameter estimates required to translate this incidence into an estimate of the probability of IE. All other probabilities are shown in Table 2. Duval et al. provided data on the proportion of IE cases associated with a predisposing cardiac condition, the proportion associated with a high-risk dental procedure, the mean number of high-risk dental procedures per year in those with a predisposing cardiac condition, and the prevalence of a predisposing cardiac condition, resulting in an estimated probability of IE of 17.98 per million high-risk dental procedures where routine AP would be provided.

The higher estimated annual incidence of IE in the absence of AP leads to an estimated probability of 1785.13 cases per million in the high-risk group and 204.33 cases per million dental procedures in the all-at-risk group.

- **Mortality from IE**: All patients were tracked for mortality within 1 year of IE diagnosis.

### Decision-making on the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for dental procedures: A survey of infectious disease consultants and review [^114xgRqi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

There is debate concerning the use of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of acquiring distant site infection (DSI). We determined the opinions and practices of infectious disease consultants (IDCs) regarding antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent DSIs that result from invasive dental procedures by conducting a survey of the 797 members of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Emerging Infections Network, with 477 members (60%) responding.

Ninety percent of respondents closely follow the American Heart Association guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with valvular heart disease who undergo invasive dental procedures. In contrast, few IDCs recommend prophylaxis for patients with lupus erythematosus, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, dialysis catheters or shunts, cardiac pacemakers, or ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

Twenty-five percent to forty percent of respondents recommended prophylaxis for prosthetic vascular grafts, orthopedic implants, or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. We conclude that IDCs differ considerably in their assessment of the need for prophylaxis for patients who have noncardiac risk factors for DSI. These differences underscore the need for definitive studies to delineate appropriate candidates for antimicrobial prophylaxis in dental practice.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^112oWydP]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

The validation of ICD-10 coding for oral streptococcal infective endocarditis was conducted. The study definition of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis, validated using medical records of 130 participants admitted to the hospital with at least one positive blood culture result for oral streptococci, had a sensitivity of 54% and a positive predictive value of 100%.

### The use of antibiotics in odontogenic infections: What is the best choice? A systematic review [^1153cJx1]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Odontogenic infections are a common problem in dentistry, and their treatment often requires the use of antibiotics in addition to the removal of the source of infection. This frequently complicates clinicians' decisions regarding the choice of antibiotic. This study aimed to explore the following questions using the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format: When should antibiotics be used in dental infections (DIs)? Which are the most effective drugs? How long should antibiotics be administered?

The systematic review utilized the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases without restrictions on the research period. The analyzed variables in each article included the number of odontogenic infections in each study, the type of study, surgical interventions performed, antibiotics administered, statistical differences between groups studied, and patients' evolution after treatment.

The search yielded 1,109 articles. After thoroughly reading 46 articles, 16 were included in the final review while 30 were excluded. A sample of 2,197 DI cases was obtained, involving the use of 15 different antibiotics, with a 98.2% overall cure rate.

The studies indicated that antibiotics should be prescribed only in situations involving regional and/or systemic body manifestations. In cases of DIs, once drainage has been performed and/or the cause of infection has been removed, all antibiotics tested were shown to be equally effective in achieving clinical cure. The success of antibiotic choice is not as crucial as local intervention.

### Prevention of orthopaedic implant infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^1127Lgfw]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

The prevention of orthopaedic implant infection in patients undergoing dental procedures evidence-based clinical practice guideline was co-developed by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Dental Association. This guideline replaces the previous AAOS Information Statement, "Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Bacteremia in Patients With Joint Replacement", published in 2009. Based on the best evidence and a systematic review of published studies, three recommendations have been created to guide clinical practice in the prevention of orthopaedic implant infections in patients undergoing dental procedures.

- **Limited Recommendation**: This recommendation proposes that the practitioner consider changing the long-standing practice of routinely prescribing prophylactic antibiotics for patients with orthopaedic implants who undergo dental procedures.

- **Inconclusive Recommendation**: This addresses the use of oral topical antimicrobials in the prevention of periprosthetic joint infections.

- **Consensus Statement**: It addresses the maintenance of good oral hygiene.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^1146QAvm]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is a widely used prevention measure for those at risk of developing infective endocarditis (IE). Following the suggestion that bacteremia secondary to invasive dental procedures might cause IE, the American Heart Association's Committee on Prevention of Rheumatic Fever and Bacterial Endocarditis was the first to recommend that individuals at increased risk of IE should be given AP before invasive dental procedures some 60 years ago. Over time, the American Heart Association and other international guideline committees have gradually restricted AP use, moving to single-dose AP strategies and restricting the types of patients for whom AP is recommended. In 2008, this culminated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommending that the use of AP to prevent IE should cease in the United Kingdom. This recommendation was confirmed in a recent review of the NICE guidelines but is in contrast with European, North American, and other international guidelines that recommend AP for high-risk individuals undergoing invasive dental procedures.

A recent interrupted time series study found that AP prescribing in England fell sharply after the 2008 NICE guidance with a significant increase in the incidence of IE. By March 2013, it was estimated that there were 34.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.9–61.9) more cases of IE per month than would have been expected from the previous trend. This increase was statistically significant both for those at high risk (previous history of IE, prosthetic heart valve, valve).

### Prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures: A cross-disciplinary survey of dentists and medical providers [^115a9o6o]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Low credibility.

The prescription of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures is common, although factors influencing prescribing are poorly understood. We surveyed general and specialist medical providers and dentists on beliefs and attitudes regarding prophylactic antibiotic prescribing prior to dental procedures. There were significant differences in factors influencing decisions and perceived responsibility regarding prophylactic antibiotic prescribing between groups, although interest in additional education on the subject was high across both groups.

### Commentary: Experience and expertise prevail when guidelines fail [^115zAJcG]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Low credibility.

In addition, a discussion is warranted regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with HCM. The authors report that the patient underwent "extensive dental work" but did not receive prophylactic antibiotics. According to the 2016 American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines, antibiotics are recommended for patients with congenital heart disease only if they have cyanotic disease or have undergone repair with prosthetic material. Likewise, although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines acknowledge that patients with HCM are at increased risk of endocarditis, prophylaxis is not routinely recommended. Nonetheless, at our institution, patients with HCM and evidence of LVOT obstruction would receive prophylactic antibiotics, as we believe the benefits outweigh the risks for this patient population.

Guidelines specific for pediatric patients with HCM and those with congenital heart disease undergoing dental procedures are not as robust as we would like, making it a necessity to thoroughly weigh the risks and benefits of various treatment options. This case report highlights that necessity. Although the treatment strategy and timing of intervention can be debated, we commend the authors on their successful management of this unique clinical scenario.

### Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^112KK3nW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart, characterized by a high mortality rate. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, and it was believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that antibiotics be administered to people at high risk of endocarditis prior to invasive dental procedures. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England as well as Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences mortality, serious illness, or the incidence of endocarditis.

- **Search methods**: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2013), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2013). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

- **Selection criteria**: Due to the low incidence of BE, it was anticipated that few if any trials would be available.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^113C61PT]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

We carried out a nationwide population-based cohort study to assess the rate of infective endocarditis associated with oral streptococci during the three months after invasive dental procedures according to different categories of exposure. This three-month interval was based on data from previous studies reporting long intervals between dental procedures and the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, and data from the literature.

Participants entered the cohort six months after the date of first identification of a prosthetic heart valve during the study period to ensure analysis under stable conditions. To be included in the cohort, patients had to be aged 18 years or older with no discharge diagnosis code for oral streptococcal infective endocarditis or other specific codes related to prosthetic heart valves before inclusion in the cohort.

- **Time frame of cohort study**: Figure 1 illustrates the time frame of the cohort study with examples of exposure during follow-up for three patients.
	- *Death from any cause (other than oral streptococcal infective endocarditis), or admission to hospital for prosthetic heart valve or replacement of prosthetic heart valve, or lost to follow-up, or follow-up until December 2014.*
	- Participant A was exposed to an invasive dental procedure during follow-up but did not present with oral streptococcal infective endocarditis.
	- Participant B was exposed to both a non-invasive and an invasive dental procedure during follow-up and presented with oral streptococcal infective endocarditis. During the co-exposure period, priority was given to exposure of an invasive dental procedure.

### Trends in endocarditis hospitalizations at US children's hospitals: Impact of the 2007 American Heart Association antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines [^113B6AAG]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association recommended cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis (IE) before dental procedures for all but those at highest risk for adverse outcomes from IE. The impact of these guidelines is unclear. We evaluated IE hospitalizations at US children's hospitals during this period.

- **Methods**: Children under 18 years old, hospitalized from 2003 to 2010 with IE at 37 centers in the Pediatric Health Information Systems Database, were included. Using Poisson regression, we evaluated the number of IE hospitalizations over time (both raw and indexed to total hospital admissions).

- **Results**: A total of 1157 IE cases were identified, of which 68% had congenital heart disease (CHD). The raw number of IE cases did not change significantly over time (+1.6% difference post vs. pre-guidelines, 95% CI -6.4% to +10.3%, P = 0.7). When the number of IE cases was indexed per 1,000 hospital admissions, there was a significant decline during the time period before the guidelines (annual change: -5.9%, 95% CI -9.9 to -1.8, P = 0.005) and a similar decline in the post-guidelines period such that the difference between the two periods was not significant (P = 0.15). In subgroup analysis, no significant change over time in IE cases (raw or indexed) was found in the CHD subset, those 5 to 18 years old (the subgroup most likely receiving dental care), or in cases coded as oral streptococci.

- **Conclusions**: We found no evidence that the release of new antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines was associated with a significant change in IE admissions across 37 US children's hospitals.

### Medical clearance for common dental procedures [^1154vLyJ]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Medical consultations before dental procedures present opportunities to integrate cross-disciplinary preventive care and improve patient health. This article presents recommendations related to patients with certain medical conditions who are planning to undergo common dental procedures, such as cleanings, extractions, restorations, endodontic procedures, abscess drainage, and mucosal biopsies. Specifically, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for preventing prosthetic joint infections or infectious endocarditis except in certain circumstances. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies typically should not be suspended for common dental treatments. Elective dental care should be avoided for six weeks after myocardial infarction or bare-metal stent placement, or for six months after drug-eluting stent placement. It is important that any history of antiresorptive or antiangiogenic therapies be communicated to the dentist. Ascites is not an indication for initiating prophylactic antibiotics before dental treatment, and acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice for patients with liver dysfunction or cirrhosis who abstain from alcohol. Nephrotoxic medications should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the consultation should include the patient's glomerular filtration rate. Although patients undergoing chemotherapy may receive routine dental care, it should be postponed, when possible, in those currently undergoing head and neck radiation therapy. A detailed history of head and neck radiation therapy should be provided to the dentist.

### Infective endocarditis among high-risk individuals before and after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry: A national cohort study [^115bsbKf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

As illustrated in Figure 2, high-risk individuals were divided into one prevalent and one incident cohort, analyzed separately to avoid survivorship bias. Previous research indicates a relatively high mortality rate among high-risk individuals, as well as a relatively high risk of infective endocarditis (IE) during the first few years after hospitalization from IE or replacement of a heart valve. It was hypothesized that the incidence of IE was lower among high-risk individuals who survived until the start of follow-up in 2008 (prevalent high-risk individuals) than among those who became high-risk individuals during the follow-up (incident high-risk individuals). Analyzing these cohorts together could lead to biased estimates of the incidence of IE. Stratification was conducted by the date of first hospital admission with a risk factor. Individuals admitted between 1964 and 2008, deemed at high risk of survivorship bias, were assigned to the prevalent cohort, and those admitted from January 2008 onward were assigned to the incident cohort.

All high-risk individuals available in Swedish medical records were included since the start of the National Patient Register in 1964. High-risk individuals were assigned to the prevalent cohort if the date of first diagnosis of a risk factor for IE was before 2008, and to the incident cohort if they became high-risk individuals during the study period. This stratification was carried out to avoid survivorship bias. Individuals in the reference group, consisting of diabetics, were assigned to prevalent and incident cohorts in a similar way.

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: do the changes make sense? A critical review [^111JqndQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

- **Recent findings**: The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis and recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures only for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. The American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

- **Summary**: While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis, there is controversy regarding what to recommend for the individual cardiac patient undergoing a given procedure. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin, while the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

### Infective endocarditis among high-risk individuals before and after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry: A national cohort study [^114TxKmu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Individuals with prior infective endocarditis (IE), a prosthetic heart valve, or cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) are at increased risk of developing IE. The incidence of IE among the overall population has been reported to be 2–7 cases per 100,000 individuals per year. Among high-risk groups, however, incidence rates of IE are 100-fold higher compared with the general population. In Sweden, with a population of approximately 10 million individuals, there are approximately 600 cases of IE per year, of which 25%–30% are caused by oral viridans group streptococci (VGS-IE). American and European guidelines state that high-risk individuals should receive antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures to reduce the risk of postprocedural VGS-IE, despite a lack of evidence to support the efficacy of the prophylaxis. The United Kingdom and Sweden are the only countries to have abandoned AP for individuals considered to be at high risk for developing IE.

### Investigation of the impact of the NICE guidelines regarding antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures on the incidence of infective endocarditis in England: an electronic health records study [^112Wmy9d]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is an uncommon but serious infection for which the evidence for giving antibiotic prophylaxis to people undergoing invasive dental procedures is inconclusive. In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued guidelines recommending that antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures should no longer be routinely offered to people at risk of infective endocarditis in England. This was in contrast to American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines issued around the same time, which continued to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis in certain high-risk cases, such as patients with prosthetic heart valves or those who had previously had infective endocarditis. Although much research on the impact of guideline changes on the incidence of infective endocarditis has been conducted internationally, including a study in England that showed an increase in cases following the NICE guideline change, no consensus has been reached. In a 2016 update to their guidelines, NICE reaffirmed their previous position while clarifying that doctors and dentists should still apply their clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis.

A recent study of ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) diagnosis codes used to represent infective endocarditis cases at two large English hospital trusts concluded that the inclusion criteria for observational studies using electronic health records (EHRs) need to be selected very carefully, as even when specific diagnostic codes are used.

### Antibiotic prescribing habits of oral and maxillofacial surgeons in conjunction with routine dental implant placement [^113n6Fgk]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Although various prophylactic systemic antibiotic regimens have been suggested to minimize failure after dental implant placement, the role of antibiotics in implant dentistry is still controversial. The purpose of the present survey was to determine the antibiotic prescribing habits of oral and maxillofacial surgeons in conjunction with routine dental implant placement to ascertain whether any consensus has been reached among such practitioners.

- **Materials and methods**: An electronic survey was sent by electronic mail to all members of the American College of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. The survey questions pertained to whether antibiotics were routinely prescribed either pre- or post-operatively during routine dental implant placement. Participants were asked about the antibiotics used, including dosage, frequency, and duration. They were also required to specify their practice setting, such as solo private practice, group private practice, academia, military, or "other". The results were tabulated and analyzed using SAS software, employing descriptive statistics and χ² analyses.

- **Results**: A total of 217 members responded to the survey. Overall, 112 of 217 (51.6%) prescribed antibiotics preoperatively (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.0 to 58.2%) and 152 of 213 (71.4%) prescribed antibiotics postoperatively (95% CI 65.0 to 77.0%) during routine dental implant placement. Additionally, 72 (34%) indicated that they prescribed antibiotics both pre- and postoperatively. The most common preoperative regimen used was amoxicillin 2 g given 1 hour before the procedure (32%, n = 36).

### The necessity of administrating antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with diabetes mellitus prior to oral surgical procedures-a systematic review [^112LhUQu]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Many studies suggest the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) as an appropriate preventive measure for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) due to the increased possibility of impaired wound healing and infections after surgical procedures in the oral cavity. Existing recommendations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis before surgical procedures are not definitive and are based on expert opinions. The purpose of this study was to review the available scientific data about the necessity of administering AP as a preventive measure prior to oral surgical procedures.

- **Method**: PubMed®, Scopus®, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were used as databases to search for published research. All articles were initially identified and classified based on the title and subsequently on their abstract. For the next level, the full scientific paper was read and evaluated.

- **Results**: Overall, 22 articles were included in the study, of which 2 were systematic reviews, 2 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies, 1 case series, 8 case reports, and 7 professional association publications.

- **Conclusions**: In the scientific literature, there is a wide range of recommendations and inconsistency regarding the need to administer AP prior to surgical dental operations in patients with DM, while there is no scientific evidence demonstrating its effectiveness as a precautionary measure. Both blood glucose level measurements and recent HbA1c measurement should be evaluated before any dental procedure. Poor regulation may result in life-threatening infections.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^1153sXRS]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for individuals at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom. This recommendation was based on a cited lack of evidence regarding both efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We have conducted a new economic evaluation of AP by utilizing contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.

A decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was employed. Health service costs and benefits, measured as quality-adjusted life-years, were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, while resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.

AP was found to be less costly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy; however, efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP to not be cost-effective. AP was notably more cost-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk patients and 33 cases among all at-risk patients) would be necessary for AP to be deemed cost-effective at £20,000 ($26,600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings ranging from £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3-$10.9 million) and health gains exceeding 2,600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved by reinstating AP in England.

In conclusion, AP is cost-effective for preventing IE, particularly in high-risk groups.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^114rJxHb]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Over the past 10 years, there has been a general move to reduce antibiotic prescribing to save costs and prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Although this initiative could have contributed to the reduction in prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis, it seems unlikely given the size and suddenness of the reduction, its coincidence with the introduction of the NICE guideline, the low cost of a single dose of amoxicillin or clindamycin, and national prescribing data showing a slight increase in the general prescribing of penicillins and macrolide antibiotics over the same period.

The results of this analysis cover a large group of patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed before the introduction of the NICE guideline. Our results suggest that for most of these patients, including those with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, there may be little or no benefit in giving antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis. However, because we cannot exclude the possibility that residual antibiotic prophylaxis prescribing targets those perceived to be at the highest risk of infective endocarditis, it does not entirely resolve the issue of whether a subset of patients, particularly those with prosthetic heart valves or a history of infective endocarditis, might still benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. To more directly address this question, a carefully designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients would be required.

Given that oral viridans group streptococci are considered a significant cause of infective endocarditis, it is crucial to evaluate the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing this condition in high-risk patients.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures to prevent indwelling venous catheter-related infections [^1166bFdn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic indwelling central venous catheters are commonly used for a variety of indications. A predominant limitation of their use is catheter-related infections. Some clinicians believe that bacteremia from an invasive dental procedure could cause catheter-related infections and that antibiotic prophylaxis may prevent this complication. The topic is controversial, in large part because of the lack of clinical trial data supporting this notion.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review to determine the level of evidence to support this practice. We retrieved studies, guidelines, recommendations, case reports, and editorials on prescribing prophylactic antibiotic therapy for indwelling central venous catheters before oral/dental procedures, using a search of PubMed, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and textbooks.

- **Results**: There were no clinical trials and no documented cases of a catheter-related infection associated with an invasive dental procedure. Despite the lack of evidence, there are numerous recommendations and guidelines available in the literature that support the administration of "dental" prophylaxis.

- **Conclusion**: There is no evidence to support the administration of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent catheter-related infections associated with an invasive oral procedure in patients with chronic indwelling central venous catheters.

### Appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2016–2018 [^1128pnob]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis is common yet unnecessary for many dental visits. In this analysis, our objective was to assess whether the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis has improved over time.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using dental visits from 2016 to 2018 (data analyzed in 2021) employing medical and prescription claims data from patients in the U.S. with commercial dental insurance. Antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a ≤ 2 days' supply prescription dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit. The appropriateness of prophylaxis was determined based on the manipulation of the gingiva/tooth periapex or oral mucosa perforation in patients with appropriate cardiac diagnoses. Associations between patient and visit characteristics and the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis were assessed using multiple Poisson regression.

- **Results**: Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was highly prevalent in this cohort, ranging from 77.0% in 2016 to 78.5% in 2018. In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis included younger age, female sex, geographic region, rurality, type of antibiotic, and certain dental procedures. The factors associated with the highest risk of unnecessary prophylaxis in the adjusted analysis were orthodontic procedures and having a history of a prosthetic joint. Notably, the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time in the adjusted analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Unnecessary prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists continues to be common.

### Aaos clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^115sGqUu]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for prosthetic joint infection, specifically with respect to prophylaxis before dental procedures, AAHKS/AAOS 2025 guidelines recommend considering delaying dental procedures after hip or knee replacement surgery. This recommendation is based on the risk of transient bacteremia, the occurrence of an invasive surgical procedure, and the treatment of an active dental infection:

- **Same day procedures**: Dental examination without probing, dental radiography or cone beam CT, denture adjustment procedures, clear orthodontic aligner adjustment procedures, occlusal guard or bite splint adjustment

- **Delayed for 3 months**:
	- **Oral hygiene procedures**: Dental cleaning, dental prophylaxis using a rubber cup and handpiece (without scaling), periodontal probing (without scaling and/or root planing)
	- **Orthodontic procedures**: Banding or debanding orthodontic fixes or removable appliances, archwire adjustment, orthodontic mini-implant removal, orthodontic separator placement
	- **Miscellaneous noninvasive procedures**: Suture removal, anesthetic injection, crown and bridge placement, dental restorative procedures, rubber dam clamp or matrix band wedge between teeth, impression taking, endodontic treatment (root canal therapy)
	- **Scaling/root planing**: Scaling and/or root planing with manual (hand instruments) or ultrasonic scaler
	- **Dental extractions**: Dental extraction, including single, multiple, impacted third molar

- **Oral surgery**: Dental implant surgery, periodontal surgery, cleft palate surgery, piezoelectric surgery, osteosynthesis

The revised guidance aims to optimize patient outcomes by minimizing the risk of joint infection following invasive dental or surgical procedures.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for gastrointestinal procedures: Current practices in North American academic pediatric programs [^11464AH8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in children are based on a small number of studies that assess the risk of infection associated with performing endoscopic procedures. The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Society of Gastroenterological Endoscopy (ASGE) have established guidelines that identify conditions and procedures placing a child at greater risk for infectious complications. Because data on bacteremia and sepsis associated with endoscopy in children are very limited, we reviewed the practices of 15 large academic pediatric gastroenterology services to see if patterns of practice and safety could be determined.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire was sent to 15 academic gastroenterology centers in the United States and Canada asking about antibiotic prophylaxis for endoscopic procedures for children with six conditions. These included three conditions related to congenital heart disease based on negligible, moderate, and high risk for endocarditis; immune compromise; the presence of a central venous line; and the presence of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Six procedures were evaluated, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy with biopsy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, esophageal sclerotherapy, esophageal dilation, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

- **Results**: The patterns of reported practice generally conform to the AHA and ASGE guidelines. The six conditions and six procedures yielded 36 response categories for the participating centers.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^1122GqJG]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

The objective is to assess the relation between invasive dental procedures and infective endocarditis associated with oral streptococci among people with prosthetic heart valves.

- **Design**: Nationwide population-based cohort and a case crossover study.

- **Setting**: French national health insurance administrative data linked with the national hospital discharge database.

- **Participants**: All adults aged more than 18 years, living in France, with medical procedure codes for positioning or replacement of prosthetic heart valves between July 2008 and July 2014.

- **Main outcome measures**: Oral streptococcal infective endocarditis was identified using primary discharge diagnosis codes. In the cohort study, Poisson regression models were performed to estimate the rate of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis during the three-month period after invasive dental procedures compared with non-exposure periods. In the case crossover study, conditional logistic regression models calculated the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals comparing exposure to invasive dental procedures during the three-month period preceding oral streptococcal infective endocarditis (case period) with three earlier control periods.

- **Results**: The cohort included 138,876 adults with prosthetic heart valves (285,034 person-years); 69,303 (49.9%) underwent at least one dental procedure. Among the 396,615 dental procedures performed, 103,463 (26.0%) were invasive and therefore presented an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis, which was performed in 52,280 (50.1%). With a median follow-up of 1.7 years, 267 people developed infective endocarditis.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^112HGKiF]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for infective endocarditis, specifically concerning antibiotic prophylaxis during dental procedures, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with any of the following conditions undergoing oro-dental procedures:

- **Transcatheter mitral or tricuspid valve repair**: Patients with this condition are advised to receive antibiotic prophylaxis during dental procedures to minimize the risk of infective endocarditis.
- **Heart transplant**: Individuals who have undergone a heart transplant should also consider antibiotic prophylaxis when participating in oro-dental procedures.

These recommendations aim to reduce the incidence of infective endocarditis in vulnerable patient populations.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1176wr4N]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Without accurate data on the proportion of cases caused by dental procedures, it is difficult for statistical analysis purposes to predefine a clinically relevant level of change after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis or to determine the sample size needed to detect the change. Using the premise that a high proportion of cases are caused by dental procedures, a large increase in the number of cases would be expected if antibiotic prophylaxis was stopped and was effective, and a comparatively small population would be needed to detect a statistically significant change. On the other hand, if the number of cases caused by dental procedures was small, it would require an infinitely large population to detect any increase.

Indeed, to exclude a 1% increase in the incidence of infective endocarditis a it is e baseline trend, assuming a similar incidence of infective endocarditis and variability in the numbers of cases on a month-by-month basis, would require a study population of 478.5 million people. For this reason, even with a study covering the entire population of England, the possibility of a small increase in cases after cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis cannot be excluded. However, that we identified no significant increase in cases in a population of this size, despite a large decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, suggests that invasive dental procedures are unlikely to account for a high proportion of the cases.

Because of this, and because of the nature of the statistical test we applied, we used the quality of the available data to…

### Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^117VUob7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the heart, with a high mortality rate. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, and it was previously believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that, prior to invasive dental procedures, antibiotics be administered to individuals at high risk of endocarditis. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England as well as Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in people at increased risk of BE, influences mortality, serious illness, or endocarditis incidence.

- **Search strategy**: The search strategy from the previous review was expanded and run on MEDLINE (1950 to June 2008) and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers, as well as the following databases: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2); EMBASE (1980 to June 2008); and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to June 2008).

- **Selection criteria**: Due to the low incidence of BE, it was anticipated that few, if any, trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotics compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk.

Inappropriate dental antibiotic prescriptions to prevent infective endocarditis in the United States result in approximately $31 million in excess costs to the healthcare system and patients. This includes out-of-pocket costs of $20.5 million, drug costs of $2.69 million, and adverse event costs of $5.82 million for amoxicillin, $1.99 million for clindamycin, and $380,849 for cephalexin.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis before invasive dental procedures [^114Mn73Z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures (IDPs) is recommended to prevent infective endocarditis (IE) in those at high IE risk, but there are sparse data supporting a link between IDPs and IE or the efficacy of AP in IE prevention.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to investigate any association between IDPs and IE, and the effectiveness of AP in reducing this.

- **Methods**: We performed a case-crossover analysis and cohort study of the association between IDPs and IE and AP efficacy, in 7,951,972 U.S. subjects with employer-provided commercial/Medicare-Supplemental coverage.

- **Results**: Time course studies showed that IE was most likely to occur within 4 weeks of an IDP. For those at high IE risk, case-crossover analysis demonstrated a significant temporal association between IE and IDPs in the preceding 4 weeks (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.59–2.52; P = 0.002). This relationship was strongest for dental extractions (OR: 11.08; 95% CI: 7.34–16.74; P < 0.0001) and oral-surgical procedures (OR: 50.77; 95% CI: 20.79–123.98; P < 0.0001). AP was associated with a significant reduction in IE incidence following IDP (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.29–0.85; P = 0.01). The cohort study confirmed the associations between IE and extractions or oral surgical procedures in those at high IE risk and the effect of AP in reducing these associations (extractions: OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03–0.34; P < 0.0001; oral surgical procedures: OR: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01–0.35; P = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: We demonstrated a significant temporal association between IDPs, particularly extractions and oral surgical procedures, and IE, and found AP to be effective in reducing this association.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^117VQykX]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

The prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures evidence-based clinical practice guideline is grounded in a systematic review of published studies. It examines the influence of dental care and procedures on outcomes after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). It also explores strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with dental care and procedures in patients with a TJA.

- **Scope**: The guideline covers the role of dental screening, antibiotic prophylaxis, use of antimicrobial mouth rinses, and timing of dental procedures before and after TJA.
- **Population**: It focuses on patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty due to a paucity of data on patients with other orthopedic implants.
- **Guidance provision**: Based on the best available evidence, the guideline presents five options to aid all qualified clinicians, including orthopedic surgeons and dental providers, in preventing periprosthetic joint infections in patients undergoing dental procedures. It serves as an information resource for healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations.

In addition to providing practical practice recommendations, the guideline identifies gaps in the literature and suggests areas for future research and the development of quality measures.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^1157HKtf]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

This cohort shows that the incidence of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis during the three months after an invasive dental procedure was higher, but not statistically significantly higher, in participants not receiving the recommended antibiotic prophylaxis. However, the analysis performed in this cohort is based on pooled data derived from a heterogeneous population of patients in terms of use of dental care (measured in our database) and certainly in terms of oral hygiene and dental status (not measured in our database), which represent a potential source of bias in the non-exposure periods.

The case crossover study may ensure better control for these confounding factors, such as individual oral hygiene and dental status, as each participant constituted his or her own control. The case crossover analysis, including 648 participants with oral streptococcal infective endocarditis, showed a statistically significant association between invasive dental procedures and oral streptococcal infective endocarditis. Using the same case crossover design in 170 participants with infective endocarditis, one study did not observe any statistically significant difference in the number and type of dental procedures performed during the three-month period before admission for infective endocarditis compared with control periods. However, only 49 viridans streptococci were analyzed, and 44% of participants had a prosthetic heart valve. Similarly, in a recent case crossover study based on Taiwan's national health insurance program, one study reported that dental procedures did not increase the risk.

### Estimated risk of endocarditis in adults with predisposing cardiac conditions undergoing dental procedures with or without antibiotic prophylaxis [^114iz1nw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Although antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis (IE) has been recommended for persons with predisposing cardiac conditions (PCCs) for many years, its efficacy, which has not been demonstrated, has been recently challenged. To assess its usefulness, we estimated the risk of developing IE after undergoing a dental procedure for which subjects would be eligible for prophylaxis, both in subjects having (protected procedure) or not having (unprotected procedure) received antibiotic prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: The number of French persons with PCCs, the annual number of dental procedures in which subjects would be eligible for antibiotic prophylaxis, and the number of procedures that were unprotected were estimated on the basis of a survey performed on a sample of 2805 subjects aged 25–84 years. The annual number of IE cases possibly due to an unprotected procedure was estimated on the basis of a 1-year epidemiological study of IE conducted in an area inhabited by 16 million people.

- **Results**: After standardization, extrapolation of results to the age-equivalent general population (39 million subjects) indicated the following: First, 3.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.6%-4%) of the subjects had PCC, 2.7 million (95% CI, 2.3–3.2 million) of whom had undergone at least one at-risk dental procedure within the survey year, and the procedures were unprotected in 62% of cases; second, 37 (95% CI, 18–68; 2.7%) of the 1370 annual IE cases in France were possibly related to unprotected procedures. Thus, the risks of developing IE were estimated to be 1 in 46,000 for unprotected scenarios.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures after total hip and knee arthroplasty does not decrease the risk of periprosthetic joint infection [^116ZcYQs]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Low credibility.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication after total hip and total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). While some guidelines no longer recommend routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures, many surgeons continue to prescribe antibiotics for their THA/TKA patients. In a setting of increasing antibiotic resistance, it is important to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. This study aims to evaluate antibiotics prior to dental procedures and the association between dental procedures and PJI.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent THA/TKA between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was late-presenting PJI, occurring more than 90 days after surgery. Patients were categorized into the antibiotic group (2,000 mg of amoxicillin) or non-antibiotic group based on their surgeon' it is ylaxis protocol. Dental-associated PJIs were considered if the patient had evidence of poor dentition or a recent dental procedure prior to the onset of PJI symptoms.

- **Results**: There were 2,871 (26.4%) patients in the no antibiotics group and 8,023 (73.6%) patients in the antibiotics group. We found 27 (0.3%) late-presenting PJIs and 4 dental-associated PJIs. In the univariate and multivariable analyses, body mass index ≥ 30 and revision surgery were the only variables that increased the odds of late-presenting PJI. All 4 dental-associated PJIs occurred in patients prescribed antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: We found a low rate of late-presenting PJI. Routine antibiotics prior to dental procedures were not shown to significantly reduce the risk of PJI.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for GI endoscopy [^112M9juY]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for infective endocarditis, particularly concerning antibiotic prophylaxis for gastrointestinal procedures, the ASGE 2015 guidelines recommend administering antibiotic prophylaxis before ERCP in patients with a history of liver transplantation or with known or suspected biliary obstruction, where there is a possibility of incomplete biliary drainage. Administer antibiotics covering biliary flora, such as enteric gram-negative organisms and enterococci, and continue after the procedure if biliary drainage is incomplete.

### Investigation of the impact of the NICE guidelines regarding antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures on the incidence of infective endocarditis in England: an electronic health records study [^113dUVRX]. BMC Medicine (2020). High credibility.

We identified potential causal organisms using secondary diagnosis codes that were present in the same consultant episode(s) as the code(s) for infective endocarditis within a superspell. These were categorized into three overall groups: Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus species, and other/unnamed species. If more than one organism code was present in a superspell (e.g. if a superspell consisted of multiple episodes with different secondary organism codes and/or an episode included more than one organism code), we included them all.

Since ICD-10 codes do not distinguish between infection with oral and non-oral streptococci, we further matched the HES records to microbiological test results in Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS), which receives microbiology results from over 98% of hospital laboratories in England. Organisms from blood specimens recorded in SGSS were matched to episodes in HES that contained an infective endocarditis diagnosis code based on NHS number and specimen date between 7 days before the episode start date up to the episode end date. This matching was carried out by the data manager at Public Health England, who had authorization to view personally identifiable data under Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002. If more than one SGSS record was matched within a superspell, we included them all. We considered the organisms from SGSS and HES to be in agreement for an infective endocarditis case if at least one organism from each source was present and belonged to the same group.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: Nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^11776fCu]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Identification of antibiotic prophylaxis

As antibiotic prophylaxis before an invasive dental procedure was not recorded in the SNIIRAM database, we considered antibiotic prophylaxis preceding the dental procedure when the participants had an antibiotic treatment active against oral streptococci dispensed by pharmacists in the 21 days before the dental procedure, irrespective of whether the procedure was invasive or non-invasive. This 21-day interval was based on a previous survey conducted among 585 dentists, which showed that 84% of practitioners prescribed antibiotic treatment during the two weeks before the dental procedure.

Definition of exposure

Initially, we classified exposure into two categories according to whether the dental procedure was invasive or non-invasive. When both types of procedures were reported for the same period for a given participant, we prioritized the invasive procedure. We then subdivided these periods into two categories according to the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, resulting in four categories: invasive dental procedure with antibiotic prophylaxis, invasive procedure without antibiotic prophylaxis, non-invasive procedure with antibiotic prophylaxis, and non-invasive procedure without antibiotic prophylaxis.

Definition of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis

We defined oral streptococcal infective endocarditis as the first hospital admission between January 2009 and December 2014 with a primary discharge diagnosis of infective endocarditis using ICD-10 codes (I33.0 for acute and subacute infective endocarditis).

### Investigation of the impact of the NICE guidelines regarding antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures on the incidence of infective endocarditis in England: an electronic health records study [^113jdQcq]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of infective endocarditis in England increased between April 1998 and March 2017, irrespective of which of the three criteria we used to measure it (Fig. 1a). Annual numbers of cases and incidence rates can be seen in Table 1. Criteria A (optimized for sensitivity/positive predictive value) produced the highest numbers of cases overall, while Criteria B (optimized for specificity/positive predictive value) produced the lowest numbers. The trends using Criteria A and B appeared very similar throughout the entire period, whereas the trend based on Criteria C (used by the largest prior English study) increased more rapidly from around 2010 onward (Fig. 1b). Controlling for changes in population attenuated the yearly increases but did not change the overall trend pattern (Fig. 1c, Additional file 2: Figure S1).

- **Monthly cases of infective endocarditis**: Different colored lines represent different inclusion criteria.
	- a: Raw cases.
	- **B**: Raw cases after applying a non-parametric LOWESS smoother.
	- c: Effect of applying different methods to adjust for changes in population, shown here for all cases using Criteria A, but results are similar for all three criteria (see Additional file 2: Figure S1).

- **Annual numbers and incidence rates of infective endocarditis**: High-risk individuals comprised 13,581/50,570 (27%), 7,286/28,851 (25%), and 12,873/35,752 (36%) cases for Criteria A, B, and C, respectively.

The incidence of infective endocarditis shows a notable increase across the studied period, highlighting the implications of the NICE guidelines regarding antibiotic prophylaxis during invasive dental procedures.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^117H7Qjf]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

This study aims to quantify the change in prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis and any consequent change in the incidence of infective endocarditis. This follows the introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008, recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

- **Design**: Before and after study.
- **Setting**: England.
- **Population**: All patients admitted to hospital in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.
- **Main outcome measures**: Monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis, consisting of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin, and monthly number of cases of infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospital, or cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

After the introduction of the NICE guideline, there was a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, from a mean of 10,277 (SD 1068) prescriptions per month to 2292 (SD 176). Evidence that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis before the guideline was significantly altered after the guideline was lacking (P = 0.61). Using a non-inferiority test, an increase in the number of cases of 9.3% or more could be excluded after the introduction of the guideline. Similarly, an increase in infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospital could not be confirmed.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: Before and after study [^1144WRma]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify the change in prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis. It also aimed to assess any change in the incidence of infective endocarditis following the introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008, which recommended the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

The study was designed as a before-and-after study, set in England. It involved all patients admitted to hospitals in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study focused on the monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis, comprising a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin. Additionally, it considered the monthly number of cases of infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis-related deaths in hospitals, and cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

- **Results**: Following the introduction of the NICE guideline, there was a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis. The mean prescriptions per month dropped from 10,277 (SD 1068) to 2,292 (SD 176). However, evidence suggesting that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis before the guideline was significantly altered after the guideline was lacking (P = 0.61). Using a non-inferiority test, an increase in the number of cases of 9.3% or more could be excluded after the introduction of the guideline. Similarly, an increase in infective endocarditis-related deaths following the guideline's implementation was not reported.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis incidence following invasive dental procedures: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Hegjy]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis after invasive dental procedures remains unclear. Guidelines began to restrict indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in 2007.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyze existing evidence on the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures. The data sources included PubMed, Cochrane-CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, Proquest, Embase, Dentistry and Oral Sciences Source, and ClinicalTrials.gov, which were searched systematically from inception to May 2023.

- **Study selection**: Studies focusing on the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures, as well as time-trend analyses of infective endocarditis incidence before and after the implementation of antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines, were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Study quality was evaluated using structured tools. Data were extracted by independent observers. Using random-effects meta-analysis, a pooled relative risk (RR) was computed for developing infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures in individuals receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those who were not.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis.

Of the 11,217 records identified, 30 studies were included, covering a total of 1,152,345 infective endocarditis cases. Among them, 8 studies (including 12 substudies) were either case-control, crossover, or cohort studies.

### Infective endocarditis hospitalizations and antibiotic prophylaxis rates before and after the 2007 American Heart Association guideline revision [^111e1Y8K]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE) for only the highest-risk patients. Whether this change affected the use of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incidence of IE is unclear.

- **Methods**: IE-related hospitalizations were identified from 2002 to 2014 among all adults and those at high and moderate risk for IE, stratified by age. Prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis were obtained from the Ontario Drug Benefit database for adults aged 65 years and older. Outcomes were antibiotic prophylaxis prescription rates and incidence of IE-related hospitalization. Trends in patient and pathogen characteristics were analyzed. Time series analyses were performed with segmented regression and change-point analyses.

- **Results**: Prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis decreased substantially in the moderate-risk cohort after the guideline revision (mean quarterly prescriptions, 30,680 versus 17,954 [level change, -6,481; P = 0.0004] per 1 million population), with a minimal yet significant decrease followed by a slow increase in the high-risk group. There were 7,551 IE-related hospitalizations among 6,884 adults aged 18 and older. Among adults aged 65 and older, the mean IE rate increased from 872 to 1,385 and 229 to 283 per 1 million population at risk per quarter in the high- and moderate-risk groups, respectively. Change-point analyses indicated that this increase occurred in the second half of 2010 in adults aged 65 and older, three years after the American Heart Association guideline revision.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures at risk of causing bacteremia among post-total joint arthroplasty patients: A survey of Canadian orthopaedic surgeons and dental surgeons [^1151T9j7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

To elicit practice and attitudes toward the use of antibiotic prophylaxis among total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients prior to dental procedures, a cross-sectional survey of practicing Canadian orthopaedic surgeons (OS) and dental surgeons (DS) was undertaken. Of the respondents, 77% of OS and 71% of DS routinely prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis. However, while 63% of OS advocate for lifelong use, only 22% of DS choose to do so (P < 0.0001).

Both groups recognize the importance of treatment within two years post-TJA as per the AAOS/ADA guidelines. However, a longer duration of practice highlighted potential inadequacy of these guidelines based on reported experiences with late-hematogenous infection post-TJA. While discrepancies in attitudes toward antibiotic prophylaxis between the surgeon groups remain, both agreed that the evidence supporting decision-making regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for TJA patients undergoing dental procedures remains inadequate.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery: Advisory statement 2008 [^114Z4yTG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is an important component of dermatologic surgery and recommendations in this area should reflect the updated 2007 guidelines of the American Heart Association, the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines, and recent prospective studies on surgical site infection. The objective of this advisory statement is to provide an update on the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery for the prevention of infective endocarditis, hematogenous total joint infection, and surgical site infection.

- **Methods**: A literature review was performed, expert consensus was obtained, and updated recommendations were created. These are consistent with the most authoritative guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

- **Results**: For patients with high-risk cardiac conditions and a defined group of patients with prosthetic joints at high risk for hematogenous total joint infection, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended when the surgical site is infected or when the procedure involves a breach of the oral mucosa. For the prevention of surgical site infections, antibiotics may be indicated for procedures on the lower extremities or groin, wedge excisions of the lip and ear, skin flaps on the nose, skin grafts, and for patients with extensive inflammatory skin disease.

- **Limitations**: These recommendations are not based on multiple, large-scale, prospective trials.

- **Conclusions**: There is a strong shift away from administration of prophylactic antibiotics for certain surgical procedures and conditions.
