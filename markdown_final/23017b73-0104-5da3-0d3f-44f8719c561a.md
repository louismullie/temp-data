## Question

Hyperghosteronemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "hyperghosteronemia". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this term exists in the provided literature or if it reflects a misspelling. Then, I should verify the closest clinically relevant entities that could be intended, such as hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or hyperaldosteronism. Next, I will review the evidence base for each candidate and outline diagnostic and management implications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-aware recommendation and explicitly state uncertainties and next steps if the intended term remains unclear.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. I cannot find "hyperghosteronemia" in the supplied references, which makes me suspect a typographical error or a misremembered term; wait, let me verify the most plausible alternatives that could be intended: hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose), hypertriglyceridemia (elevated triglycerides), and hyperaldosteronism (excess aldosterone), as these are the closest-sounding, clinically relevant entities represented in the corpus.

> I will now examine hyperglycemia because it is extensively covered and often confused in spelling. Hyperglycemia spans chronic dysglycemia in diabetes and acute hyperglycemic crises; chronic hyperglycemia drives microvascular complications via multiple mechanisms, and acute crises include DKA and HHS with distinct diagnostic criteria and management pathways, including fluid resuscitation, insulin, and electrolyte replacement per ADA and SCCM guidance [^7ec7986e] [^97aa752f] [^6b37eeeb] [^638557ad].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also consider hypertriglyceridemia. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL and carries a risk of acute pancreatitis; management includes identifying secondary causes, dietary modification, omega-3s, and fibrates when indicated, with attention to assay interference from glycerol in certain settings, which can artifactually elevate triglyceride measurements and mislead therapy [^87b1e1f6] [^4f8262ce] [^70ec0511].

> But wait, what if the user meant hyperaldosteronism? Although not prominently featured in the provided references, hyperaldosteronism is a recognized endocrine cause of hypertension and hypokalemia; if that was the intended term, I should confirm that the user is asking about screening, subtype differentiation, and targeted therapy, noting that the supplied corpus does not provide direct guidance here and that external endocrine sources would be needed for a complete answer [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while I keep verifying the intended term. If the question is about hyperglycemia, I would confirm diagnosis with ADA plasma glucose or A1C criteria, screen for DKA/HHS when appropriate, and manage per standards including fluids, insulin, and electrolytes, with inpatient protocols for persistent glucose ≥ 180 mg/dL in critically ill patients and structured education to prevent recurrence [^6a64d0e6] [^97aa752f] [^638557ad] [^1e1c9b48]. If the question is about hypertriglyceridemia, I would assess severity, search for secondary causes, implement lifestyle and pharmacologic strategies to prevent pancreatitis, and double-check for pseudohypertriglyceridemia from glycerol interference when labs and phenotype diverge [^87b1e1f6] [^4f8262ce] [^70ec0511]. If the question is about hyperaldosteronism, I would pivot to endocrine references and outline screening, confirmatory testing, and targeted therapy, acknowledging the gap in the current corpus [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also flag a potential pitfall: I initially thought I saw a direct mention of "hyperghosteronemia" in one of the sodium-tonicity papers, but on rechecking, that was a misread; those articles address hyperglycemia's effects on serum sodium and tonicity, not an entity named "hyperghosteronemia", so I need to correct that assumption and keep the focus on the verified terms above [^f8542271] [^a3349bad].

> In summary, I need to ensure the intended term is clarified. Given the absence of "hyperghosteronemia" in the provided sources, the most likely intended topics are hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or hyperaldosteronism; I have outlined evidence-based diagnostics and management for the first two and acknowledged the need for external guidance if the third was intended, so please confirm which entity you meant so I can tailor the plan precisely [^6a64d0e6] [^97aa752f] [^87b1e1f6] [^4f8262ce].

I can't find a medical condition called "hyperghosteronemia". Did you mean **hyperglycemia** (high blood sugar) [^7ec7986e], **hypertriglyceridemia** (high triglycerides) [^9e5c0365], or **hyperaldosteronism** (excess aldosterone)? Please confirm the term so I can provide the right information and guidance. If you meant one of these, I can quickly summarize causes, diagnosis, and treatment based on current standards [^6a64d0e6] [^87b1e1f6] [^4f8262ce].

### Cardiometabolic risk in pseudohypertriglyceridemia resulting from hyperglycerolemia [^897d9d56]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hyperglycerolemia is a rare X-linked inborn error of metabolism whose prevalence is currently unknown. Whether extreme glycerol levels are associated with atherosclerosis is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in hyperglycerolemia.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis in a cohort of patients referred to a tertiary referral center for dyslipidemia between 2000 and 2011. We assessed plasma glycerol levels in all subjects exhibiting hypertriglyceridemia (defined as triglyceride levels > 200 mg/dL). Genetic testing was performed in patients with confirmed hyperglycerolemia.

Results

Over 314,268 lipid profiles, 11.8% had hypertriglyceridemia, of whom 13 patients had biological hyperglycerolemia. Genetic tests showed 7 previously undescribed variants of the X-linked glycerol kinase gene. None of the hyperglycerolemic patients presented carotid atherosclerosis at baseline. After a median 11.5 years follow-up, none of the hyperglycerolemic patients developed clinical ASCVD, although noninvasive coronary and carotid imaging revealed the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis for three of the hyperglycerolemic patients with concomitant classical cardiovascular (CV) risk factors together with an unhealthy trajectory in body weight.

Conclusions

Hyperglycerolemia per se is not associated with premature ASCVD. Its screening should be considered only in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia unresponsive to treatment. The confirmation of hyperglycerolemia can help the clinician reassure the patient concerning his CV risk, as no further assessment is required other than common CV risk factors monitoring, including body weight increase and insulin resistance that may appear over the life course.

### Glycerol kinase deficiency in adults: description of 4 novel cases, systematic review and development of a clinical diagnostic score [^556c6b9d]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hyperglycerolemia and glyceroluria, which could be misdiagnosed as a moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). We aimed to describe four novel cases of GKD, to complete a systematic review of all cases of isolated GKD published so far, and to develop a suspicion clinical diagnostic score for GKD.

Methods

We reported four cases with suspicion of GKD and compared their phenotype with 584 males with triglycerides (TG) > 300 mg/dL, selected as control group (HTG non-GKD). The GK gene was sequenced in all cases. Lipoprotein particle concentrations were measured in all cases with GKD. The systematic review involved a PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus databases search to identify anthropometric and biochemical characteristics of all described cases with GKD.

Results

The systematic review retrieved a total of 15 articles involving 39 subjects with GKD. GKD cases reported a history of high TG levels resistant to lipid-lowering therapy. Compared to GKD subjects (n = 43), HTG non-GKD subjects (n = 584) showed significantly higher BMI, total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and gamma-glutamyltransferase, significantly lower HDL cholesterol and TG, and higher prevalence of diabetes. The proposed diagnostic score was significantly higher in GKD than in HTG non-GKD subjects.

Conclusions

This is the first systematic review that compiles all GKD cases reported to date including 4 novel cases, and examine the differential GKD phenotype compared to other types of HTG. The proposed score would have a broad utility in clinical practice to avoid unwarranted lipid lowering treatment in GKD patients.

### Falsely elevated triglyceride and lipase levels due to hyperglycerolemia in a burn patient treated with topical silver sulfadiazine [^70ec0511]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pseudohypertriglyceridemia is an overestimation of serum triglyceride levels, potentially leading to an inaccurate diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia. This can result from hyperglycerolemia, which interferes with enzymatic measurement methods. Hyperglycerolemia may arise from drugs or genetic glycerol kinase defects. We present a case of a severely burned patient with very high triglyceride levels (up to 5696 mg/dL) that was resistant to lipid-lowering treatment, identified during the work up for pancreatitis associated with elevated lipase levels. Despite the very high triglyceride levels reported in the laboratory results, the standing plasma showed clear plasma, with no significant peak of pre-beta lipoprotein observed on serum lipoprotein electrophoresis. Serum apolipoprotein B levels were low, and urine triglyceride levels were high. This case confirms that very high serum glycerol levels caused the false elevations of triglyceride and lipase levels, resulting from hyperglycerolemia induced by the massive topical application of silver sulfadiazine cream (containing glycerine and glyceryl stearate) to the severely burned wound, which interfered with the laboratory assays. Triglyceride and lipase levels dramatically decreased after reducing the dose of silver sulfadiazine cream. No genetic defects related to glycerol kinase deficiency were identified.

### Is hyperglycemia a cardiovascular risk factor? [^0391d5f7]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetes show an increased vascular morbidity and mortality that reduces their life expectancy by ~5–15 years (depending on the age at diagnosis). There is convincing evidence from epidemiological and pathophysiological studies that hyperglycemia per se is largely responsible for the harmful effects of the disease. As recently shown by clinical trials, treatment of this condition may reduce cardiovascular events and mortality, and several therapies should be considered: initiating early and individualized treatment and avoiding hypoglycemia.

### Shifting the disease management paradigm from glucose: what are the cons? [^7121cc86]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Recent evidence from pathophysiology, extensive clinical experience, and a number of well-controlled prospective studies clearly prove that hyperglycemia is a key risk factor for diabetes-related complications and a driving force for deterioration of β-cell function and cardiovascular disease resulting in a significant reduction of life expectancy. Therefore, early intervention to keep the glucotriad and A1C in a near-normal range should remain a high priority to protect our patients, together with integrated treatment of comorbidities, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypercoagulation. Shifting to a better form of individualized disease management does not imply that diabetologists should not maintain confidence in their well-established treatment strategies based on sound evidence and good clinical practice.

### Glycerol kinase deficiency: evidence for complexity in a single gene disorder [^3a8a7cc3]. Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) occurs as part of an Xp21 contiguous gene syndrome or as isolated GKD. The isolated form can be either symptomatic with episodic metabolic and central nervous system (CNS) decompensation or asymptomatic with hyperglycerolemia and glyceroluria only. To better understand the pathogenesis of isolated GKD, we sought individuals with point mutations in the GK coding region and measured their GK enzyme activities. We identified six individuals with missense mutations: four (N288D, A305V, M428T, and Q438R) among males who were asymptomatic and two (D198G, R405Q) in individuals who were symptomatic. GK activity measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines or fibroblasts was similar for the symptomatic and the asymptomatic individuals. Mapping of the individuals' missense mutations to the three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli GK revealed that the symptomatic individuals' mutations are in the same region as a subset of the mutations among the asymptomatic individuals, adjacent to the active-site cleft. We conclude that, like many other disorders, GK genotype does not predict GKD phenotype. We hypothesize that the phenotype of an individual with GKD is a complex trait influenced by additional, independently inherited genes.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: major influences and treatment implications [^a6539fa1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Plasma glucose concentrations at various levels of extracellular glucose gain and different ratios of euglycemic intracellular/extracellular volume (/ratio).

Regardless of the status of extracellular volume, as [Glu] S rises, the value Δ[Glu] S becomes progressively lower than the value [Glu] A because extracellular volume increases progressively as [Glu] S rises in a closed system. However, the same [Glu] A produces comparable Δ[Glu] S values at different states of extracellular volume even in extreme hyperglycemia. For example, if baseline [Na] S and [Glu] S values are 140 and 5.6 mmol/L, respectively, and [Glu] A is 112 mmol/L (2016 mg/dL), Δ[Glu] S by formula (4) will be 92.1 mmol/L (1659 mg/dL) in euvolemia (α 1 = 1.50), 87.2 mmol/L (1567 mg/dL) in severe hypovolemia (α 1 = 3.00), and 95.4 mmol/L (1717 mg/dL) in severe hypervolemia (α 1 = 1.00). Figure 2 shows the ratio Δ[Na] S /Δ[Glu] S for widely varying values of the volume ratio α 1 and [Glu] A.

### Is hyperglycemia a cardiovascular risk factor? [^9c8ae3ac]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We conclude that hyperglycemia is still a key cardiovascular risk factor for patients with type 2 diabetes, and treatment of hyperglycemia to near-normal levels might reduce cardiovascular events and mortality of these patients if we consider several aspects: 1) an early initiation of treatment seems to be necessary, 2) hypoglycemia should be avoided, and 3) an individualized therapeutic regimen should be developed, taking into account concomitant diseases and the individual risk profile.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: major influences and treatment implications [^70fe6a88]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Change in serum concentrations of sodium over glucose (Δ[Na] S /Δ[Glu] S), in mmol/L per mmol/L, at different extracellular glucose gains and ratios of euglycemic intracellular/extracellular volume (ICFV/ECFV ratios) during development of hyperglycemia. ΔNa/ΔGlucose indicates Δ[Na] S /Δ[Glu] S.

The numerical values of the ratio Δ[Na] S /Δ[Glu] S calculated by formula (3) (Table 1) decrease progressively at progressively lower values of the volume ratio α 1 (ie, at progressively higher gains in extracellular volume) 30 and at progressively higher values of [Glu] A (progressive degree of hyperglycemia). 28, 29, 30, 31 The numerical values of the ratio Δ[Na] S /Δ[Glu] S decrease progressively in progressive hyperglycemia because of the progressive decrease in the volume ratio α. 31 Values of the ratio Δ[Na] S /Δ[Glu] S numerically < 1.6 mmol/L per 5.6 mmol/L result in higher values of hyperglycemic [Na] S and serum tonicity than the values computed from the Katz formula. 25

Figure 3 shows changes in [Na] S for widely varying values of the volume ratio α 1 and [Glu] A. The values of hyperglycemic [Na] S computed by formula (4) differ substantially from the values computed by formula (2) (Table 1) in states of extreme extracellular volume excess or deficit. For example, if baseline [Na] S and [Glu] S values are 140 and 5.6 mmol/L, respectively, and [Glu] A is 112 mmol/L (2016 mg/dL), [Na] S at hyperglycemia will be 113.7 mmol/L by the Katz formula (formula (1) in Table 1) and 116.3 mmol/L by formula (3) (Table 1) in euvolemia (α 1 = 1.5), 115.1 mmol/L by formula (1) and 110.7 mmol/L by formula (3) in severe hypovolemia (α 1 = 3.0), and 112.8 mmol/L by formula (1) and 120.2 mmol/L by formula (3) in severe hypervolemia (α 1 = 1.0).

### The endothelial glycocalyx: a review of the vascular barrier [^f92c2d8e]. Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

The endothelial glycocalyx is an important part of the vascular barrier. The glycocalyx is intimately linked to the homoeostatic functions of the endothelium. Damage to the glycocalyx precedes vascular pathology. In the first part of this paper, we have reviewed the structure, physiology and pathology of the endothelial glycocalyx, based on a literature search of the past five years. In the second part, we have systematically reviewed interventions to protect or repair the glycocalyx. Glycocalyx damage can be caused by hypervolaemia and hyperglycaemia and can be prevented by maintaining a physiological concentration of plasma protein, particularly albumin. Other interventions have been investigated in animal models: these require clinical research before their introduction into medical practice.

### Vascular complications and changes in body mass index in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with abdominal obesity [^ae185f48]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to clarify the clinical features of type 2 diabetic patients with abdominal obesity. In the present study, we demonstrated the following differences between the abdominal obesity (+) group and the abdominal obesity (−) group; 1) Hypertension and dyslipidemia were significantly more prevalent in type 2 diabetic patients with abdominal obesity. 2) Cardiovascular diseases were significantly more in patients with abdominal obesity. 3) There were no significant differences in the prevalence of diabetic microangiopathies (diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy) between the two groups. 4) In the abdominal obesity (+) group, the mean BMI was < 25 kg/m 2 at 20 years of age (non-obese), but reached maximum to more than 30 kg/m 2 in the course. 5) Substantial portion of the type 2 diabetic patients (52% in males and 43% in females) were not obese at 20 year-old (BMI < 25 kg/m 2), but developed abdominal obesity by the time of admission.

Abdominal obesity and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

Visceral fat accumulation is accompanied by lifestyle changes, such as disturbance of eating habits, physical inactivity and sleep disorders. The hypertrophied adipocytes in intra-abdominal visceral fat exhibit hyperlipolytic activity, which is resistant to the antilipolytic effect of insulin. The resulting hyper-free-fatty-acidemia and hyperglycerolemia in the portal vein increase the production of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins and glucose in the liver, leading to dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes. Adipose tissue is not only an energy-storage organ, but it produces and secretes a variety of biologically active molecules known as adipocytokines, such as adiponectin, PAI-1 and TNF-α. Dysregulation of adipocytokines caused by visceral fat accumulation is regarded as one of the major pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerosis associated with the metabolic syndrome. Our group has demonstrated that some of anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, and anti-dyslidemic agents had potential to target obesity and hypoadiponectinemia.

### Postprandial hyperglycemia and glycemic variability: should we care? [^ab780295]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS: SHOULD WE CARE?

The concept of postprandial hyperglycemia as well as high glucose variability as important independent risk determinants of vascular and especially CV complications in subjects with IGT or type 2 diabetes is highly intriguing. It is best supported by impressive pathophysiological studies, also in the human situation. The epidemiological evidence that is more or less confined to postprandial hyperglycemia and postload glycemia is likewise rather compelling, although certainly not fully conclusive. The biggest gap still is the missing evidence as derived from randomized prospective intervention studies targeting postprandial hyperglycemia and seeking to reduce hard CV end points. In fact, there has been some stark disappointment recently in this context. As this evidence by intervention is, however, key for the ultimate approval of a treatment concept that it is mandatory to care for postprandial hyperglycemia and glucose variability beyond achieving appropriate glycemic control as assessed by HbA 1c, the current net balance of attained evidence is not favorable that we should care. The absence of a uniformly accepted standard of how to estimate postprandial hyperglycemia and glucose variability adds a further challenge to this whole debate.

### Basic approach to managing hyperglycemia for the nonendocrinologist [^3f868b0e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is growing rapidly worldwide. Reducing the complications of diabetes requires aggressive management of multiple risk factors, including elevated blood pressure, abnormal plasma lipid levels, and elevated plasma glucose. Fortunately, numerous agents are available to control these risk factors. This review discusses the therapeutic options in managing hyperglycemia, including lifestyle, oral agents, and insulin.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^ffa0c91c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is an underrecognized diabetic emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Many features of HHS overlap with those of diabetic ketoacidosis but key differentiators for HHS are serum osmolality greater than 320 mOsm/kg, lack of metabolic acidosis, and minimal to no presence of ketones. HHS is often triggered by an underlying illness-most commonly infection but may also be triggered by stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and other acute illnesses. Treatment guidelines recommend aggressive volume-repletion of osmotic losses in addition to insulin therapy, plus treatment of the underlying cause.

Stage 4: Normalization of Serum Glucose Concentration Without Further External Losses of Water or Solute

The only difference between stages 3 and 4 is loss of extracellular glucose so that [Glu] S is normalized (ie, [Glu] S4 = [Glu] S1): Δ[Na] S4 = [Na] S4 −[Na] S3 and Δ[Glu] S4 = [Glu] S4 −[Glu] S3. In this case, [Glu] S4 < [Glu] S3; therefore, Δ[Glu] S4 will be negative. Formulas (21), (22), (23), (24) through (25) in Table 5 express the changes in the amounts of solute and the final [Na] S.

The following hypothetical example illustrates the effects of hyperglycemic osmotic diuresis on body solute and volume status.

### Current diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemic emergencies [^25483cb0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: major influences and treatment implications [^79184557]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The ratio of intracellular/extracellular volume (ratio α) decreases during expansion of the extracellular volume due to either salt and water retention or osmotic transfer of intracellular water into the extracellular compartment in states of hypertonicity, and it increases during development of hypovolemia from external fluid losses or from transfer of extracellular water into the cells in states of hypotonicity. The contribution of the euglycemic volume ratio to the changes in tonicity, [Na] S, and [Glu] S induced by hyperglycemia is a consequence of the fact that total body water determines the change in tonicity secondary to gain in solute with extracellular distribution along with the amount of solute gained. 5 The increase in serum tonicity (ΔTon) after a gain in [Glu] S is expressed as the algebraic sum Δ[Na] S +Δ[Glu] S. Note that Δ[Na] S has a negative sign because [Na] S decreases during development of hyperglycemia. 24 ΔTon is determined by the amount of glucose gained divided by total body water, whereas Δ[Glu] S is equal to the amount of glucose gained divided by extracellular volume. 5 Therefore, the relationship between extracellular volume and total body water is a major determinant of the ratios ΔTon/Δ[Glu] S and Δ[Na] S /Δ[Glu] S. 29, 30, 31 The baseline volume ratio (α 1) is the most appropriate expression of the relationship between extracellular volume and total body water. 30 For a given degree of hyperglycemia, the rise in tonicity will be lower, and thus the decrease in [Na] S will be greater, when the baseline intracellular volume is very large in comparison to the extracellular volume (ie, in a volume‐depleted state in which the volume ratio α 1 has a large value), because the abundance of intracellular volume provides a relative abundance of water for osmotic exchanges. An abundance of extracellular volume in edematous states, characterized by low value of the ratio α 1, has effects exactly opposite those of a high value α 1 on the rise in tonicity and drop in [Na] S during development of hyperglycemia because the intracellular water available for osmotic exchanges is relatively sparse in this case.

Limitations of study

The limitations of this study include its retrospective design and determination of serum osmolality by calculation rather than laboratory measurement. We may have underestimated serum osmolality where osmotically active substances other than glucose and sodium are present in the serum as we calculated rather than measured the serum osmolality. Another limitation is that results of urine osmolality, urine specific gravity and urine electrolytes concentrations were not provided as these are not routinely done in our practice.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^7edd4f24]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) — field thresholds and testing emphasize glucose cutoffs and dehydration severity. If someone with diabetes is found to be hyperglycemic (plasma glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1), assess for HHS or DKA, and individuals with type 1 diabetes should be able to test for blood or urine ketones if they have unexplained hyperglycemia. In HHS, serum glucose level usually > 600 mg·dL−1 with extreme dehydration with a fluid deficit of 8 to 12 L.

### Molecular understanding of hyperglycemia's adverse effects for diabetic complications [^7ec7986e]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with diabetes. Chronic hyperglycemia is a major initiator of diabetic microvascular complications (eg, retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy). Glucose processing uses a variety of diverse metabolic pathways; hence, chronic hyperglycemia can induce multiple cellular changes leading to complications. Several predominant well-researched theories have been proposed to explain how hyperglycemia can produce the neural and vascular derangements that are hallmarks of diabetes. These theories can be separated into those that emphasize the toxic effects of hyperglycemia and its pathophysiological derivatives (such as oxidants, hyperosmolarity, or glycation products) on tissues directly and those that ascribe pathophysiological importance to a sustained alteration in cell signaling pathways (such as changes in phospholipids or kinases) induced by the products of glucose metabolism. This article summarizes these theories and the potential therapeutic interventions that may prevent diabetic complications in the presence of hyperglycemia, control of which is often difficult with current therapeutic options.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: major influences and treatment implications [^272dc37c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

A second factor that can affect the accuracy of the calculations in this report is that the volumes of distribution of sodium and glucose, although "extracellular," may not be equal. Sodium volume of distribution is higher than that of other markers of extracellular volume, including bromide, 68 which is often considered the gold standard for measuring extracellular volume. Sodium ions enter the intracellular compartment. Furthermore, sodium concentration in intracellular fluids is higher in patients with several severe illnesses compared with healthy participants. 69 In contrast, Hirota and coinvestigators computed an early (3 minutes after injection) volume of distribution of glucose that was equal only to the central extracellular volume. 20 However, the apparent volume of distribution of glucose should be higher than the extracellular volume in states characterized by insulin deficiency because insulin is not required for glucose to enter several organs with several liters of intracellular volume (eg, brain and liver). 70 The effect of differences in the apparent volumes of distribution of sodium and glucose on the osmotic consequences of development and correction of hyperglycemia, including the formulas predicting Δ[Na] S /Δ[Glu] S, is another area requiring further research.

### Pathogenesis of fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: implications for therapy [^82fbff04]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

The premise of all of these studies, as well as others that my colleagues and I have performed, is that an understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes enables the development of targeted therapies that are directed toward correcting specific metabolic defects in a given individual. I, as well as many other investigators, believe that such therapies are likely to be more effective and have a lower risk than would occur if everyone were treated the same regardless of the underlying cause of their hyperglycemia. While we do not yet have sufficient knowledge to truly individualize therapy, in my opinion this approach will be the norm in the not too distant future.

Serum Hypertonicity as an Exclusive Consequence of Development of Hyperglycemia

When solutes with extracellular distribution, other than sodium salts, do not exceed their normal concentration, the expression 2×[Na] S represents approximately 98% of serum tonicity. Solutes distributed in total body water, such as urea, ethanol, methanol, or propyl alcohol, increase osmolality but do not change this relationship between [Na] S and tonicity because they do not affect the volume of cells. In contrast, gain of solutes restricted in the extracellular compartment, other than sodium salts, causes hypertonicity resulting in osmotic fluid exit from the intracellular compartment and decrease in [Na] S. In this case, [Na] S alone does not indicate the state of tonicity. Hypertonicity may result from gain of exogenous solutes with extracellular distribution, for example, mannitol or low‐molecular‐weight radiographic contrast agents. However, hyperglycemia is the major clinical condition that creates hypertonicity challenges from gain of extracellular solutes other than sodium salts. 17

Glucose infused as a bolus is distributed in the extracellular compartment. 18, 19, 20 After glucose enters the cells, it is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water or compounds with negligible osmotic activity (eg, glycogen). Consequently, regarding internal solute balance, glucose is considered an extracellular solute that contributes to the tonicity of body fluids. 5, 6, 7, 21, 22 Gains in glucose raise the effective extracellular solute and result in hypertonicity. 21 Serum tonicity in patients with hyperglycemia is calculated as the sum of 2×[Na] S plus the serum glucose concentration ([Glu] S) in mmol/L. 21

Correction of hypertonicity constitutes one of the main aims and challenges of managing hyperglycemic crises. 22 Correction of hyperglycemia results in loss of effective extracellular solute 23 and osmotic transfer of extracellular water into the cells, leading to a rise in [Na] S. 24 Serum tonicity decreases during correction of hyperglycemia because the decrease in osmolarity secondary to the decrease in [Glu] S (Δ[Glu] S) is greater than the corresponding increase in osmolarity secondary to the rise in [Na] S (Δ[Na] S). 24 The magnitude of the change in tonicity due to the level of correction of hyperglycemia must be accurately predicted because hyperglycemia causes a second major increase in body fluid tonicity through osmotic diuresis that requires additional measures for its correction. 7 This second hyperglycemic influence on tonicity will be addressed later in this report.

### Advanced age, altered level of consciousness and a new diagnosis of diabetes are independently associated with hypernatreamia in hyperglycaemic crisis [^2d72c32b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of hospital records of admissions for hyperglycaemic crisis during the two year periods of 2008 and 2009. Readmissions of the same patient were included as the levels of serum sodium at presentation may vary in different admissions. The prevalence of hypernatreamia at presentation (as a percentage of total admissions for hyperglycaemic crisis) and its associated factors were determined. Ethical approval was obtained from the Walter Sisulu University.

Definitions

Hypernatreamia was defined as uncorrected serum sodium at presentation above 145 mmol/L, hypotension as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mm/Hg, hyperosmolality as calculated effective osmolality > 320 mosmols/Kg, hyperchloreamia as serum chloride > 104 mmol/L, elevated serum urea as serum urea > 7 mmol/L, leukocytosis as white blood count (WBC) > 10 × 10 6 /mm 3 and thrombocytopenia as platelet count < 150 × 10 6 /mm 3. Types of hyperglycaemic crisis as (a) non-hyperosmolar ketoacidosis: blood glucose > 13.9 mmol/L with serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L and calculated effective osmolality ≤ 320 mosmols/Kg, (b) hyperosmolar ketoacidosis: blood glucose > 13.9 mmol/L with serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L and calculated effective osmolality > 320 mosmols/Kg, (c) hyperosmolar non-ketotic state: blood glucose > 33.3 mmol/L with serum bicarbonate ≥ 18 mmol/L and calculated effective osmolality > 320 mosmols/Kg, and (d) hyperglycaemia: blood glucose > 13.9 mmol/L with serum bicarbonate ≥ 18 mmol/L and calculated effective osmolality ≤ 320 mosmols/Kg were as previously defined. Hyperglycaemia without ketoacidosis or hyperosmolality was considered to be in crisis where treatment with intravenous fluids and insulin infusion were considered necessary by the attending medical staff.

### Hyperglycemic crises in diabetes mellitus type 2 [^a30e674a]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic crises in type 2 diabetes are not rare and are becoming increasingly recognized as part of the spectrum of the presentation of previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and the decompensation of established diabetes mellitus. Contributing factors and associations are being elucidated but remain far from clear, particularly in DKA states. Medications commonly used in the treatment of many comorbid illnesses in patients with diabetes can themselves predispose to HHS. Endocrinopathies can contribute to insulin resistance and directly increase the glycemic load, leading to hyperglycemia. Medications such as the protease inhibitors may in the future lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the metabolic derangements seen in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Advanced age, altered level of consciousness and a new diagnosis of diabetes are independently associated with hypernatreamia in hyperglycaemic crisis [^7c96c945]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is limited literature on hypernatreamia in the setting of hyperglycaemic crisis. This is despite the fact that the presence of hypernatreamia may impact on the classification of hyperglycaemic crisis and its management particularly with regards to the nature of fluid therapy. We determined the prevalence of hypernatreamia and its associated factors at presentation for hyperglycaemic crisis.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of data for hyperglycaemic crisis admissions in Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, Mthatha, South Africa. The prevalence of hypernatreamia (uncorrected Serum Sodium at presentation > 145 mmol/L) was determined. Hyperosmolality was defined by calculated effective osmolality > 320 mosmols/Kg. Multivariate logistic regression was undertaken using variables that were statistically significant in univariate analysis to ascertain those that were independently associated (Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI)) with hypernatreamia.

Results

The prevalence of hypernatreamia in our admissions for hyperglycaemic crisis was 11.7% (n = 32/273 including 171 females and 102 males). All admissions with hypernatreamia met the criteria for hyperosmolality. Age ≥ 60 years (OR = 3.9 95% CI 1.3–12.3; P = 0.018), Altered level of consciousness (OR = 8.8 95% CI 2.3–32.8; P < 0.001) and a new diagnosis of diabetes (OR = 3.7 95%CI 1.2–11.5; P = 0.025) were independently associated with hypernatreamia.

Conclusion

The prevalence rate of hypernatreamia in hyperglycaemic admissions was high with all hypernatreamic admissions meeting the criteria for hyperosmolality. Advanced age, altered conscious level and a new diagnosis of diabetes were independently associated with hypernatreamia.

### Controlling postprandial hyperglycemia [^e3c2063f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

A growing body of evidence indicates that measurements of postprandial glucose levels, in combination with glycosylated hemoglobin, are a more accurate predictor of metabolic abnormality than fasting or preprandial glucose levels for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Early identification of elevated postprandial blood glucose levels is an important step in predicting the onset of microvascular and macrovascular complications that can progress to full symptomatic diabetes. This article summarizes the research conducted to date on the diagnostic import of postprandial glucose and the parameters established for judging the need for treatment. When individuals cannot reach target glucose levels through diet and exercise, medical treatment is necessary. The article reviews a range of treatment options, including insulin secretagogues, insulin sensitizers, antiabsorptive agents, weight reduction agents, and insulin and combination medical therapy.

### Hypoglycemia [^a8303c92]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Under physiologic conditions, glucose plays a critical role in providing energy to the central nervous system. A precipitous drop in the availability of this substrate results in dramatic symptoms that signal a medical emergency and warrant immediate therapy aimed at restoring plasma glucose to normal levels. A systemic approach to the differential diagnosis is useful in identifying the cause of hypoglycemia. Once established, a specific and/or definitive intervention that addresses that underlying problem can be implemented. In most cases, this systemic approach to diagnosis and therapy is rewarded with a good outcome for the patient.

Results

There were 273 admissions with serum sodium results. Four of these 273 admissions who only had blood glucose readings as 'high' on glucometer testing and no documented laboratory blood glucose values in their case records were excluded from any analysis involving type of hyperglycaemic crisis as the serum osmolality could not be calculated to allow for categorization into one of the 4 types of hyperglycaemic crisis. These 4 admissions were also excluded from any analysis involving corrected serum sodium. Ten individuals were admitted more than once with a range of 2–7 admissions. One hundred and seventy one (171) and 102 admissions were female and male related respectively. The proportions of admissions for the various types of hyperglycaemic crisis were: DKA (45%, n = 121/269); 36.1% (n = 97/269) for non-hypersomolar DKA and 8.9% (n = 24/269) for hyperosmolar DKA. Hyperosmolar non-ketotic state and hyperglycaemia accounted for 10.8% (n = 29/269) and 44.2% (n = 119/269) of all admissions respectively. The prevalence of uncorrected hypernatreamia was 11.7% (n = 32/273) while the prevalence was 30.1% when corrected for blood glucose concentration using the formula: corrected Serum Sodium in mmol/L = Serum Sodium in mmol/L + 1.6 (Plasma glucose in mmol/L - 5.5 mmol/L)/5.5. Table 1 shows that the majority of hypernatreamic admissions, had serum sodium levels in the range of 146–155 mmol/L with few admissions associated with a presenting uncorrected or corrected serum sodium above 165 mmol/L. Table 2 shows similar gender distribution among hypernatreamic and non-hypernatreamic admissions. Both groups had comparable mean ages but the proportion of admissions associated with age ≥ 60 years was more in the hypernatreamic than non-hypernatreamic admissions. The mean heart rate (111.6 ± 16.7 versus 100.7 ± 21 beats per minute, P = 0.03) was higher in the hypernatreamic than non-hypernatreamic admissions. Systolic blood pressure (111 ± 29.1 versus 128.9 ± 27.9 mm/Hg, P = 0.04) and diastolic blood pressure (65.1 ± 22.7 versus 78.8 ± 19.2 mm/Hg, P = 0.002) were both lower in the hypernatreamic than non-hypernatreamic admissions. Table 2 also shows that hypotension, altered level of consciousness and a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were all significantly associated with hypernatreamia in univariate analysis. Table 3 shows admissions with hypernatremia at presentation to be associated with hyperosmolality, hyperchloreamia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and elevated serum urea levels.

Nearly a quarter of older adults in the U.S. have type 2 diabetes, and this population is continuing to increase with the aging of the population. Older adults are at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes due to the combined effects of genetic, lifestyle, and aging influences. The usual defects contributing to type 2 diabetes are further complicated by the natural physiological changes associated with aging as well as the comorbidities and functional impairments that are often present in older people. This paper reviews the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes among older adults and the implications for hyperglycemia management in this population.

Other clinical manifestations in dyslipidemia

Although ASCVD prevention is of paramount importance, dyslipidemia is associated with other clinical issues for which preventive therapies are required. The most clinically relevant is the causal relationship between severe HTG (ie, TG > 10 mmol/L or > 885 mg/dL) and the development of acute pancreatitis. Although the underlying pathophysiology is not understood, it could be related to abnormal lipolysis by mislocalized exocrine pancreatic lipase, leading to pancreatic autodigestion and inflammation. Also, monogenic dyslipidemias can present with multisystem involvement, as discussed later.

Understanding hypernatremia is at times difficult for many clinicians. However, hypernatremia can often be deciphered easily with some basic understanding of water and sodium balance. Here, the basic pathophysiological abnormalities underlying the development of sodium disorders are reviewed, and case examples are given. Hypernatremia often arises in the hospital, especially in the intensive care units due to the combination of (1) not being able to drink water; (2) inability to concentrate the urine (most often from having kidney failure); (3) osmotic diuresis from having high serum urea concentrations, and (4) large urine or stool outputs.

### Familial hypercholesterolemia: screening, diagnosis, and treatment… [^63e87d99]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, is characterized by markedly increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that causes premature arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia typically presents with pathognomonic physical findings such as xanthomas or a corneal arcus. In contrast, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is not indicated by clinical findings and is typically not diagnosed until after an early-onset ASCVD event. 1 The worldwide prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is estimated to be 1 in 250 to 350, and ASCVD events can occur with this condition as young as 17 years in men and by 25 years of age in women. 2–4 Screening for and diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia in childhood can lead to treatment with lifestyle changes and medication, reducing the serious vascular effects of this dyslipidemia.

8 NICE advocates reviewing medical records to identify families with members older than 16 years who have LDL cholesterol greater than 190 mg per dL and a family history of ASCVD clinical events in men younger than 55 years and women younger than 65 years. These family members are then screened for dyslipidemia and genetically tested for familial hypercholesterolemia if the screening shows adults with LDL cholesterol greater than 190 mg per dL or children with LDL cholesterol greater than 155 mg per dL. After patients with familial hypercholesterolemia are identified, family physicians should provide lifestyle guidance to optimize blood pressure, weight, diet, physical activity, and tobacco cessation. Unless the physician has expertise with pharmacologic management of children and adults with familial hypercholesterolemia, referral to a cardiologist or lipidologist specializing in prevention is prudent. Other agents in phase 3 trials may soon be used in familial hypercholesterolemia management. 10 Family physicians have an opportunity to identify and care for patients at high risk of ASCVD due to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia before the onset of cardiovascular clinical events. The proven benefit of LDL cholesterol reduction in the primary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients supports identification and treatment of all patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Early metabolic markers of the development of dysglycemia and type 2 diabetes and their physiological significance [^5fb96281]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

With T2D prevalence continuing to increase worldwide, there is interest in identifying high-risk patients with more sensitivity than currently feasible. Because IR is a risk factor for IGT and T2D, we tested whether newly identified markers of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function could predict deterioration of glucose tolerance. We found α-HB and L-GPC were related to IR in an opposite manner — the former positive, the latter negative — in the RISC and Botnia cohorts, independently of known determinants of insulin sensitivity and of one another. Fasting concentrations of α-HB and L-GPC measured at baseline predicted worsening GT independently of classical predictors and with similar power as the 2-h plasma glucose level. Furthermore, changes in α-HB and L-GPC over time tracked with their ability to predict development of dysglycemia in the RISC cohort: at follow-up, α-HB had risen and L-GPC had fallen in subjects who progressed to dysglycemia compared with stable NGT subjects.

9. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users (23). Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance (62). Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents (23,63). However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose (64). Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS, 1a. and 1d.), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.

10. Elevated Blood Pressure

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives (65) and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users (66) and with continued use (65). Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (18) and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestogens.

Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases or renal disease (67) should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely, and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives (66), and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever and never users (65,67,68).

11. Headache

The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.

12. Bleeding Irregularities

Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Non-hormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^9e5c0365]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertriglyceridemia:

- **Definition**: Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, which is associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease.
- **Pathophysiology**: Underlying pathophysiology occurs through abnormalities in hepatic VLDL production, and intestinal chylomicron synthesis; dysfunctional LPL-mediated lipolysis or impaired remnant clearance. Primary etiology includes genetic mutations (LPL, APOC3, APOA5 genes), while secondary etiologies may consist of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, alcohol use, renal disease, pregnancy, and MASLD.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the US is estimated at 29% in men and 21% in women.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, lipemia retinalis, tuberous xanthoma, palmar crease xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, focal neurologic symptoms (irritability), and recurrent epigastric pain with an increased risk of pancreatitis seen mostly with both familial chylomicronemia and primary mixed hyperlipidemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, T2DM, and acute pancreatitis with a reduction in health-related QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypertriglyceridemia with high (150–500 mg/dL) and very high levels (> 500 mg/dL) is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality with hazard ratio of 1.49 (95% CI 1.36–1.63, p < 0.001) and 3.08 (95% CI 1.46–6.50, p < 0.01), respectively.

### Is early menopause a different entity from premature ovarian insufficiency? [^23bf6975]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI, defined as age at menopause < 40 years) affects 1%–3% of postmenopausal women. It is positively associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, fractures, cognitive impairment, and depression. Early menopause (EM, defined as age at menopause < 45 years) is also associated with these adverse health consequences, in most cases to the same degree as in POI. Therefore, a unifying term for EM and POI, such as 'premature menopause', may be proposed, using the age threshold of < 45 years. This could provide broader coverage of these women, substantiating the need for prompt administration of menopausal hormone therapy (in this case, 'hormone replacement therapy'). However, the benefits of this approach, which precludes a higher oestrogen dose up to the normal age of menopause, need to be proven in well‐designed randomized controlled trials.
