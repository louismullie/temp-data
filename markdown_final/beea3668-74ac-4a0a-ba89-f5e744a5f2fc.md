## Question

Treatment for salicylates toxicity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for salicylate toxicity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and airway/ventilation strategy. Then, I should verify gastrointestinal decontamination indications and timing. Next, I will review acid-base correction and urine alkalinization. After that, I need to check serial salicylate level monitoring and interpretation, including delayed peaks. Then, I will examine indications and logistics for extracorporeal treatment. I should also consider special populations and formulations, including methyl salicylate and topical exposures. Finally, I will integrate supportive care, complications, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure I double-check thresholds and correct any inconsistencies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status, with a strict rule to avoid suppressing the patient's respiratory drive because hyperventilation is compensatory for metabolic acidosis. I should not intubate solely for tachypnea unless there is impending respiratory failure, and if I must intubate, I need to match the patient's minute ventilation to avoid worsening acidemia and salicylate distribution into the CNS, which can precipitate collapse [^114QkYyJ].

> Wait, let me verify the acid-base pattern I expect: early respiratory alkalosis from direct stimulation of the respiratory center transitions to mixed respiratory alkalosis with metabolic acidosis as salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. I should obtain serial ABGs and electrolytes, correct hypokalemia to enable alkalinization, and treat hyperthermia aggressively with external cooling and IV fluids because fever worsens acidosis and CNS toxicity [^114WN3NY].

> I need to check gastrointestinal decontamination next: activated charcoal is indicated for potentially toxic ingestions if the airway is protected and there are no contraindications, ideally within 1 hour, but I should not delay transport to give charcoal. For enteric-coated or massive ingestions, multi-dose charcoal may be reasonable given erratic absorption, and I should avoid gastric emptying/emesis outside of specific protocols because aspiration risk outweighs benefit [^116reim9] [^113hPVyB].

> Hold on, I should verify the cornerstone therapy: urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate to target urine pH ≥ 7.5–8.0, which increases renal clearance of salicylate from less than 5% to more than 80% as urinary pH rises above 6.5. I will start with a 1–2 mEq/kg IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion, correct potassium first, and monitor for fluid overload and alkalemia complications [^115LVftT].

> Next, I should review serial salicylate level monitoring and kinetics: after acute ingestion, levels often peak by 1–2 hours, but delayed or erratic absorption can occur, especially with enteric-coated or massive ingestions. I will obtain levels every 2–4 hours until peak is documented and then every 4 hours until levels decline with a 4-hour half-life, remembering that an initially undetectable level does not exclude toxicity and that chronic toxicity correlates poorly with levels [^113cJoPi] [^117FSDnL] [^116EGLku].

> I will now examine indications for extracorporeal treatment: EXTRIP recommends intermittent hemodialysis for severe salicylate poisoning, including altered mental status, ARDS requiring oxygen, or failure of standard therapy regardless of level. Absolute level thresholds are > 7.2 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for all and > 6.5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) for impaired renal function, with lower thresholds considered for severe acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20). IHD is preferred, CRRT is an alternative if IHD is unavailable, and cessation is reasonable when clinical improvement occurs and salicylate is < 1.4 mmol/L (19 mg/dL) or after at least 4–6 hours of treatment if levels are unavailable [^116iNHog] [^115Bo2mc] [^116Sof1v].

> But wait, what if the patient is intubated and unstable? I should double-check survival data: in intubated patients with salicylate levels > 50 mg/dL, survival is markedly improved with timely hemodialysis, with mortality rising steeply without dialysis as levels increase. This reinforces a low threshold to involve nephrology early when severe features are present [^113n7ba3].

> Let me consider special populations and formulations: methyl salicylate is highly toxic, with 1 mL ≈ 1.4 g of salicylate, so even small ingestions can be lethal. I should treat topical salicylate toxicity similarly with alkalinization and dialysis when indicated, and in pediatrics, the 150 mg/kg referral threshold may be too high, as moderate effects can occur at lower doses, so I should use clinical judgment and err on the side of evaluation [^113rwTaq] [^1179xsFp] [^113si5nb].

> I need to ensure supportive care is comprehensive: correct volume status with isotonic fluids, treat hypoglycemia with dextrose, manage seizures with benzodiazepines, and avoid acetazolamide because it can worsen acidosis despite increasing urine flow. I should also anticipate and monitor for complications including noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, coagulopathy, and renal failure, adjusting management accordingly [^114WN3NY] [^112DKEsY].

> Hold on, I should verify the decision algorithm to keep this actionable: if there is altered mental status, ARDS needing oxygen, refractory acidemia, or failure of standard therapy, proceed to hemodialysis. If the salicylate level exceeds 100 mg/dL (or 90 mg/dL with renal impairment), proceed to hemodialysis. Otherwise, continue aggressive supportive care with alkalinization and serial monitoring, recognizing that clinical status trumps a single level, especially in chronic toxicity [^116iNHog] [^116EGLku].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the EXTRIP threshold for severe acidemia was pH ≤ 7.2 across the board, but I should confirm the grading. EXTRIP assigns a 2D recommendation to pH ≤ 7.20 in the absence of other indications, so I should frame this as a strong suggestion rather than an absolute mandate, integrating it with the clinical picture and trajectory [^116iNHog].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed prevention of rebound: after stopping urine alkalinization, a small proportion of patients may experience a modest salicylate rebound, but routine repeat levels are not required unless symptoms recur. If tinnitus, vomiting, or confusion return, I should recheck the level and resume alkalinization or escalate to dialysis as indicated [^114tDRmC].

Salicylate toxicity management centers on **early recognition** [^113MawgG], **serial salicylate levels** [^113cJoPi], and **alkalinization** [^112eknoZ] to reduce CNS penetration and enhance renal elimination. Activated charcoal is first-line if within 1 hour of ingestion [^114QkYyJ]; **avoid intubation** unless absolutely necessary, as it can worsen acidosis and CNS toxicity [^114QkYyJ]. Hemodialysis is indicated for severe cases — altered mental status, refractory acidosis, or salicylate > 100 mg/dL — and is the most effective removal method [^116iNHog] [^115Bo2mc]. Supportive care includes aggressive IV fluids, correction of electrolytes, and glucose for hypoglycemia [^113Uvffm]. Chronic toxicity requires lower thresholds for intervention due to higher tissue burden [^116EGLku].

---

## Clinical presentation and severity grading

Salicylate toxicity presents with a characteristic progression of symptoms, correlating with plasma salicylate concentrations [^113MawgG]:

| **Severity** | **Plasma salicylate concentration (mg/l)** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 300–500 | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Tinnitus <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Lethargy |
| Moderate | 500–750 | - Tachypnea <br/> - Hyperpnea <br/> - Hyperpyrexia <br/> - Sweating <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Confusion |
| Severe | > 750 | - Hallucinations <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Cerebral edema <br/> - Renal failure <br/> - Cardiovascular collapse <br/> - Coma |

---

Chronic toxicity may present with **confusion, hyperventilation, and neurologic symptoms** even at lower plasma concentrations due to tissue accumulation [^115TkSEY].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Determine dose, time of ingestion, formulation (immediate-release vs. enteric-coated), and co-ingestants [^116reim9].
- **Laboratory tests**: Serial salicylate levels every 2–4 hours until peak and decline are confirmed; arterial blood gases (ABGs) to assess acid-base status; electrolytes, renal function, glucose, and coagulation profile [^114WN3NY].
- **Imaging**: Chest radiograph if respiratory symptoms present to assess for pulmonary edema [^1169fqrG].

---

## General supportive care

Supportive care is foundational and includes:

- **Airway and breathing**: Maintain spontaneous ventilation whenever possible; avoid intubation unless absolutely necessary due to risk of worsening acidosis and CNS toxicity [^114QkYyJ].
- **Circulation**: Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluids to correct dehydration and hypotension [^113Uvffm].
- **Electrolyte and glucose management**: Correct electrolyte disturbances; administer glucose for hypoglycemia or CNS glucose utilization deficits [^115tyZb6].

---

## Gastrointestinal decontamination

Activated charcoal is **first-line** if administered within 1 hour of ingestion and the airway is protected; it is effective in reducing absorption. Gastric lavage is rarely indicated and should be reserved for life-threatening ingestions within 1 hour; whole-bowel irrigation may be considered for massive ingestions or enteric-coated formulations.

---

## Alkalinization therapy

Alkalinization is a cornerstone of management, reducing salicylate CNS penetration and enhancing renal elimination [^115LVftT]. Sodium bicarbonate is given as a **1–2 mEq/kg IV bolus**, followed by a continuous infusion to maintain serum alkalinization (pH 7.5–8.0) and urinary alkalinization (urine pH ≥ 7.5). Potassium supplementation is often required to replace losses and maintain alkalinization.

---

## Indications for extracorporeal treatment (hemodialysis)

Hemodialysis is the most effective method for rapid salicylate removal and is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Severe toxicity**: Altered mental status, refractory acidosis, renal failure, or salicylate concentration > 100 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) [^115Bo2mc].
- **Failure of standard therapy**: Persistent or worsening clinical status despite aggressive supportive care and alkalinization [^116iNHog].
- **Chronic toxicity**: Lower thresholds for dialysis due to higher tissue burden and risk of complications [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic salicylate toxicity**: Lower thresholds for intervention due to higher tissue burden and risk of complications [^116EGLku].
- **Pediatric patients**: Lower thresholds for referral and intervention; careful monitoring for Reye syndrome risk [^113si5nb].
- **Methyl salicylate ingestion**: Highly toxic; small ingestions can be fatal, necessitating aggressive management and early dialysis [^113rwTaq].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous monitoring includes **serial salicylate levels** every 2–4 hours until peak and decline are confirmed, along with frequent ABGs to track acid-base status. Continuous cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic monitoring is essential, and electrolytes and glucose should be checked frequently to guide correction.

---

## Potential complications and long-term sequelae

Complications include **metabolic acidosis, renal failure, pulmonary edema, coagulopathy, and neurologic impairment** [^112DKEsY]. Long-term sequelae may include **chronic renal impairment, persistent neurologic deficits, and hearing loss** [^114EK9C5].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **patient education** on safe use and storage of salicylate-containing medications, and **healthcare provider awareness** of the risks associated with chronic salicylate use and the potential for toxicity [^11177b74].

---

Salicylate toxicity management requires a structured approach: **early recognition, supportive care, GI decontamination, alkalinization, and hemodialysis** for severe cases. Close monitoring and prevention strategies are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Topical salicylic acid is often used in dermatologic conditions because of its keratolytic, bacteriostatic, fungicidal, and photoprotective properties. The bioavailability of salicylic acid differs depending on the vehicle used and pH of transcellular fluids. Although rare, salicylic acid toxicity (salicylism) can occur from topical application. Physicians should be mindful of the potential for salicylism or even death from topically applied salicylic acid.

Poisoning is a common problem in the United States. Acid-base disturbances, electrolyte derangements, or acute kidney injury result from severe poisoning from toxic alcohols, salicylates, metformin, and acetaminophen. Lithium is highly sensitive to small changes in kidney function. These poisonings and drug overdoses often require the nephrologist's expertise in diagnosis and treatment, which may require correction of acidosis, administration of selective enzyme inhibitors, or timely hemodialysis. The clinical and laboratory abnormalities associated with the poisonings and drug overdoses can develop rapidly and lead to severe cellular dysfunction and death. Understanding the pathophysiology of the disturbances and their clinical and laboratory findings is essential for the nephrologist to rapidly recognize the poisonings and establish an effective treatment plan. This installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology presents illustrative cases of individual poisonings and drug overdoses and summarizes up to date information on their prevalence, clinical and laboratory findings, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Salicylate poisoning… [^113ufMtB]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

An experimental study of salicylate poisoning in young dogs was used to investigate the relative efficacy of water diuresis, bicarbonate, and acetazolamide plus bicarbonate as therapy for salicylate poisoning. Blood salicylate levels fell at about the same rate in all three groups. Urinary salicylate excretion and pH increased rapidly following acetazolamide, with a three-hour delay after bicarbonate, and did not increase at all with water diuresis. The latter animals became progressively acidotic until death. Of nine animals in each group, two survived in group 1, six in group 2, eight in group 3. While the rapid action of acetazolamide favors its use in the treatment of salicylate poisoning, the profound acidosis present in most children precludes its immediate administration.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, contact a Poison Control Center immediately.

Signs and Symptoms: In acute overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis.

Treatment: Treatment consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing salicylate elimination, and correcting the acid-base disturbance. Gastric emptying or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage or emesis, administer activated charcoal, as a slurry, if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion.

Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. Monitor acid-base status with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.

In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Replace fluid intravenously and correct acidosis. Monitor plasma electrolytes and pH to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. Glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can reduce the body aspirin content. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

### Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole [^117XExwh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Aspirin:

Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.

The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from < 5% to > 80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine.

### Salicylate toxicity after undetectable serum salicylate concentration: a retrospective cohort study [^113cJoPi]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Salicylates are usually rapidly absorbed and quickly measurable in serum. An undetectable serum salicylate concentration ([ASA]) may occur early after ingestion and may be interpreted as evidence of non-exposure and not repeated. Although cases of delayed salicylate detection are reported rarely, the risk factors associated with this phenomenon are not known.

Research Question

What factors are associated with an early undetectable [ASA] in salicylate poisoning?

Methods

Records from a single regional poison center were searched from 2002 to 2016 for cases of salicylate toxicity treated with bicarbonate and [ASA] > 30mg/dL. Cases were excluded if initial [ASA] was obtained > 4h after presentation. Case information, serial [ASA], and outcomes were recorded and compared between groups.

Results

A total of 313 records met all criteria with 11 initially undetectable [ASA] (3.5%) and 302 detectable [ASA] (96.5%). Time of first [ASA] occurred sooner in the undetectable [ASA] group (89 vs. 137min, p = 0.011) while time to peak [ASA] was longer (640 vs. 321min, p < .001). The longest interval between ingestion and undetectable [ASA] was 225min. Peak [ASA] and reported mean ingested dose were similar in both groups (45 vs. 50mg/dL, p = NS; 19.7g vs. 32.9g, p = NS). Coingestion of agents that delay gastric emptying were similar in both groups (18% [2/11] vs. 25% [76/302], p = NS, chi-square). Hemodialysis was performed in 9% (1/11) of undetectable [ASA] patients and 5.6% (17/302) of detectable [ASA] patients (p = NS, chi-square). A single death occurred in the entire cohort in a patient with an initially detectable [ASA].

Discussion

In this series, a small but significant proportion (3.5%) of patients who developed [ASA] > 30mg/dL had an initially undetectable [ASA]. Those with an undetectable [ASA] were measured earlier after ingestion with a longer time to peak [ASA]. However, neither coingestion of agents prolonging gastric emptying nor reported dose ingested was different between groups. Formulation was infrequently recorded but one undetectable [ASA] did ingest a non-enteric coated product. Limitations include the small number of patients with undetectable [ASA], use of single poison center data and partial data on co-ingestants and aspirin formulation.

Conclusions

[ASA] may be undetectable early after an overdose and need for serial [ASA] in the evaluation of salicylate ingestion should be further explored. Additional research is needed to determine any causative factors and the optimal timing of [ASA] measurements.

### Salicylate toxicity from chronic bismuth subsalicylate use [^11177b74]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 79-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening confusion, falls and hearing impairment. An initial workup for infectious, metabolic and structural causes was unrevealing. However, further history discovered that he had been ingesting one to two bottles of Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) daily for gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms. On his second day of admission, the plasma salicylate concentration was 2.08 mmol/L (reference range 1.10–2.20 mmol/L), despite no sources of salicylate in hospital. He was diagnosed with chronic salicylate toxicity and Pepto-Bismol use was discontinued. The patient was treated supportively with isotonic intravenous fluids only and plasma salicylate concentration fell to less than 0.36mmol/L. Concurrently, all his symptoms resolved. This case highlights the potential adverse effects of over-the-counter medications. The diagnosis of chronic salicylate toxicity is challenging, specifically in the elderly and in undifferentiated presentations, as it can be missed if not suspected.

### Exploration on the potential efficacy and mechanism of methyl salicylate glycosides in the treatment of schizophrenia based on bioinformatics, molecular docking and dynamics simulation [^114AAce8]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

The multi-component and multi-target action characteristics of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ethnic Medicine (EM), as well as the advantage of low toxicity and side effects of them have been of great interest to the majority of researchers. Dianbaizhu is an EM herb that we have been researching for a long time, and it is commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in the southwest of our country. At the early stage, with the support of in the two National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) projects, our team conducted a series of studies, including screening of medicinal parts, chemical composition, enrichment of active parts, intestinal absorption characteristics in situ and in vitro, pharmacokinetics and exploration of anti-rheumatic mechanism. We determined its medicinal active part and isolated its main active ingredients (methyl salicylate glycoside components, MSGs), named as MSTG-A, MSTG-B and Gaultherin, respectively, all of which have been reported to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Their chemical structure differs only in the position and number of glucose and xylose substitutions, and they have been shown to interconvert in vivo and in vitro. Eventually, they are present in the animal in the form of their metabolites, salicylic acid or methyl salicylate. Both their prototype and metabolite share the same parent structural core, which is similar to aspirin. Based on the principle of similar structure and similar properties, together with the research strategy of anti-inflammatory immune regulation, it has been speculated that the three methyl salicylate glycosides may have good therapeutic activity in SCZ.

Do they have such activity and what is the underlying mechanism of this activity? According to the research purpose, we mainly adopted bioinformatic data mining, network pharmacology and molecular docking technology as the key technologies of this study. Accordingly, the mining of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SCZ patients and healthy controls based on GEO data, the screening and verification of SCZ key targets based on network pharmacology technology, and the exploration of the potential efficacy and mechanism of MSGs in the treatment of SCZ based on molecular docking and dynamics simulation technology were carried out respectively. This is the schematic procedure for this study (Fig. 1).

### Hyoscyamine sulfate, methenamine, methylene blue, phenyl salicylate, and sodium phosphate, monobasic, monohydrate (Urelle) [^117QGSz5]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS:

Cross sensitivity and/or related problems - patients intolerant of belladonna alkaloids or salicylates may be intolerant of this medication also. Delay in gastric emptying could complicate the management of gastric ulcers.

Urelle®contains methylene blue. Methylene blue should generally NOT be given to patients taking serotonergic drugs.

Drug Interactions:

Although the exact mechanism of this drug interaction is unknown, methylene blue inhibits the action of monoamine oxidase A — an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin in the brain. It is believed that when methylene blue is given to patients taking serotonergic psychiatric medications, high levels of serotonin can build up in the brain, causing toxicity. This is referred to as Serotonin Syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome include mental changes (confusion, hyperactivity, memory problems), muscle twitching, excessive sweating, shivering or shaking, diarrhea, trouble with coordination, and/or fever.

Additional Information for Healthcare Professionals:

Methylene blue can interact with serotonergic psychiatric medications and cause serious CNS toxicity.

In emergency situations requiring life-threatening or urgent treatment with methylene blue (as described above), the availability of alternative interventions should be considered and the benefit of methylene blue treatment should be weighed against the risk of serotonin toxicity. If methylene blue must be administered to a patient receiving a serotonergic drug, the serotonergic drug must be immediately stopped, and the patient should be closely monitored for emergent symptoms of CNS toxicity for two weeks (five weeks if fluoxetine [Prozac] was taken), or until 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue, whichever comes first.

In non-emergency situations when non-urgent treatment with methylene blue is contemplated and planned, the serotonergic psychiatric medication should be stopped to allow its activity in the brain to dissipate. Most serotonergic psychiatric drugs should be stopped at least 2 weeks in advance of methylene blue treatment. Fluoxetine (Prozac), which has a longer half-life compared to similar drugs, should be stopped at least 5 weeks in advance.

Treatment with the serotonergic psychiatric medication may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue.

Serotonergic psychiatric medications should not be started in a patient receiving methylene blue. Wait until 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue before starting the antidepressant.

Educate your patients to recognize the symptoms of serotonin toxicity or CNS toxicity and advise them to contact a healthcare professional immediately if they experience any symptoms while taking serotonergic psychiatric medications or methylene blue.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^11492gk5]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 grams.

Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

### Aspirin therapy for cancer: it is never too late [^1174EbJh]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Willow tree extracts have been recognised for their medicinal properties since 3500 BC. In the mid-late 1800s, a series of breakthrough investigations led to the isolation of salicin, synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid, and patent of aspirin. However, more than 100 years and 20 000+ scientific publications later, aspirin remains an interesting enigma, in that, the scope of biological activity and spectrum of clinical application for this agent remains incompletely defined. Aspirin's anti-carcinogenic potential was originally described in rodent models, with the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study credited with reporting the first human observational data in 1988. Since then, the use of aspirin has been inversely associated with multiple target organ malignancies. However, existing data are not entirely consistent, with unresolved questions regarding the dose, duration and follow-up period needed to fully appreciate aspirin's actual chemopreventive benefits. To address these questions, recently combined and analysed data from eight randomised clinical trials of aspirin (dose range 75–1200 mg per day) vs placebo, conducted in patient populations at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, wherein the scheduled duration of intervention was at least 4 years. Salient findings from the pooled analysis included a 21% reduction in overall risk for death due to cancer (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68–0.92; P = 0.003) among subjects assigned to the active vs placebo interventions. Notably, aspirin therapy for at least 5 years resulted in even greater risk reduction (30–40%), with persistent effects on cancer mortality extending out to 20 years of follow-up (HR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.72–0.88; P < 0.0001 for solid organ tumours). Stratification by dose did not appreciably influence the observed risk estimates. In response to this intriguing report, discussions regarding the routine aspirin use for the primary purpose of favourably affecting cancer risk have been re-invigorated. Aside some benefits in cancer mortality seem to be apparent within 4 years, suggesting provocatively that the humble aspirin could perhaps also stifle cancer growth. However, despite the ever-mounting efficacy data, residual concerns remain about the potential of aspirin-associated adverse events. This issue continues to impede recommendations for widespread cancer chemoprevention in generally healthy adults. Specifically as about 30% of the population may get cancer, there is a need for prevention. However, from estimates by, only 20% of the latter group will derive a chemopreventive benefit from aspirin. Furthermore, the serious risks of aspirin, usually GI bleeding, are currently contentious, ranging from 0.02 to 2% per year. This could mean that serious side effects from 10 years of aspirin chemoprevention would range from 0.2 to 20%. At the higher end, the benefits of chemoprevention would be nullified by the risks. The recent report fromis potentially paradigm-shifting, as it alludes to an improved risk benefit ratio for adjuvant aspirin therapy for early cancers This area has to date received relatively lesser attention compared with its chemopreventive potential. As discussed by the authors, new insights into the mechanisms of aspirin-mediated growth inhibition (such as altered endothelial cell tubule formation resulting in decreased angiogenesis) may afford unique advantages over other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or selective COX-2 inhibitors for treating malignant tumours. Other putative effects of COX-2 on apoptosis, invasion, and immunoregulation support targeting this enzyme in advanced, adjuvant, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy settings as well. Available observational data further suggest that aspirin use vs non-use is associated with improved survival following colorectal or breast cancer diagnosis. However, three small randomised, controlled trials of aspirin (dose range 1000–2400 mg per day) in combination with other anti-cancer therapies did not confirm the anticipated survival benefit. Similarly, results from the recently reported VICTOR Trial, which evaluated the effects of rofecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor) 20 mg per day vs placebo on overall survival among stages II and III colorectal cancer patients who had undergone potentially curative surgery and completed adjuvant chemotherapy (when indicated), also failed to demonstrate a statistically significant advantage from the active agent, although the intervention phase was terminated early (median exposure time of 7.4 months) due to concerns regarding increased cardiovascular toxicity.

### Coagulopathy and bleeding associated with salicylate toxicity [^112DKEsY]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Salicylate toxicity is a common cause of morbidity and hospitalization. Animal and human studies suggest that salicylates cause a dose-dependent inhibition of the activation of factors 2, 7, 9, and 10. However, limited reports of coagulopathy or major bleeding from salicylate toxicity exist. Methods: This is a retrospective study examining subjects from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2011 in whom at least one serum salicylate concentration was measured above 30mg/dL. Cases were patients with elevated salicylate concentration and coagulopathy (INR > 1.5). Major bleeding cases were those with elevated salicylate concentration who developed hemorrhagic death; or bleeding from an intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, pericardial, intramuscular site; or hemoglobin decrease of > 2g/dL, or transfusion of at least 2 units of packed RBCs during hospitalization. Results: Twelve percent of all cases of elevated salicylate concentration developed coagulopathy, 6% developed major bleeding, and 3% died. In a multivariate model, duration of elevated salicylate concentration and renal impairment were associated with coagulopathy and no variable was associated with major bleeding. Patients were more likely to develop major bleeding if they had coagulopathy, but not all cases of major bleeding had coagulopathy. Discussion: Coagulopathy and major bleeding during salicylate toxicity has been underrecognized. Renal impairment and duration of salicylate elevation contribute to the risk of coagulopathy, but no factors predict major bleeding. Patients with coagulopathy have a high risk of bleeding but some bleeding occurs without coagulopathy, suggesting that other factors, such as platelet dysfunction, may play a role. Conclusion: Coagulopathy and major bleeding develop in a clinically relevant percentage of cases of salicylate toxicity.

### Death due to acute salicylate intoxication despite dialysis [^115iKLNJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Salicylate poisoning is a common problem with appreciable morbidity and mortality. We present a case of a patient with a large aspirin ingestion who expired despite aggressive hemodialysis (HD).

Case Report

A 35-year-old man arrived at the Emergency Department 7.5 h after ingesting 400 tablets of 325-mg aspirin. He was afebrile, the respiratory rate (RR) was 30 breaths/min, heart rate (HR) 120 beats/min, blood pressure (BP) 125/76 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. His salicylate concentration was 89.6 mg/dL. His initial arterial blood gas: pH 7.48, pCO₂ 21 mm Hg, PaO₂ 97 mm Hg, and bicarbonate 15.8 mmol/L. His initial serum chemistry panel was normal. He received activated charcoal and intravenous hydration with sodium bicarbonate. Two hours after arrival, salicylate concentration was 91.6 mg/dL. The patient became agitated and HD was initiated; 22 h after presentation, repeat salicylate concentration was 88.4 mg/dL and his creatinine was 3.9 mg/dL. A second run of HD was performed. After this, his temperature had risen to 39.06°C (102.3°F), BP 122/64 mm Hg, HR 168 beats/min, RR 43 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 95% (2 L nasal cannula). His confusion increased, and he died 40 h after his ingestion.

Conclusion

HD is widely advocated in managing severe salicylate intoxications, however, no consensus exists for the duration and best mode of therapy. Patients with severe salicylate poisonings may require extended durations of HD to effectively mitigate toxicity. Additional study is warranted to determine optimal therapy in severe salicylate intoxications.

### Severe salicylate poisoning due to teaberry flavoring ingestion: a case report [^1135chJ3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are currently many commercial uses for methyl salicylate, including fragrances, flavoring, topical pain relief, and polymer restoration. Most recorded cases of human toxicity due to methyl salicylate are the result of topical or accidental exposures. However, this is a previously unreported case of an adult patient who intentionally ingested teaberry flavoring, causing life-threatening salicylism.

Case Report

A 22-year-old man presented to the emergency department with the chief symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Triage nursing noted the patient's vomit smelled strongly of wintergreen. Further history indicated the patient had ingested approximately 40 mL of teaberry oil while using it to make ice cream. The initial serum salicylate concentration was 111 mg/dL. The medical toxicology team was consulted, and the patient was given a singular dose of activated charcoal by mouth. He was also administered both an intravenous sodium bicarbonate bolus and sodium bicarbonate infusion. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and the nephrology service was consulted to initiate emergent hemodialysis. After the single hemodialysis treatment with concomitant serum and urine alkalization, the patient had progressive improvement of salicylate concentrations. He was discharged on hospital day 3 in normal condition. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should be aware of novel etiologies of life-threatening salicylate poisoning.

### Delayed salicylate toxicity in a 17-year-old girl with initially undetectable salicylate concentration 3.9 hours after ingestion [^112K5uNT]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 17-year-old girl with a 126-mg/kg nonenteric coated aspirin ingestion with nontoxic salicylate concentrations at 1.5 and 3.9 hours postingestion, who developed tinnitus and vomiting an estimated 8 hours postingestion, and who was subsequently found to have a toxic salicylate concentration at 22.7 hours postingestion. This case, as well as previous cases of delayed aspirin therapy, may prompt providers to consider educating patients and their care providers regarding the need to return for further testing if symptoms, such as vomiting or tinnitus, develop after an aspirin ingestion.

### Chronic salicylate intoxication in adults… [^115TkSEY]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Chronic overdosage with salicylates can produce a syndrome of chronic salicylate intoxication. The main features of this syndrome are confused, sometimes bizarre, behavior and hyperventilation. The measurement of serum salicylate and carbon dioxide provides reliable laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis and may prevent mistaking the condition for frank hysteria, diabetic coma, or other causes of organic delirium. Five patients are reported who suffered from various primary diseases but were hospitalized for complaints directly related to salicylate poisoning. In one patient, papilledema appeared to be the result of the salicylate intoxication. Greer HD, Ward HP, Corbin KB. Chronic Salicylate Intoxication in Adults. JAMA. 1965; 193: 555–558.

### Aspirin and cancer: has aspirin been overlooked as an adjuvant therapy? [^111Kt52Y]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Aspirin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase (Cox), and there is a significant body of epidemiological evidence demonstrating that regular aspirin use is associated with a decreased incidence of developing cancer. Interest focussed on selective Cox-2 inhibitors both as cancer prevention agents and as therapeutic agents in patients with proven malignancy until concerns were raised about their toxicity profile. Aspirin has several additional mechanisms of action that may contribute to its anti-cancer effect. It also influences cellular processes such as apoptosis and angiogenesis that are crucial for the development and growth of malignancies. Evidence suggests that these effects can occur through Cox-independent pathways questioning the rationale of focussing on Cox-2 inhibition alone as an anti-cancer strategy. Randomised studies with aspirin primarily designed to prevent cardiovascular disease have demonstrated a reduction in cancer deaths with long-term follow-up. Concerns about toxicity, particularly serious haemorrhage, have limited the use of aspirin as a cancer prevention agent, but recent epidemiological evidence demonstrating regular aspirin use after a diagnosis of cancer improves outcomes suggests that it may have a role in the adjuvant setting where the risk:benefit ratio will be different.

### Salicylate-containing rubefacients for acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^111DE1zu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rubefacients containing salicylates cause irritation of the skin and are believed to relieve various musculoskeletal pains. They are available on prescription, and are common components in over-the-counter remedies. This is an update of a review of rubefacients for acute and chronic pain, originally published in 2009, which found limited evidence for efficacy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topically applied salicylates in acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, from inception to 22 August 2014, together with the Oxford Pain Relief Database, two clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical trials of topical rubefacients containing salicylates to treat musculoskeletal pain in adults, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, and reporting outcomes at close to 7 (minimum 3, maximum 10) days for acute conditions and 14 (minimum 7) days or longer for chronic conditions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit or harm (NNT or NNH) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. We analysed acute and chronic conditions separately.

Main Results

New searches for this update identified one new study that satisfied our inclusion criteria, although it contributed information only for withdrawals. Six placebo- and one active-controlled studies (560 and 137 participants, respectively) in acute pain, and seven placebo- and three active-controlled studies (489 and 182 participants, respectively) in chronic pain were included in the review. All studies were potentially at risk of bias, and there were substantial differences between studies in terms of the participants (for example the level of baseline pain), the treatments (different salicylates combined with various other potentially active ingredients), and the methods (for example the outcomes reported). Not all of the studies contributed usable information for all of the outcomes sought. For the primary outcome of clinical success at seven days in acute conditions (mostly sprains, strains, and acute low back pain), the RR was 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.5) and the NNT was 3.2 (2.4 to 4.9) for salicylates compared with placebo, but this result was not robust (very low quality evidence). Using a random-effects model for analysis the RR was 2.7 (1.05 to 7.0). For the same outcome in chronic conditions (mostly osteoarthritis, bursitis, and chronic back pain), the RR was 1.6 (1.2 to 2.0) and the NNT was 6.2 (4.0 to 13) (very low quality evidence). This result was not substantially changed using a random-effects model for analysis. In both categories there were a number of factors might have influenced the results but sensitivity analysis was limited because of the small number of studies and participants. For both acute and chronic painful conditions any evidence of efficacy came from the older, smaller studies, while the larger, more recent studies showed no effect. Adverse events were more common with salicylate than with placebo but most of the events occurred in only two studies. There was no difference when these studies were removed from the analysis (very low quality evidence). Local adverse events (at the application site) were again more common with salicylate but were nearly all in one study (in which salicylate was combined with another irritant). There was no difference when this study was removed (very low quality evidence). There were insufficient data to draw conclusions against active controls.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence does not support the use of topical rubefacients containing salicylates for acute injuries or chronic conditions. They seem to be relatively well tolerated in the short-term, based on limited data. The amount and quality of the available data mean that uncertainty remains about the effects of salicylate-containing rubefacients.

### Position statement and practice guidelines on ototoxicity monitoring [^115h57VE]. AAA (2009). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) — salicylate-related ototoxicity is linked to anion transport and outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or salicylates inhibit anion translocation across cell membranes, prestin in OHCs facilitates electromotility via monovalent anion translocation such as Cl⁻, and salicylate can inhibit electromotility thereby adversely affecting the cochlear amplifier; despite salicylate treatment, human temporal bones reveal normal cochlear structures, consistent with reversibility of ototoxic effects of aspirin.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^114ybA8L]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor-associated skin fissures — prevention and treatment measures include wearing protective footwear or covering the fingertips to avoid friction to prevent fissures and aid healing, applying thick moisturizers or zinc oxide creams, and using bleach soaks to prevent infection with a dilution rate of one quarter cup of bleach to 3 gal of water; liquid glues like cyanoacrylate preparations (Superglue or Liquid Bandaid) can seal cracks, relieve pain, and allow healing, with propylene glycol 50% solution and salicylic acid 10% ointment as other recommendations. Steroid tape (Cordran tape) and hydrocolloid dressings are recommended for painful, erythematous areas; limited evidence supports silver nitrate or potassium permanganate foams and topical antibiotics, and oral antibiotics may be necessary if infection worsens despite topical treatment.

### Salsalate [^112dPAVC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Salsalate tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use Salsalate tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with Salsalate tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. Salsalate is indicated for relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and related rheumatic disorder.

Adults: The usual dosage is 3000 mg daily, given in divided doses as follows:

1) two doses of two 750 mg tablets; 2) two doses of three 500 mg tablets; or 3) three doses of two 500 mg tablets. Some patients, e.g., the elderly, may require a lower dosage to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations and to avoid the more common side effects such as auditory.

Alleviation of symptoms is gradual, and full benefit may not be evident for 3 to 4 days, when plasma salicylate levels have achieved steady-state. There is no evidence for development of tissue tolerance (tachyphylaxis), but salicylate therapy may induce increased activity of metabolizing liver enzymes, causing a greater rate of salicyluric acid production and excretion, with a resultant increase in dosage requirement for maintenance of therapeutic serum salicylate levels.

Children: Dosage recommendations and indications for salsalate use in children have not been established.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^113SZBPd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Salicylic acid — topical keratolytic use, combination practices, and precautions are detailed. Salicylic acid is a topical keratolytic agent used in psoriasis and may reduce keratinocyte-to-keratinocyte binding and reduce the pH of the stratum corneum, softening psoriatic plaques. While there are no placebo-controlled studies verifying the efficacy and safety of salicylic acid, it is often combined with topical corticosteroids or immunomodulators; however, combination agents containing both salicylic acid and topical corticosteroids are not currently available in the United States. Precautions include that topical salicylic acid should not be used with other oral salicylate drugs; systemic absorption, although rare, can occur especially when applied to more than 20% of the body surface or in patients with abnormal hepatic or renal function; and it decreases the efficacy of UVB phototherapy and therefore should not be applied before UVB phototherapy.

### The association of hemodialysis and survival in intubated salicylate-poisoned patients [^113n7ba3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Salicylate poisonings are common due to their multiple uses and wide availability. The variation of presenting symptoms contributes to inconsistent treatments in the emergency department. Patients with severe salicylate overdose require a high minute ventilation. Early in the course of an overdose, a patient will require hyperventilation. If they become too fatigued to compensate, mechanical ventilation may be needed. It can be impossible to recreate such a high minute ventilation with mechanical ventilation. This places patients at a high risk for decompensation and death. Hemodialysis is an effective elimination technique for salicylate overdose and should be considered early.

Methods

All salicylate cases reported to the Illinois Poison Center were reviewed from 2003–2014. All intubated patients with a salicylate level > 50mg/dl were included for analysis. Survival was compared to measured serum salicylate level and the administration of hemodialysis.

Results

56 Cases were identified with an overall survival rate of 73.2% in patients with a serum salicylate level > 50mg/dl. When patients did not receive hemodialysis, a peak salicylate level > 50mg/dl had a 56% survival rate and 0% survival when the level was > 80mg/dl. In the patients who received hemodialysis, a peak salicylate level > 50mg/dl had a 83.9% survival rate and 83.3% survival when the level was > 80mg/dl.

Conclusion

Survival was decreased in these patients if hemodialysis was not performed. Mortality increases with the measured serum salicylate level. Timely hemodialysis for intubated salicylate overdose patients decreases mortality.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole (aggrenox) [^114vnmng]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because
of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of AGGRENOX
is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose.
In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact
a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is
essential.

Based upon the known
hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling,
flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness and dizziness
may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be
observed.

Salicylate toxicity
may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication.
Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood
salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism),
including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations
approaching 200 µg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia
are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of
aspirin above 300 µg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are
associated with levels above 400 µg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin
in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at
30 g.

Treatment of overdose consists
primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination,
and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or
lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has
vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration
of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3
hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not
be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely
with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and
electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and
augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use
of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Administration of xanthine derivatives
(e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole
overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially
to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal.
In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening
intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose;
however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not
likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated
in infants and young children.

### Salicylic acid (salvax) [^115N7UYk]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

SALVAX is for external use only. It is not for ophthalmic, oral, anal or intravaginal use. Contact with eyes, lips, broken or inflamed skin, and all mucous membranes should be avoided. SALVAX should not be used by persons who have a known hypersensitivity to salicylic acid or any of the other listed ingredients.

Prolonged use over large areas, especially in children and those patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment could result in salicylism. Concomitant use of other drugs which may contribute to elevated serum salicylate levels should be avoided where the potential for toxicity is present. In children under 12 years of age and those patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the area to be treated should be limited and the patient monitored closely for signs of salicylate toxicity: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of hearing, tinnitus, lethargy, hyperpnoea, diarrhea, psychic disturbances. In the event of salicylic acid toxicity, the use of SALVAX should be discontinued. Fluids should be administered to promote urinary excretion. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate (oral or intravenous) should be instituted as appropriate.

Considering the potential risk of developing Reye's syndrome, salicylate products should not be administered to children or teenagers with varicella or influenza, unless directed by a physician.

### Modern intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) is an effective method of removing salicylate in chronic topical salicylate toxicity [^1179xsFp]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are limited data on modern intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) efficacy on salicylate elimination from topical poisoning.

Case Report

A 54-year-old male sought treatment for dyspnea but was then diagnosed with salicylate toxicity from topical application of Dencorub Extra Strength Heat Gel® for 1 week. Each tube contained 100 g with 26% methylsalicylate (26 g). Laboratory workup was remarkable for an elevated anion gap of 30 and salicylate concentration of 78.7 mg/dL [5.7 mmol/L (N < 0.4 mmol/L)]. Treatment with urinary alkalinization was followed by hemodialysis for 5 h. Extraction ratios were 0.44 with clearance rates of 78.5 mL/min. Salicylate concentrations fell rapidly following initiation of hemodialysis with no rebound observed.

Discussion

Modern high flux IHD is an effective method of removing salicylates in the treatment of chronic topical poisoning.

### Salicylic acid 10% (salicate) [^113xQEee]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology:

Salicylic acid has been shown to produce desquamation of the horny layer of skin while not affecting qualitative or quantitative changes in the structure of the viable epidermis1,2. The mechanism of action has been attributed to the dissolution of intercellular cement substances3. In a study of the percutaneous absorption of salicylic acid 6% in four patients with extensive active psoriasis, Taylor and Halprin4showed that peak serum salicylate levels never exceeded 5 mg/100 mL even though more than 60% of the applied salicylic acid was absorbed. Systemic toxic reactions are usually associated with higher serum levels (30 to 40 mg/100 ml). Peak serum levels occurred within 5 hours of the topical application under occlusion. The sites were occluded for 10 hours over the entire body surface below the neck. Since salicylates are distributed in the extracellular space, patients with a contracted extracellular space due to dehydration or diuretics have higher salicylate levels than those with common extracellular space. (See PRECAUTIONS).

The primary metabolites identified in the urine after topical administration are salicyluric acid (52%), salicylate glucuronides (42%), and free salicylic acid (6%). The urinary metabolites after percutaneous absorption differ from those after oral salicylate administration; those derived from percutaneous absorption contain more glucuronides and less salicyluric and salicylic acid. Almost 95% of a single dose of salicylate is excreted within 24 hours of its entrance into the extracellular space. Fifty to eighty percent of salicylate is protein bound to albumin. Salicylates compete with the binding of several drugs and can modify the action of these drugs. By similar competitive mechanisms, other drugs can influence salicylate serum levels. (See PRECAUTIONS).

### Salicylates and pandemic influenza mortality, 1918–1919 pharmacology, pathology, and historic evidence [^112Ymjq3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The high case-fatality rate — especially among young adults — during the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic is incompletely understood. Although late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia, early deaths exhibited extremely "wet", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs. The hypothesis presented herein is that aspirin contributed to the incidence and severity of viral pathology, bacterial infection, and death, because physicians of the day were unaware that the regimens (8.0–31.2 g per day) produce levels associated with hyperventilation and pulmonary edema in 33% and 3% of recipients, respectively. Recently, pulmonary edema was found at autopsy in 46% of 26 salicylate-intoxicated adults. Experimentally, salicylates increase lung fluid and protein levels and impair mucociliary clearance. In 1918, the US Surgeon General, the US Navy, and the Journal of the American Medical Association recommended use of aspirin just before the October death spike. If these recommendations were followed, and if pulmonary edema occurred in 3% of persons, a significant proportion of the deaths may be attributable to aspirin.

### Asprin and extended-release dipyridamole [^116Qniby]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.

Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.

Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^115LVftT]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin

Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 grams), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.

The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from < 5% to > 80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine.

### Aspirin therapy for cancer: it is never too late [^1149RhWb]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Given the current evidence base, where should additional resources be invested to decipher aspirin's true anti-cancer potential? As noted by, further investigation of the benefits and harms associated with aspirin therapy in high-risk subject cohorts (i.e. patients with newly diagnosed cancer or established premalignant conditions) may permit re-calibration of an 'acceptable' safety profile. Consideration of oncologic and non-oncologic endpoints, relating to efficacy and toxicity, in all large clinical trials also seems imperative. Ideally, these disparate endpoints could be accurately measured and appropriately weighted to more appropriately summarise the aspirin's total impact on personal and/or public health. Specific to the adjuvant therapy setting, broader use of molecular phenotyping to define tumours that are likely to be most susceptible to aspirin exposure (i.e. based on increased COX-2 expression) could improve the response rate. Finally, further attempts to clarify the genetic characteristics that differentiate aspirin responders from non-responders may also be of merit. Several of these issues will be directly assessed by ongoing prospective studies, such as the AspECT aspirin chemoprevention trial as well as the ChOPIN genetic trial. It may even be possible to predict who will get a response to aspirin, based upon their genome.

In summary, the case for aspirin therapy continues to get stronger. It may never be too late for aspirin adjuvant therapy, even if chemoprevention is not feasible. However, more well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed with adequate follow-up time before definitive clinical recommendations can be given.

### Risk of toxicity from pediatric topical salicylate ingestions [^111mxtFL]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suspected pediatric ingestions of greater than or equal to one teaspoon topical salicylate analgesic are recommended by poison control centers to be managed at healthcare facilities. This cutoff is applied for both liquid and non-liquid (cream, ointment, gel) formulations.

Methods

California poison control cases involving topical salicylate exposures in children less than 6-years-old who were evaluated at a health care facility between 2003 and 2018 were analyzed.

Results

Of 599 patient cases, the majority described no or minor symptoms, with gastrointestinal distress being the most common. Signs of salicylate toxicity (metabolic acidosis, tachypnea) occurred in six cases. Seven patients were hospitalized, six of whom were exposed to liquid preparations.

Discussion

In line with previous research, liquid salicylate preparations were more frequently associated with the signs of salicylate toxicity and hospitalization.

Conclusion

There was a low frequency of severe side effects and low hospitalization rates among those referred to a healthcare facility, especially for non-liquid topical salicylate ingestions.

### Extracorporeal treatment for salicylate poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^116iNHog]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Salicylate poisoning is a challenging clinical entity associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The indications for extracorporeal treatments such as hemodialysis are poorly defined. We present a systematic review of the literature along with evidence- and consensus-based recommendations on the use of extracorporeal treatment in salicylate poisoning.

Methods

The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning (EXTRIP) Workgroup is a multidisciplinary group with international representation whose aim is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of extracorporeal treatments in poisoning. We conducted a systematic literature review followed by data extraction and summarized findings, following a predetermined format. The entire work group voted by a 2-round modified Delphi method to reach consensus on voting statements, using a RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to quantify disagreement. Anonymous votes were compiled, returned, and discussed in person. A second vote determined the final recommendations.

Results

Eighty-four articles met inclusion criteria, including 1 controlled clinical trial, 3 animal studies, and 80 case reports or case series, yielding an overall very low quality of evidence for all recommendations. Clinical data on 143 patients (130 sets of which could be analyzed for patient-level entry data), including 14 fatalities, were reviewed. Toxicokinetic data on 87 patients were also included. After the second round of voting, the workgroup concluded that salicylates are dialyzable by hemodialysis and hemoperfusion (level of evidence = B) and recommended extracorporeal treatment in patients with severe salicylate poisoning (1D), including any patient with altered mental status (1D), with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring supplemental oxygen (1D), and for those in whom standard therapy is deemed to be failing (1D) regardless of the salicylate concentration. High salicylate concentrations warrant extracorporeal treatment regardless of signs and symptoms (> 7.2 mmol/L [100 mg/dL] [1D]; and > 6.5 mmol/L [90 mg/dL] [2D]), with lower thresholds applied for patients with impaired kidney function (> 6.5 mmol/L [90 mg/dL] [1D]; > 5.8 mmol/L [80 mg/dL] [2D]). Extracorporeal treatment is also suggested for patients with severe acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20 in the absence of other indications) (2D). Intermittent hemodialysis is the preferred modality (1D), although hemoperfusion (1D) and continuous renal replacement therapies (3D) are acceptable alternatives if hemodialysis is unavailable, as is exchange transfusion in neonates (1D).

Conclusion

Salicylates are readily removed by extracorporeal treatment, with intermittent hemodialysis being the preferred modality. The signs and symptoms of salicylate toxicity listed warrant extracorporeal treatment, as do high concentrations regardless of clinical status.

### Salicylic acid (salicylic acid 6 percent) [^114g9ajd]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Prolonged use over large areas, especially in children and those patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment could resultin salicylism. Excessive application of the product other than is needed to cover the affected area will not result in more therapeutic benefit. Concomitant use of other drugs which may contribute to elevated serum salicylate levels should be avoided where the potential for toxicity is present. In children under 12 years of age and those patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the area to be treated should be limited and the patient monitored closely for signs of salicylate toxicity: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of hearing, tinnitus, lethargy, hyperpnea, diarrhea, and psychic disturbances. In the event of salicylic acid toxicity, the use of the Salicylic Acid 6% (w/w) Shampoo should be discontinued. Fluids should be administered to promote urinary excretion. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate (oral or intravenous) should be instituted as appropriate. Patients should be cautioned against the use of oral aspirin and other salicylate containing medications, such as sports and injury creams, to avoid additional excessive exposure to salicylic acid. Where needed, aspirin should be replaced by an alternative non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory agent that is not salicylate based.

Due to potential risk of developing Reye's syndrome, salicylate products should not be used in children and teenagers with varicella or influenza, unless directed by a physician.

### Salicylic acid 10% (salicate) [^114tQ4QR]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings:

Salicate™ is for external use only. It is not for ophthalmic, oral, anal, or intravaginal use. Contact with eyes, lips, broken or inflamed skin, and mucous membranes should be avoided. Salicate™ should not be used by persons who have a known hypersensitivity to salicylic acid or other listed ingredients. Prolonged use over large areas, especially in children and those patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, could result in salicylism. Concomitant use of other drugs which may contribute to elevated serum salicylate levels should be avoided where the potential for toxicity is present. In children under 12 years of age and those patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the area to be treated should be limited, and the patient should be monitored closely for signs of salicylate toxicity: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of hearing, tinnitus, lethargy, hyperpnoea, diarrhea, psychic disturbances.

In the event of salicylic acid toxicity, Salicate™ should be discontinued. Fluids should be administered to promote urinary excretion. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate (oral or intravenous) should be instituted as appropriate. Considering the potential risk of developing Reye's syndrome, salicylate products should not be administered to children or teenagers with varicella or influenza, unless directed by a physician. When using this product, skin irritation and dryness is more likely to occur if you use another topical acne medication at the same time. If irritation occurs, only use one topical acne medication at a time. Applying the serum more than once per week will increase the risk of skin sensitivity.

### Salicylate-induced pulmonary edema – a near-miss diagnosis [^1169fqrG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A 43-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with confusion, agitation, and progressive dyspnea. Chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema. Initial diagnostic considerations were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, central nervous system infection, substance toxicity, and heart failure. Her salicylate level was 92.6 mg/dL, and an arterial blood gas revealed a respiratory alkalosis and nonanion gap metabolic acidosis, consistent with salicylate poisoning. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is an atypical presentation of salicylate toxicity, and this case highlights the importance of an early toxicology screen to make a time-critical diagnosis and provide specific treatment.

### Aspirin and omeprazole (aspirin and omeprazole delayed-release tab) [^114WN3NY]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There is no clinical data on overdosage with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA.

Aspirin

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.

Signs and Symptoms: In acute overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis.

Treatment: Treatment consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing salicylate elimination, and correcting the acid-base disturbance. Gastric emptying and/or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage.

Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. Serial salicylate levels should be obtained every 1 to 2 hours until concentrations have peaked and are declining. Acid-base status should be closely followed with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Fluid and electrolyte balance should also be maintained.

In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged with tepid water. Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and augmented with correction of acidosis. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce the body drug content. In patients with renal impairment or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

### Salicylates and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation: molecular mechanisms for cell cycle arrest [^1176LKWU]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Salicylates are effective prophylactic treatment strategies for myocardial infarction and ischemic strokes. Recent evidence suggests that high doses of salicylates may exert direct, platelet-independent effects on the vascular wall. Salicylate and aspirin, in concentrations between 1 and 5 mM, effectively inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and DNA synthesis without inducing cellular toxicity or apoptosis. This inhibition is associated with effects on specific cell-cycle regulatory molecules, and may proceed via downregulation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. High-dose salicylates and selective NF-kappaB inhibitors may, therefore, play an important role in the management of vascular proliferative disorders.

### Effect of intravenous albumin infusion on brain salicylate concentration [^112kNdfG]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Salicylate poisoning appears to result in death, despite supportive care, once a critical brain salicylate concentration is reached. The binding of salicylate to albumin is saturable; free plasma salicylate concentrations rise disproportionately to total drug levels. Because unbound salicylate distributes into the brain, the authors questioned whether an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of albumin would cause a redistribution of salicylate from the brain back into the plasma, which might allow enough time for hemodialysis to be instituted.

Objectives

To determine if i.v. albumin infusion would lower brain salicylate concentrations through redistribution in a porcine model of acute salicylate poisoning.

Methods

In a randomized controlled trial, 17 swine under anesthesia and controlled ventilation received 400 mg/kg of sodium salicylate i.v. over 15 minutes. At 60 minutes, nine animals received 1.25 g/kg albumin (25% solution) i.v. over 15 minutes, while eight control animals received an equal volume of normal saline (5 mL/kg). Arterial pH was maintained between 7.45 and 7.55. Serial measurements of serum albumin as well as free and total salicylate concentrations were obtained, and urine was collected for measurement of total salicylate excretion. At 180 minutes, animals were killed and brains harvested for measurement of brain salicylate concentrations.

Results

Average peak serum total salicylate concentrations of 105.5 and 109 mg/dL were achieved in control and albumin-treated animals, respectively. Albumin infusion was accompanied by statistically significant increases in serum total salicylate concentrations (median from 79.5 to 86.9 mg/dL at 75 minutes), while levels decreased slightly in control animals. Serum free salicylate concentrations decreased slightly in albumin-treated animals, but the difference was not statistically significant. Median brain salicylate concentrations were about 14% lower in the albumin treatment group (17.8 mg/100 g brain) compared with controls (20.5 mg/100 g brain); this approached statistical significance (p = 0.075). Median urinary salicylate excretion was higher in the albumin-treated group (0.83 vs. 0.48 g; p = 0.072), with similar urinary pH and volumes in both groups.

Conclusions

In this animal model of salicylate poisoning, i.v. infusion of 1.25 g/kg albumin was accompanied by a 14% decline in median brain salicylate concentrations, which approached statistical significance.

### Current knowledge and management of hypersensitivity to aspirin and NSAIDs [^1119699q]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are some of the most common culprits of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and can lead to a wide array of adverse effects. The accurate and timely diagnosis of aspirin and NSAID-induced hypersensitivity reactions is important for both patient safety and for the initiation of appropriate disease-specific management and treatment. Because there are no reliably validated in vitro tests available, aspirin and NSAID challenges are considered to be the criterion standard for the diagnosis of these hypersensitivity reactions, though in some patients the diagnosis can be made on the basis of a clear clinical history.

Salicylic acid — risks and use parameters specify that systemic absorption and increased risk for salicylate toxicity are higher in patients with renal disease and patients with hepatic disease when treating large BSAs (> 20%); therefore, its use should be avoided or used with caution in these groups; topical salicylic acid should not be applied before UVB phototherapy because it reduces its efficacy; there are inadequate human data available for its use during pregnancy/lactation; the combination of salicylic acid with topical corticosteroids can be used for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis (BSA ≤ 20%) as well as palmar-plantar psoriasis; and two randomized multicenter studies demonstrated the addition of salicylic acid to mometasone furoate is safe.

### Meprobamate and aspirin (equagesic) [^111yG8sS]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Overdosage

Treatment of overdose with Equagesic is essentially symptomatic and supportive. In cases where excessive doses of Equagesic have been taken, sleep ensues rapidly and blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rates are reduced to basal levels. Any drug remaining in the stomach should be removed and symptomatic treatment given. After emesis and/or lavage, activated charcoal may reduce absorption of both aspirin and meprobamate. Should respiration or blood pressure become compromised, respiratory assistance, central nervous system stimulants, and pressor agents should be administered cautiously as indicated. Diuresis, osmotic (mannitol) diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis have been used successfully in removing both aspirin and meprobamate. Alkalinization of the urine increases the excretion of salicylates. Careful monitoring of urinary output is necessary, and caution should be taken to avoid overhydration. Relapse and death, after initial recovery, have been attributed to incomplete gastric emptying and delayed absorption. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, acid-base disturbances with development of metabolic acidosis, convulsions, delirium, hyperpnea, hyperthermia, hypoprothrombinemia, restlessness, Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and vomiting. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus, occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 μg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 μg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 μg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately. Careful medical management is essential. In acute aspirin overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Treatment of aspirin overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing salicylate elimination, and correcting the acid-base disturbance.

### Salicylate toxicity [^113MawgG]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on aspirin overdose:

- **Definition**: Aspirin overdose is the plasma salicylate concentration of 300–500 mg/L in mild toxicity, 500–700 mg/L in moderate toxicity, and > 750 mg/L in severity toxicity.
- **Pathophysiology**: Aspirin overdose is caused by accidental ingestions in children, suicidal or intentional overdoses in adults.
- **Disease course**: Acute aspirin overdose results in salicylate poisoning resulting in either mild, moderate, or severe toxicity depending on the plasma salicylate concentration. Mild toxicity presents with burning in the mouth, lethargy, nausea and vomiting, tinnitus, or dizziness. Moderate toxicity includes additional symptoms of tachypnea, hyperpyrexia, sweating, dehydration, loss of coordination, and restlessness. Severe toxicity causes hallucinations, stupor, convulsions, cerebral edema, oliguria, renal failure, cardiovascular failure, metabolic acidosis, and coma.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe salicylate poisoning results in 5% mortality.

### Medical outcomes of acute aspirin single substance poisoning in pediatric patients [^113si5nb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A consensus guideline on salicylate poisoning recommends referring patients to the emergency department if they ingested 150 mg/kg of aspirin. The dose of aspirin associated with severe poisoning in pediatric patients has not been investigated.

Objective

This study aims to associate medical outcomes with aspirin overdoses in patients 5 years old and younger.

Methods

A retrospective review of data on pediatric patients with single substance aspirin exposures reported from poison centers across the country was conducted. The primary endpoint was to associate aspirin doses with medical outcomes. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of the signs, symptoms, and treatments of ingestion and their association with medical outcomes.

Results

There were 26488 included exposures with aspirin exposures resulting in no effect (92.5%), minor effect (6.0%), moderate effect (1.4%), major effect (0.2%), and death (0.02%). There were 8921 cases with available weight-based dosing information. Median doses associated with no effect, minor effects, moderate effects, major effects, and death ranged between 28.4 and 40.9 mg/kg, 52.5 and 82.3 mg/kg, 132.1 and 182.3 mg/kg, 132.3 and 172.8 mg/kg, and 142.2 and 284.4 mg/kg, respectively. Minor effect and moderate effect exposures were more likely to have alkalinization documented compared to no effect exposures (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.41–2.17; OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.12–2.86). There was no difference in rates of alkalinization between minor and moderate exposures (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.61–1.7).

Conclusions and Relevance

Reevaluation of the current recommendation of 150 mg/kg for referral to a healthcare facility is necessary for pediatric acute salicylate overdoses.

### Missed opportunities? an evaluation of potentially preventable poisoning deaths [^116i611J]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although most poisoning deaths are not preventable with current medical technology, in some cases different management decisions may have prevented fatal outcomes.

Objective

This study aims to review reported poisoning-related deaths for preventability to provide insight to improve future care.

Methods

Fatality abstracts published in the US National Poison Data System (NPDS) Annual Reports (2008–2012) were analyzed. Preventability was graded using a Likert scale of 1 (definitely non-preventable) to 6 (definitely preventable). Two medical toxicologists screened all cases. Cases deemed definitely not preventable (score 1) by both reviewers were excluded from further review and considered to be "non-preventable". All cases considered at least possibly preventable by either screener were reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel of 5 physicians for preventability scoring. Differences were resolved by consensus. Cases determined to be "preventable" (scores 4–6) were characterized by type of improvement issue involved (diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, other) and recurring scenarios.

Results

Of 390 published abstracts, 78 (20.0%) deaths were considered at least possibly preventable by at least one screener. Of these, 34 (8.7%) deaths were determined to be "preventable" by the panel. Inter-observer agreement by weighted kappa analysis was 0.58 for screening, 0.24 for preventability, and 0.44 for specific aspects of care. The most common toxicants were salicylates (n = 9), opioids (n = 4), toxic alcohols (n = 3), fluoride containing product (n = 3), and bupropion (n = 3). The most common improvement opportunities involved treatment and monitoring.

Discussion

Most of the ingested substances in preventable deaths have delayed GI absorption or require metabolic activation to produce a delayed effect (such as salicylates, opioids, and toxic alcohols), and therefore provide an opportunity for early recognition and successful interventions. Most improvement opportunities are clearly described in the literature but may be not recognized.

Conclusions

Based on an analysis of published NPDS data, a considerable number of poisoning-related deaths reaching medical attention may be preventable. The most common scenarios involved in potentially preventable poisoning fatalities related to monitoring and treatment. Salicylates and opioids were the most common agents involved in preventable deaths.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114QkYyJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO EMS clinical guidelines — Aspirin overdose directs: Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 gm/kg) PO only if within the first hour of ingestion. As ASA is erratically absorbed, charcoal is highly recommended to be administered early. If altered mental status or risk of rapid decreasing mental status from polypharmacy, do not administer oral agents including activated charcoal. In salicylate poisonings, let the patient breathe on their own, even if tachypneic, until there is evidence of decompensation or dropping oxygen saturation; acid/base disturbances and outcomes worsen when the patient is manually ventilated.

### A 29-year analysis of acute peak salicylate concentrations in fatalities reported to United States poison centers [^116Bi5Pq]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

The threshold salicylate concentration commonly recommended to initiate extracorporeal elimination, in the absence of significant end-organ toxicity, is 100mg/dL. Unfortunately, the grade of evidence to support this decision is low. Our primary aim is to describe highest reported salicylate concentrations in patients who died from acute salicylate ingestions. Our secondary aim is to determine if age or coingestants varied with highest reported salicylate concentration.

Methods

We analyzed acute salicylate fatalities reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) between 1 January 1986 and 31 December 2014. Included were patients who died during the index hospitalization and for which acute salicylate toxicity was the primary cause of death. We used descriptive statistics with standard deviations (SD) or 95% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate. We created a general linear model that evaluated the association of age and coingestions with salicylate concentrations. We divided the patients into age quartiles to assess a possible interaction between age and salicylate concentration.

Results

We identified 602 acute salicylate fatalities that fit inclusion criteria. The mean peak reported fatal salicylate concentration across all age groups was 99.19mg/dL (± 50.2mg/dL). The median peak fatal salicylate concentration was 97.0mg/dL. The oldest quartile had a lower mean concentration (age > 57 years; 90.4mg/dL) than the youngest quartile (age < 30 years; 111.6mg/dL, mean difference 21.2mg/dL, 95%CI 6.1–36.3). Fatalities with a coingestant had a lower mean concentration of 91.5mg/dL compared to 104.8mg/dL among those ingesting salicylates alone (mean difference 13.4mg/dL, 95%CI 21.4–5.3). Increasing age and the presence of any coingestions were negatively associated with fatal concentrations (estimates; 95%CI 0.41; 0.61–0.021 and -14.43; 22.45–6.42, respectively). When opioids were a coingestant, mean concentration was 72.8 (mean difference 32.1 95%CI 23.1–41.1).

Conclusions

Using the current recommended hemodialysis threshold of 100mg/dL, more than half of the patients would be deprived of this critical life-saving therapy. Additionally, increasing age and ingestion of other substances, especially opioids, are associated with lower peak fatal salicylate concentrations. A prospective, randomized controlled trial considering salicylate concentrations and other clinical factors may provide further guidance for hemodialysis.

### Measuring plasma salicylate concentrations in all patients with drug overdose or altered consciousness: is it necessary? [^114zHAkM]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Salicylate self poisoning is potentially fatal. Plasma salicylate concentrations can be used to guide management when taken in the context of clinical features of toxicity and acid base status. Previous studies in the USA and Hong Kong have shown that routine measurement of plasma salicylate concentrations in all overdose patients is inappropriate, but there have been no previous studies in the UK.

Methods

A retrospective case note study from 1 February 2001 to 31 January 2002 was undertaken at the emergency department of St. Thomas' Hospital, London. Records were reviewed and information on demographic data, history, details of salicylate overdose, and documentation of clinical features of salicylate toxicity recorded.

Results

In total, 722 patient episodes were identified, of which 596 case notes were available and appropriate for inclusion in this study. Plasma salicylate concentrations (range 15–428 mg/l) were detectable in 50 patients (three notes not available), of whom 38 had given a positive history. The history of salicylate poisoning had a sensitivity of 81% (95% confidence interval (CI) 67 to 91%) and the predictive value of a negative history of salicylate ingestion in not detecting salicylate concentrations was 98% (95% CI 97 to 99%). Insufficient information on clinical features of salicylate toxicity was recorded in 569 patients (including 35 patients who had a history of salicylate ingestion).

Conclusion

History of salicylate ingestion has a high sensitivity and negative predictive value with respect to the detection of plasma salicylate concentrations. However, current practice indicates that insufficient information is obtained from patients about the clinical features of toxicity. Routine measurement of plasma salicylate concentrations is not required unless there is (a) a positive history of ingestion of salicylates or (b) a reduced level of consciousness or other reason limiting the validity of the history obtained, together with clinical features consistent with salicylate poisoning.

### Iron poisoning: a literature-based review of epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^111N9ja2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although seen less frequently than acetaminophen or salicylate poisoning, acute iron poisoning remains a dangerous threat, particularly to pediatric patients. Multiple factors-including legal and manufacturing practices-have changed the landscape of iron poisoning over the decades. Despite these changes, diagnosis and management of iron poisoning have minimally evolved, and the current evidence for iron poisoning is yet based principally on case series, expert consensus, animal studies, and adult volunteer studies. This review article describes in detail the epidemiology of acute iron poisoning as it relates to the pediatric patient, as well as the historical and current array of literature on diagnosis and management.

### Delayed salicylate toxicity at 35 hours without early manifestations following a single salicylate ingestion [^117FSDnL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of delayed toxicity following a single ingestion of aspirin, where the initial concentrations were nearly undetectable and the patient was completely asymptomatic for the first 35 hours.

Case Summary

A 14-year-old white female was evaluated after a single ingestion of 120 tablets of aspirin 81 mg/tablet hours before arrival to the emergency department. She denied nausea, abdominal pain, tinnitus, or shortness of breath. She received one dose of activated charcoal. The first salicylate concentration (4 h after ingestion) was 1 mg/dL. At 35 hours, the patient became symptomatic (dizziness, tinnitus, epigastric discomfort). Her salicylate concentration at that time was 46 mg/dL. A second dose of activated charcoal was administered, and intravenous bicarbonate with potassium was started as a continuous infusion for 30 hours.

Discussion

While delayed salicylate toxicity is well reported in the literature, no report was found regarding concentrations increasing to toxicity 35 hours after ingestion. The delayed aspirin absorption may be due to salicylate-induced pylorospasm or the formation of pharmacobezoars.

Conclusions

In cases with known salicylate ingestion, it is important to follow salicylate concentrations every 4 hours until they are steadily decreasing according to a 4-hour half-life and the patient shows no symptoms of salicylate intoxication.

### Risk-stratified monitoring for sulfasalazine toxicity: prognostic model development and validation [^117Q575A]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Hepatic, haematological and renal toxicity from sulfasalazine occurs uncommonly after the first few months of treatment.
Nevertheless, the manufacturers and some specialist societies, for example, the American College of Rheumatology recommend monitoring blood tests at 3 monthly intervals during established treatment.
Other guidelines, for example, from the British Society of Rheumatology recommend no monitoring after the first 2 years of treatment.
It is not known whether hepatic, haematological and renal toxicities due to sulfasalazine can be predicted and monitoring be risk-stratified.

### Delayed salicylate toxicity with undetectable initial levels after large-dose aspirin ingestion [^1146AanB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), the most commonly used medicinal salicylate, is an antiinflammatory, antipyretic, antirheumatic, and analgesic agent. In 2005, according to the Toxic Exposures Survey from the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poisoning and Exposure Database, there were more than 20,000 reported aspirin and nonaspirin salicylate exposures, 64% of which required treatment in a health care facility. Of these exposures, 50% were reported as intentional overdoses and 60 patients died.

### Are one or two dangerous? Methyl salicylate exposure in toddlers [^113rwTaq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Serious toxicity can result from exposure to small amounts of methyl salicylate. Methyl salicylate is widely available as a component in many over-the-counter brands of creams, ointments, lotions, liniments and medicated oils intended for topical application to relieve musculoskeletal aches and pains. Among the most potent forms of methyl salicylate is oil of wintergreen (98% methyl salicylate). Other products with varying concentrations of methyl salicylate are ubiquitous throughout many parts of the world, including a number of products marketed as Asian herbal remedies. The toxic potential of all of these formulations is often underestimated by health care providers and the general public. A comprehensive review of the existing medical literature on methyl salicylate poisoning was performed, and data compiled over the past two decades by the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) was examined. Methyl salicylate continues to be a relatively common source of pediatric exposures. Persistent reports of life-threatening and fatal toxicity were found. In children less than 6 years of age, a teaspoon (5 mL) or less of oil of wintergreen has been implicated in several well-documented deaths. More needs to be done to educate both health care providers and the general public regarding the dangers of these widely available formulations.

### Incidence of rebound salicylate toxicity following cessation of urine alkalinization [^114tDRmC]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Management of patients with salicylate toxicity frequently requires urine alkalinization to enhance excretion of salicylate. One strategy for determining when to stop urine alkalinization is to wait for two consecutive serum salicylate concentrations to be less than 300mg/L (2.17mmol/L) and declining. When alkalinization of the urine ceases, a rebound in serum salicylate concentration can occur from tissue redistribution or delayed gastrointestinal absorption. Whether this can lead to rebound toxicity is not well understood.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective review of cases with a primary ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid reported to the local poison center over a five-year period. Cases were excluded if the product was not listed as the primary ingestion or if there was no serum salicylate concentration documented after discontinuation of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion. The primary outcome was the incidence of serum salicylate rebound to a concentration greater than 300mg/L (2.17mmol/L) after discontinuation of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion.

Results

A total of 377 cases were included. Of these, eight (2.1%) had a serum salicylate concentration increase (rebound) after stopping the sodium bicarbonate infusion. All these cases were acute ingestions. Five of the eight cases had rebound serum salicylate concentrations that were greater than 300mg/L (2.17mmol/L). Of these five patients, only one reported recurrent symptoms (tinnitus). Prior to stopping urinary alkalinization, the last or the last two serum salicylate concentrations were less than 300mg/L (2.17mmol/L) in three and two cases, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with salicylate toxicity, the incidence of rebound in serum salicylate concentration after cessation of urine alkalinization, is low. Even if serum salicylate rebounds to supratherapeutic concentrations, symptoms are often absent or mild. Routine repeat serum salicylate concentrations after urine alkalinization is stopped may be unnecessary unless symptoms recrudesce.

### Activated charcoal and bicarbonate for aspirin toxicity: a retrospective series [^112eknoZ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin overdose causes acid-base disturbances and organ dysfunction. Management is guided by research reported over 50 years ago when chronic aspirin toxicity was common and accounted for significant morbidity. We investigate our experience of aspirin overdose and the effectiveness of charcoal and bicarbonate administration over 20 years.

Methods

This is a retrospective series of acute aspirin overdose from two toxicology units from January 2000 to September 2019. Acute aspirin ingestions > 3000 mg were identified in each unit's database. Excluded were cases of chronic exposure, hospital presentation > 24 hours after ingestion, and cases without a salicylate concentration. Included in our analysis was demographic data, clinical effects, investigations, complications, and treatment.

Results

There were 132 presentations in 108 patients (79 females (73%)). The median age was 28 years (range: 13–93 years). The median dose ingested was 7750 mg (IQR: 6000–14,400 mg). There were 44 aspirin-only ingestions. Mild toxicity (nausea, vomiting, tinnitus or hyperventilation) occurred in 22 with a median dose of 160 mg/kg. Moderate toxicity (acid-base disturbance, confusion) occurred in 16 with a median ingested dose of 297 mg/kg. There were no cases of severe toxicity (coma or seizures) due to aspirin alone. The median peak salicylate concentration was 276 mg/L (IQR: 175–400 mg/L, range: 14–814 mg/L). There was a moderate association between dose ingested and peak concentration (Pearson r = 0.58; 95% CI 0.45–0.68). Activated charcoal was administered in 36 (27%) cases, which decreased the median peak salicylate concentration (34.2 to 24.8 mg/L/g (difference: 9.4, 95% CI: 1.0–13.1)). Bicarbonate was administered in 34 (26%) presentations, decreasing the median apparent elimination half-life from 13.4 to 9.3 h (difference: 4.2 h, 95% CI: 1.0–6.5 h).

Conclusions

Acute aspirin overdose caused only mild to moderate effects in this series. Early administration of activated charcoal decreased absorption and use of bicarbonate enhanced elimination.

### Salicylic acid (Salycim) [^113Yjmq1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Prolonged use over large areas, especially in children and those patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, could result in salicylism. Concomitant use of other drugs which may contribute to elevated serum salicylate levels should be avoided where the potential for toxicity is present. In children under 12 years of age and those patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the area to be treated should be limited and the patient monitored closely for signs of salicylate toxicity: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of hearing, tinnitus, lethargy, hyperpnea, diarrhea, and psychic disturbances. In the event of salicylic acid toxicity, the use of Salycim™ Cream should be discontinued. Fluids should be administered topromote urinary excretion. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate (oral or intravenous) should be instituted as appropriate.

Patients should be cautioned against the use of oral aspirin and other salicylate containing medications, such as sports injury creams, to avoid additional excessive exposure to salicylic acid.

Where needed, aspirin should be replaced by an alternative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that is not salicylate based. Patients should be advised not to apply occlusive dressings, clothing or other occlusive topical products such as petrolatum-based ointments to prevent excessive systemic exposure to salicylic acid. Excessive application of the product other than what is needed to cover the affected area will not result in a more rapid therapeutic benefit.

Due to potential risk of developing Reye's syndrome, salicylate products should not be used in children and teenagers with varicella or influenza, unless directed by physician.

### Delayed recrudescence to toxic salicylate concentrations after salsalate overdose [^117MCWmj]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Salicylates are common exposures. We report an unusual case of salicylate ingestion, as salsalate, with resolution of symptoms and return of salicylate levels to non-toxic values, with a subsequent, unexpected recrudescence to toxic levels requiring reinstitution of therapy. A 31-year-old man ingested unknown amounts of salsalate, hydroxyzine, and a benzodiazepine. He was intubated and treated with IV sodium bicarbonate and two doses of oral activated charcoal. Eight hours after presentation, his serum salicylate concentration peaked at 55 mg/dL, and then decreased to a nadir of 5.6 mg/dL 38 h after presentation, coinciding with return of GI motility. Several hours later salicylate concentrations began to rise, peaking 67 h after presentation at 61.7 mg/dL. He was treated with sodium bicarbonate and charcoal, which resulted in decreased serum salicylate to therapeutic levels. Salicylate ingestions are known to exhibit unusual toxicokinetics and absorption in overdose; however, this is the first case we are aware of that shows a return to toxic concentrations after apparent resolution of toxicity. Recrudescence of salicylate concentrations to a degree that would dictate reinstitution of therapy for overdose is unusual and may warrant prolonged monitoring of serum salicylate concentrations in salsalate ingestions.

### Extracorporeal removal of poisons and toxins [^112tBXMK]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal therapies have been used to remove toxins from the body for over 50 years and have a greater role than ever before in the treatment of poisonings. Improvements in technology have resulted in increased efficacy of removing drugs and other toxins with hemodialysis, and newer extracorporeal therapy modalities have expanded the role of extracorporeal supportive care of poisoned patients. However, despite these changes, for at least the past three decades the most frequently dialyzed poisons remain salicylates, toxic alcohols, and lithium; in addition, the extracorporeal treatment of choice for therapeutic removal of nearly all poisonings remains intermittent hemodialysis. For the clinician, consideration of extracorporeal therapy in the treatment of a poisoning depends upon the characteristics of toxins amenable to extracorporeal removal (e.g., molecular mass, volume of distribution, protein binding), choice of extracorporeal treatment modality for a given poisoning, and when the benefit of the procedure justifies additive risk. Given the relative rarity of poisonings treated with extracorporeal therapies, the level of evidence for extracorporeal treatment of poisoning is not robust; however, extracorporeal treatment of a number of individual toxins have been systematically reviewed within the current decade by the Extracorporeal Treatment in Poisoning workgroup, which has published treatment recommendations with an improved evidence base. Some of these recommendations are discussed, as well as management of a small number of relevant poisonings where extracorporeal therapy use may be considered.

### Altered mental status and complete heart block: an unusual presentation of aspirin toxicity [^1115VzK9]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most commonly used medications. We report a patient who presented with severe weakness, altered mental status and complete heart block requiring temporary pacing. Despite the patient's family denying that the patient used aspirin, an arterial blood gas that revealed a respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis suggested the diagnosis of salicylate toxicity. The salicylate level was extremely elevated and the patient was successfully treated with haemodialysis. Our case illustrates that salicylate toxicity should be considered in a patient with a combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. A prompt salicylate level should be obtained. This is also the first case of salicylate toxicity causing complete heart block in an adult. The heart block resolved with treatment of the salicylate toxicity.

Combination topical therapy — corticosteroids with salicylic acid may be beneficial but should be potency-limited: "The combination of topical corticosteroids and salicylic acid may be valuable because of the ability of salicylic acid to enhance the efficacy of corticosteroids by increasing penetration", and to avoid toxicity, "it is recommended that this combination be limited to no more than medium-potency (class 3–4) topical corticosteroids". This aligns with the general statement that "combination regimens, utilizing medications from different categories, have been studied and shown to be potentially beneficial".

### Acute and chronic effects of aspirin toxicity and their treatment… [^113Uvffm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Salicylate poisoning remains a major clinical hazard, usually resulting from accidental ingestions in preschool children, suicidal overdoses in adults and teenagers, and therapeutically acquired intoxication in all ages. Alkalemia or acidemia, alkaluria or aciduria, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, and water and electrolyte imbalances may occur; nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, hyperpnea, hyperpyrexia, disorientation, coma, and/or convulsions are common. With chronic, therapeutically induced salicylism, these symptoms may be mistaken for symptoms resulting from the illness for which the salicylates were administered. For acute ingestions, the magnitude of the poisoning is clearly dose related. Blood level determinations are good prognostic indicators for acute ingestions but are of limited value in chronic, therapeutically induced salicylism. Fluid and electrolyte management is the mainstay of therapy.

Methotrexate — drug interactions and hepatotoxic co-medications: Numerous medications may interact with methotrexate by a variety of mechanisms that can result in elevated drug levels, thereby increasing the risk for methotrexate toxicity; after absorption, methotrexate binds to serum albumin. Salicylates, sulfonamides, diphenylhydantoin, and antibiotics including penicillin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim may decrease the binding of methotrexate to albumin leading to increased serum levels, and several other medications including colchicine, CSA, probenecid, salicylates, and sulfonamides may lead to decreased renal tubular excretion with increased serum levels. Given the hepatotoxicity of methotrexate, caution should be used when prescribing this drug to patients taking other potentially hepatotoxic agents including alcohol, statins, leflunomide, retinoids, azathioprine, and minocycline; although some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may elevate serum methotrexate levels (e.g., ibuprofen, salicylates, naproxen), other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, piroxicam, meloxicam, lumiracoxib, rofecoxib, and celecoxib do not. Table V identifies medication classes and examples that may increase methotrexate toxicity.

### Salicylate poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^116reim9]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A review of U.S. poison center data for 2004 showed over 40,000 exposures to salicylate-containing products. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and pre-hospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected exposure to salicylates by 1) describing the process by which a specialist in poison information should evaluate an exposure to salicylates, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of salicylate exposure, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses: 1) Patients with stated or suspected self-harm or who are the victims of a potentially malicious administration of a salicylate, should be referred to an emergency department immediately. This referral should be guided by local poison center procedures. In general, this should occur regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). 2) The presence of typical symptoms of salicylate toxicity such as hematemesis, tachypnea, hyperpnea, dyspnea, tinnitus, deafness, lethargy, seizures, unexplained lethargy, or confusion warrants referral to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 3) Patients who exhibit typical symptoms of salicylate toxicity or nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained lethargy, confusion, or dyspnea, which could indicate the development of chronic salicylate toxicity, should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 4) Patients without evidence of self-harm should have further evaluation, including determination of the dose, time of ingestion, presence of symptoms, history of other medical conditions, and the presence of co-ingestants. The acute ingestion of more than 150 mg/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin equivalent, whichever is less, warrants referral to an emergency department. Ingestion of greater than a lick or taste of oil of wintergreen (98% methyl salicylate) by children under 6 years of age and more than 4 mL of oil of wintergreen by patients 6 years of age and older could cause systemic salicylate toxicity and warrants referral to an emergency department (Grade C). 5) Do not induce emesis for ingestions of salicylates (Grade D). 6) Consider the out-of-hospital administration of activated charcoal for acute ingestions of a toxic dose if it is immediately available, no contraindications are present, the patient is not vomiting, and local guidelines for its out-of-hospital use are observed. However, do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grade D). 7) Women in the last trimester of pregnancy who ingest below the dose for emergency department referral and do not have other referral conditions should be directed to their primary care physician, obstetrician, or a non-emergent health care facility for evaluation of maternal and fetal risk. Routine referral to an emergency department for immediate care is not required (Grade C). 8) For asymptomatic patients with dermal exposures to methyl salicylate or salicylic acid, the skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and water and the patient can be observed at home for development of symptoms (Grade C). 9) For patients with an ocular exposure of methyl salicylate or salicylic acid, the eye(s) should be irrigated with room-temperature tap water for 15 minutes. If after irrigation the patient is having pain, decreased visual acuity, or persistent irritation, referral for an ophthalmological examination is indicated (Grade D). 10) Poison centers should monitor the onset of symptoms whenever possible by conducting follow-up calls at periodic intervals for approximately 12 hours after ingestion of non-enteric-coated salicylate products, and for approximately 24 hours after the ingestion of enteric-coated aspirin (Grade C).

### Aspirin and multiple sclerosis [^113AyQNq]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

ASA and salicylate, the active metabolite of ASA, are known to cause hearing loss and tinnitus at high doses (for example, 6–8 g/day). The mechanisms behind these effects are unclear, but salicylate seems to have effects centrally on GABAergic neurotransmission, as well as more peripherally by affecting cochlear function. Moreover, a strong linear relationship exists between unbound salicylate plasma concentration and a resultant decrease in auditory sensitivity, and the salicylate toxicity model is used by auditory scientists to investigate mechanisms underlying tinnitus.

Certain asthmatic patients have a sensitivity to ASA that manifests itself as a respiratory/asthma-type attack. Jenkins et al. performed a systematic review and found that the pooled incidence of ASA-induced asthma was 21% in adults and 5% in children. This is higher than the value of approximately 10% that has been published elsewhere. The mechanism of this reaction in ASA sensitive-individuals is thought to occur due to COX inhibition resulting in decreased PGE 2 and thus unabated activation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. This, in turn, increases production of leukotrienes and mast cell release of histamine, leading to airway hyperreactivity.

Prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation is necessary for proper renal plasma flow, especially in individuals with underlying renal disease, congestive heart failure, or cirrhosis. Through inhibition of renal COX-2, ASA and other NSAIDs can cause volume-dependent renal failure and that resulting from interstitial nephritis and nephritic syndrome.

### Absorption of salicylate powders versus tablets following overdose: a poison center observational study [^114tXp9h]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Salicylate absorption following overdose of aspirin (ASA) tablet formulations can be prolonged for greater than 24h. Accordingly, serial serum concentrations are typically recommended to guide treatment. However, there are little published data on absorption following ingestion of powder ASA formulations, and it is not known if delayed ASA absorption occurs following overdose of powder formulations. The objective of this study is to compare the absorption characteristics of powder and tablet formulations of ASA in patients reported to a single poison center.

Methods

Electronic records from an accredited poison center were searched for single substance acute or acute on chronic ingestions of ASA in powder form between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2014. An identical search for ingestions of ASA tablet products between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 was undertaken as the comparator group. Other inclusion criteria were age > 12 years, documented time of ingestion, treatment in a health care facility within nine hours of ingestion and at least two detectable serum salicylate concentrations.

Results

16 of 25 powder and 22 of 49 tablet cases met inclusion criteria for analysis. Repeat serum salicylate concentrations following ingestion of tablets increased or insignificantly changed in 11 of 22 (50%) cases, and median serum salicylate concentrations in followed cases remained elevated for up to 12h in some cases. In comparison, serum salicylate concentrations following powder ingestions declined in 15 of 16 (94%) cases. One patient, who ingested a powder product, underwent hemodialysis pursuant to an initial serum salicylate concentration of 96mg/dL.

Conclusions

In contrast to persistent concentrations following overdose of tablets, the majority of serum salicylate concentrations declined following ingestion of powder formulations. In this small study population, these findings suggest that prolonged absorption is unlikely following ingestions of ASA powders.

### Salicylate toxicity | NEJM resident 360… [^116EGLku]. resident360.nejm.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Q: What are some of the clinical manifestations of acute salicylate toxicity. A: In acute intoxication, within 1 or 2 hours after a single salicylate ingestion, at which point plasma levels often exceed 40 or 50 mg per deciliter, clinical manifestations of salicylate intoxication include tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and hyperpnea. Plasma levels between 50 mg per deciliter and 70 mg per deciliter indicate severe intoxication and can be associated with fever, sweating, listlessness, and incoordination. At levels exceeding 75 mg per deciliter, patients are at risk for hallucinations, seizures, cerebral edema, coma, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular collapse.

Frequent monitoring is required, and an undetectable or low salicylate level should not lull the clinician into complacency about the need to initiate treatment if the assessment suggests a possibility of salicylism. The plasma level of salicylate required to elicit symptoms tends to be lower in chronic than in acute salicylate poisoning, sometimes falling into the upper end of the therapeutic range, because of the large amount of drug previously distributed to and located within tissues, including the central nervous system. In cases of acute salicylate toxicity, rising plasma levels are roughly correlated with the development of expected clinical manifestations, but such correlations are notoriously absent with chronic toxicity. Overreliance on drug levels can lead to underestimation of the severity of poisoning and delay implementation of appropriate therapy, potentially contributing to worse outcomes. A: Hemodialysis is the most efficient way to remove salicylate from the body.

The small size, low volume of distribution, and absence of tissue binding make salicylate an ideal substance for dialysis. The threshold for starting hemodialysis should be lower for patients with altered mental status or renal insufficiency, patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome who require supplemental oxygen, and those in whom standard therapy has failed regardless of the salicylate level.

### Oxycodone and aspirin (Endodan) [^11557uQ1]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric emptying and/or lavage may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.
This procedure is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the
patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of
activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than three hours have
passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to
lavage and emesis.

In severe cases of salicylate overdose, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the
major immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged with tepid water.
Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and augmented with
correction of acidosis. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored to
promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. Infusion of
glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. With more severe acute toxicity
respiratory alkalosis may occur.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce the body
content of aspirin. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of
life-threatening salicylate intoxication dialysis is usually required. Exchange
transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

In case of real or suspected overdose, a poison control center should be
consulted for the treatment of salicylism.

The toxicity of oxycodone and aspirin in combination is unknown.

### Salicylate poisoning… [^114ieh6Q]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Although the administration of salicylates is commonly not associated with untoward effects, occasionally therapy with these drugs may be accompanied by medical hazards for patients who have an idiosyncrasy or susceptibility to these drugs. The type of ester radical may detrimentally influence the toxicity; the methyl ester is particularly toxic. Fatal results may ensue after ingestion of methyl salicylate; approximately 80 deaths from this cause have been reported to date. Such fatalities may follow very small doses of this compound. Four cubic centimeters of oil of wintergreen taken by a child of 1½ years caused death, and 6 cc. was fatal to an adult. Most of the deaths reported have been caused by methyl salicylate, probably because of the fact that this compound is more toxic than other salicyl compounds in equivalent doses. However, the other salicylates may be toxic, and an increasing number TROLL MM, MENTEN ML.

### Methocarbamol and aspirin [^111Wisj2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Limited information is available on the acute toxicity of methocarbamol. Overdose of methocarbamol is frequently in conjunction with alcohol or other CNS depressants and includes the following symptoms: nausea, drowsiness, blurred vision, hypotension, seizures, and coma.

In post-marketing experience, deaths have been reported with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants, alcohol or psychotropic drugs.

Early signs of acute aspirin (salicylate) overdose including tinnitus occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately.

In acute salicylate overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration, and coma. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Serious symptoms such as depression, coma, and respiratory failure progress rapidly.

Salicylism (chronic salicylate toxicity) may be noted by symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus, difficulty hearing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mental confusion. More severe salicylism may result in respiratory alkalosis.

Treatment of Overdosage: Supportive therapy for 24 hours, as methocarbamol is excreted within that time. If salicylate intoxication occurs, especially in children, the hyperpnea may be controlled with sodium bicarbonate. Judicious use of 5% CO₂with 95% O₂may be of benefit. Abnormal electrolyte patterns should be corrected with appropriate fluid therapy.

### Perioperative pain control: a strategy for management [^114or4Gc]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

A thorough understanding of the anatomy and neurophysiology of the pain response is necessary for the effective treatment of perioperative pain. This article describes the mechanisms that produce pain, including those related to inflammation. Other topics include the pharmacologies of nonopioid and opioid analgesics. Nonopioid analgesics can be separated into two categories: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as salicylates, and acetaminophen. Opioids include morphine, fentanyl, and meperidine. The pharmacology of local anesthesia is discussed. The six major adverse reactions to local anesthetics are cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, direct tissue toxicity, central nervous system toxicity, methemoglobinemia and allergic reactions. Methods for measuring pain are described.

### Salicylate toxicity from ingestion of traditional massage oil [^112oXdcV]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 16-month-old child developed a brief generalised tonic-clonic fitting episode and vomiting at home, after accidental ingestion of traditional massage oil. As the patient presented with clinical features of salicylate toxicity, appropriate management was instituted. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for multiorgan support. The child was discharged well 1&emsp14; week after the incident. Methyl-salicylate is a common component of massage oils which are used for topical treatment of joint and muscular pains. However, these massage oils may be toxic when taken orally. Early recognition of the salicylate toxicity is very important in producing a good patient outcome.

### Acute salicylate poisoning: risk factors for severe outcome [^112eLCNi]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Salicylate poisoning remains a significant public health threat with more than 20,000 exposures reported annually in the United States.

Objective

We aimed to establish early predictors of severe in-hospital outcomes in Emergency Department patients presenting with acute salicylate poisoning.

Methods

This was a secondary data analysis of adult salicylate overdoses from a prospective cohort study of acute drug overdoses at two urban university teaching hospitals from 2009 to 2013. Patients were included based on confirmed salicylate ingestion and enrolled consecutively. Demographics, clinical parameters, treatment and disposition were collected from the medical record. Severe outcome was defined as a composite occurrence of acidemia (pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 16mEq/L), hemodialysis, and/or death.

Results

Out of 1997 overdoses screened, 48 patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patient characteristics were 43.8% male, median age 32 (range 18–87), mean initial salicylate concentration 28.1mg/dL (SD 26.6), and 20.8% classified as severe outcome. Univariate analysis indicated that age, respiratory rate, lactate, coma, and the presence of co-ingestions were significantly associated with severe outcome, while initial salicylate concentration alone had no association. However, when adjusted for salicylate concentration, only age (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02–1.26) and respiratory rate (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.02–1.63) were independent predictors. Additionally, lactate showed excellent test characteristics to predict severe outcome, with an optimal cutpoint of 2.25mmol/L (78% sensitivity, 67% specificity).

Conclusions

In adult Emergency Department patients with acute salicylate poisoning, independent predictors of severe outcome were older age and increased respiratory rate, as well as initial serum lactate, while initial salicylate concentration alone was not predictive.

### Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole [^112RcgnA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.

Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

Prescribing information for salicylic acid — used alone or in combination with other drugs for the symptomatic treatment of acne — includes topical dosing, safety, interactions, and pediatric cautions. Salicylic acid is used alone or in combination with other drugs for the symptomatic treatment of acne, and dosing is to apply topically using appropriate preparations containing salicylic acid 0.5–2%, with appropriate 0.5–2% salicylic acid preparation applied 1–3 times daily; initially apply once daily then gradually increase to 2 or 3 times daily, and if dryness or peeling occurs reduce application to once daily or every other day. Contraindications are known sensitivity to salicylic acid or any other ingredient in the formulation; adverse effects/toxicity include hypersensitivity reactions, salicylate toxicity, excessive erythema, and scaling; and interactions are listed with acidifying agents, anticoagulants, antidiabetic agents, aspirin, corticosteroids, diuretics, methotrexate, pyrazinamide, sulfur, and uricosuric agents. Other issues note cumulative irritant or drying effect and state that if excessive dryness occurs, use only 1 topical medication unless directed by a clinician; pregnancy category C is stated; and for nursing, discontinue nursing or the drug and, if used by nursing women, avoid applying to the chest area. Pediatric use guidance states that salicylic acid 6% cream, lotion, and gel and 15% plaster are not recommended in children < 2 years of age, there is increased risk of salicylate toxicity with prolonged, excessive use in children < 12 years of age, treatment area should be limited with monitoring for possible signs of salicylate toxicity, and use of salicylates in children with varicella infection or influenza-like illnesses is associated with an increased risk of developing Reye syndrome.

### Activated charcoal for acute poisoning: one toxicologist's journey [^113hPVyB]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Greene proposes the following criteria for oral administration of AC: (1) the ingestion is potentially toxic, (2) there are no contraindications to use of AC, (3) the substance is adsorbed by AC, (4) the substance is likely to still be in the GI tract when AC is given, (5) the patient is expected to be able to maintain a patent airway or is already intubated, and(6) the GI tract is functionally and anatomically intact; and there is no safer or more effective alternate treatment. Bailey pictures a risk-benefit "gastrointestinal triangle" whose three corners are (1) the hazard posed by the ingestion, (2) the potential benefit of gastrointestinal decontamination, and (3) the risks of the procedure. Wiegand designed an algorithm incorporating the risk of aspiration, the potential toxicity of the substance, and the time since ingestion. The algorithm (presented in abstract form but not yet published in full) calls for administration of AC up to 4 h after ingestion of potentially toxic substances or up to 24 h in special circumstances: e.g. the drug is probably still present in the stomach (e.g. massive ingestion, anticholinergic, and salicylate); the poisoning could be lethal despite supportive care; a very large ingestion requiring multiple doses of AC to achieve a 10:1 AC/drug ratio; or ingestion of drug packets ("body packer" or "stuffer"). Wiegand's list of potentially lethal drugs includes cardiotoxic agents such as calcium channel blockers and chloroquine; cytotoxic agents such as amatoxin-containing mushrooms, colchicine, and chemotherapeutic agents; and other menacing poisons such as paraquat.
