## Question

what can cause early spotting 10 days before period? Patient took a plan B ill yesterday. List all potential reasons

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause early spotting about 10 days before the expected period after taking a Plan B pill yesterday, and wants all potential reasons listed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how levonorgestrel emergency contraception affects bleeding patterns and whether early spotting is expected. Then, I should verify pharmacologic mechanisms that could plausibly cause bleeding around day 10 premenstrually. Next, I will consider failure of emergency contraception and how to time pregnancy testing. After that, I need to evaluate ectopic pregnancy risk and its warning signs. Finally, I will outline less common or unrelated causes and synthesize a practical, safety-focused plan with counseling points and follow-up actions.

> Let me first confirm the most likely explanation: levonorgestrel can acutely alter endometrial stability and timing of withdrawal bleeding, so spotting several days after dosing is not rare. Wait, let me verify the directionality — some data suggest that when Plan B is taken earlier in the cycle, the next bleed may come early, which aligns with spotting around day 10 premenstrually if taken in the follicular or early luteal phase, though I should acknowledge the evidence is observational and low certainty. FDA labeling also notes that some women experience spotting a few days after taking Plan B and that menstrual bleeding patterns may be altered, which supports the clinical plausibility of early, light bleeding in this scenario [^117DWihH] [^114cNTF1] [^1144n69m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is a mechanistic expectation, not a guarantee. Mechanistically, levonorgestrel can delay or hasten ovulation, modify endometrial receptivity, and trigger a withdrawal response that may manifest as light spotting within days of administration; this fits the clinical picture of spotting appearing 10 days before the expected menses. I should confirm that while many women have their next menses on time or within a week, a meaningful minority have delays beyond 7 days, underscoring the need to interpret any cycle change in the context of timing and symptoms [^114cNTF1] [^117DWihH].

> Next, I should review the possibility of EC failure and how to test for it. Let me think about the timing: a home urine pregnancy test is reasonably sensitive about 2–3 weeks after the unprotected intercourse; if the expected period is more than a week late, pregnancy should be considered and testing pursued. I should double-check the guidance on when to test — labels advise considering pregnancy if menses is delayed beyond 1 week, and professional recommendations endorse offering post-EC pregnancy testing as needed; so a practical approach is to test now if 2–3 weeks have elapsed since exposure, or otherwise repeat if the period is a week late or symptoms arise. I need to ensure we counsel that EC does not terminate an existing pregnancy and is not teratogenic if taken inadvertently in early pregnancy, so testing is prudent but not a cause for alarm regarding fetal harm [^114cNTF1] [^1144n69m] [^1117aEDK] [^115ZJpQE].

> I will now examine ectopic pregnancy risk, even though it is uncommon. The FDA warns that if a patient becomes pregnant or has lower abdominal pain after Plan B, ectopic pregnancy should be considered; case reports describe ectopic pregnancies presenting with spotting and pain after levonorgestrel use, though causality is uncertain. Wait, I should verify the counseling: patients should be advised to seek urgent care for severe lower abdominal pain 3–5 weeks after EC, and any positive pregnancy test after EC warrants prompt evaluation to localize the pregnancy and exclude ectopic. I need to ensure we do not overstate risk — most pregnancies after EC are intrauterine — but vigilance is warranted given the potential morbidity of missed ectopic pregnancy [^114cNTF1] [^1144n69m] [^117HVy2H] [^112gkcvQ].

> But wait, what if the spotting reflects something unrelated to EC? Less commonly, early-cycle spotting can reflect cervical ectopy, cervical polyps, STIs, or breakthrough bleeding from ongoing hormonal contraception; however, in the immediate post-EC window, the temporal association strongly favors a hormonal effect. I should confirm that persistent, heavy, or recurrent bleeding merits evaluation for structural or infectious causes, but isolated, light spotting a few days after levonorgestrel is typically self-limited and not pathologic [^114cNTF1] [^1156xuXo].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-focused plan. First, provide reassurance that early, light spotting within days of Plan B is a recognized, generally benign effect and often resolves spontaneously. Second, advise pregnancy testing if the expected period is more than a week late or if symptoms such as breast tenderness, nausea, or new pelvic pain occur, using a sensitive home test or clinic testing. Third, give strict return precautions for severe lower abdominal pain, syncope, or shoulder pain, which could signal ectopic pregnancy. Fourth, initiate or resume routine contraception promptly after EC, using backup for 7 days or until the next period/withdrawal bleed when starting hormones after LNG, to reduce future EC needs and stabilize cycles. Finally, document the bleeding pattern and follow up if irregularities persist beyond the next cycle or if the patient has risk factors for ectopic pregnancy or structural uterine disease [^114cNTF1] [^1117aEDK] [^112gkcvQ] [^1156xuXo].

> In conclusion, the most likely cause of spotting 10 days before the expected period after Plan B taken yesterday is a transient hormonal effect from levonorgestrel altering endometrial shedding and cycle timing; this is common and usually self-limited. I should confirm that EC failure remains possible, so timely pregnancy testing and awareness of ectopic warning signs are essential, while also counseling on routine contraception initiation and when to seek further evaluation for persistent or atypical bleeding [^114cNTF1] [^112xQpxE] [^1117aEDK].

Early spotting 10 days before a period after Plan B is most often due to **hormonal disruption** from levonorgestrel [^114cNTF1], causing breakthrough bleeding or an early, lighter period [^112xQpxE]. Other causes include **implantation bleeding** if ovulation occurred before Plan B, **ectopic pregnancy** (rare but serious) [^117HVy2H], and pre-existing conditions such as cervical polyps, infection, or hormonal imbalance [^111XEQbt]. Spotting is common after Plan B and usually resolves; however, if bleeding is heavy, persistent, or accompanied by pain, fever, or a missed period, evaluate for pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or other pathology [^112gkcvQ] [^1144n69m].

---

## Physiological effects of Plan B on menstrual cycle

Plan B contains levonorgestrel, a progestin that **delays ovulation** and alters the endometrium, which can cause cycle changes and spotting [^1144n69m]. Spotting or bleeding within days of Plan B is common and usually benign [^112xQpxE].

---

## Common causes of early spotting after Plan B

### Hormonal disruption

Hormonal disruption from levonorgestrel can cause **breakthrough bleeding** — unscheduled spotting or light bleeding from altered endometrial stability — or an **early period**, with bleeding starting earlier and lighter than usual [^114cNTF1] [^112xQpxE].

---

### Implantation bleeding

Implantation bleeding is a **light, early bleed** that may occur if ovulation happened before Plan B and fertilization occurred; Plan B does not work after fertilization [^114cNTF1].

---

### Ectopic pregnancy

Ectopic pregnancy is rare but serious; Plan B does not prevent it, and early spotting with unilateral pain or a missed period warrants evaluation [^117HVy2H] [^114cNTF1].

---

## Less common causes of early spotting

- **Cervical polyps**: Benign growths that can bleed with hormonal changes.
- **Cervical ectropion**: Sensitive endocervical tissue exposed to hormones.
- **Infection**: STIs like chlamydia or gonorrhea can cause spotting.
- **Hormonal imbalance**: Pre-existing thyroid or endocrine issues [^111XEQbt].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Pregnancy test**: If the next period is > 1 week late, test for pregnancy [^notfound].
- **Ectopic evaluation**: Test if there is pain, a missed period, or a positive test [^114cNTF1].
- **Persistent bleeding**: Evaluate if bleeding lasts > 7 days or is heavy [^111qH6Y6].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek care for **heavy bleeding** (soaking pads), **persistent bleeding** (> 7 days), **severe pain** (especially unilateral), **fever or discharge** (possible infection), or a **missed period** (> 1 week late) [^114cNTF1] [^1144n69m].

## Causes of early spotting after Plan B

| **Cause** | **Description** | **Frequency** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hormonal disruption | Breakthrough bleeding or early period | Common | Usually benign |
| Implantation bleeding | Early sign of pregnancy | Rare | Possible pregnancy |
| Ectopic pregnancy | Rare, serious | Rare | Requires urgent care |
| Cervical polyps | Benign growths | Rare | Usually benign |
| Infection | STI-related bleeding | Rare | Treatable |
| Hormonal imbalance | Pre-existing endocrine issues | Rare | May need evaluation |

---

Early spotting 10 days before a period after Plan B is **usually from hormonal disruption** [^114cNTF1] but can also signal implantation, ectopic pregnancy, or other pathology. Most cases resolve; **evaluate if bleeding is heavy, persistent, or accompanied by pain or a missed period** [^1117aEDK].

### Ectopic pregnancy after plan B emergency contraceptive use [^117HVy2H]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy outcomes after emergency contraceptive use has been debated over time, but review of the literature includes mechanisms by which these medications may increase the chance of an ectopic pregnancy. Such cases are infrequently reported, and many emergency providers may not readily consider this possibility when treating patients.

Case Report

This is a case presentation of ectopic pregnancy in a patient who had recently used Plan B (levonorgestrel) emergency contraceptive. She presented with abdominal pain and vaginal spotting, and was evaluated by serum testing and pelvic ultrasound. She was discovered to have a right adnexal pregnancy. She was treated initially with methotrexate, though she ultimately required surgery for definitive treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case report aims to bring a unique clinical case to the attention of emergency providers. The goal is to review research on the topic of levonorgestrel use and the incidence of ectopic pregnancies. The mechanism of action of this emergency contraceptive is addressed, and though no definite causal relationship is known between levonorgestrel and ectopic pregnancies, there is a pharmacologic explanation for how this event may occur after use of this medication. Ultimately, the emergency provider will be reminded of the importance of educating the patient on the possible outcomes after its use, including failure of an emergency contraceptive and the potential of ectopic pregnancy.

### Effect of hormonal emergency contraception on bleeding patterns [^112xQpxE]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

Spotting following the use of emergency contraception is not unusual, nor is anxiety in women waiting to see if the treatment has worked. It is not known whether such spotting should bring worry or relief. We, therefore, wished to see if there was any correlation between bleeding pattern and treatment outcome. Using data from a large multicenter efficacy trial, we examined bleeding patterns post-emergency contraception. The earlier in the cycle the pills were taken, the more likely the next bleed was to be early and the less likely it was to be on time. There was no observable difference in spotting rates between women who got pregnant and those who did not. The occurrence of spotting did not influence whether the next period was lighter or heavier.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Ectopic Pregnancy: Women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking Plan B should be evaluated for ectopic pregnancy. (5.1)
Plan B is not effective in terminating an existing pregnancy. (5.2)
Effect on menses: Plan B may alter the next expected menses. If menses is delayed beyond 1 week, pregnancy should be considered. (5.3)
STI/HIV: Plan B does not protect against STI/HIV. (5.4)

5.1 Ectopic Pregnancy

Ectopic pregnancies account for approximately 2% of all reported pregnancies. Up to 10% of pregnancies reported in clinical studies of routine use of progestin-only contraceptives are ectopic.

A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to use of this emergency contraceptive method. Healthcare providers, however, should consider the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking Plan B. A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or pregnancy status of any woman after taking Plan B.

5.2 Existing Pregnancy

Plan B is not effective in terminating an existing pregnancy.

5.3 Effects on Menses

Some women may experience spotting a few days after taking Plan B. Menstrual bleeding patterns are often irregular among women using progestin-only oral contraceptives and women using levonorgestrel for postcoital and emergency contraception.

If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, consider the possibility of pregnancy.

5.4 STI/HIV

Plan B does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

5.5 Physical Examination and Follow-up

A physical examination is not required prior to prescribing Plan B. A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or pregnancy status of any woman after taking Plan B.

5.6 Fertility Following Discontinuation

A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with Plan B for emergency contraception; therefore, routine contraception should be continued or initiated as soon as possible following use of Plan B to ensure ongoing prevention of pregnancy.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Women using Daysee may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

When prescribing Daysee, the occurrence of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Daysee also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N = 1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Daysee, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 2 shows the percentage of Daysee subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle.

Figure 2: Percent of Women Taking Daysee who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding

If unscheduled spotting or bleeding occurs, instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen. If the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Daysee may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant.

If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy.

After discontinuation of Daysee, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol (Zafemy) [^115xVmuE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using ZAFEMY. Consider non-hormonal causes and take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out malignancy, other pathology, or pregnancy in the event of unscheduled bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology and pregnancy have been excluded, time or a change to another contraceptive product may resolve the bleeding.

In the clinical trials, most women started their scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding on the fourth day of the drug-free interval, and the median duration of withdrawal bleeding was 5 to 6 days. On average, 26% of women per cycle had 7 or more total days of bleeding and/or spotting (this includes both scheduled and unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting). Three clinical studies of the efficacy of ZAFEMY in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)] in 3,330 women who completed 22,155 cycles of exposure. A total of 36 (1.1%) of the women discontinued ZAFEMY at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

Table 2 summarizes the proportion of subjects who experienced unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding/spotting by treatment cycle.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

In the event of amenorrhea, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one patch or started the patch on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of hormonal contraceptive use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.10 Hormonal Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy

Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue ZAFEMY use if pregnancy is confirmed.

Administration of CHCs should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

DAY 1 START

Counting the first day of menstruation as "Day 1", tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, one green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days followed by 1 yellow (ethinyl estradiol) tablet daily for 5 days. For all subsequent cycles, the patient then begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the next day after taking the last yellow tablet. [If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first white tablet should be taken on the first day of menstruation which begins after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product.]

If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or if the patient misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills.

ALL ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, non-functional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If both pregnancy and pathology have been excluded, time or a change to another preparation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol (Xulane) [^111shGGU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Breakthrough Bleeding or Spotting

In the event of unscheduled or breakthrough bleeding or spotting (bleeding that occurs on the days that Xulane is worn), treatment should be continued. If unscheduled bleeding persists longer than a few cycles, consider causes other than Xulane.

If the woman does not have scheduled or withdrawal bleeding (bleeding that should occur during the patch-free week), she should resume treatment on the next scheduled Change Day. If Xulane has been used correctly, the absence of withdrawal bleeding is not necessarily an indication of pregnancy. Nevertheless, consider the possibility of pregnancy, especially if absence of withdrawal bleeding occurs in 2 consecutive cycles. Discontinue Xulane if pregnancy is confirmed.

In Case of Skin Irritation

If patch use results in uncomfortable irritation, the patch may be removed and a new patch may be applied to a different location until the next Change Day. Only one patch should be worn at a time.

Additional Instructions for Dosing

Unscheduled bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing hormonal contraceptives. In case of breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, consider nonfunctional causes. In case of undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another method of contraception may solve the problem.

Use of Hormonal Contraceptives in the Event of a Missed Menstrual Period

If the woman has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period. Discontinue use of Xulane if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the woman has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses one period, she should continue using her contraceptive patches. However, if she has adhered to the prescribed regimen, misses one period and has symptoms associated with pregnancy, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Xulane use if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the woman has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Xulane use if pregnancy is confirmed.

5.9	Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. Consider non-hormonal causes and take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out malignancy, other pathology, or pregnancy in the event of unscheduled bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology and pregnancy have been excluded, time or a change to another contraceptive product may resolve the bleeding.

In the clinical trials, most women started their scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding on the fourth day of the drug-free interval, and the median duration of withdrawal bleeding was 5 to 6 days. On average, 26% of women per cycle had 7 or more total days of bleeding and/or spotting (this includes both scheduled and unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting). Three clinical studies of the efficacy of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)] in 3,330 women who completed 22,155 cycles of exposure. A total of 36 (1.1%) of the women discontinued norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

Table 2 summarizes the proportion of subjects who experienced unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding/spotting by treatment cycle.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

In the event of amenorrhea, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one patch or started the patch on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of hormonal contraceptive use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

5.10 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N = 2,467) show that the percent of women who took Zarah and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the Zarah trials (< 1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia.

The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4–7 days. Women who use Zarah tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1–11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.11 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy

Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned.

The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.12 Depression

Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Zarah discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Women using Simpesse may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

When prescribing Simpesse, the occurrence of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Simpesse also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N = 1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%).

Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 2 shows the percentage of Simpesse subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle.

If unscheduled spotting or bleeding occurs, instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen. If the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Simpesse may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant.

If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy.

After discontinuation of Simpesse, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.

### Levonorgestrel (plan B) [^117DWihH]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

A double-blind, randomized, multinational controlled clinical trial in 1,955 evaluable women (mean age 27) compared the efficacy and safety of Plan B (one 0.75 mg tablet of levonorgestrel taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, and one tablet taken 12 hours later) to the Yuzpe regimen (two tablets each containing 0.25 mg levonorgestrel and 0.05 mg ethinyl estradiol, taken within 72 hours of intercourse, and two additional tablets taken 12 hours later). After a single act of intercourse occurring anytime during the menstrual cycle, the expected pregnancy rate of 8% (with no contraceptive use) was reduced to approximately 1% with Plan B.

Emergency contraceptives are not as effective as routine hormonal contraception since their failure rate, while low based on a single use, would accumulate over time with repeated use [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1)].

At the time of expected menses, approximately 74% of women using Plan B had vaginal bleeding similar to their normal menses, 14% bled more than usual, and 12% bled less than usual. The majority of women (87%) had their next menstrual period at the expected time or within + 7 days, while 13% had a delay of more than 7 days beyond the anticipated onset of menses.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Ocella) [^111dKEcW]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What Should I Know about My Period when Taking OCELLA?

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking OCELLA. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.

Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long has you have taken the pills regularly on time.

What if I Miss My Scheduled Period when Taking OCELLA?

It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you miss two periods in a row or miss one period when you have not taken your birth control pills regularly on time, call your healthcare provider. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking OCELLA if you are pregnant.

### Recommendations for standardization of bleeding data analyses in contraceptive studies [^113abpTx]. Contraception (2022). Medium credibility.

To address limitations that exist with existing definitions of menstrual bleeding changes that occur with contraceptive methods, we assembled a panel to develop new recommendations for standardization of bleeding data analyses associated with contraceptive use to better inform users, clinicians, investigators, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies. We propose three criteria for assessing bleeding outcomes: pattern, flow, and duration. The descriptors within each criterion depend on whether the contraceptive is designed to result in a predictable or unpredictable bleeding pattern. Predictable pattern outcomes quantify days of scheduled, unscheduled and no bleeding, while unpredictable pattern outcomes assess frequency. Flow is quantified based on patient comparisons to their typical flow when not using contraception, with spotting representing no menstrual products use. Duration of a prolonged bleeding and/or spotting episode is more than 7 days. Studies should assess bleeding characteristics for a minimum of 12 months for 21/7, 24/4, extended cycle or continuous regimens, two years for injectables, and the full duration of use for long-acting contraceptives. Describing pattern, flow and duration as independent categories allows a fuller understanding of the bleeding outcomes and better future assessments of acceptability and continuation. Standardization of outcomes permits better comparison between studies and data synthesis; standardization will also improve the ability of clinicians and patients to understand differences between products.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^113mXMCa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Bleeding irregularities with extended or continuous use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — before initiation of CHCs, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during extended or continuous CHC use. Extended contraceptive use has been defined as a planned hormone-free interval after more than 28 days of active hormones, and continuous contraceptive use has been defined as uninterrupted use of hormonal contraception without a hormone-free interval. Spotting or bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of extended or continuous CHC use.

### Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (lomedia 24 Fe) [^114GVC5j]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs:

The patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her healthcare provider. Although pregnancy is unlikely if Lomedia 24 Fe is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. Hormonal contraceptives should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.

For additional patient instructions regarding missed pills:

See the "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS" section in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING. Any time the patient misses two or more white tablets, she should also use another method of non-hormonal back-up contraception until she has taken a white tablet daily for seven consecutive days. If the patient misses one or more brown tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking the active white tablets again on the proper day. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed white tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. The possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled white tablets are missed. Therefore, the risk of pregnancy increases with each active (white) tablet missed.

Use after pregnancy, abortion or miscarriage:

Lomedia 24 Fe should be initiated no earlier than 28 days postpartum in the nonlactating mother due to the increased risk for thromboembolism. When the tablets are administered in the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS concerning thromboembolic disease). The patient should be advised to use a non-hormonal back-up method for the first 7 days of tablet taking. However, if intercourse has already occurred, the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.

Lomedia 24 Fe may be initiated after a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage; if the patient starts Lomedia 24 Fe immediately, additional contraceptive measures are not needed.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Syeda) [^117TQUqV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.10 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N = 2,467) show that the percent of women who took drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol trials (< 1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia.

The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1 to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.11 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy

Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned.

The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (falessa) [^115NHMR4]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Switching From Another Hormonal Method of Contraception

When the patient is switching from a 21 day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week. She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21 day regimen. When the patient is switching from a 28 day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets on the day after her last tablet. She should not wait any days between packs. The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets the next day. If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due. In switching from a progestin-only pill, injection, or implant, the patient should be advised to use a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.

If Spotting or Breakthrough Bleeding Occurs

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occur, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her physician.

Risk of Pregnancy if Tablets are Missed

While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two orange tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled orange tablets are missed. Although the occurrence of pregnancy is unlikely if Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

The risk of pregnancy increases with each active (orange) tablet missed. For additional patient instructions regarding missed tablets, see the WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING below.

### Bleeding patterns after immediate vs. conventional oral contraceptive initiation: a randomized, controlled trial [^111EnSod]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare bleeding patterns after immediate vs. conventional oral contraceptive (OC) initiation.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting

University-based clinic.

Patient(S)

One hundred thirteen women initiating combination OCs.

Intervention(S)

Participants received a 4-month supply of a monophasic 35-microg ethinyl E(2) (EE) OC and a bleeding diary, were randomized to immediate or conventional OC start, underwent monthly telephone follow-up, and after 90 days returned the diary and completed an exit interview.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Total number of bleeding-spotting days, using the World Health Organization 90-day reference period method. Comparisons were made by trial assignment (immediate vs. conventional) and cycle day of OC initiation (day 8+ vs. days 1–7).

Result(S)

There was no significant difference in the number of bleeding-spotting days (mean difference: -0.5 days; 95% CI: -3.4 to 2.3) or any other bleeding parameter between the immediate and conventional starters, or days 1–7 and day 8+ starters.

Conclusion(S)

Immediate start of OCs does not induce bleeding patterns different from conventional starting regimens. Concern about adverse bleeding patterns should not be considered a justification for instructing women to wait until menses before starting OCs.

5.10 Headache

If a woman using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring if indicated.

Consider discontinuation of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in the case of an increased frequency or severity of migraine during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)].

5.11 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.

Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N = 1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1–13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N = 1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N = 512).

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.

Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.

If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^117LhHN2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous CHCs, information about common side effects such as spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Bleeding irregularities usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method. To avoid spotting or bleeding, counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing; for users of contraceptive pills, emphasize consistent pill use. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

A systematic review identified three studies with small study populations that addressed treatments for breakthrough bleeding among women using extended or continuous CHCs. In two separate RCTs in which women were taking either contraceptive pills or using the contraceptive ring continuously for 168 days, women assigned to a hormone-free interval of 3 or 4 days reported improved bleeding. Although they noted an initial increase in flow, this was followed by an abrupt decrease 7–8 days later with eventual cessation of flow 11–12 days later. These findings were compared with those among women who continued to use their method without a hormone-free interval, in which a greater proportion reported either treatment failure or fewer days of amenorrhea. In another randomized trial of 66 women with breakthrough bleeding among women using 84 days of hormonally active contraceptive pills, oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) initiated the first day of bleeding and taken for 5 days did not result in any improvement in bleeding compared with placebo (Level of evidence: I, fair, direct).

5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.

In a clinical trial of Junel Fe 24, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 743 women (3,823 28-day cycles). A total of 10 subjects (1.3%) discontinued Junel Fe 24, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trial, [24 to 38%] of women using Junel Fe 24 experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the six months of the trial. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Junel Fe 24 may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. In the clinical trial with Junel Fe 24, 31 to 41% of the women using Junel Fe 24 did not have a withdrawal menses in at least one of 6 cycles of use.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy

Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Junel Fe 24 use if pregnancy is confirmed.

Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Initiating hormonal contraception [^1177BZYp]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Most patients can safely begin using hormonal contraception at any point in their menstrual cycle. An evidence-based, flexible, patient-centered approach to initiating contraception promotes health and enhances patients' reproductive autonomy. A recent Papanicolaou test is not necessary before prescribing hormonal contraception. Most patients can begin using progestin-only contraceptives immediately after childbirth. Patients can begin any appropriate contraceptive method immediately after an abortion or early pregnancy loss, except for an intrauterine device following septic abortion. Delaying contraception to wait for the next menses or for an appointment creates unnecessary barriers for patients. Clinicians can facilitate the use of hormonal contraception by providing anticipatory guidance about common side effects (e.g., spotting, other menstrual cycle changes), giving comprehensive information about available contraceptive choices, honoring patients' preferences, and eliminating office-related barriers. Prescribing or dispensing a one-year supply of contraceptives lowers costs and improves adherence. Counseling via telemedicine or a patient portal eliminates unnecessary office visits.

### Levonorgestrel (plan B one-step) [^1169NPoC]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

A double-blind, randomized, multicenter, multinational study evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of three different regimens for emergency contraception. Subjects were enrolled at 15 sites in 10 countries; the racial/ethnic characteristics of the study population overall were 54% Chinese, 34% Caucasian, and 12% Black or Asian (other than Chinese). 2,381 healthy women with a mean age of 27 years, who needed emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse were involved and randomly allocated into one of the two levonorgestrel groups. A single dose of 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel (Plan B One-Step) was administered to women allocated into group 1. Two doses of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel 12 hours apart (Plan B) were administered to women in group 2. In the Plan B One-Step group, 16 pregnancies occurred in 1,198 women and in the Plan B group, 20 pregnancies occurred in 1,183 women. The number of pregnancies expected in each group was calculated based on the timing of intercourse with regard to each woman's menstrual cycle. Among women receiving Plan B One-Step, 84% of expected pregnancies were prevented and among those women taking Plan B, 79% of expected pregnancies were prevented. The expected pregnancy rate of 8% (with no contraceptive use) was reduced to approximately 1% with Plan B One-Step.

Emergency contraceptives are not as effective as routine contraception since their failure rate, while low based on a single use, would accumulate over time with repeated use [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1)].

In the clinical study, bleeding disturbances were the most common adverse event reported after taking the levonorgestrel-containing regimens. More than half of the women had menses within two days of the expected time; however, 31% of women experienced change in their bleeding pattern during the study period; 4.5% of women had menses more than 7 days after the expected time.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive counseling for transgender and gender diverse people who were female sex assigned at birth [^114NS38b]. Contraception (2020). High credibility.

Estrogen-containing contraceptives in TGD individuals, including those on testosterone therapy — anticipated effects, risks, and dosing: Estrogen-containing products, such as oral contraceptive pills, the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring, can be used cyclically or continuously; when used in a cyclic fashion, with 21 or 24 days of hormones followed by a hormone-free interval, most cisgender women will have a withdrawal bleed in the hormone-free interval, whereas continuous or extended cycle use does not have a scheduled withdrawal bleed, and those who use these products continuously may have fewer total days of bleeding or spotting compared to cyclic use. Expert clinical experience suggests that bleeding is unlikely to occur if amenorrheic on testosterone therapy and the products are used continuously [GRADE 2C]. Estradiol increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) production from the liver, which binds circulating free testosterone, and combined hormonal contraceptives can also block androgen receptors; use of combined hormonal contraception also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism by three to six times in presumed cisgender women compared to non-use, but the absolute difference is small and has not been considered clinically significant in the absence of other risk factors. Given the lack of data specific to TGD individuals using gender-affirming testosterone in combination with estrogen-containing contraceptives, it is reasonable to consider avoiding these products unless there is a clear benefit for the patient or strong patient preference; if used, providers can consider products with a lower estrogen dose, for example a combined oral contraceptive that contains ethinyl estradiol with a lower daily dose (10–20 μg), although there are no published data to support this decision and lower estradiol doses may lead to increased unscheduled bleeding and it is unclear if there are clinically significant benefits to this approach.

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES:

In addition to the risks and more serious side effects discussed above (see RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY and WARNING SIGNALS sections above), the following may also occur:

1. **Vaginal Bleeding**:

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or health care provider.

2. **Gastrointestinal Effects**:

The most frequent, unpleasant side effects are nausea and vomiting, stomach cramps, bloating, and a change in appetite.

3. **Contact Lenses**:

If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your doctor or health care provider.

4. **Fluid Retention**:

Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your doctor or health care professional.

5. **Melasma**:

A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.

6. **Other Side Effects**:

Other side effects may include change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, and vaginal infections.

If any of these side effects bother you, call your doctor or health care professional.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^111XEQbt]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Bleeding irregularities during injectable use — before DMPA initiation, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during DMPA use. Amenorrhea and spotting or light bleeding are common with DMPA use, heavy or prolonged bleeding can occur, these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome, and spotting, light bleeding, and heavy or prolonged bleeding might decrease with continued DMPA use. For spotting or light bleeding, if clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition such as interactions with other medications, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions including polyps or fibroids.

### Extended regimens of the contraceptive vaginal ring: a randomized trial [^1174Py7e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the bleeding patterns and tolerability of 3 different extended ring regimens with those of the standard 28-day cycle with 21 days of contraceptive vaginal ring use followed by 7 ring-free days.

Methods

Following a run-in 28-day ring cycle, women were randomized to 1 of 4 regimens: monthly (28-day cycle), every other month (49-day cycle), every third month (91-day cycle), or continuous (364-day cycle). Treatment duration was 1 year. Daily bleeding diary, interval visit questionnaire, and examination data were collected.

Results

A total of 561 women were enrolled, 429 were subsequently randomized, and 289 (67.4%) women completed the entire year. All schedules were well tolerated and acceptable to women, but study completion rates were higher for the shorter cycles. Bleeding days were reduced with postponement of the withdrawal bleeding (ring-free) week, but spotting days increased. For example, women using the continuous or 364-day ring cycle reported a median of zero bleeding days but 10–12 days of spotting during the first 3 months of extended use. Unscheduled bleeding during ring use was the lowest with the traditional 28-day cycle. Adverse events, blood pressure, body weight, and laboratory findings were comparable over the 4 treatment groups.

Conclusion

The combination vaginal contraceptive ring can be used for extended cycles to alter the bleeding schedule. Women willing to tolerate some spotting might choose the longer extensions to have fewer menstrual periods.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: emergency contraception [^115ZJpQE]. Contraception (2023). High credibility.

Emergency contraception in an unknowingly pregnant patient and intrauterine device (IUD) timing — clinical considerations — include that for patients who take LNG ECPs while unknowingly pregnant or who conceive as a result of LNG ECP failure, there is no concern for associated pregnancy-related toxicity; for patients choosing copper or LNG IUDs for emergency contraception who report unprotected intercourse more than five days before planned insertion, the potential presence of a preimplantation fertilized ovum should be considered, and studies demonstrate that pregnancy is uncommon in such situations following IUD placement; if pregnancy occurs with an IUD in situ, risks of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and septic abortion are elevated, and removal decreases risks though they remain above baseline without an IUD.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114V2e71]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — counseling and management of bleeding irregularities emphasize that bleeding changes generally decrease with continued CHC use. If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition and, if found, treat the condition or refer for care. If the patient wants treatment, advise the patient to discontinue CHC use (i.e., a hormone-free interval) for 3–4 consecutive days; a hormone-free interval is not recommended during the first 21 days of using the continuous or extended CHC method, and a hormone-free interval is not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous CHCs, information about common side effects such as spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed; these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome and usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method, and counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing and, for users of contraceptive pills, consistent pill use.

### Extended regimens of the vaginal contraceptive ring: cycle control [^111LobMb]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Oral contraceptives used for extended periods of time have been extensively studied because of their potential benefits; however, there have been few publications on extended regimen of vaginal rings. The aim of this study was to compare the bleeding patterns of women using extended regimens of the vaginal ring or oral contraceptives.

Study Design

Prospective cohort involving 150 women: 75 used vaginal rings that release 120 mcg of etonogestrel and 15 mcg of ethinyl estradiol daily, and 75 took oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol 0.3 mcg and desogestrel 150 mcg. Both groups used their respective contraceptive method over continuous periods of 84 days, followed by a 7-day pause, during 1 year.

Results

The total number of scheduled bleeding and spotting days decreased significantly during the 1-year period of the study for both methods (p = .001), and this decrease was significantly higher for oral contraceptive users. Similarly, during the study period, there was a significant reduction in the total number of unscheduled bleeding and spotting days for both methods (p = .01), but this decrease was significantly higher among vaginal ring users (p = .003).

Conclusion

Vaginal ring used on an extended regimen is a contraceptive method that offers good cycle control.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (delyla) [^116EbGkP]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Switching from another hormonal method of contraception

When the patient is switching from a 21–day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts DELYLA. She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week. She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21–day regimen. When the patient is switching from a 28-day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of DELYLA on the day after her last tablet. She should not wait any days between packs. The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin DELYLA the next day. If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start DELYLA on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due. In switching from a progestin-only pill, injection, or implant, the patient should be advised to use a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occur, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her physician.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Zarah) [^115MF6wZ]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

When switching from a method other than a birth control pill

When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, Zarah should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, Zarah should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, Zarah should be started on the day of removal.

Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last blue tablet. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking Zarah, instruct the patient to continue taking Zarah by the regimen described above. Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, she should consult her healthcare provider.

Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if Zarah is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Zarah if pregnancy is confirmed.

The risk of pregnancy increases with each active blue tablet missed. For additional patient instructions regarding missed pills, see the "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS" section in the FDA-Approved Patient Labeling. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more peach tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of blue tablets on the proper day.

For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start Zarah no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts Zarah postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken Zarah for 7 consecutive days.

2.3 Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances

In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting occurs within 3–4 hours after tablet-taking, this can be regarded as a missed tablet.

Bleeding Irregularities with Cu-IUD Use

Before Cu-IUD placement, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during Cu-IUD use. Spotting or light bleeding and heavy or prolonged bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of Cu-IUD use, is generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient, and generally decreases with continued Cu-IUD use.
If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as Cu-IUD displacement, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids), especially in patients who have already been using the Cu-IUD for a few months or longer and who have developed a new onset of heavy or prolonged bleeding. If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued Cu-IUD use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or Cu-IUD removal. If the patient wants to continue Cu-IUD use, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if it is desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient desires Cu-IUD removal at any time, remove the Cu-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option may be considered during days of bleeding, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: º NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days

5.10 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Data from ten Yasmin®contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N = 2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin®and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 25 subjects out of 3,009 in the Yasmin®and drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets trials (< 1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia.

The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from Yasmin®contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1 to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.11 Depression

Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.

Bleeding Irregularities (Including Amenorrhea) During Implant Use

Before implant placement, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during implant use. Spotting or light bleeding is common with implant use, and certain implant users experience amenorrhea. These bleeding changes are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Bleeding changes might or might not decrease with continued implant use. Heavy bleeding is uncommon during implant use.

Bleeding Irregularities (Spotting, Light Bleeding, or Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding)

If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as interactions with other medications, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued implant use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or implant removal. If the patient wants to continue implant use, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if it is desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient desires implant removal at any time, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use; bleeding is likely to recur after treatment cessation. Treatment may be repeated as needed. Hormonal treatment (e.g. 20–30 µ g EE COCs or estrogen) Antifibrinolytic agents (e.g. tranexamic acid), 5 days º Treatments that might improve bleeding irregularities during treatment use and whose effects might persist for some time after treatment cessation.

Bleeding Irregularities with Extended or Continuous Use of CHCs

Before initiation of CHCs, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during extended or continuous CHC use. Extended contraceptive use has been defined as a planned hormone-free interval after more than 28 days of active hormones. Continuous contraceptive use has been defined as uninterrupted use of hormonal contraception without a hormone-free interval.
Spotting or bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of extended or continuous CHC use. Spotting or bleeding is generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Bleeding changes generally decrease with continued CHC use.
If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as inconsistent use, interactions with other medications, cigarette smoking, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued CHCs (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or discontinuation of CHCs. If the patient wants to continue CHCs, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if it is desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient wants to discontinue CHCs at any time, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option may be considered: º Advise the patient to discontinue CHC use (i.e. a hormone-free interval) for 3–4 consecutive days; a hormone-free interval is not recommended during the first 21 days of using the continuous or extended CHC method. A hormone-free interval also is not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced.

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Data from ten Yasmin contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N = 2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 25 subjects out of 3,009 in the Yasmin and Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium trials (< 1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia.

The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4–7 days. Women who use Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from Yasmin contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1–11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.11 Depression

Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.

Amenorrhea

Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance. º If a patient's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated.
If the patient desires implant removal, remove the implant, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the implant, information about common side effects, such as spotting or light bleeding and amenorrhea, especially during the first year of use, should be discussed. A pooled analysis of data from 11 clinical trials indicates that a significant proportion of ENG implant users had relatively little bleeding: 22% of women experienced amenorrhea and 34% experienced infrequent spotting, although 7% reported frequent bleeding and 18% reported prolonged bleeding. Bleeding or amenorrhea is generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

During Week 3: The woman should discard that ring. One of the following two options should be chosen:

1. Insert a new ring immediately. Inserting a new ring will start the next three-week use period. The woman may not experience a withdrawal bleed from her previous cycle. However, breakthrough spotting or bleeding may occur.

2. Insert a new ring no later than seven days from the time the previous ring was removed or expelled, during which time she may have a withdrawal bleed. This option should only be chosen if the ring was used continuously for at least seven days prior to inadvertent removal/expulsion.

In either case, a barrier method such as male condoms with spermicides must be used until the new ring has been used continuously for seven days.

If EnilloRing was out of the vagina for an unknown amount of time, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered. A pregnancy test should be performed prior to inserting a new ring.

Prolonged Ring-Free Interval:

If the ring-free interval has been extended beyond one week, consider the possibility of pregnancy, and an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, MUST be used until EnilloRing has been used continuously for seven days.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Zumandimine) [^111VPy2G]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

When switching from a different birth control pill

When switching from another birth control pill, Zumandimine should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous oral contraceptive would have been started.

When switching from a method other than a birth control pill

When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, Zumandimine should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, Zumandimine should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, Zumandimine should be started on the day of removal.

Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last light pink to pink tablet. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking Zumandimine, instruct the patient to continue taking Zumandimine by the regimen described above. Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, she should consult her healthcare provider.

Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if Zumandimine is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Zumandimine if pregnancy is confirmed.

The risk of pregnancy increases with each active light pink to pink tablet missed. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more green tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of light pink to pink tablets on the proper day.

For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start Zumandimine no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts Zumandimine postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken Zumandimine for 7 consecutive days.

### Emergency contraception [^115qF67V]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Women can use emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy after known or suspected failure of birth control or after unprotected intercourse. Many patients do not ask for emergency contraception because they do not know of its availability. Emergency contraception has been an off-label use of oral contraceptive pills since the 1960s. Dedicated products, the Yuzpe regimen (Preven) and levonorgestrel (Plan B), were marketed in the United States after 1998 but had been available in Europe for years before that. A third approved method of emergency contraception is the insertion of an intrauterine device. Emergency contraception is about 75 to 85 percent effective. It is most effective when initiated within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. The mechanism of action may vary, depending on the day of the menstrual cycle on which treatment is started. Despite the large number of women who have received emergency contraception, there have been no reports of major adverse outcomes. If a woman becomes pregnant after using emergency contraception, she may be reassured about the lack of negative effects emergency contraception has on fetal development. It may be beneficial for physicians to offer an advance prescription for emergency contraception at a patient's regular gynecologic visit to help reduce unwanted pregnancies. Advance provision of emergency contraception can increase its use significantly without adversely affecting the use of routine contraception.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: emergency contraception [^112oJJx1]. Contraception (2023). Medium credibility.

Emergency contraception (EC) refers to several contraceptive options that can be used within a few days after unprotected or under protected intercourse or sexual assault to reduce the risk of pregnancy. Current EC options available in the United States include the copper intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrel (LNG) 52 mg IUD, oral LNG (such as Plan B One-Step, My Way, Take Action), and oral ulipristal acetate (UPA) (ella). These clinical recommendations review the indications, effectiveness, safety, and side effects of emergency contraceptive methods; considerations for the use of EC by specific patient populations and in specific clinical circumstances and current barriers to emergency contraceptive access. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of LNG IUDs for emergency contraceptive use; address the effects of repeated use of UPA at different times in the same menstrual cycle; assess the impact on ovulation of initiating or reinitiating different regimens of regular hormonal contraception following UPA use; and elucidate effective emergency contraceptive pill options by body mass indices or weight.

Additionally, approximately 19% of women in the United States report a history of rape or attempted rape in their lifetime. Patients present to various settings to inquire about or access EC, including emergency departments, clinics, urgent care centers, and pharmacies, and health care providers working in such settings should be knowledgeable about EC options and facilitate the provision of these methods in a time-sensitive manner.

### What every cardiologist should know about contraception and reproductive planning in 2025 [^1177Q3hR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION

Though available for decades, EC was not US Food and Drug Administration approved until 1998 in the form of a combination of oral ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. A year later the levonorgestrel‐only pill (Plan B) was approved for EC use. EC effectively reduces the chance of pregnancy after intercourse when contraception was not used, used incorrectly, or failed. As such it is not medical abortion. EC is legal throughout the United States and per the US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, there is no situation where the risk outweighs its benefits. As abortion access becomes more restrictive across the United States, timely use of EC to prevent unintended pregnancy is critically important to reduce unplanned pregnancy for all individuals. Therefore, it is essential for cardiologists to be aware of EC options. Since EC is unfamiliar for most cardiologists, we recommend that all cardiology practices maintain relationships with local gynecologic providers or cardio‐obstetric specialists who are willing to create a workflow for timely provision of EC.

EC is broadly classified into 2 categories: IUDs and oral medication. Copper IUDs are the most effective form of EC and can be effective up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse (Figure 2, Table 3). Copper IUDs negatively impact sperm viability and function, as well as the oocyte and endometrial implantation. Insertions are performed by trained providers (typically gynecology, internal or family medicine). Approximately 12% of patients experience irregular and/or heavy vaginal bleeding or pain, and uterine perforations occur in 1/1000 insertions. In addition to providing EC, copper IUDs provide excellent ongoing contraception for 10 years, though it may cause increased bleeding at the time of menses, which may be worsened in individuals on anticoagulation. Emerging evidence also suggests that levonorgestrel IUDs may provide effective EC (ideal for individuals on anticoagulation or for those who desire reduced menses), but additional studies are needed. Strong relationships with local gynecologic providers are essential to allow for timely referrals for placement of copper IUDs for EC.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol, and ferrous fumarate (FEMCON Fe) [^116uPvfD]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

The patient begins her next and all subsequent 28-day courses of tablets on the same day of the week on which she began her first course, following the same schedule: 21 days on white tablets — 7 days on brown tablets. If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control until she has taken a white tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.

When the patient is switching from a 21-day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts FEMCON Fe. She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week. She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21-day regimen. When the patient is switching from a 28-day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of FEMCON Fe on the day after her last tablet. She should not wait any days between packs. The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin FEMCON Fe the next day. If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start FEMCON Fe on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due.

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her healthcare provider. Although pregnancy is unlikely if FEMCON Fe is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. Hormonal contraceptives should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.

### Extended cycle combined hormonal contraception [^114BnSsw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Extended cycle contraception is a safe and acceptable form of contraception and may be more efficacious than cyclic regimens, especially for users of oral contraceptive pills. Most extended cycle regimens result in fewer scheduled bleeding episodes, an outcome desired by many women. They may also result in more unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting episodes that decrease with time. Women who use extended cycle contraception experience fewer menstrual symptoms, particularly headache. Some women have medical conditions or menstrual symptoms that make extended cycle contraception a preferred method. Although we do not have enough data to recommend one particular extended cycle regimen over another, the use of these new regimens will provide women with more options, and almost certainly will improve the acceptability and efficacy of hormonal contraception. In this article, the authors focus on extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive regimens and summarize their acceptability, efficacy, and safety. They also argue that extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive may have increased efficacy compared with traditional cyclic combined hormonal contraceptive.

In either case, a barrier method such as male condoms with spermicides must be used until the new ring has been used continuously for seven days.

If etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring was out of the vagina for an unknown amount of time, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered. A pregnancy test should be performed prior to inserting a new ring.

Contraceptive implant — management of bleeding irregularities (spotting, light bleeding, or heavy or prolonged bleeding) includes that if clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition and treat or refer if found; explore patient goals including continued implant use or implant removal; if removal is desired at any time, remove the implant and counsel on alternatives; and if treatment is desired, options may be considered based on preferences, goals, and history, including treatments that might improve bleeding only during use — hormonal treatment (e.g., 20–30 μg ethinyl estradiol [EE] combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or estrogen) or antifibrinolytic agents (e.g., tranexamic acid), 5 days — with bleeding likely to recur after cessation and treatment may be repeated as needed, and treatments that might improve bleeding with effects that might persist after cessation — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., celecoxib, ibuprofen, or mefenamic acid), 5–7 days, or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g., tamoxifen), 7–10 days — with treatment may be repeated as needed.

### Characterizing physiological and symptomatic variation in menstrual cycles using self-tracked mobile-health data [^114xRf13]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To this end, we select users from the Clue dataset aged 21–33 (because menstrual cycle lengths are relatively less variable, and cycles are more likely to be ovulatory during this age interval,) with natural menstrual cycles (i.e. no hormonal birth control or intrauterine device (IUD)). We define a menstrual cycle as the span of days from the first day of a period through to and including the day before the first day of the next period. A period consists of sequential days of bleeding (greater than spotting and within 10 days after the first greater-than-spotting bleeding event) unbroken by no more than 1 day on which only spotting or no bleeding occurred.

In this paper, we take symptom tracking behavior to be a proxy for true physiological behavior. The Clue tracking categories (summarized in Table 3) encompass a wide range of experiences (subject to user interpretation of the category rather than based on specific validated scales), enabling broad usage of the app to meet individual user needs. Self-tracked data reliability is dependent on consistent and accurate user tracking; for instance, cycle length can be arbitrarily long if a user forgets to track their period, which would skew the analysis of menstrual patterns by misrepresenting a long cycle as due to physiological behavior rather than tracking behavior. We propose a procedure to mitigate such potential engagement artifacts by quantifying engagement with cycle tracking and identifying cycles lacking engagement, allowing us to separate true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. To investigate the spectrum of variability in women's menstrual health experiences, we propose cycle length difference or CLD — the absolute difference between subsequent cycle lengths — as a robust metric for quantifying cycle variability, and we examine users who fall at opposite ends of the variability spectrum.

### Bleeding patterns after immediate initiation of an oral compared with a vaginal hormonal contraceptive [^111mC9nw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study compared 84-day bleeding patterns after immediate initiation of a triphasic oral contraceptive with a 25-mug daily dose of ethinyl estradiol (E2) compared with the contraceptive vaginal ring, which has a 15-mug daily dose of ethinyl E2.

Methods

This was an open-label controlled trial. We randomly assigned 201 women to immediate start of a contraceptive pill or immediate start of the ring in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Our primary outcome was difference in mean bleeding-spotting days per woman according to treatment assignment. Secondary outcomes were differences in World Health Organization-defined menstrual indices, differences in perceived bleeding changes, and differences in bleeding according to cycle day at the start of method.

Results

The mean bleeding-spotting days in the 84-day reference period for all subjects was 19.2 days (17.0 days for ring users and 21.4 days for pill users, mean difference 4.4 days). Using the World Health Organization menstrual indices, the ring users experienced fewer days or episodes of bleeding-spotting and shorter intervals. Among ring users, no baseline characteristics were associated with bleeding outcomes. Older nulliparous pill users, however, reported more bleeding-spotting days. Significantly more ring users reported a decrease in duration of bleeding compared with pill users (P < .01). We found no significant differences in bleeding patterns based on analysis of cycle day at study enrollment.

Conclusion

Our study shows advantageous bleeding patterns for subjects using the contraceptive vaginal ring. It also confirms our previous findings that immediate start of hormonal contraception is an acceptable alternative to waiting for menses.

### Quadriphasic versus monophasic oral contraceptives for contraception [^114Ha5rV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Quadriphasic oral contraceptives have been developed to reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives and are presented as more physiological since they mimic the natural cycle. However, suggested disadvantages of quadriphasic oral contraceptives include a possible increased risk of pill-taking errors caused by the array of different color pills, complicated directions for catching up when a pill is missed, the higher price and potential inferiority in terms of side effects.

Objectives

To compare the contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability of quadriphasic contraceptive pills versus monophasic contraceptive pills.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP for trials comparing quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills. We contacted researchers and manufacturers of quadriphasic oral contraceptives to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing quadriphasic with monophasic oral contraceptives. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, minor side effects, ease of use or trial discontinuation. We excluded studies where the intervention was primarily used as a treatment for disorders or was administered for fewer than three consecutive cycles.

Data Collection and Analysis

T wo authors abstracted and entered data into RevMan. We critically appraised the methodological quality of the included trials. For continuous variables, we computed the mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random-effects model. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio with 95% CI using the random-effects model.

Main Results

We included one double-blind, double-dummy RCT comparing a quadriphasic oral contraceptive composed of dienogest and estradiol valerate with a monophasic oral contraceptive composed of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol. Contraceptive effectiveness, intracyclic bleeding and discontinuation due to side effects were similar for quadriphasic and monophasic pills. The number of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding was higher in the monophasic group compared to the quadriphasic group. Users of quadriphasic pills reported fewer bleeding/spotting days and fewer bleeding/spotting episodes than users of monophasic pills but the report did not specify whether the bleeding/spotting was scheduled or unscheduled. More women using quadriphasic oral contraceptives reported breast pain compared to women using monophasic oral contraceptives.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether quadriphasic differ from monophasic oral contraceptives in contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability. Studies that compare quadriphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives with an identical progestogen and estrogen type are needed to determine whether the quadriphasic approach differs from the monophasic approach. Studies that compare quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol are indicated to determine whether quadriphasic oral contraceptives have an advantage over the current, first choice oral contraceptive. Until then, we recommend monophasic pills containing 30 μg estrogen as the first choice for women starting oral contraceptive use.

### Efficacy of the 1-year (13-cycle) segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system: results of two multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trials [^116erjjA]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Participants used a daily diary card during the study to record dates when the contraceptive vaginal system was in or out of place, any duration of removal longer than 2 h during a period of contraceptive vaginal system use, and any bleeding or spotting during each 28-day cycle. Participants also noted dates when they were sexually active, used condoms or other contraceptives, including emergency contraceptive pills, experienced expulsions (complete or partial) or any other problems with the contraceptive vaginal system, any health issues, and use of other medications. Study personnel reviewed diary entries at all participant visits. Participants removed the contraceptive vaginal system for the last time on day 22 of cycle 13.

Participants not continuing hormonal contraception at study end were followed up for 6 months to document spontaneous return to menses. Women who desired pregnancy were followed up for pregnancy occurrence up to 6 months. All women in the follow-up study received urine pregnancy test kits at their last study visits, with instructions to test within 2 to 3 weeks after that visit, and monthly thereafter, if they had no bleeding or had pregnancy symptoms. Participants were contacted every 2 months to determine if they had resumed spontaneous menses or had become pregnant. Patients were asked to return to the study site if the pregnancy test was positive for pregnancy confirmation and were referred for prenatal care as required.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy endpoint was the Pearl Index for women in the efficacy population who were aged 35 years or younger. The Pearl Index is considered a standard measure for determining contraceptive efficacy and reflects the incidence of pregnancy per 100 woman-years. The acceptable range of Pearl Index efficacy includes values where the upper boundary of the 95% CI is less than 5. We analysed an intention-to-treat Kaplan-Meier life table as a secondary efficacy outcome to evaluate the cumulative probability of pregnancy by cycle. Adverse events, physical examinations, and laboratory assessments were also done and have been reported elsewhere.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: emergency contraception [^1117aEDK]. Contraception (2023). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning — post–emergency contraception initiation of routine contraception and pregnancy testing: We recommend routine hormonal contraception be initiated as soon as desired following LNG ECP use, with abstinence or a nonhormonal contraceptive method used as back-up for seven days or until the next menstrual period/withdrawal bleed, whichever occurs first. Following UPA ECPs, we recommend generally delaying initiation of routine hormonal contraception for five days and abstinence or a nonhormonal contraceptive method used as back-up for an additional seven days or until the next menstrual period/withdrawal bleed, whichever occurs first, and the specific timing should be individualized through shared decision-making. We recommend against withholding or delaying ECPs for pregnancy testing, and we recommend offering urine pregnancy testing for post-EC pregnancy assessment as needed.
