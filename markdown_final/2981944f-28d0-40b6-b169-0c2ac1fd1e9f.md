## Question

Frequency of interarticular steroid injection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often intra-articular corticosteroid injections should be given, including questions about minimum intervals, annual limits, lifetime limits, and how to factor in safety considerations like surgery timing and cartilage effects. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the duration of benefit to anchor how soon a repeat might be reasonable. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and meta-analyses say about frequency and any hard limits. Next, I will examine survey data on real-world practice patterns. After that, I need to check safety signals, especially cartilage effects and perioperative infection risk, and how those influence interval and pre-arthroplasty timing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, joint-specific recommendation and note exceptions and monitoring needs, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too rigid or unsupported by evidence.

> Let me first confirm the duration of benefit, because if the effect lasts only a few weeks, repeating too often would be inappropriate. High-quality evidence shows that intra-articular corticosteroids provide short-term pain relief in knee osteoarthritis, with clinically meaningful benefit typically lasting up to about 6 weeks and diminishing by 3 months, and no durable benefit at 6 months, which sets a natural lower bound for repeat intervals [^1169S5Jd] [^113fWaJr] [^11368Xmr] [^114T2keQ].

> Wait, let me verify what major guidelines say about frequency before I jump to numbers. The AAOS guideline states that IA corticosteroids can provide short-term relief up to 3 months and notes concern for potential acceleration of osteoarthritis with repeated injections, which supports spacing out injections and using the lowest effective dose rather than frequent repetition [^114NBF9J]. The ACR strongly recommends IA corticosteroids for knee and hip OA but does not specify a numeric interval, emphasizing individualized use and shared decision-making rather than a fixed schedule [^115XUinh]. The VA/DoD guideline suggests offering IA corticosteroids for persistent knee or hip OA pain after other measures, again without a mandated frequency, reinforcing individualized care [^117HrXSu].

> I should confirm what interventional pain societies and surveys of surgeons actually do in practice, because that often clarifies a pragmatic interval. Multisociety guidance suggests a minimum of 2–3 weeks between injections, with a typical interval of about 3 months, and stopping when relief is adequate or has plateaued, which aligns with pharmacologic rationale and observed clinical durability [^112tzMaA] [^115kH4Ru]. A large AAHKS survey shows that most hip and knee surgeons use a 3-month minimum interval and favor a 3-month steroid-free window before arthroplasty, reflecting both efficacy waning and infection risk considerations [^111ESBR7].

> Hold on, I should verify whether there is a universally accepted annual or lifetime limit, because I recall seeing "no more than 4 per year" in some sources. A narrative review cites a limit of no more than 4 injections per year for symptomatic joints, but this is low-credibility, retrospective, and not endorsed by major guidelines, so I should not treat it as a formal cap despite its face validity for limiting cumulative steroid exposure [^116HT5Cc]. High-credibility guidelines generally avoid hard numeric limits, instead emphasizing prudent spacing, reassessment of benefit, and avoidance of routine repetition without indication [^115XUinh] [^114NBF9J].

> Next, I should review safety signals that would argue for longer intervals or fewer total injections. Multiple injections over time have been associated with greater cartilage loss in randomized and observational studies, and meta-analytic data suggest multiple injections are not superior to placebo for pain while raising structural concerns, so I need to ensure we do not over-repeat injections when benefit is marginal [^113eAWEC]. Observational cohorts also link repeated injections with increased risk of knee arthroplasty, although confounding is possible and results should be interpreted cautiously, which still supports a conservative stance on frequency and cumulative exposure [^112ziRAh]. But wait, what if I am overstating causality here? A separate 5-year cohort using marginal structural models did not find a significant increase in radiographic progression or TKR with IA glucocorticoids, reminding me to balance potential harms with the uncertainty introduced by confounding and immortal time bias in observational designs [^111ecCA8].

> I need to check perioperative infection risk because that directly affects timing around surgery. Meta-analytic data indicate that ipsilateral IA corticosteroid injection within 3 months before hip or knee arthroplasty increases the odds of periprosthetic joint infection, with the signal strongest within 1 month, so I should recommend avoiding injections within 1 month of planned arthroplasty and discussing risks if within 3 months [^115ntCma] [^114HnBVn]. ASRA guidance similarly advises avoiding IA steroids within 1 month of joint replacement and coordinating with surgeons if within 3 months, which operationalizes this risk signal into practice [^114HnBVn] [^116zYLi8].

> Let me consider dosing and technique, because minimizing dose and maximizing accuracy can mitigate harm without sacrificing benefit. For the knee, 40 mg triamcinolone is effective and higher doses do not clearly improve outcomes, so using the lowest effective dose is prudent, and ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and may reduce procedural pain and adverse events, which is particularly relevant for deep joints like the hip and in patients with obesity [^111Z1r2e] [^1123wn9e]. I should confirm that hip injections are generally performed with image guidance due to lower accuracy with landmarks, which is reflected in guideline statements and contemporary practice patterns [^116mxhdV] [^115X1npG].

> I will now examine joint-specific nuances briefly to ensure the frequency advice is appropriately tailored. For the knee, the evidence base is largest and supports short-term benefit with careful attention to not over-repeating injections when response wanes, aligning with a 3-month interval in routine practice and avoidance within 1–3 months of arthroplasty [^1169S5Jd] [^114NBF9J] [^115ntCma] [^114HnBVn]. For the hip, evidence is more limited but RCTs show short-term benefit with ultrasound-guided injections, and image guidance is standard due to accuracy requirements, again supporting spaced use rather than frequent repetition [^1128FCLT] [^116mxhdV]. For the shoulder, AAOS advises against multiple injections because of potential compromise to rotator cuff integrity, so I should avoid serial injections beyond one or two in most nonoperative shoulder pathways [^114rSBjM] [^116YDMb8].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation, but I should double-check that I am not over-specifying where guidelines are silent. A reasonable, evidence-aligned approach is to maintain a minimum interval of about 3 months between injections in the same joint, to limit to roughly 3–4 injections per year when clinically justified, and to stop or extend intervals once benefit plateaus or diminishes, while using the lowest effective dose and preferring image guidance for hips and other deep joints; in patients with planned arthroplasty, avoid injections within 1 month and coordinate carefully if within 3 months [^112tzMaA] [^115kH4Ru] [^111Z1r2e] [^1123wn9e] [^115ntCma] [^114HnBVn] [^116HT5Cc]. I should confirm that this aligns with ACR's emphasis on individualized use and AAOS's caution about repeated injections, which it does, while acknowledging that numeric annual caps are not mandated by high-credibility guidelines and should be individualized to response and risk profile [^115XUinh] [^114NBF9J].

> But wait, what about special populations and monitoring needs that could modify frequency decisions? In diabetes, I should advise closer glucose monitoring for 48–72 hours and sometimes up to a week after injection due to hyperglycemia risk, which may influence the threshold for repeating injections. In patients on anticoagulation with therapeutic INR, routine withholding for joint injection is not generally required when aseptic technique is used. And after injection, patients should be counseled to watch for infection, postinjection flare, and skin changes, prompting earlier reassessment if symptoms persist or worsen rather than automatic repetition [^111yVeiK] [^1162Wa7W] [^114G2S62].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan remains dynamic and reassessed each time. The most defensible, reference-consistent approach is to space injections by at least 3 months when possible, avoid exceeding about 3–4 per year in the same joint unless there is compelling benefit, escalate intervals as benefit wanes, minimize dose, use image guidance for deep joints, and respect a 1-month steroid-free window before arthroplasty with 3-month risk discussion, all within a shared decision-making framework that revisits core noninvasive therapies and surgical planning at each visit [^112tzMaA] [^115kH4Ru] [^111Z1r2e] [^1123wn9e] [^115ntCma] [^114HnBVn] [^115XUinh] [^114NBF9J] [^116HT5Cc].

---

Interarticular steroid injections are generally limited to **3–4 per year per joint** [^116HT5Cc] to balance symptom relief with safety, as repeated injections can accelerate cartilage loss [^113eAWEC] and increase arthroplasty risk [^112ziRAh]. Injections should be spaced by at least **3 months** [^1116ZhzV] to allow full effect and reduce cumulative harm. For patients with diabetes, monitor glucose closely after injection [^111yVeiK], and avoid injections within **1 month** of planned joint arthroplasty [^114HnBVn] to reduce infection risk [^114HnBVn]. Use the lowest effective dose [^111Z1r2e] and consider alternatives if repeated injections are needed [^113eAWEC].

---

## Recommended frequency and intervals

- **General recommendation**: 3–4 injections per year per joint [^notfound], with at least 3-month intervals [^1116ZhzV] between injections.

- **Rationale**: Allows full effect, reduces cumulative harm, and limits cartilage damage [^113eAWEC].

- **Clinical judgment**: Adjust frequency based on response, disease severity, and comorbidities [^112tzMaA].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting frequency limits

- **Cartilage damage**: Repeated injections are linked to cartilage loss and faster OA progression [^113eAWEC] [^117Qsmgo].

- **Arthroplasty risk**: Multiple injections may increase the need for joint replacement [^112ziRAh].

- **Infection risk**: More frequent injections raise infection risk, especially near surgery [^115ntCma].

---

## Factors influencing injection frequency

Several factors influence injection frequency, including **joint-specific considerations** — the knee is more tolerant of repeat injections than the hip or shoulder [^1123J68t] [^114rSBjM] — and **patient-specific factors**, such as age, comorbidities (notably diabetes), and disease severity [^111pXQHS]. Treatment response also guides frequency; patients with sustained benefit may receive fewer injections, whereas those with limited relief may require fewer or alternative therapies [^1169S5Jd].

---

## Risks associated with frequent injections

- **Cartilage degeneration**: Repeated injections can accelerate cartilage loss and OA progression [^113eAWEC] [^117Qsmgo].

- **Infection**: Higher infection risk, especially near surgery [^115ntCma].

- **Systemic effects**: Hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression, and bone loss can occur with repeated use [^1162Wa7W].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American College of Rheumatology (ACR) | - Strongly recommends **IA corticosteroids** for **knee/hip OA** [^115XUinh] <br/> - No specific frequency limit <br/> - Emphasizes **individualized care** [^notfound] |
| American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) | - IA corticosteroids provide **short-term relief** [^114NBF9J] <br/> - No specific **frequency limit** <br/> - Highlights potential **cartilage harm** [^114NBF9J] |
| Expert consensus | - 3–4 **injections/year per joint** <br/> - ≥ **3-month intervals** <br/> - Lowest **effective dose** [^111Z1r2e] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Diabetes**: Monitor glucose closely after injection [^111yVeiK]; consider fewer injections or alternatives [^111Z1r2e].

- **Perioperative care**: Avoid injections within 1 month of arthroplasty [^114HnBVn]; discuss risks if within 3 months [^114HnBVn].

- **Alternative therapies**: Use hyaluronic acid, PRP, or physical therapy to reduce injection frequency [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Frequency**: 3–4 injections per year per joint, spaced by ≥ 3 months [^116HT5Cc] [^1116ZhzV].

- **Dose**: Use the lowest effective dose [^111Z1r2e].

- **Monitoring**: Track response and adjust frequency; watch for adverse effects [^111yVeiK].

- **Alternatives**: Consider other therapies if frequent injections are needed [^113eAWEC].

---

Interarticular steroid injections are effective for short-term relief [^1169S5Jd], but **limit to 3–4 per year per joint** with ≥ 3-month intervals to minimize harm [^1116ZhzV]. Individualize based on response, comorbidities, and surgery timing, and use alternatives when possible [^111yVeiK].

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections to manage trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis-a systematic review [^114twZpD]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint (TMJ) is a common condition causing significant disability. The aim of this study is to ascertain whether an intra-articular corticosteroid injection leads to pain relief and increased function and what is the duration and magnitude of this effect.

Methods

A systematic review with a critical appraisal of identified studies that met the inclusion criteria was performed. Two authors performed the literature review by independently searching the Cochrane, PubMed and Google Scholar databases.

Results

A total of 118 relevant articles were found, but only nine studies met the inclusion criteria which included 4 double-blinded randomised control trials (RCTs) and 5 prospective case series. There is some evidence in the literature to support the efficacy of steroid injections into the TMJ. Most studies do suggest a good short-term benefit. However, one identifies no benefit over placebo but two studies found a benefit lasting at least 6 months.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that there are potentially significant although short-term benefits to be gained from steroid injections into the TMJ. They can lead to pain relief and improved function, certainly in the first 1 to 3 months post-injection. Steroid injections are a low-risk procedure and are helpful in delaying or avoiding the need for surgery.

### A narrative review of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for low back pain [^112zMajH]. Pain Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize and to analyze the available literature on the efficacy of intra-articular injections of corticosteroids for low back pain.

Design

Publications, in English, French, and German, were obtained that reported the proportions of patients who obtained complete relief of pain following intra-articular steroids, and that provided any form of follow-up. These publications were analyzed to determine the rationale, indications, and outcomes of the treatment.

Results

The only rationale for intra-articular steroids appears to be the expectation that they should work. The most commonly used indication has been back pain, for which no specific diagnosis has been made. When the results of observational studies are pooled, they paint a picture of impressive immediate responses, but a rapid decay of outcomes by three and six months. Initial responses, however, are dissonant with the literature from controlled studies of the prevalence of lumbar zygapophysial joint pain. Moreover, controlled trials have shown that there is no attributable effect to the injection of steroids.

Conclusion

The apparent efficacy of lumbar intra-articular steroids is no greater than that of a sham injection. There is no justification for the continued use of this intervention. Better outcomes can be achieved with deliberate placebo therapy.

### Mechanisms of action of intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections for knee osteoarthritis: a targeted review of the literature [^112Q6hHT]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by chronic pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility in weightbearing joints, leading to increased disability in the adult population, and it is especially prevalent in elderly and obese populations. The knee is the most frequently affected joint, with an estimated prevalence of 654 million people affected worldwide in 2020. Knee OA (KOA) leads to a gradual deterioration of the entire joint structure, which includes the articular cartilage (AC), subchondral bone, synovial capsule, and membrane, as well as the surrounding periarticular tissues comprising connective and muscular elements. Furthermore, OA extends its influence to the soft tissues within the knee, including ligaments, tendons, and the menisci. This has led to a significant adverse effect on the quality of life of affected individuals and an increased economic burden.

Treatment options for KOA are multifaceted, encompassing nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Nonpharmacological strategies include patient education and lifestyle adjustments such as activity modification, exercise programs involving "core to floor" muscle strengthening, weight management, bracing, ambulatory aids, and the use of cooling or heating applications. Encouraging physical activity tailored to each patient's capabilities is essential for maintaining joint function and reducing pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (topical or oral) are frequently prescribed pharmacological treatments. However, long-term use of systemic or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can lead to serious adverse renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular events in addition to proteoglycan catabolism. Intra-articular injections have been recommended in KOA for achieving maximum local benefits with limited side effects. Intra-articular steroid injections reduce pain and inflammation, although the relief provided is short-term (up to 4 weeks). Yet, repeat use of intra-articular steroid injections may cause deleterious effects on AC, including a decrease in protein and matrix synthesis, mutation of cartilage cell shape, and prevention of new cartilage growth, as well as cartilage surface deterioration, such as edema, pitting, shredding, ulceration, and erosions, which may enhance cartilage destruction.

### Common practices in intra-articular corticosteroid injection for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a survey of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons membership [^111ESBR7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis nonoperative management options remain limited. Our aim is to define the current American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) members' practices and perceptions in terms of the frequency, formulation, use of concomitant aspiration, maximum lifetime number of injections, efficacy, interval between injection and surgery and complication rates.

Methods

A 22-question survey based on Likert scale response anchors was approved and distributed by the AAHKS Research Committee to its membership by email during the Spring 2019 meeting. Data were managed with REDCap software.

Results

Membership response totaled 537 of 2365 (22.7%) members. Highlights include every respondent using intra-articular corticosteroid injections (ICIs) in their practice, and most use a three-month minimum interval, although the preferred interval is longer. Near consensus was found waiting three months before surgery. There was a great variability in the number of injections allowed, and injections before surgery were very common. Nearly all responders use a local anesthetic mixture with the cortisone injection, but there was great variation in corticosteroid type: methylprednisolone (42%), triamcinolone (41%), betamethasone (13.3%), and dexamethasone (3.7%).

Conclusion

The results of our survey indicate the majority of the AAHKS members who completed the survey use ICIs routinely for treatment of knee osteoarthritis. There was near consensus in ICIs, which is effective with decreasing efficacy over serial injections, and an absolute minimum interval between injections was believed by most to be three months with no clearly defined lifetime limit and strong consensus for a three-month preoperative interval. The formulation of steroid, local anesthetic, and skin preparation technique varied greatly.

### Do glucocorticoid injections increase the risk of knee osteoarthritis progression over 5 Years? [^111ecCA8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent findings have demonstrated that intraarticular (IA) glucocorticoid injections can be deleterious for knees with osteoarthritis (OA). This study was undertaken to assess, in a real-life setting, the risk of knee OA progression in patients who received IA glucocorticoid injections over a 5-year follow-up period.

Methods

We used marginal structural modeling with inverse probability of treatment weighting to determine the causal association between IA glucocorticoid injections and the 5-year risk of disease progression in patients with symptomatic knee OA from the Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis Long-term Assessment cohort. OA progression was defined as an incident total knee replacement (TKR) and/or radiographic worsening (Kellgren/Lawrence [K/L] grade or joint space narrowing [JSN]). We also examined these outcomes in knees that received IA hyaluronan (IAHA) injections.

Results

Among the 564 patients with knee OA included in the study sample, 51 (9.0%) and 99 (17.5%) received IA glucocorticoid or IAHA injections, respectively, and 414 (63.1%) did not receive any injection during follow-up. Compared to untreated knees, those treated with IA glucocorticoid injections had a similar risk of incident TKR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.20, 4.14]; P = 0.91) or K/L grade worsening (HR 1.33 [95% CI 0.64, 2.79]; P = 0.44). IAHA injections had no effect on the risk of TKR (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.14, 4.63]; P = 0.81) or K/L grade worsening (HR 1.36 [95% CI 0.85, 2.17]; P = 0.20). Similar results were obtained for JSN, and when TKR and radiographic outcomes were combined.

Conclusion

In this study, IA glucocorticoid injections for symptomatic knee OA did not significantly increase the 5-year risk of incident TKR or radiographic worsening. These findings should be interpreted cautiously and replicated in other cohorts.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections provide a clinically relevant benefit compared to placebo only at short-term follow-up in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114T2keQ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To quantify the clinical relevance of intra-articular corticosteroid effects compared to placebo for the injective treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched on May 3, 2023. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, with no time limitation regarding publication date, comparing intra-articular corticosteroids and placebo injections for knee OA. The effects were quantified at short- (≤ 6 weeks), mid- (> 6 weeks and ≤ 3 months), and long-term (≥ 6 months) follow-ups. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the outcomes (visual analogue scale for pain - VAS: 1.4, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index - WOMAC: 9) was used to interpret the clinical improvement provided by intra-articular corticosteroid injections compared to placebo. The quality of each article was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and the GRADE guidelines.

Results

Among the 1030 articles retrieved, 11 RCTs (842 patients) were included. A comparison of the two groups revealed statistically significant differences in the improvement of VAS and WOMAC scores in terms of the mean difference (MD); this difference was in favour of corticosteroids at short-term (p < 0.001, MD = -1.6 and p < 0.001, MD = -9.9, respectively) and mid-term follow-ups (p = 0.001, mean MD = -1.3 and p = 0.005, MD = -4.9, respectively). No difference was observed at the long-term follow-up. The MDs between the improvements in the two groups reached the MCID values for the VAS and WOMAC only at the short-term follow-up. The RoB 2 tool and the GRADE evaluations showed the presence of risk of bias and limited quality of evidence.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that intra-articular corticosteroid injections offer clinically perceivable pain relief and functional improvement higher than the placebo effect only at short-term follow-up in patients affected by knee OA, with benefits losing clinical relevance already after 6 weeks. These results, together with the low number and the limited quality of the RCTs comparing this treatment with placebo, question the indication for the use of corticosteroid injections in clinical practice for the treatment of knee OA.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) — role of imaging: Ultrasound-guided techniques result in more accurate intra-articular needle placement than landmark-based techniques (Level of certainty: high). There are no significant differences in accuracy between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided peripheral joint corticosteroid injections (Level of certainty: low). Compared with landmark-based techniques, use of image guidance may be associated with less pain on injection, improved patient satisfaction, and better short-term clinical outcomes (Level of certainty: low). Use of imaging guidance may be associated with fewer adverse events, including damage to periosteum and intravascular injection, after diagnostic or therapeutic arthrocentesis (Level of certainty: low). Image-guided techniques may be preferred for accuracy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections, especially in individuals with morbid obesity (Grade C).

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) dosing, imaging selection, injection intervals, efficacy duration, and adverse effects are summarized for musculoskeletal injections. US requires expertise; hence the physician should employ the imaging modality with which they are most experienced and comfortable. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. For dosing, a dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg TA for shoulder IACS, the most commonly used dose for hip IACS was 40 mg TA or MPA, and triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. For frequency, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks between injections, up to 3 months, and overall, IACS results in short-term (4 weeks to 3 months) pain relief. Adverse effects from IACS are related to the procedure and corticosteroid exposure and include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage, reduction of BMD, and PJI.

Modified US Preventive Services Task Force levels of certainty regarding net benefit — definitions for evidence strength are outlined for joint pain interventions. High certainty is described as evidence with "consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative care populations with joint pain", with conclusions "unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate certainty is when "the available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the intervention on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors", and "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low certainty indicates "the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes".

### Therapeutic and diagnostic joint injections [^112GcYoC]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Joint injections remain a valuable modality in the detection and treatment of intra-articular pathology. Over the past several decades, various diagnostic and therapeutic indications for joint injections have been developed. Imaging guidance for joint injection generally increases accuracy in joint aspirations and diagnostic blocks. Confirming intra-articular placement with steroid injections improves efficacy and reduces local complications. Administering intra-articular contrast can improve the diagnostic performance of CT and MR imaging in many circumstances. This article focuses on the rationale for injections at different sites and describes different fluoroscopic approaches for common joints.

We conducted electronic searches of several databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Standard mean difference was calculated for efficacy, whereas hazard ratio (HR) was used for adverse effects. Results were combined using the random effects model. Heterogeneity was measured using I2 statistics.

Results

Six RCTs were included for efficacy assessment. The use of multiple IACS appeared to be better than comparator (standard mean difference for pain -0.47, 95% CI -0.62, 0.31). However, there was considerable heterogeneity (I2 92.6%) and subgroup analysis by comparator showed no separation of regular IACS from placebo, though timing of pain assessments was questionable. Fourteen RCTs and two observational studies were assessed for the safety of multiple IACS. Minor local adverse events were similar in both groups. One RCT found that regular IACS every 3months for 2years caused greater cartilage loss compared with saline injection (-0.21 vs 0.10mm). One cohort study found that multiple IACS injections associated with worsening of joint space narrowing (HR 3.02, 95% CI 2.25, 4.05) and increased risk of joint replacement (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.81, 3.57).

Conclusion

Multiple IACS injections are no better than placebo for OA pain according to current evidence. The preliminary finding of a detrimental effect on structural OA progression warrants further investigation. Efficacy and safety of multiple IACS reflecting recommended best practice has yet to be assessed.

Recommendations Regarding Injection-Based Therapies

Corticosteroid Injections

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IAC or IACS) injections were pioneered by Dr Jollander in 1953. The first trial for IAC injections was performed by White and Norton in 1958. IAC injections have become standard therapy for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, there is still debate on the efficacy of IAC injections for knee OA. A Cochrane review in 2015 evaluated 27 trials with a total of 1767 participants comparing IAC injections with a sham injection or no treatment for patients with knee OA. The quality of evidence was "low" due to a high or unclear risk of bias in many studies. There was also a significant amount of inconsistencies regarding the dosage of corticosteroid and the type of corticosteroid used. The review did find IAC injections reduced pain and improved function more effectively than control interventions. The authors reported an improvement of pain after IAC injection was moderate at 1–2 weeks post-injection, mild to moderate at 4–6 weeks, and minor at 13 weeks. There was no statistically significant evidence of treatment effect at 26 weeks. The Cochrane review concluded, given the poor quality and variability in the studies, it is uncertain if there is a significant advantage of IAC injections for knee OA after 6 weeks post-injection.

Conversely, a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the magnitude and duration of the effect of IAC for knee OA found moderate evidence for IAC injections to reduce pain related to knee OA. The treatment effect was up to 3 months after the injection in the meta-analysis. The number needed to treat was 10. Unfortunately, as was such the case in the Cochrane review, there is significant heterogeneity between studies evaluating IAC for knee OA. The inconsistency between the Cochrane review and the meta-analysis underscores the need for RCTs with specific corticosteroids used and a fixed-dose to consider further the efficacy of pain relief and duration of effect (see Table 11).

Evidence Table Regarding Intra-Articular Corticosteroid Injections

In summary, IAC may provide short-term mild-to-moderate pain relief for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Clinical implications and future research

The findings from this work can be used to refine the use of IACI in the patient pathway and should facilitate the shared decision-making process between patients and clinicians when considering the use of IACIs for osteoarthritis. The reduction in rates of knee replacement following the use of IACI as observed in our IV analysis suggests a strategy of using IACI for knee osteoarthritis may be effective in helping manage uncontrolled pain, possibly conferring an appreciable delay to meeting the threshold for surgery. However, given our propensity score analyses did not replicate these findings but instead yielded conflicting results due to suspected residual confounding factors, future randomised studies are most likely needed to confirm and further elucidate the impact of single and repeat IACI use on the need for surgery. Unanswered questions include what the possible mechanisms of effect are, when in the osteoarthritis pathway patients should be offered IACI, what is the value for money, and what dose and type of IACI is most effective. The replication of the study in other healthcare settings elsewhere in the world is another subject for future research.

### The magnitude and duration of the effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections on pain severity in knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11368Xmr]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to clarify the evidence on the magnitude and duration of treatment effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis compared with placebo, to evaluate a treatment effect by steroid type, and to describe the reported adverse effects.

Design

Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. The risk of systematic bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation framework.

Results

The final sample included eight randomized controlled studies with follow-ups from 1 to 26 wks. The risk of systematic bias was considered low in five and high in three studies. The pooled standardized mean difference was -0.58 (95% confidence interval = -0.88 to -0.27) and number needed to treat 5.1 (95% confidence interval = 10.0 to 3.7). The heterogeneity was considerable. The pooled effect size approached the level of statistical insignificance at 4 mos. The pooled risk ratio of adverse effects was insignificant 0.95 (95% confidence interval = 0.34 to 2.55).

Conclusions

The intra-articular corticosteroid had a mild to moderate effect on pain severity up to 3 mos after the injection-much longer than it had previously been reported. The effect may vary substantially in different patient groups and appropriate patient selection is important. The risk of adverse effects was low.

### Intra-articular injections of the hip and knee with triamcinolone vs ketorolac: a randomized controlled trial [^116b6NKB]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians commonly utilize intra-articular injections to treat symptomatic primary arthritis. Steroid injections are common yet have immune-modulating effects and can alter gene expression which may delay definitive arthroplasty and further damage cartilage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory injections may offer a safer profile due to their differing mechanism of action; however, there is a relative dearth of information regarding their efficacy. This noninferiority study compares the effectiveness of triamcinolone vs ketorolac in treating symptoms of moderate to advanced primary osteoarthritis of the hip and knee.

Methods

In total, 110 patients (52 hips and 58 knees) with moderate to severe radiographic primary osteoarthritis of the hip or knee were randomized in a double-blinded study to receive an ultrasound-guided intra-articular injection of ketorolac or triamcinolone. Patient-reported outcome measures were collected pre-injection and at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

Results

For hips and knees, intra-articular injections with either ketorolac or triamcinolone led to statistically significant improvements in patient-reported outcome measures. The treatment effect size was largest at 1 week and decreased over time. Primary analysis of variance comparisons revealed no significant differences between ketorolac and triamcinolone. For knee injections, post hoc secondary analysis suggests slight added durability in the triamcinolone group. Adverse effects were minimal with both interventions.

Conclusion

Intra-articular ketorolac injections provide comparable improvement to triamcinolone for primary hip and knee osteoarthritis. Ketorolac is an additional low-cost option for conservative management of primary osteoarthritis, and due to its differing mechanism of action, it may not propagate additional cartilage damage or preclude from early surgical intervention if unsuccessful.

### Efficacy and treatment response of intra-articular corticosteroid injections in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis [^111pXQHS]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are often used for short-term pain relief in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). This study investigates the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections in patients with symptomatic knee OA and factors that affect treatment response.

Methods

This prospective, multicentered cohort study had 100 participants with radiographic evidence of knee OA enrolled. Participants received one corticosteroid injection into the affected knee and were evaluated before the injection (baseline) and at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the injection.

Results

Participants' Visual Numeric Scale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores improved at all time points except for the Visual Numeric Scale score at 6 months, compared with baseline scores (P < 0.001). Participants with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 or 2 OA saw clinical improvement in the WOMAC scores at all time points, compared with the baseline score (P < 0.01). Compared with all other subgroups, obese patients with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3 or 4 OA had significantly worse WOMAC scores at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively).

Discussion

Our findings validate previously established guidelines for nonsurgical management of knee OA and suggest that intra-articular corticosteroid injections may be an acceptable short-term management option in patients unwilling or unable to undergo surgical treatment. Obesity and OA severity affect the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections.

Conclusion

Patients receiving intra-articular corticosteroid injections had improved pain and function. Clinicians should expect less improvement in patients with obesity and/or advanced arthritis. Clinical benefits of intra-articular injections in these patients are less predictable.

### Helpful tips for performing musculoskeletal injections [^114G2S62]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Injections are valuable procedures for managing musculoskeletal conditions commonly encountered by family physicians. Corticosteroid injections into articular, periarticular, or soft tissue structures relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and improve mobility. Injections can provide diagnostic information and are commonly used for postoperative pain control. Local anesthetics may be injected with corticosteroids to provide additional, rapid pain relief. Steroid injection is the preferred and definitive treatment for de Quervain tenosynovitis and trochanteric bursitis. Steroid injections can also be helpful in controlling pain during physical rehabilitation from rotator cuff syndrome and lateral epicondylitis. Intra-articular steroid injection provides pain relief in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. There is little systematic evidence to guide medication selection for therapeutic injections. The medication used and the frequency of injection should be guided by the goal of the injection (i.e., diagnostic or therapeutic), the underlying musculoskeletal diagnosis, and clinical experience. Complications from steroid injections are rare, but physicians should understand the potential risks and counsel patients appropriately. Patients with diabetes who receive periarticular or soft tissue steroid injections should closely monitor their blood glucose for two weeks following injection.

### Critical appraisal of intra-articular glucocorticoid injections for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee [^115eFtzG]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intra-articular (IA) injections of glucocorticoids (GCs) have been shown to decrease pain, increase mobility, and improve quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Concerns about cartilage loss with IA GCs have prompted reconsideration of their use in knee OA. This review has three objectives: 1) critically review the clinical, molecular, and structural effects of IA GCs in knee OA; 2) provide a design for a clinical trial aimed at improving our understanding of the long-term consequences of IA GCs; and 3) provide practical guidance on the use of IA GCs in patients with knee OA based on current information.

Design

A narrative review of current literature on the use of IA GCs for OA of the knee.

Results

Important questions remain to be fully answered with respect to IA GCs, including long-term effects on all aspects of the structural and molecular environment of the knee, and identification of factors that can reliably predict a positive or negative response to IA GCs.

Conclusions

While awaiting results from an appropriately designed study, several provisional statements regarding IA GCs can be put forward: 1) IA GCs appear to be a relatively safe option that is effective in specific patients with symptomatic knee OA; 2) there is no definitive evidence that IA GCs accelerate joint deterioration to an important extent or hastens the requirement for knee replacement; and 3) there are few contraindications to IA GCs and injection-associated complications are rare when IA GCs are delivered with proper technique.

Table 1
Information About Intra-Articular Injection of Corticosteroids

Studies have confirmed that the intra-articular corticosteroids can significantly relieve the clinical symptoms of patients with early OA. Nonetheless, the relief of this symptom is short-lived and no other benefits are seen half a year later. According to the retrospective literature, most patients with osteoarthritis showed a mild to moderate improvement in function within 6 weeks after corticosteroids injection, but the patient's symptoms did not improve significantly after this period of time. The specific contraindications and adverse reactions are shown in Table 2. The long-term use of corticosteroids can increase oxidative stress and change gene expressions of chondrocyte. It will lead to chondrotoxicity and other adverse reactions, and accelerates the progress of osteoarthritis. The latest study found that there is a certain causal relationship between high dose and long-term use of corticosteroids and the development of chondraltoxicity. Therefore, in order to relieve symptoms in the short term, intra-articular corticosteroids should not be injected for symptomatic joints more than 4 times a year. Many studies confirmed that intra-articular injection of corticosteroids only offers a mild and temporary pain-relieving effect, and surgeons must doubt the sustainability and development of this treatment in future medicine.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection and peri-articular corticosteroid injection are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. Results vary by musculoskeletal region, but most studies report short-term benefit with mixed results on long-term relief. Publications showed adverse events from single corticosteroid injections. Recommended effective doses were lower than those currently used by clinicians.

Methods

Development of the practice guideline for joint injections was approved by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the participating societies. A Corticosteroid Safety Work Group coordinated the development of three guidelines: peripheral nerve blocks and trigger points; joints; and neuraxial, facet, and sacroiliac joint injections. The topics included safety of the technique in relation to landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or radiology-aided injections; effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate; and adverse events related to the injection. Experts on the topics were assigned to extensively review the literature and initially develop consensus statements and recommendations. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed. A modified Delphi process was adhered to in arriving at a consensus.

Results

This guideline focuses on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid joint injections for managing joint chronic pain in adults. The joints that were addressed included the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet. All the statements and recommendations were approved by all participants and the Board of Directors of the participating societies after four rounds of discussion. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain. A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for both shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections. The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone. Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. Overall, IACS injections result in short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months. The adverse events include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection.

Conclusions

In this practice guideline, we provided specific recommendations on the role of corticosteroids in joint, bursa, and peritendon injections for musculoskeletal pain.

### Corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee: meta-analysis [^1135Az5c]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee and to identify numbers needed to treat.

Data Sources

Cochrane controlled trials register, Medline (1966 to 2003), Embase (1980 to 2003), hand searches, and contact with authors.

Inclusion Criteria

Randomised controlled trial in which the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee could be ascertained.

Results

In high quality studies, the pooled relative risk for improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee at 16–24 weeks after intra-articular corticosteroid injections was 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.7) and the number needed to treat was 4.4. The pooled relative risk for improvement up to two weeks after injections was 1.66 (1.37 to 2.0). The numbers needed to treat to get one improvement in the statistically significant studies was 1.3 to 3.5 patients.

Conclusion

Evidence supports short term (up to two weeks) improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee after intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Significant improvement was also shown in the only methodologically sound studies addressing longer term response (16–24 weeks). A dose equivalent to 50 mg of prednisone may be needed to show benefit at 16–24 weeks.

Hip intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injections — statements and recommendations: IACS hip injections are commonly performed for diagnosis in hip osteoarthritis and for short-term (4–12 weeks) pain relief (Level of certainty: high). Potential adverse effects may include accelerated cartilage loss, subchondral insufficiency fractures, osteonecrosis, and rarely rapid joint destruction (Level of certainty: moderate). Pre-injection/screening X-ray of the hip joint may help to verify baseline pathology that would preclude corticosteroid injection (Level of certainty: moderate). Education and exercise used with IACS result in better global improvement than IACS alone at 1 year, with similar pain relief (Level of certainty: low). Safety and accuracy of greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections are similar across landmarks, fluoroscopy, or ultrasound (Grade B). Caution should be taken with high-dose and multiple injections; consider using the lowest effective corticosteroid dose for hip IACS while extending the interval between repeat CSI (Grade B). Consider using a 40 mg dose of triamcinolone or a comparable corticosteroid dose for IACS hip injection (Grade B). Pre-injection/screening X-ray should be performed prior to IACS hip injection to verify baseline pathology including osteonecrosis (Grade B). Patient education and physiotherapy exercises should be offered in conjunction with or prior to CSI for greater trochanteric pain syndrome (Grade B).

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections increase the risk of requiring knee arthroplasty [^112ziRAh]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Recent studies have suggested that corticosteroid injections into the knee may harm the joint resulting in cartilage loss and possibly accelerating the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to assess whether patients with, or at risk of developing, symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee who receive intra-articular corticosteroid injections have an increased risk of requiring arthroplasty.

Methods

We used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a multicentre observational cohort study that followed 4,796 patients with, or at risk of developing, osteoarthritis of the knee on an annual basis with follow-up available up to nine years. Increased risk for symptomatic OA was defined as frequent knee symptoms (pain, aching, or stiffness) without radiological evidence of OA and two or more risk factors, while OA was defined by the presence of both femoral osteophytes and frequent symptoms in one or both knees. Missing data were imputed with multiple imputations using chained equations. Time-dependent propensity score matching was performed to match patients at the time of receving their first injection with controls. The effect of corticosteroid injections on the rate of subsequent (total and partial) knee arthroplasty was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards survival analyses.

Results

After removing patients lost to follow-up, 3,822 patients remained in the study. A total of 249 (31.3%) of the 796 patients who received corticosteroid injections, and 152 (5.0%) of the 3,026 who did not, had knee arthroplasty. In the matched cohort, Cox proportional-hazards regression resulted in a hazard ratio of 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 1.81; p < 0.001) and each injection increased the absolute risk of arthroplasty by 9.4% at nine years' follow-up compared with those who did not receive injections.

Conclusion

Corticosteroid injections seem to be associated with an increased risk of knee arthroplasty in patients with, or at risk of developing, symptomatic OA of the knee. These findings suggest that a conservative approach regarding the treatment of these patients with corticosteroid injections should be recommended.

### Clinical effectiveness of one ultrasound guided intra-articular corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection in addition to advice and education for hip osteoarthritis (HIT trial): single blind, parallel group, three arm, randomised controlled trial [^11313Zp6]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hip osteoarthritis affects a substantial and growing number of people worldwide and is a leading cause of global disability, with a large proportion of those affected experiencing persistent pain, functional loss, and impaired quality of life. In 2019, more than 100 000 primary total hip replacements were undertaken in the UK, at a cost exceeding £500m (€596m; $659m). Ninety per cent of these surgeries were for osteoarthritis. Although not all patients with hip osteoarthritis require surgery, the numbers of hip replacements continue to increase. Patients with hip osteoarthritis are typically treated in primary care for several years before surgical referral, with evidence suggesting that primary care management is suboptimal.

Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises combining non-drug and drug approaches, with education, exercise, and weight reduction as core treatments. Analgesic options include paracetamol (acetaminophen), with intra-articular corticosteroid injection recommended as an adjunct if pain is moderate to severe. However, guidelines highlight that the clinical and economic evidence supporting the use of intra-articular hip corticosteroid injection is limited and conflicting, and recommend intra-articular corticosteroid for knee osteoarthritis but not for hip osteoarthritis. A systematic review identified only five trials of corticosteroid injection in people with hip osteoarthritis, which were limited by recruitment from secondary care (eg, surgical waiting lists), and small sample sizes (n = 36–101). Two randomised controlled trials showed clinical benefits of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection, compared with control injection, at eight weeks after injection, with only one trial reporting outcomes beyond 8 weeks (non-significant reduction in pain between intervention and control). These previous randomised controlled trials compared corticosteroid injection with either local anaesthetic or saline but only one used the comparison of standard care. In addition to uncertainties about patient selection and effectiveness, use of intra-articular corticosteroid injection can also be limited by availability. Hip injections require imaging guidance, either using fluoroscopy or ultrasound, to improve the accuracy of placement. Ultrasonography avoids ionising radiation or a contrast agent and is more widely available than fluoroscopy because ultrasound guided injections at other sites are commonly performed in outpatient settings. However, only two randomised controlled trials of corticosteroid injections in hip osteoarthritis used ultrasound guidance.

In this study the clinical effectiveness of best current treatment (BCT) plus an ultrasound guided intra-articular hip injection of triamcinolone and lidocaine or of lidocaine alone was compared with BCT.

➢ Corticosteroid injections are largely safe, but patients and practitioners should be aware of the small risk of adverse side effects, and their limited duration of efficacy. The timing of injection should be coordinated with potential surgical dates.➢ The routine use of hyaluronic acid injections for osteoarthritis is not recommended, but there are certain subsets of patients, such as those who have undergone other therapies that failed, who may benefit from it.➢ Local anesthetics are frequently used in conjunction with corticosteroids for enhanced pain control; however, caution is needed because of concerns regarding chondrotoxicity. Proper patient selection is crucial, and their overuse for diagnostic purposes is not recommended.➢ There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of prolotherapy, bone marrow aspirate concentrate, stromal vascular fraction, and mesenchymal stromal cell injections.➢ Intra-articular saline solution has been associated with improvements in both patient-reported pain and function scores, and this should be considered in future study designs.

### The efficacy, accuracy and complications of corticosteroid injections of the knee joint [^115mdEYU]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Corticosteroid knee injections are being increasingly used in the conservative management of knee osteoarthritis. The procedure is usually performed in secondary care by orthopaedic surgeons and rheumatologists, but as the role of general practitioners in chronic disease management expands, joint injections are now frequently being performed in primary care. It is commonly perceived amongst clinicians that the benefits of corticosteroid knee joint injections in treating symptomatic knee osteoarthritis significantly outweigh the risks of complications.

Methods

The evidence in the literature for the benefits, accuracy, safety and complications of corticosteroid knee injections in osteoarthritis is reviewed. The perception that serious complications are rare is addressed, and the incidence of infectious complications is estimated.

Results and Conclusions

Short-term symptomatic relief is the only evidence-based benefit of corticosteroid injection of an osteoarthritic knee. Accurate intra-articular placement is not achieved in up to 20% of injections and varies considerably with the anatomical approach used. There is no evidence that a medial approach is more accurate. The incidence of serious infectious complications following knee joint injections ranges widely, and may be as high as 1 in 3,000 and potentially far higher in high-risk patients for whom specialist management is advised.

### Do intra-articular steroid injections increase infection rates in subsequent arthroplasty? A systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies [^116eidCb]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

Intra-articular steroid injections are widely used in joint arthritis. The safety of such injections has been questioned as they may increase infection rates in subsequent arthroplasty. We carried out a meta-analysis of studies examining the relation between intra-articular steroid injections and infection rates in subsequent joint arthroplasty. A literature search was undertaken. Eight studies looking at hip and knee arthroplasties were analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that steroid injection had no significant effect on either deep (risk ratio = 1.87; 95% CI 0.80–4.35; P = 0.15) or superficial infection rates (risk ratio = 1.75; 95% CI 0.76–4.04; P = 0.19) of subsequent arthroplasty. Further large cohort studies would be of value in further examining whether steroid injections close to the time of arthroplasty are safe.

### Corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain [^1159rAUK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

While many treatments, including corticosteroid injections in and around the shoulder, are advocated to be of benefit for shoulder pain, few are of proven efficacy. This review of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain is one in a series of reviews of varying interventions for shoulder disorders.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of adults with shoulder pain.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Central and Science Citation Index were searched up to and including June 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and pseudo-randomised trials in all languages of corticosteroid injections compared to placebo or another intervention, or of varying types and dosages of steroid injection in adults with shoulder pain. Specific exclusions were duration of shoulder pain less than three weeks, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and fracture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial inclusion and methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers according to predetermined criteria. Results are presented separately for rotator cuff disease, adhesive capsulitis, full thickness rotator cuff tear and mixed diagnoses, and, where possible, combined in meta-analysis.

Main Results

Twenty-six trials met inclusion criteria. The number, site and dosage of injections varied widely between studies. The number of participants per trial ranged from 20 to 114 (median 52 participants). Methodological quality was variable. For rotator cuff disease, subacromial steroid injection was demonstrated to have a small benefit over placebo in some trials however no benefit of subacromial steroid injection over NSAID was demonstrated based upon the pooled results of three trials. For adhesive capsulitis, two trials suggested a possible early benefit of intra-articular steroid injection over placebo but there was insufficient data for pooling of any of the trials. One trial suggested short-term benefit of intra-articular corticosteroid injection over physiotherapy in the short-term (success at seven weeks RR = 1.66 (1.21, 2.28).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Despite many RCTs of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain, their small sample sizes, variable methodological quality and heterogeneity means that there is little overall evidence to guide treatment. Subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease and intra-articular injection for adhesive capsulitis may be beneficial although their effect may be small and not well-maintained. There is a need for further trials investigating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain. Other important issues that remain to be clarified include whether the accuracy of needle placement, anatomical site, frequency, dose and type of corticosteroid influences efficacy.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injection frequency and cumulative dose — survey practice and suggestion: An American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons survey of common injection practices yielded 537 members' responses, and most used a 3-month minimum interval between repeat IACS in the same joint. Based on the available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks, up to 3 months, and the series of injections should be stopped when there is complete or acceptable pain relief or when the relief has plateaued, taking into consideration the maximum cumulative dose. Almost all responders used a local anesthetic mixture with the CSI, there were no distinctly defined early or lifetime limits, and there was a strong consensus for a 3-month corticosteroid-free preoperative interval.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^114Z4YsY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this trial suggest that, among patients in primary care settings with symptomatic knee OA, an IM glucocorticoid injection could present an inferior effect in reducing pain at our primary end point of 4 weeks, compared with an IA injection. An IM injection is noninferior to IA injection at 8 and 24 weeks after injection, but not at 2 and 12 weeks. Both types of injection should be considered effective strategies, and this trial provides evidence for shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of both treatment strategies.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) and peri-articular injections for musculoskeletal pain are addressed in this adult-focused guideline, which summarizes scope, dosing, efficacy, and safety. The guideline covers corticosteroid joint injections for "the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet", notes "little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another", and states that "Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain". Dosing statements include: "A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections", "The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone", and "Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS". Efficacy is characterized as "short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months", and adverse events include "an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection".

Indications and frequency limits for injections — the document states these decisions have often relied on non-evidence-based assumptions. Over the years, some authors have recommended one injection for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes; others have preached 3 injections in a series irrespective of a patient's progress or lack thereof; others suggest 3 injections followed by a repeat course of 3 injections after 3-, 6-, or 12-month intervals; and some propose an unlimited number of injections. Dose caps such as a limitation of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid or 210 mg per year in an average person and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid also have been advocated; however, with no scientific basis.

Box 7 — Adverse events from intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injections — states that clinically significant increases in blood glucose may follow IACS injection with effects noted within hours and peak blood glucose possibly delayed for up to 2 days; extended-release corticosteroid preparations may mitigate the impact of IACS on systemic blood glucose in patients with diabetes; adrenal suppression may follow an intra-articular corticosteroid injection; for warfarin patients with an international normalization ratio in the therapeutic range (2.0–3.0), the risks of withholding anticoagulation prior to IACS related to thromboembolism are greater than the risks of bleeding; when there is strict adherence to standard infection control practices, the risk of infection due to IACS is low; and there is an increased risk of postoperative deep joint infection when IACS is administered within 3 months of a joint replacement surgery, especially if performed prior to that surgery.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Corticosteroid injections for adult chronic joint pain are described with use, techniques, and safety considerations. Pain in the shoulder, hip, knees, or fingers is common in patients over 40 years of age, and peripheral joint injections are used after failure of conservative management with the objective of reducing pain and improving function. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) and other musculoskeletal injections alleviate inflammation and reduce pain, improve function, facilitate rehabilitation, or give some temporary relief until definitive treatment, for example, surgery, can be undertaken, and injections include local anesthetic, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), mesenchymal stromal cells, and corticosteroid. For patients with joint pain, such injections are performed using landmark techniques or guided by ultrasound (US) or fluoroscopy. Clinical studies revealed corticosteroid-related adverse events; these include decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary axis, increase in blood sugar, and postoperative joint infection, and these events are compounded by clinicians injecting amounts higher than minimally effective doses; moreover, there has been no publication that compared the safety of the different procedures with landmark, US, or fluoroscopy across the joints' spectrum.

Intra-articular injections

Current knowledge

Subanalyses of the BeSt study showed that 3 months after intra-articular GCs injection, 50% of joints were no longer swollen. After 1 year, swelling had recurred in 14% of joints with initially good clinical response. Initially, disease activity scores significantly improved, but over time, DAS and HAQ scores became similar in injected and non-injected patients. After 8 years, the two groups did not differ in joint damage. In the CIMESTRA trial, patients with early RA received intra-articular GCs in any swollen joint (maximum four joints per visit) combined with step-up csDMARDs treatment over 2 years. Oral GCs were not allowed. At 2 years, the median cumulative number of injections for each patient was 13, and the cumulative dose of GCs was < 1 mg/day. The injections had a rapid-onset anti-inflammatory action, and 2 weeks after inclusion, 39% of patients were in DAS28 remission. At the end of follow-up, 55.5% of joints injected at baseline did not show disease relapse, and intra-articular injections were well tolerated.

Recently, one small and open-label RCT showed greater clinical efficacy (ACR20/50/70 response) of csDMARDs combined with initial intra-articular GCs injections than csDMARDs alone in patients with early RA without oral GCs.

Studies to perform

Larger RCTs with a design similar to the trial by Menon et al and with compliance to blinding are needed, as are RCTs comparing intra-articular GCs injections with other routes of administration.

### Injectable corticosteroids in modern practice [^116yLZDz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Long-lasting, crystalline suspensions of injectable corticosteroids have been used to treat joint and soft-tissue disorders for many years; they decrease inflammation by reducing local infiltration of inflammatory cells and mediators. Depot formulations differ in their characteristics. Compounds with low solubility are thought to have the longest duration of action but may cause tissue atrophy when used in soft tissues. Intra-articular corticosteroids are commonly used to treat osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis: meta-analyses confirm their benefit in reducing pain and symptoms. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been shown to be safe and effective for repeated use (every 3 months) for up to 2 years, with no joint space narrowing detected. Fewer clinical trials are available for extra-articular uses for injectable corticosteroids, although there is evidence of efficacy in a variety of soft-tissue conditions. The accuracy of injections affects outcomes. Postinjection flare, facial flushing, and skin and fat atrophy are the most common side effects. Systemic complications of injectable corticosteroids are rare.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid for knee osteoarthritis [^113fWaJr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of chronic pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. Despite the long-standing use of intra-articular corticosteroids, there is an ongoing debate about their benefits and safety. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of intra-articular corticosteroids compared with sham or no intervention in people with knee osteoarthritis in terms of pain, physical function, quality of life, and safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (from inception to 3 February 2015), checked trial registers, conference proceedings, reference lists, and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared intra-articular corticosteroids with sham injection or no treatment in people with knee osteoarthritis. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pain, function, quality of life, joint space narrowing, and risk ratios (RRs) for safety outcomes. We combined trials using an inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Results

We identified 27 trials (13 new studies) with 1767 participants in this update. We graded the quality of the evidence as 'low' for all outcomes because treatment effect estimates were inconsistent with great variation across trials, pooled estimates were imprecise and did not rule out relevant or irrelevant clinical effects, and because most trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Intra-articular corticosteroids appeared to be more beneficial in pain reduction than control interventions (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.22), which corresponds to a difference in pain scores of 1.0 cm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale between corticosteroids and sham injection and translates into a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 6 to 13). An I(2) statistic of 68% indicated considerable between-trial heterogeneity. A visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested some asymmetry (asymmetry coefficient -1.21, 95%CI -3.58 to 1.17). When stratifying results according to length of follow-up, benefits were moderate at 1 to 2 weeks after end of treatment (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.27), small to moderate at 4 to 6 weeks (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.21), small at 13 weeks (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.00), and no evidence of an effect at 26 weeks (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.11). An I(2) statistic of ≥ 63% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity up to 13 weeks after end of treatment (P for heterogeneity ≤ 0.001), and an I(2) of 0% indicated low heterogeneity at 26 weeks (P = 0.43). There was evidence of lower treatment effects in trials that randomised on average at least 50 participants per group (P = 0.05) or at least 100 participants per group (P = 0.013), in trials that used concomittant viscosupplementation (P = 0.08), and in trials that used concomitant joint lavage (P ≤ 0.001). Corticosteroids appeared to be more effective in function improvement than control interventions (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.09), which corresponds to a difference in functions scores of -0.7 units on standardised Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) disability scale ranging from 0 to 10 and translates into a NNTB of 10 (95% CI 7 to 33). An I(2) statistic of 69% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity. A visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested asymmetry (asymmetry coefficient -4.07, 95% CI -8.08 to -0.05). When stratifying results according to length of follow-up, benefits were small to moderate at 1 to 2 weeks after end of treatment (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.14), small to moderate at 4 to 6 weeks (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.09), and no evidence of an effect at 13 weeks (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.10) or at 26 weeks (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.28). An I(2) statistic of ≥ 62% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity up to 13 weeks after end of treatment (P for heterogeneity ≤ 0.004), and an I(2) of 0% indicated low heterogeneity at 26 weeks (P = 0.52). We found evidence of lower treatment effects in trials that randomised on average at least 50 participants per group (P = 0.023), in unpublished trials (P = 0.023), in trials that used non-intervention controls (P = 0.031), and in trials that used concomitant viscosupplementation (P = 0.06). Participants on corticosteroids were 11% less likely to experience adverse events, but confidence intervals included the null effect (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.23, I(2) = 0%). Participants on corticosteroids were 67% less likely to withdraw because of adverse events, but confidence intervals were wide and included the null effect (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.07, I(2) = 0%). Participants on corticosteroids were 27% less likely to experience any serious adverse event, but confidence intervals were wide and included the null effect (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.67, I(2) = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of corticosteroids on quality of life compared to control (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.28, I(2) = 0%). There was also no evidence of an effect of corticosteroids on joint space narrowing compared to control interventions (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.46).

Authors' Conclusions

Whether there are clinically important benefits of intra-articular corticosteroids after one to six weeks remains unclear in view of the overall quality of the evidence, considerable heterogeneity between trials, and evidence of small-study effects. A single trial included in this review described adequate measures to minimise biases and did not find any benefit of intra-articular corticosteroids. In this update of the systematic review and meta-analysis, we found most of the identified trials that compared intra-articular corticosteroids with sham or non-intervention control small and hampered by low methodological quality. An analysis of multiple time points suggested that effects decrease over time, and our analysis provided no evidence that an effect remains six months after a corticosteroid injection.

### Prior intra-articular corticosteroid injection within 3 months may increase the risk of deep infection in subsequent joint arthroplasty: a meta-analysis [^115ntCma]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular injections containing a corticosteroid are used frequently, and periprosthetic joint infection is a serious complication after total joint arthroplasty. There is debate regarding whether intra-articular corticosteroid injections before arthroplasty increase periprosthetic joint infection after surgery.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does a previous intra-articular corticosteroid injection increase the odds of infection after subsequent hip or knee arthroplasty? (2) Does this risk vary based on how soon before the arthroplasty (such as less than 3 months before surgery) the injection is administered?

Methods

Using the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception to July 2021, we searched for comparative studies in English on patients who received intra-articular corticosteroid injections before arthroplasty and that tracked the frequency of infection after arthroplasty. We extracted data on the risk of infection after subsequent joint arthroplasty. The keywords included "corticosteroid", "steroid", "arthroplasty", "knee replacement", and "hip replacement". Eleven retrospective, comparative studies from four countries were included, of which 10 reported the specific diagnosis criteria and one did not. These articles included data on 173,465 arthroplasties in the hip or knee, as well as of 73,049 injections and 100,416 control patients. The methodologic quality of the included studies was evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale; the articles' scores ranged from 6 to 7 (the score itself spans 0 to 9, with higher scores representing better study quality). We found no evidence of publication bias based on the Egger test, and tests of heterogeneity generally found heterogeneity, so a random-effects model was used of our meta-analyses. A meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.3 software and Stata version 12.0 software.

Results

Overall, there were no differences in the odds of periprosthetic joint infection between the injection group and the control group among patients who received any kind of injection (odds ratio 1.22 [95% CI 0.95 to 1.58]; p = 0.12). However, in a subgroup analysis, there was a higher OR for postoperative PJI in patients with an intra-articular corticosteroid injection in the knee or hip within 3 months (OR 1.39 [95% CI 1.04 to 1.87]; p = 0.03). There were no differences in the infection risk in patients who had injections between 3 and 6 months before arthroplasty (OR 1.19 [95% CI 0.95 to 1.48]; p = 0.13) or between 6 and 12 months before arthroplasty.

Conclusion

The current evidence suggests ipsilateral intra-articular corticosteroid injections within 3 months before arthroplasty were associated with an increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection during subsequent joint arthroplasty. We recommend against performing total joint arthroplasty on a patient who has received an intra-articular corticosteroid injection within 3 months. Further high-quality studies on this topic from registries, national databases, or insurance company data are still required to confirm and extend our findings.

### Clinical effectiveness of one ultrasound guided intra-articular corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection in addition to advice and education for hip osteoarthritis (HIT trial): single blind, parallel group, three arm, randomised controlled trial [^1128FCLT]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Comparison of the effectiveness and safety of administering corticosteroid by alternative routes needs further research, given that a randomised controlled trial in people with hip osteoarthritis showed that intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was effective in reducing pain up to 12 weeks. As imaging findings of inflammation seem to predict response to injection, future research could investigate the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of a stratified approach to treatment. A need remains to understand more fully the incidence and risk factors for adverse reactions associated with intra-articular corticosteroid injections, such as infection. Furthermore, in view of recent studies suggesting that multiple corticosteroid injections might be associated with loss of cartilage volume or radiographical evidence of worsening of osteoarthritis, further studies are needed to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and optimal timing of repeated hip injections.

Conclusions

In community settings of musculoskeletal services, we have shown that an ultrasound guided intra-articular hip injection of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic, administered with advice and education, is a clinically effective treatment for rapid and sustained symptom response compared with advice and education alone for people with hip osteoarthritis. These findings provide evidence to inform international guidelines and support treatment decision making for policy makers, payers (commissioners), GPs, and clinicians in musculoskeletal services. Our patient advisory group felt that these findings offer an important choice to patients, particularly those who are unsuitable for surgery and might feel their treatment options are limited. As in routine clinical practice, caution should be applied in patients with risk factors for, or signs of, infection. Increased susceptibility to infection, greater severity of infection, and masking of symptoms and signs of infection are recognised after intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Our findings do not confirm or refute a causal link between glucocorticoid injection and bacterial endocarditis, but clinicians should specifically exert caution and carefully counsel patients with risk factors for endocarditis, such as those with a prosthetic heart valve.

### Analysis of the cost and efficacy of intra-articular knee injections [^111PP9H4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequently encountered orthopaedic conditions, affecting more than 9.3 million adults and accounting for more than $27 billion in annual healthcare expenditures in the United States alone. Although OA is known to be caused by wear and tear on knee joint cartilage, current treatment modalities target different aspects of the condition and follow a tiered approach. Medical management often begins with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to address inflammatory mediators, while physical therapy improves outcomes for symptomatic pain and stiffness. As the condition severity worsens, affected joints may be managed with intra-articular injections or operative management with total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

The efficacy of joint injections, however, presents a contentious topic. While corticosteroid (CS) injections have been repeatedly found to offer rapid onset pain relief, they have not demonstrated long-term effects. Although they are the most widely used intra-articular therapy for OA, reviews on CS injections have reported pain relief duration spans as short as 1 weekand up to 6 weeks, while effects past that window remain under debate. CS injections may paradoxically induce cartilage damage over time and increase the risk of OA progression. Similarly, the outcomes of hyaluronic acid (HA) injections are contested, with the long-term efficacy of this treatment modality unproven. Comparatively, the pain relief provided by HA seems enduring than that by CS injections, with several studies suggesting HA outperforms CS beyond 8 weeks from treatment.HA is also designed to restore and protect the physiologic environment of the joint capsule, which, in principle, is a positive effect on function. However, perceived benefits are weighed against a higher price point and the context of industry-backed studies with a preponderance for many of the positive findings currently published in peer-reviewed journals.

Studies dealing with an intra-articular corticosteroid injection to the hip and infection following subsequent THA were identified from databases for the period between 1990 to 2013. Retrieved articles were independently assessed for their methodological quality.

Results

A total of nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two recommended against a steroid injection prior to THA and seven found no risk with an injection. No prospective controlled trials were identified. Most studies were retrospective. Lack of information about the methodology was a consistent flaw.

Conclusions

The literature in this area is scarce and the evidence is weak. Most studies were retrospective, and confounding factors were poorly defined or not addressed. There is thus currently insufficient evidence to conclude that an intra-articular corticosteroid injection administered prior to THA increases the rate of infection. High quality, multicentre randomised trials are needed to address this issue. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B:1027–35.

### Injectable corticosteroids in treatment of arthritis of the knee [^112TNUby]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Injection of corticosteroid preparations for the local treatment of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the knee, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, has been used widely since the 1950s. This local therapy minimizes systemic toxicity and can result in rapid improvement in symptoms, most often as an adjunctive therapy for acute or severe symptom flares. The evidence assessing safety and efficacy is reviewed and analyzed. Intra-articular knee injection technique is described and is a procedure that is easy to learn and can be performed quickly in an office or hospital setting.

Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for osteoarthritis (OA) are strongly recommended for patients with knee and/or hip OA and conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA. Trials of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections have demonstrated short-term efficacy in knee OA, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is conditionally, rather than strongly, recommended for hand OA given the lack of evidence specific to this anatomic location. There are insufficient data to judge the choice of short-acting over long-acting preparations or the use of low rather than high doses.

ASRA Pain Medicine — Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) around arthroplasty and native joints: The incidence of infection following intra-articular injection into a native joint is rare. The risk of PJI following shoulder surgery is elevated in patients receiving IACSI injection within 3 months prior to surgery. The incidence of SSI following knee replacement surgery in patients receiving IACS injection preoperatively may be increased if administered within 3 months prior to surgery, and there is an increased risk of postoperative deep joint infection when IACS injection is administered within 1 month prior to total joint replacement surgery. Risk factors for native joint infection following IACSI injection include elevated BMI > 25 kg/m2, rheumatoid arthritis, and injections performed by general practitioners. Avoid IACS injection within 1 month of planned surgery for that joint. Evidence: grade B. Discuss with the surgeon the risks/benefits when considering IACS injection in a joint planned for replacement surgery within 3 months. Evidence: grade C. IACS injection to the knee should not be offered following TKA. Evidence: grade D.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^114Ng5Rb]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is an intramuscular glucocorticoid injection noninferior to an intra-articular glucocorticoid injection in reducing knee pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis in primary care?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial including 145 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis found intramuscular injection of the glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide could present an inferior effect in reducing pain at 4 weeks compared with the intra-articular injection. Noninferiority of an intramuscular injection was observed at 8 and 24 weeks after injection.

Meaning

The findings of this trial suggest both types of injection should be considered effective strategies and that a shared decision-making process should take place between clinicians and patients with knee osteoarthritis when a glucocorticoid injection is indicated.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^114NBF9J]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroids — Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids could provide short-term relief for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, with Strength of Recommendation: Moderate (downgrade). Overall pain and function improved with intra-articular corticosteroids; however, such effect lasted only up to 3 months. Analyses differentiating extended versus immediate release found that extended release IA steroids can be used over immediate release to improve patient outcomes (Moderate strength recommendation). The recommendation has been downgraded one level because of potential risk in accelerating osteoarthritis from injections. For implementation safety, the AAOS Patient Safety Committee recommends avoiding musculoskeletal corticosteroid injections for two weeks before and one week after COVID vaccine administration. The cost-effectiveness of different intra-articular therapies is still to be determined.

### A randomized trial of intra-articular injection therapy for knee osteoarthritis [^111WmDpN]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study included its single-center study setup and the single-dose intra-articular injection. The image-guided injection with contrast media assured correct intra-articular application, which is a crucial factor. This study is, to our knowledge, the first randomized trial comparing the use of glucocorticoids, hyaluronic acid, PRP, and placebo intra-articular injections.

Limitations

Up to now, there is no clear recommendation how often PRP should be injected. Because of the blinded study design, we could not offer multiple PRP injections to our patients.

Our study included patients with 1 or 2 knees treated. We took this into account in our statistical modeling and implemented a model with 2 random effects (for the patient and patient's knee) and an additional variable predictor that accounts for the treatment applied to the contralateral knee. Because systemic effects of glucocorticoid injections have only been reported up to 1 month after the initial injection, we injected the second knee at least 3 months after the injection in the contralateral knee.

Lastly, intra-articular injections are known for strong placebo effect. Self-reported parameters such as pain and stiffness are susceptible to this phenomenon. Future studies with larger study cohorts are warranted to confirm our findings.

In summary, there is no evidence that knee injections with glucocorticoid, PRP, or hyaluronic acid have superior short- or long-term effects in patients with mild or moderate OA when compared with placebo.

Based on these results, treating physicians might avoid these injection therapies for the management of knee OA.

### Effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis on the rates of subsequent knee replacement and post-operative outcomes: a national cohort study of england [^115q88Qo]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis is an irreversible musculoskeletal condition associated with pain, morbidity, functional decline, and reduced quality of life. It is a significant public health problem and leads to substantial healthcare system and societal costs.

In the United Kingdom (UK), osteoarthritis is mainly managed by general practitioners (GPs) in primary care, with patients proceeding to secondary (hospital) care for surgical management if considered necessary. Following a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, there is an estimated 30% average lifetime risk of knee replacement. As the prevalence of osteoarthritis is increasing, the need for joint replacement surgery is expected to increase considerably over the coming decades. Intermediate surgical procedures such as arthroscopy and debridement are also routinely offered, although these have been discouraged given growing evidence of lack of benefit and potential harms.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on the management of osteoarthritis states referral for joint replacement should only be made after trying all other appropriate treatments. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection (IACI) is an established treatment option for providing short-term pain relief and can be considered when other treatments are ineffective or unsuitable. NICE and Cochrane state there is no evidence of IACI therapeutic benefit on pain lasting beyond the short-term (3–6 months), although high heterogeneity of evidence is noted. There is a lack of longer-term follow-up in most studies of the effects of IACI, meaning there is scarcity of data on the impact of IACI on outcomes, including the subsequent need for joint replacement. Whilst the pain relief afforded by IACI could be expected to delay the need for surgical management, there are emerging reports of recurrent use of IACI being associated with adverse outcomes such as radiological osteoarthritis progression and joint damage, although inconsistent findings have been reported.

There have also been some reports of patients who receive an IACI prior to knee replacement surgery being at increased risk of post-operative infection, although findings have not been consistently replicated and more research is needed.

Our aim was therefore to use quasi-experimental methods applied to a large primary and secondary care linked electronic health record database to assess the effects of IACI for knee osteoarthritis on the incidence of subsequent joint surgery and on post-operative patient-reported outcomes and adverse events.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee… [^1116ZhzV]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question How effective and safe are intra-articular corticosteroid injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Evidence-Based Answer Intra-articular corticosteroid injections can be used to reduce pain by about 20% in the short term in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Intra-articular injections cause joint infections in one out of 14, 000 to 77, 000 procedures and can result in hyperglycemia for two to three days in patients with diabetes mellitus. Injections should not be given more often than every three months. Evidence Summary EFFECTIVENESS A meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials comparing a single corticosteroid injection with placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee showed improvement in pain but not in function at one week.

There was no improvement in any parameter at longer intervals. SAFETY A systematic review found no significant differences in withdrawal rates, number of postinjection steroid flares, or local discomfort. 1 A randomized trial of patients with osteoarthritis who received intra-articular corticosteroid or saline injections found no difference in radiographic appearances between the groups. 2 A cohort study of 65 patients with osteoarthritis who were given multiple corticosteroid injections and followed for up to 20 years found no correlation between the frequency of injections and deterioration on radiography.
3. Joint Infection. A retrospective study asked 69 rheumatologists to recall all episodes of joint infection after intra-articular corticosteroid injections that they performed during their careers. 4 They reported a total of 15 joint infections out of an estimated 1.

6 million injections into a variety of joints. Another retrospective review cited in the meta-analysis above 1 reported infection rates of one in 14, 000 to 50, 000 injections. Recommendations from Others The American College of Rheumatology recommends that intra-articular corticosteroid injections be administered no more often than every three months for patients with osteoarthritis whose symptoms are not controlled with full-dose acetaminophen. 7 A guideline from the United Kingdom's National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions recommends intra-articular corticosteroid injections in combination with exercise and weight loss for pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. 8.

### The efficacy of intra-articular steroids in hip osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^115pBTUM]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

International guidelines recommend intra-articular steroid injections (IASIs) in the management of hip osteoarthritis (OA), though these recommendations are extrapolated primarily from studies of knee OA. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of IASI on pain in hip OA.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to May 2015. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of hip IASI on pain were included. Pre-specified data was extracted using a standardised form. Quality was assessed using the Jadad score.

Results

Five trials met the inclusion criteria. All had a small number of participants (≤ 101). All studies reported some reduction in pain at 3–4 weeks post-injection compared to control. Based on data from individual trials the treatment effect size was large at 1 week post-injection but declined thereafter. A significant (moderate effect size) reduction in pain was reported in two trials up to 8 weeks following IASI. Pooled results of two trials (n = 90) showed an increased likelihood of meeting the Outcome measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT)-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) response criteria at 8 weeks post-IASI, odds ratio 7.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.7–22.8). The number needed to treat to achieve one OMERACT-OARSI responder at 8 weeks post-injection was 2.4 (95% CI: 1.7–4.2). Hip IASI appear to be generally well tolerated.

Conclusions

Hip IASI may be efficacious in short-term pain reduction in those with hip OA though the quality of the evidence was relatively poor. Further large, methodologically rigorous trials are required to verify whether intra-articular corticosteroids are beneficial and for how long.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: what the orthopaedic provider needs to know [^111k87Nn]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been used for decades in the management of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and remain a common practice. The pain relief from a steroid injection is thought to work by reducing inflammation within the arthritic knee. Substantial variability remains among providers with regard to the technique used to perform the procedure, including the site of the injection, the medications injected, and the level of sterility. The success of steroid injections in relieving arthritic knee pain most often occurs in the short term. However, the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections varies within the published literature. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline does not support conclusive recommendations about the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Providers should be aware of the adverse effects and potential complications of these injections when using them in clinical practice.

### Effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis on the subsequent use of pain medications: a UK CPRD cohort study [^114fen3z]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis is a common and progressive musculoskeletal condition associated with pain, morbidity, functional decline and reduced quality of life. Approximately 10% of adults are estimated to have some degree of joint osteoarthritis. It is a significant public health problem and is associated with substantial healthcare system and societal costs. Due to population ageing and increases in risk factors like obesity, the prevalence of osteoarthritis is increasing.

Common treatments for osteoarthritis aim to reduce pain and improve function. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection (IACI) has been a recognized treatment option for over 50 years. Cochrane reports 'small to moderate' benefits of IACI for knee osteoarthritis on pain reduction lasting up to six weeks in clinical trials, although concludes it is unclear if clinically important benefits last beyond six weeks, and no evidence of an effect at six months. NICE guidance recommends use of IACI for short-term pain relief when other treatments are ineffective or unsuitable, but recognizes there is no evidence of therapeutic benefit lasting beyond three months.

However, high heterogeneity of previous findings on IACI effectiveness and low overall quality of evidence has been noted. There is a need for better data on longer-term outcomes following IACI. Despite the widespread use of IACI worldwide, most evidence to date pertains to knee osteoarthritis, and future research on the effects of IACI at non-knee joints has been explicitly recommended. Furthermore, whilst OARSI guidelines suggest up to four injections per year could be used, it is acknowledged that data are limited on the appropriate frequency of IACI administration.

Our aim was therefore to use quasi-experimental methods applied to routinely collected medical record data to assess the effects of single or repeated use of IACI on longer-term use of pain medications amongst people with knee, hip, hand or shoulder osteoarthritis.

### The efficacy and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review of level I studies [^111qoaWJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of the current literature to determine the efficacy and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection in reducing pain caused by knee osteoarthritis and to determine whether the type of corticosteroid used affected these results. Following an electronic search of multiple databases and a review of reference lists from various articles, we found six trials in five papers that compared corticosteroid versus placebo and four papers that compared different corticosteroids. Results of corticosteroid compared with placebo showed both a statistically and clinically significant reduction in pain at 1 week, with an average difference between groups of 22%. Two of four trials showed triamcinolone to be more effective in pain reduction than other corticosteroids. We concluded that intra-articular corticosteroids reduce knee pain for at least 1 week and that intra-articular corticosteroid injection is a short-term treatment of a chronic problem.
