## Question

What is the role of fibrinolytic therapy in retinal detachment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of fibrinolytic therapy in retinal detachment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the types of retinal detachment and where fibrinolysis might logically fit. Then, I should verify the specific indications and routes of administration described in the documents. Next, I will examine the mechanism of action, review the evidence for efficacy and safety, and contrast this approach with standard non-hemorrhagic retinal detachment management. Finally, I need to synthesize practical clinical implications, dosing and timing considerations, limitations of the evidence, and clear boundaries where fibrinolytics should not be used.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions. Retinal detachment includes rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative forms, and fibrinolytic therapy is not described as a primary treatment for these mechanisms themselves; instead, its reported role is narrow and adjunctive when hemorrhage is a dominant barrier, such as massive subretinal hemorrhage producing a hemorrhagic or bullous detachment, suprachoroidal hemorrhage complicating repair, or submacular hemorrhage sometimes accompanied by exudative detachment, including polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy contexts [^112aXic6] [^112jjgz9] [^111xqeHB] [^117XCNWt] [^113guEwT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should specify the indications precisely. The documents support fibrinolytic use in two principal scenarios: first, massive subretinal hemorrhage where clot organization prevents efficient surgical drainage and retinal reattachment maneuvers, and second, suprachoroidal hemorrhage where pre-drainage liquefaction can facilitate evacuation, with an additional related setting being submacular hemorrhage in which subretinal tPA is used intraoperatively and may coincide with exudative detachment in certain vasculopathies; importantly, in each scenario, the fibrinolytic is adjunctive to vitrectomy, retinotomy or drainage steps, tamponade, and positioning rather than a standalone therapy for the detachment mechanism [^112jjgz9] [^111xqeHB] [^117XCNWt] [^113guEwT].

> I will now examine the mechanism of action and perioperative strategy. The rationale is to accelerate fibrin clot lysis so that thick, organized blood can be mobilized and evacuated; reports describe intravitreal tPA administered 12–24 hours preoperatively to liquefy subretinal hemorrhage followed by vitrectomy with peripheral retinotomy and perfluorocarbon-assisted drainage, while natural clot liquefaction may otherwise take 10–14 days and risk deferring repair; gas tamponade and posturing can assist displacement in submacular hemorrhage cases as well [^112jjgz9] [^111xqeHB] [^1153CHBx]. Wait, let me verify the route in the suprachoroidal hemorrhage report to avoid misattribution; I will come back to this in the safety section to ensure accuracy [^111xqeHB].

> Next, I should review the evidence for efficacy and be cautious with interpretation. Case series of massive subretinal hemorrhage with hemorrhagic detachment report improved visual acuity in most eyes and successful intraoperative evacuation after preoperative tPA, but sample sizes are very small; a single suprachoroidal hemorrhage case after retinal detachment repair showed dramatic improvement after targeted r-tPA to liquefy the clot before drainage; subretinal tPA for submacular hemorrhage shows high rates of hemorrhage displacement and stabilization or improvement in vision, yet these are uncontrolled experiences and outcomes are limited by underlying macular pathology and disease chronicity [^112jjgz9] [^111xqeHB] [^117XCNWt]. Hold on, I should double-check for randomized data — none are identified here for these RD-related hemorrhagic scenarios, reinforcing that the current evidence base is low quality and observational [^112jjgz9] [^111xqeHB] [^117XCNWt].

> Now, I need to assess safety and dosing with self-verification. Human studies used 100 µg intravitreal tPA and 48 µg subretinal tPA, which appears within a generally safe range based on available reports [^111xqeHB] [^117XCNWt]. Wait, let me verify the routes because I may have misstated them; in the suprachoroidal hemorrhage case, r‑tPA was actually given intracamerally and into the suprachoroidal space, not intravitreally, so my earlier wording about 100 µg intravitreal in that report was incorrect and I should correct it here to intracameral plus suprachoroidal administration, whereas 48 µg was delivered subretinally during vitrectomy for submacular hemorrhage in a separate series [^111xqeHB] [^117XCNWt]. I should also confirm toxicity boundaries; rabbit data suggest no retinal toxicity up to 50 µg tenecteplase intravitreally with dose-dependent retinal damage at higher doses, underscoring that higher intravitreal fibrinolytic doses can be harmful and that cautious dosing and route selection are essential; risks of rebleeding and iatrogenic injury exist but are not well quantified in these small series [^115Pbcsb].

> But wait, what if we mistakenly generalize fibrinolysis to standard, non-hemorrhagic detachments; I need to ensure we delineate standard of care. Management of rhegmatogenous detachment relies on pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, or pneumatic retinopexy with laser or cryotherapy and appropriate tamponade, tractional detachments require vitrectomy with membrane dissection and are often optimized with anti-VEGF in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and exudative detachments are primarily medical with surgery as salvage; fibrinolytics have no established role in these non-hemorrhagic mechanisms and should not delay definitive RD repair pathways [^112aXic6] [^114kMqg8] [^111STpYs] [^113KQyGB] [^114g5U4L] [^114Exqo1].

> Let me consider related pathophysiological signals to avoid overextending implications. Elevated fibrinogen correlating with broader extent of rhegmatogenous detachment may reflect inflammation or adhesion biology but does not justify fibrinolysis as therapy for primary RRD; likewise, PAI‑1's link to AMD and experimental neovascularization pertains to choroidal neovascular disease rather than RD, and contemporary PVR concepts emphasize glial injury responses rather than fibrin pathways, arguing against fibrinolytic use for PVR prevention or primary RD pathogenesis modulation [^116i3374] [^1135KH2i] [^111XcmN9].

> I should confirm the procedural nuances and timing, as these affect outcomes. For massive subretinal hemorrhage with hemorrhagic RD, preoperative tPA given 12–24 hours before PPV aims to liquefy clot for perfluorocarbon-assisted retinotomy drainage, followed by gas tamponade and posturing; for submacular hemorrhage, direct subretinal tPA injection during PPV with subsequent fluid–gas exchange supports displacement; for suprachoroidal hemorrhage, targeted r‑tPA in the suprachoroidal space plus intracameral administration immediately before drainage can hasten evacuation ahead of the usual 10–14 day spontaneous liquefaction window; in each scenario, dose selection must respect toxicity observations and route-specific safety considerations to minimize retinal injury [^112jjgz9] [^117XCNWt] [^111xqeHB] [^115Pbcsb] [^1153CHBx].

> Hold on, I should verify contraindications and non-indications to keep clinicians anchored. Fibrinolytics are not indicated for primary rhegmatogenous detachment without hemorrhage, tractional detachment from proliferative diabetic retinopathy, exudative detachment from inflammatory or neoplastic causes, or for prevention of PVR; they should be reserved for hemorrhagic obstacles to surgical repair and must not delay or replace standard RD surgical strategies [^112aXic6] [^113KQyGB] [^111XcmN9].

> I need to ensure we acknowledge evidence limitations and future directions. The current literature consists of small case reports and series without randomized controls, with heterogeneous dosing, routes, and co-interventions; larger prospective studies are needed to define patient selection, dose–route–timing parameters, and comparative effectiveness versus standard drainage techniques alone, along with systematic safety assessment including rebleeding and retinal toxicity risks [^112jjgz9] [^111xqeHB] [^117XCNWt].

> In summary, after double-checking the pathways and data, fibrinolytic therapy has a narrow, adjunctive role in retinal detachment care limited to hemorrhagic scenarios where organized subretinal or suprachoroidal clot impedes repair, facilitating clot liquefaction to enable safer and more effective surgical evacuation; it is not a treatment for the detachment mechanism itself, and its use should be carefully dosed, route-specific, and integrated into standard vitreoretinal surgical workflows [^112jjgz9] [^111xqeHB] [^117XCNWt].

Fibrinolytics are not used for **retinal detachment** [^112aXic6] because the condition is not caused by fibrin clots, and there is no evidence that fibrinolytics improve outcomes. The **standard of care is surgical repair** [^112aXic6] (pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, or pneumatic retinopexy) [^114Exqo1]. Fibrinolytics are only used in retinal surgery to liquefy subretinal [^112jjgz9] or suprachoroidal hemorrhage [^111xqeHB] to facilitate drainage, not to treat the detachment itself. They carry risks of intraocular bleeding [^117XCNWt] and retinal toxicity [^115Pbcsb], so their use is limited to specific hemorrhagic complications, not retinal detachment.

---

## Pathophysiology of retinal detachment

Retinal detachment is **classified into three main types** [^112aXic6] based on underlying mechanisms:

- **Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)**: Caused by retinal breaks allowing vitreous fluid into the subretinal space [^112aXic6], separating the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [^1113cD7j].

- **Tractional retinal detachment (TRD)**: Resulting from vitreoretinal traction due to contracting membranes [^112aXic6], commonly seen in proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^1139W4Db] and other proliferative vitreoretinopathies.

- **Exudative retinal detachment (ERD)**: Caused by accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space [^112aXic6] due to inflammatory, vascular, or neoplastic conditions [^114g5U4L].

The primary goal of retinal detachment management is to **reattach the retina** [^112aXic6] and prevent further vision loss. This is typically achieved through surgical interventions such as pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, or pneumatic retinopexy [^114Exqo1].

---

## Fibrinolytic agents: mechanism of action and clinical applications

Fibrinolytic agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase, and streptokinase, act by **converting plasminogen to plasmin**, which subsequently degrades fibrin clots, and are primarily used in clinical settings where fibrin clot dissolution is required, such as acute myocardial infarction [^113L4QdV], pulmonary embolism, and ischemic stroke; in ophthalmology [^111xqeHB], fibrinolytic agents have been explored primarily for their ability to **liquefy organized blood clots** [^117XCNWt] in the subretinal or suprachoroidal space [^112jjgz9], facilitating surgical drainage and improving visual outcomes.

---

## Evidence for fibrinolytic use in retinal detachment

A comprehensive review of the literature reveals that fibrinolytic agents are **not used as primary treatments for retinal detachment** [^112aXic6] itself. Instead, their use is limited to specific clinical scenarios involving hemorrhagic complications associated with retinal detachment surgery or other retinal conditions.

---

### Subretinal hemorrhage management

Fibrinolytic agents, particularly tPA, have been used to **liquefy subretinal hemorrhages** [^117XCNWt], facilitating their displacement or drainage during surgical procedures. For example, in cases of massive subretinal hemorrhage associated with retinal detachment, intravitreal or subretinal injection of tPA has been employed to liquefy the clot, allowing for easier surgical removal and potentially improving visual outcomes [^112jjgz9].

---

### Suprachoroidal hemorrhage management

Similarly, fibrinolytic agents have been used to **liquefy organized clots** in the suprachoroidal space [^111xqeHB], facilitating surgical drainage and reducing intraocular pressure. This approach has been reported in cases of suprachoroidal hemorrhage complicating retinal detachment surgery.

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications associated with fibrinolytic use

Use of fibrinolytic agents in ophthalmology is associated with several **potential complications**, including:

- **Intraocular hemorrhage**: Increased risk of bleeding due to fibrin clot dissolution [^117XCNWt].

- **Retinal toxicity**: Potential retinal damage, particularly at higher doses, as demonstrated in animal studies [^115Pbcsb].

- **Endophthalmitis**: Risk of infection associated with intravitreal injections [^112UFm5k].

- **Retinal detachment**: Although rare, fibrinolytic agents have been associated with retinal detachment as a complication of intravitreal injections [^115Pbcsb] [^111ZA3EU].

Given these potential complications, the use of fibrinolytic agents in ophthalmology is carefully considered and typically **reserved for specific clinical scenarios** where the benefits outweigh the risks.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not recommend the routine use** of fibrinolytic agents for the primary treatment of retinal detachment [^112aXic6]. Instead, fibrinolytic agents are reserved for specific clinical scenarios involving hemorrhagic complications, such as subretinal or suprachoroidal hemorrhages, where their use may facilitate surgical management and improve outcomes.

---

## Alternative treatments for retinal detachment

The **standard of care for retinal detachment remains surgical intervention**, including:

- **Pars plana vitrectomy**: Removal of vitreous gel and relief of tractional forces [^114Exqo1].

- **Scleral buckling**: External indentation of the sclera to close retinal breaks [^114kMqg8].

- **Pneumatic retinopexy**: Injection of gas bubble to reattach the retina [^112aXic6].

These surgical approaches have well-established efficacy and safety profiles and remain the **primary treatment modalities** for retinal detachment.

---

Fibrinolytic agents are **not used as primary treatments for retinal detachment** [^112aXic6]. Their use is limited to specific clinical scenarios involving hemorrhagic complications, such as subretinal [^112jjgz9] or suprachoroidal hemorrhages [^111xqeHB], where they may facilitate surgical management. The standard of care for retinal detachment remains surgical intervention, including pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, and pneumatic retinopexy [^114Exqo1].

### Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the treatment of suprachoroidal hemorrhage [^111xqeHB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Suprachoroidal hemorrhages are a vision-threatening complication, and poor visual outcome is correlated with increasing hemorrhage complexity. The recommended time for surgical drainage is 10–14 days after the hemorrhage begins to liquefy. We describe a case in which recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA), alteplase, is injected within the suprachoroidal space before surgery to assist in the drainage of an organized clot prior to liquefaction. This is a report of a technique in which r-tPA is used in the intrachoroidal space to target the organized clot of suprachoroidal hemorrhage prior to drainage.

- **Case report**: A 62-year-old male presented 12 days after retinal detachment repair with sudden ocular pain and vision loss following a Valsalva maneuver. Vision was light perception only, and intraocular pressure was 43 mmHg. Diagnosed with hyphema and suprachoroidal hemorrhage, the patient underwent surgery the following day. An injection of r-tPA 100 μg was given intracamerally, and an additional dose of r-tPA 100 μg was injected into the suprachoroidal space prior to surgery. Liquified by r-tPA, the clot was expressed through the sclerotomies. Best corrected vision in the eye eight months after the drainage procedure was 20/40.

- **Conclusion**: To the author's knowledge, this is the first reported case in which r-tPA was successfully injected in the suprachoroidal space to liquefy and drain a suprachoroidal hemorrhage prior to natural dissolution.

### Pars plana vitrectomy with peripheral retinotomy after injection of preoperative intravitreal tissue plasminogen activator: A modified procedure to drain massive subretinal haemorrhage [^112jjgz9]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to report the outcome of a modified procedure for draining massive subretinal haemorrhages (SRHs). The charts of eight consecutive eyes from eight patients with massive SRHs — extending to the periphery and involving two or more quadrants with haemorrhagic and bullous retinal detachment — were reviewed. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was injected intravitreally 12–24 hours preoperatively. Vitrectomy was carried out with peripheral retinotomy, drainage of the SRH from the retinotomy using perfluorocarbon liquid, and gas tamponade with prone positioning postoperatively.

The preoperative visual acuities ranged from light perception to 20/200. Most of the subretinal haematomas moved postoperatively to the vitreous cavity through the peripheral retinotomy using perfluorocarbon liquid. Residual SRHs were drained from the anterior chamber at the bedside after prone positioning overnight. SRH recurred in one eye 14 months postoperatively and was successfully retreated. No other serious complications developed. The final visual acuity improved in seven eyes, ranging from 20/1000 to 20/60. Polypoidal lesions in choroidal vasculatures were present in three of seven patients.

The technique appears safe and effective for treating massive SRH. However, visual recovery is limited by the underlying macular pathology. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, other than age-related macular degeneration, may be another cause of massive SRHs.

### Tamponade in the surgical management of retinal detachment [^114Exqo1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite treatment advances, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) can have poor visual outcomes even with prompt and appropriate therapy. Pars plana vitrectomy is a leading management modality for the treatment of RD and is generally accompanied by the use of internal tamponade. Various gases and silicone oils may yield beneficial outcomes. Heavy silicone oils have been approved in some European nations but are not available in the United States. Different tamponade agents have unique benefits and risks, and the choice of agent should be individualized according to the characteristics of the patient and RD, as well as perioperative and postoperative factors.

### Retinal detachment [^112aXic6]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2024). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment (RD) occurs when the neurosensory retina, the neurovascular tissue responsible for phototransduction, is separated from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Given the importance of the RPE for optimal retinal function, RD invariably leads to decreased vision. There are three main types of RD: rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative (also termed serous) RD.

In rhegmatogenous RD, one or more retinal breaks enable vitreous fluid to enter the subretinal space and separate the neurosensory retina from the RPE. In tractional RD, preretinal, intraretinal, or subretinal membranes contract, exert tangential forces, and elevate the retina from the underlying RPE. Finally, in exudative RD, an underlying inflammatory condition, vascular abnormality, or the presence of a tumor causes exudative fluid to accumulate in the subretinal space, exceeding the osmotic pump function of the RPE.

The surgical management of RD usually involves pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, or pneumatic retinopexy. The approach taken often depends on patient characteristics, as well as practitioner experience and clinical judgment. Advances in surgical technology and continued innovation have improved outcomes for many patients. However, even if retinal reattachment is achieved, some patients still experience decreased vision or other visual symptoms, such as metamorphopsia, that diminish their quality of life. Continued research in the areas of neuroprotection and retinal biology, as well as continued surgical innovation, are necessary to enhance therapeutic options.

### Retinal vein thrombosis: The internist's role in the etiologic and therapeutic management [^111QfE8K]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common and significant cause of vision loss. Generally, there is limited knowledge about this condition within an internist's practice, despite its relevance due to associations with other chronic ailments. A diagnosis of RVO should prompt the investigation of conditions that require chronic management in these patients. This review summarizes the clinical presentation of RVO, its classification, associated risk factors, and treatment, focusing on the internist's scope of practice.

### Mendelian randomization implicates causal association between epigenetic age acceleration and age-related eye diseases or glaucoma endophenotypes [^1135KH2i]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). High credibility.

PAI-1 is the main substance that inhibits fibrinolytic activity in blood circulation; an increase in PAI-1 levels can lead to a decrease in fibrinolytic activity, thus increasing the risk of thrombosis. However, we did not observe a significant association between genetically predicted PAI-1 and RVO. The annual incidence of AMD is 0.03% in people aged 55 to 59 years, increasing to 3.67% in people aged 90 years or older. DNA methylation estimated PAI-1 level was related to an increased risk of AMD, but the OR was relatively small. This finding was consistent with previous studies showing that PAI-1 could induce the development of choroidal experimental neovascularization in AMD, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach of targeting PAI-1 in neovascular AMD.

DNA methylation estimated GCP was associated with a decreased risk of presbyopia in this study. Presbyopia results from the declined accommodation of the ciliary muscle and lens. Our findings raise concerns about the effect of age-associated inflammation on the development of presbyopia. Conversely, genetically predicted GCP was associated with an increased risk of RRD, with a meaningful OR value, suggesting that age-associated inflammation significantly contributed to the development of RRD. Maidana et al. found that peripheral monocytes and neutrophils were responsible for photoreceptor degeneration in an experimental retinal detachment model, highlighting the important role of immune cell infiltration in the pathogenesis of retinal detachment.

There are inevitable limitations to our study.

### Management of persistent exudative retinal detachment: Exploring etiology and surgical outcomes [^114g5U4L]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Exudative retinal detachment (ERD) is a condition that arises from dysfunction in the retinal pigment epithelium or vascular compromise, leading to the accumulation of subretinal fluid. Potential causes include inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes in the choroid or retina. The prognostic outcomes for ERD exhibit significant variability and are strongly influenced by the underlying etiology. Acute, self-resolving etiologies of ERD are associated with a favorable prognosis, while chronic, irreversible etiologies present a poor prognosis.

While medical management represents the primary therapeutic approach for ERDs, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) may be warranted in cases of persistent posterior pole involvement that demonstrate resistance to medical treatment. Surgical intervention is typically reserved as a salvage procedure. It plays a crucial role in optimizing visual outcomes or preventing enucleation in advanced presentations of ERD.

The management of ERD exhibits significant variability, with no universally accepted surgical algorithm. The role of vitreoretinal surgery in treating ERD remains a topic of debate within the ophthalmic literature. Existing studies have documented a range of surgical approaches based on the patient's etiology, age, and disease severity. The impaired blood-retinal barrier and increased inflammation in ERD cases may result in the recurrence of subretinal fluid (SRF), proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and ultimately surgical failure. This report aims to present the causes, clinical features, and surgical outcomes of ERD.

### Fibrinogen and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: A pilot prospective study [^116i3374]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation, if any, between fibrinogen plasma levels (FPL) and the clinical features of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).

- **Methods**: Fibrinogen plasma levels were measured preoperatively in 33 patients with primary RRD. Patient characteristics and detachment features, such as the number of breaks and the extent of the detachment, were recorded.

- **Results**: No statistically significant correlation was found between FPL and the number of breaks. A statistically significant correlation was found between FPL and the extent of the RRD, even if the influence of the number of breaks was excluded.

- **Conclusions**: FPL correlate with retinal detachment extent, which implicates an acute inflammatory response to the detachment traumatic phenomenon or a role of the fibrinogen molecule in retinal adhesiveness.

### Intravenous fibrinolytic therapy in central retinal artery occlusion: A patient-level meta-analysis [^111MqEzm]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmologic emergency that can result in blindness. At present, no proven therapy for CRAO exists. Treatment with fibrinolytic agents has shown promise but remains of unproven benefit.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy of systemic fibrinolytic therapy for patients with CRAO and to define a time window of efficacy.

- **Data sources**: We systematically queried PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using the following index terms: "retinal artery occlusion" OR "retinal ischemia" AND "thrombolysis" OR "fibrinolysis" OR "tissue plasminogen activator" OR "streptokinase" OR "urokinase". The search was not limited by year of publication or language and was conducted in August 2014. In addition, we evaluated the references from relevant review articles.

- **Study selection**: We assembled observational studies reporting on visual acuity outcomes after CRAO. Inclusion criteria were complete reporting of visual outcomes after CRAO (with or without fibrinolytic therapy) and a series of more than 5 patients for fibrinolysis treatment or more than 20 cases when untreated or treated with conservative modalities.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Patient-level data were sought for studies reporting outcomes of treatment with fibrinolysis. Summary statistics were obtained for conservative treatment and natural history studies. The studies were weighted by the inverse of variance and merged in a random-effects model.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Rate of visual recovery, defined as improvement of visual acuity from 20/200 or worse at presentation.

### Supra choroidal buckling in managing myopic vitreoretinal interface disorders: 1-year data [^113nVWVi]. Retina (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of the supra choroidal buckling procedure using a supra choroidal catheter, a new approach was tested for treating myopic vitreomacular interface disorders. This method is particularly useful in difficult cases of myopic traction maculopathy, with or without macular hole retinal detachment in posterior staphyloma, based on the concept of indenting the choroid only. The results are derived from a 1-year data study.

A newly developed supra choroidal catheter was used to deliver stabilized, cross-linked, long-acting hyaluronic acid as a filler in the supra choroidal space in the area of the staphyloma, forming a choroidal indenting effect. Prior to the injection, pars plana vitrectomy was performed without internal limiting membrane peeling to avoid the risk of breaking the roof of the foveal detachment in case of foveoschisis. This procedure was applied to 11 patients with myopic foveoschisis and 12 patients with myopic macular hole retinal detachment, 5 of whom had previously undergone unsuccessful primary repair by vitrectomy before inclusion in this trial. Clinical and optical coherence tomographic evaluations of these patients were conducted over a 1-year follow-up period.

Retinal layer restoration was achieved in all 11 eyes with myopic foveoschisis, gradually occurring over a period of 2 to 6 weeks postoperatively. There was no recurrence over the 12-month follow-up. Visual acuity improved by 1 line or more in 9 eyes (81.8%). Of the 12 eyes, 10 with macular hole detachment (83%) showed closure of the holes in association with the resolution of the detachment; 2 eyes showed resolution of the detachment and flattening of the macular region.

### Intraocular lens implantation after atopic cataract surgery decreases incidence of postoperative retinal detachment [^116bTeVW]. Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

To investigate the efficacy of intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in reducing the incidence of postoperative retinal detachment after cataract surgery in patients with atopic dermatitis, a retrospective review was conducted.

- **Participants**: One hundred sixty-nine eyes of 126 patients who underwent cataract surgery for atopic cataract. These patients were followed for more than one year. None of the eyes had a previous retinal detachment or retinal detachment surgery.

- **Methods**: The eyes were divided into two groups: 132 eyes of 95 patients with an IOL implantation (IOL group) and 37 eyes of 31 patients without an IOL implantation (aphakia group). The postoperative visual acuity and incidence of postoperative retinal detachment were compared between the two groups. Additionally, the effects of the location of the causative retinal breaks, intraoperative posterior capsule rupture, and postoperative posterior capsulotomy on the incidence of retinal detachments were evaluated.

- **Main outcome measures**: The postoperative corrected visual acuity, incidence of postoperative retinal detachment, and influence of intraoperative posterior capsule rupture on retinal detachment.

Results indicated that the final visual acuity was better than or equal to 20/20 in 128 eyes (97.0%) of the IOL group and in 29 eyes (78.4%) of the aphakia group (P = 0.0007). Retinal detachment after uncomplicated cataract surgery occurred in 3 eyes (2.3%) of the IOL group and in 8 eyes (25.8%) of the aphakia group (P < 0.0001, Mantel-Cox). Two out of three eyes (66.7%) with IOL implantation that later developed a retinal detachment belonged to the IOL group, compared to 1 out of 8 eyes (16.7%) in the aphakia group.

### Incidence of retinal detachment associated with atopic dermatitis in Japan: review of cases from 1992 to 2011 [^1165UY4S]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Ocular complications of atopic dermatitis (AD) include blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, keratoconus, iritis, cataract, and retinal detachment. Among these, retinal detachment is the most severe complication affecting the younger population and significantly impairing their quality of life. Previous single-center or multicenter retrospective studies reported a large number of retinal detachment patients with AD, with an increase in cases until 1993. This increase was attributed to the marked rise in severely affected AD patients in the late 1980s. However, no detailed studies regarding retinal detachment with AD have been reported after the 2000s, leaving the current status of retinal detachment with AD unknown.

The prevalence of adolescent AD in Japan markedly increased from 1967 to 1996. After 2000, AD therapies improved with the introduction of new therapeutic tools, including topical and systemic calcineurin inhibitors, and proactive therapies with topical calcineurin inhibitors and/or corticosteroids. The improvement in AD therapies led to a decreased prevalence of AD in 2006 compared to 1993. In Japan, topical tacrolimus therapy is approved as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with AD. These recent changes in AD therapies might influence the prevalence of retinal detachment associated with AD. Therefore, ophthalmologists and dermatologists are greatly interested in new trends in retinal detachment associated with AD.

### Intraocular foreign bodies extracted by pars plana vitrectomy: Clinical characteristics, management, outcomes and prognostic factors [^114xn6Aa]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

We identified two factors that were significantly associated with a worse outcome in our series: retinal detachment upon presentation and large IOFB. The extensive retinal and choroidal lesions produced by the large IOFBs induced the development of PVR that eventually led to the loss of vision. Given the poor outcomes associated especially with IOFBs larger than 3 mm, eye protection should play a major role in preventing this disability affecting young people.

### Management of central retinal artery occlusion: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112FG7Fk]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a form of acute ischemic stroke that causes severe visual loss and is a harbinger of further cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events. There is a paucity of scientific information on the appropriate management of CRAO, with most strategies based on observational literature and expert opinion. In this scientific statement, we critically appraise the literature on CRAO and provide a framework within which to consider acute treatment and secondary prevention.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature review of randomized controlled clinical trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports, clinical guidelines, review articles, basic science articles, and editorials concerning the management of CRAO. We assembled a panel comprising experts in the fields of vascular neurology, neuro-ophthalmology, vitreo-retinal surgery, immunology, endovascular neurosurgery, and cardiology. Document sections were divided among the writing group members. Each member received an assignment to perform a literature review, synthesize the data, and offer considerations for practice. Multiple drafts were circulated among the group until consensus was achieved.

- **Results**: Acute CRAO is a medical emergency. Systems of care should evolve to prioritize early recognition and triage of CRAO to emergency medical attention. There is considerable variability in management patterns among practitioners, institutions, and subspecialty groups. The literature suggests that treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen

### Proliferative vitreoretinopathy: A revised concept of retinal injury and response [^111XcmN9]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Previous concepts for the pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) have focused exclusively on the central role of retinal pigment epithelium cells, potentially contributing to the lack of clinical advances. More recent studies have demonstrated the essential role of retinal glial cells in the PVR healing response but have failed to identify a consistent triggering mechanism.

We propose a revised concept for the pathogenesis of PVR based on retinal injury and response. A posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is invariably present in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and PVR. There is evidence to suggest that the shearing forces of acute PVD can cause mechanical injury to the inner retina and trigger a subsequent intraretinal glial healing response. This response is characterized by subclinical glial cell activation and proliferation, which may then be amplified into full-blown PVR by coexisting pathology such as retinal breaks and detachment.

- **Plane of separation**: Whether a PVD causes interface pathology depends on the plane of separation of the posterior vitreous and areas of increased vitreoretinal adhesions. If the vitreous separates in a plane or location that damages the inner retina, then glial cell activation and proliferation are likely to develop.

- **Severity of damage**: The severity of the subclinical inner retinal damage may represent one of the missing links in our understanding of the pathogenesis of PVR and could explain many of the findings encountered in clinical practice. Controlling the process of acute PVD and subsequent intraretinal response may be essential in the prevention and management of PVR.

### A paradigm shift in the management approaches of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: Role of anti-VEGF therapy [^1139W4Db]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-VEGF agents have been noted to play a significant role when the tractional component of PDR is considered. A TRD is associated with the multiplication of fibrous tissue or neovascular growth arising from retinal vasculature. Excessive tractional component occasionally leads to the bleeding of intricate new vessels into the vitreous or preretinal space, leading to vitreous/subhyaloid hemorrhage and retinal detachment. If PRP is performed before the development of serious PDR complications, including TRD, the incidence of severe vision loss is reduced by 50%. Additionally, patients with extramacular TRD require additional PRP to halt the extension of detachment to the macula.

In patients affected by PDR with TRD, bevacizumab was injected to prepare prior to surgical intervention. It was noted that in the 38 eyes with PDR that received preoperative bevacizumab, two eyes suffered worsening retinal traction within 1.5–2 months. In a separate series, worsening of the tractional component within 3–31 days (13 days mean) of bevacizumab injection suggested a cause–effect relationship. Studies have thus proven that anti-VEGF agents can lead to the worsening of TRD conditions in affected patients or might cause combined rhegmatogenous and tractional detachment.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for parapneumonic effusion and empyema, specifically in relation to intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, the PE-CG 2021 guidelines recommend avoiding the offer of monotherapy with fibrinolytics as a first-line approach for adult patients with empyema. Additionally, monotherapy with DNase should not be offered to adult patients with empyema.

### Ocular ultrasonography focused on the posterior eye segment: what radiologists should know [^113oLjnF]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment refers to the separation of the inner sensory layer of the retina from the outer pigmented layer. Retinal detachments are classified into three types, depending on the underlying mechanism: rhegmatogenous retinal detachment results from a retinal tear; tractional retinal detachment results from vitreoretinal traction due to contracting membranes; and exudative retinal detachment results from blood, exudative fluid, or a lesion in the subretinal space. Detachment is classified as total, partial, or focal, depending on its extension.

- **Ultrasonographic appearance**: On ultrasound (US), a total retinal detachment appears as a "V" shape in the vitreous cavity because the retina remains firmly attached to the ora serrata anteriorly and to the optic nerve head posteriorly (Fig. 15). In partial detachment, a linear echogenic membrane can be seen, usually extending to the optic nerve head, but not across it. The point of fixation at the optic nerve head is a useful feature for differentiating between retinal detachment and vitreous membrane. Retinal detachment is sometimes associated with subretinal hemorrhage (Fig. 16).

- **Dynamic examination characteristics**: In the acute setting, the retinal leaves look thin and mobile on dynamic scanning, whereas chronic detachments display thicker, echogenic leaves that are not mobile on dynamic examination. Chronic detachment is often seen as a rigid "triangle sign" (Fig. 17). Eventually, cysts may form within the retinal leaves in long-standing retinal detachment (RD) (Fig. 18).

### Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment after rupture of retinal arterial macroaneurysm [^1142smkT]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

To report two cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment following rupture of retinal arterial macroaneurysm:

- **Observational case report**: A review of clinical records of 75 consecutive eyes (73 patients) with macroaneurysm was conducted.

- **Results**: Ruptured macroaneurysm was present in 68 of the 75 eyes, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed spontaneously in 2 (2.9%) of the 68 eyes. In the 2 eyes with retinal detachment, there were no predisposing lesions, and the detachment occurred either 2 weeks or 1 month after the rupture of a macroaneurysm. Retinal detachment and posterior vitreous detachment developed simultaneously after bleeding from the macroaneurysm spread into the vitreous in 1 eye.

- **Conclusions**: We report the occurrence of retinal detachment after macroaneurysmal rupture. Detailed fundus examination is required to detect retinal detachment in the follow-up of patients with ruptured macroaneurysm.

### Pneumatic retinopexy for retinal detachment associated with severe choroidal detachment [^116kZmtG]. Retina (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of pneumatic retinopexy as an initial management strategy for retinal detachment associated with hypotony, severe choroidal detachment, and vitritis.

- **Methods**: Retrospective, interventional, noncomparative case series. We included nine eyes from nine patients (six women and three men) with retinal detachment associated with hypotony, severe choroidal detachment, and vitritis. These cases were managed with pneumatic retinopexy (either SF6 or C3F8) as their initial treatment between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2007.

- **Results**: Hypotony and choroidal detachment were rapidly and significantly improved 1 to 3 days after pneumatic retinopexy in all patients. The extent of retinal detachment decreased in five patients. After vitreoretinal surgery in these five patients, all exhibited attached retinas. Complete reattachment of the retina was noted in four patients after pneumatic retinopexy. Two of these patients did not require further surgery, as the entire retina remained attached at 6 months and 16 months postoperatively.

- **Conclusion**: Pneumatic retinopexy is a useful initial procedure in managing retinal detachment associated with hypotony, severe choroidal detachment, and vitritis. By rapidly resolving the hypotony and choroidal detachments, it facilitates subsequent surgical repair of this complicated retinal detachment. In addition, complete retinal reattachment after pneumatic retinopexy alone was initially achieved in 33% of eyes.

### Tent-shaped retinal detachments in retinopathy of prematurity [^112oJ8ED]. Retina (2006). Low credibility.

Most retinal detachments associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) are radial, segmental, or circumferential with cicatricial extraretinal fibrovascular proliferation (EFP) at the apex of the detachment. This report describes peculiar tent-shaped retinal detachments that developed among eyes with ROP.

- **Methods**: An observational case series consisting of 9 patients and 13 eyes with tent-shaped retinal detachments was conducted. Their morphology, clinical baseline, surgical course, and final retinal status were extracted from medical records.

- **Results**: Eight cases had simple tent-shaped retinal detachments, three had a double tent-shaped retinal detachment, one had a chevron-based retinal detachment, and one had a star-shaped retinal detachment. Each case had a disk-based stalk that extended to the apex of the traction retinal detachment and continued anteriorly. Twelve stalks inserted in the retrolental space and one terminated in the mid vitreous. Six eyes were stage 4A, two eyes were stage 4B, and five eyes were stage 5. Vitrectomy surgery was performed on 11 eyes, resulting in retinal attachment in nine eyes, while two retinas remained detached.

- **Conclusion**: Tent-shaped retinal detachments are seen in patients with ROP. A stalk should be sought in the evaluation of these eyes. Vitreous surgery aimed at relieving this traction is often successful.

### Posterior vitreous findings in cases of spontaneous retinal reattachment [^112Fp3zX]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

To describe the posterior vitreous findings in two patients with retinal detachment who experienced spontaneous retinal reattachment, two observational case reports were conducted. **Testing**: Biomicroscopic and high-resolution echographic evaluation of the vitreoretinal relationships were carried out. **Main outcome measures**: Retinal reattachment and echographic vitreoretinal relationships were closely monitored.

The results showed that two patients, one with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and one with a tractional retinal detachment, exhibited a partial posterior vitreous detachment with vitreoretinal adherence at the time of presentation. Spontaneous retinal reattachment occurred in both cases, and echography revealed complete vitreous separation from the retina.

In conclusion, complete posterior vitreous detachment may release tractional components in retinal detachment, contributing to spontaneous retinal reattachment.

### Multimodal imaging of tumour-related lipid exudation and exudative retinal detachment following brachytherapy in choroidal melanoma [^111UJYiR]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding long-term vascular changes, some studies have assessed the effects of I-125 brachytherapy and TTT as primary treatments for choroidal melanoma. Pilotto et al. reported that retino-choroidal anastomoses developed in 11% of patients treated with TTT, while none were observed in those treated with brachytherapy. These findings were associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence. In our case, fluorescein angiography has not yet been performed; thus, we cannot confirm the presence or absence of vascular anastomoses involving the tumor. However, based on the aforementioned study, the risk would be expected to be relatively low.

In conclusion, this case underscores the importance of recognizing TRLE as a potential complication of brachytherapy for choroidal melanoma and highlights the crucial role of multimodal imaging in its early detection and monitoring. The successful resolution of the exudative retinal detachment following brachytherapy combined with intravitreal aflibercept suggests that the combined therapy may be a useful option in managing TRLE. However, further studies are needed to better define its role. Case reports like this contribute valuable insights that help refine clinical decision-making and optimize treatment approaches for choroidal melanoma.

### Dramatic recovery of vision in patient with acute central retinal artery occlusion treated with local intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator [^1142ecxJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a devastating disease resulting in severe visual loss in most cases. It has no proven treatment, and a variety of management options used clinically all have a dismal rate of success. We report the outcome of treatment with local intra-arterial thrombolysis administered 2.75 hours after devastating visual loss from incomplete CRAO.

### Incidence, mechanism, and outcomes of schisis retinal detachments revealed through a prospective population-based study [^116pEdQj]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, presentation, and outcomes of progressive sight-threatening retinal detachment (RD) complicating degenerative retinoschisis.

The methods involved conducting the first prospective population-based epidemiological study of progressive schisis detachment over a 1-year period (2014–2015) in the UK. Case ascertainment was achieved through monthly British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit reporting cards sent to all ophthalmologists in the UK. For each reported case, data were collected using incident and 6-month follow-up questionnaires. These gathered information including demographics, presenting symptoms, retinal findings, primary management, primary outcome, secondary management, and secondary outcome.

Results indicated that fifty-five cases of progressive schisis RD were identified with a similar age distribution to conventional rhegmatogenous RD (mean age 64.0 years, range 20–88), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. The locations of schisis detachments were predominantly supratemporal (46.7%) and infratemporal (35.6%). At least 70% of schisis RD were associated with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) at presentation, and 21% with grade B-C proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Primary management consisted of pars plana vitrectomy (82%), scleral buckle (9%), observation (4%), laser (2%), and combined vitrectomy-buckle (2%). The primary reattachment rate was 70%. The final reattachment rate was 87%, with a mean best-corrected visual acuity of 0.49 Decimal (SD 0.34) for fovea-on and 0.42 Decimal (SD 0.29) for fovea-off schisis detachments at a mean follow-up of 8.7 months (SE 1.0).

### Izervay [^1158ahUq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:

	- **Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments (5.1)**: Intravitreal injections may be associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering Izervay in order to minimize the risk of endophthalmitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay, to permit prompt and appropriate management [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

	- **Neovascular AMD (5.2)**: In the GATHER1 and GATHER2 clinical trials, use of Izervay was associated with increased rates of neovascular (wet) AMD or choroidal neovascularization (7% when administered monthly and 4% in the sham group) by Month 12. Over 24 months, the rate of neovascular (wet) AMD or choroidal neovascularization in the GATHER2 trial was 12% in the Izervay group and 9% in the sham group. Patients receiving Izervay should be monitored for signs of neovascular AMD.

	- **Increase in intraocular pressure (5.3)**: Transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been observed after an intravitreal injection, including with Izervay [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored following the injection and managed as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Incidence of retinal detachment associated with atopic dermatitis in Japan: Review of cases from 1992 to 2011 [^114Egq87]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The annual changes in the number of surgically treated retinal detachments with atopic dermatitis (AD) reveal significant trends. The number of retinal detachments associated with AD and the total number of retinal detachments are described in Figure 1. Over the span of 20 years, no apparent change was noted in the annual number of total retinal detachments (Figure 1B). In contrast, retinal detachments with AD increased rapidly from 1992 to 1995 and continued this trend until 2001 (Figure 1A). Post-2001, a gradual decrease was observed, with no retinal detachment associated with AD treated in 2010. Due to the consistency in the total number of retinal detachments, the proportion of retinal detachments linked to AD increased from 1992 and tapered in the 2000s.

The number of first-visit AD patients in our dermatology clinic showed a linear decrease over these 19 years, from 153 cases in 1993 to 65 cases in 2011 (Figure 1C). The average age of these patients gradually increased during the study period, rising from a mean age of 19.41 years in 1993 to 24.94 years in 2011.

### The outcome of surgical management for giant retinal tear more than 180° [^114ZLt57]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Giant retinal tear (GRT) is a full-thickness retinal break extending circumferentially for ≥ 90° (≥ 3 clock hours) of the retina. It is a major and challenging ophthalmological problem with a wide variety of surgical techniques for unfolding and sealing the retinal tear.

Despite improvements in surgical maneuvers and tamponade agents, recurrence of the detachment still occurs due to several factors, such as reopening of the tear, formation of a new tear, or extension of the existing tear due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Furthermore, the surgical procedure is more challenging when the GRT circumference is more than 180° as there is a high risk of failure and retinal slippage.

There is a debate about the role of the scleral buckle procedure combined with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in the surgical management of GRT. While some surgeons consider it a beneficial procedure to help attach the retina, because it minimizes vitreoretinal tractional forces, others consider it a real cause of posterior retinal slippage due to its role in changing ocular contour and scleral shortening relative to the retina. Alternatively, some surgeons consider it only in rare cases.

In the study herein, the author examined the safety and efficacy of combined PPV, encircling scleral buckle, 360° laser retinopexy, and postoperative silicone oil tamponade in the management of GRT more than 180°.

### Therapeutic effect of suprachoroidal viscoelastic injection combined with 532 laser photocoagulation in treating rhegmatogenous retinal detachment [^114AdNKn]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is the most common form of retinal detachment, with an estimated annual incidence of 1 in 10,000 individuals. If not properly and promptly managed, this condition can lead to blindness in the affected eye. Multiple surgical treatment options are available for RRD, and a surgical plan tailored to the individual's specific condition is core to successful treatment. RRD is characterized by the formation of retinal holes, a process involving pathological interaction between the retina and the vitreous body. When the neural sensory layer (RNL) of the retina separates from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retinal changes caused by other ocular or systemic diseases have been excluded, RRD is diagnosed.

Traditional surgical treatments for RRD are primarily categorized into vitrectomy and scleral buckling surgery. Each approach has its specific indications, advantages, and limitations. Vitrectomy has advantages in managing complex cases of retinal detachment, such as those accompanied by choroidal detachment; however, it may entail risks of complications, such as secondary cataracts and glaucoma. In certain instances, additional surgery may be required for subsequent management. In contrast, scleral buckling surgery is renowned for its simplicity; however, patients may subsequently experience issues such as foreign body sensations within the eye, increased fragility due to scleral thinning, diplopia, and changes in refractive status.

To ensure that patients attain optimal visual acuity and quality postoperatively, innovative approaches and techniques continue to evolve and improve in the treatment of RRD.

### Natural history of asymptomatic clinical retinal detachments [^1144Mg1e]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the natural history of asymptomatic, clinical rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. This was a single-observer, prospective, consecutive, observational case series. Consecutive patients were included who were referred to the author's clinical practice with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment extending greater than two disk-diameters posterior to the equator. Patients whose eye had an intraocular procedure within the past year or who had a history of symptomatic retinal detachment in the fellow eye were excluded. Eighteen eyes of 16 patients were followed for an average of 46 months. The main outcome measure was progression from asymptomatic retinal detachment to symptomatic retinal detachment.

None of the 18 asymptomatic, clinical, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments became symptomatic. The posterior margin of one retinal detachment slightly progressed 4 months into the study and then stabilized for 4 years, remaining asymptomatic. Asymptomatic, clinical, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments can probably be safely observed for many years.

### Management of subretinal macular haemorrhage by direct administration of tissue plasminogen activator [^117XCNWt]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent studies on the treatment of acute subretinal macular haemorrhage have shown that the volume of the clot and the time to evacuation are strong prognostic factors for visual outcomes. A novel technique for the surgical evacuation of these lesions involves the direct injection of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) into the haematoma using pars plana vitrectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of this recently described procedure.

Seventeen consecutive patients with subretinal macular haemorrhages caused by age-related macular degeneration were enrolled. Patient demographics, acuities, and fluorescein angiograms were obtained for all evaluations. All patients underwent a complete three-port pars plana vitrectomy to enable direct cannulation of the subretinal space and injection of 48 µg of t-PA. This was followed by partial fluid-air exchange, one hour of face-up supine positioning postoperatively, and upright positioning overnight.

Eighty-eight percent of patients in the study experienced stabilization or improvement of visual acuity. Nine patients had total clearing of the macular haemorrhage, and eight patients had subtotal clearing. Two patients experienced a recurrence of haemorrhage after the procedure, and one patient underwent repair for retinal detachment. Occult lesions demonstrated similar outcomes to classic or predominantly classic lesions. Additionally, nine patients required no further therapy after the study to treat subfoveal neovascularisation.

This study represents one of the largest case series at the time of writing, showing that direct injection of subretinal t-PA is effective.

### Vabysmo [^112UFm5k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following potentially serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)], endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], increase in intraocular pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], and retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) reported in patients receiving Vabysmo were cataract (15%) and conjunctival hemorrhage (8%).

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data described below reflect exposure to Vabysmo in 2,567 patients, which constituted the safety population in six Phase 3 studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3)]. Less common adverse reactions reported in < 1% of the patients treated with Vabysmo were corneal abrasion, eye pruritus, ocular hyperemia, blurred vision, sensation of foreign body, endophthalmitis, conjunctival hyperaemia, visual acuity reduced, visual acuity reduced transiently, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tear, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

### Retinal toxicity of intravitreal tenecteplase in the rabbit [^115Pbcsb]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate the retinal toxicity of intravitreal injection of a novel fibrinolytic tenecteplase in rabbit eyes, tenecteplase (25–350 µg in 0.1 mL BSS) was injected into the vitreous cavity of normal rabbit eyes. Control (fellow) eyes received 0.1 mL of BSS. One day, one week, and two months post-injection, the eyes were examined by slit lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and electroretinography. They were then harvested for histopathological examination.

No evidence of retinal toxicity was observed with tenecteplase doses up to and including 50 µg. At a dose of 150 µg, ophthalmoscopy was normal, but histology showed mild retinal damage in the inner nuclear layer, and electroretinography showed a temporary reduction in B-wave amplitude. At doses of 200 µg and above, there was evidence of retinal toxicity on electroretinography, ophthalmoscopy, and histology. Ophthalmoscopic findings included vitreal fibrosis, retinal necrosis, and tractional retinal detachment, while light microscopy revealed necrosis of the retinal pigment epithelium and other retinal layers. Damage was centered around the injection site but was more widespread with higher doses.

A dose of 50 µg tenecteplase appears safe for intravitreal injection in the rabbit. Tenecteplase could have potential applications in the treatment of submacular hemorrhage and retinal vein occlusion.

### Incidence of retinal detachment associated with atopic dermatitis in Japan: Review of cases from 1992 to 2011 [^115uDbv3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment is a serious eye disease that impairs the quality of life for patients. A significant increase in cases of retinal detachment among patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) was reported in the 1990s. Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AD and improvements in therapies have led to better prognoses for severely affected AD patients. To understand recent changes in the prevalence of retinal detachment, both with and without AD, we investigated surgically treated patients with retinal detachment over the past 20 years at our hospital.

Reported cases of retinal detachment associated with AD are characterized by common bilateral involvement and development at a younger age compared to cases without AD. The causative break is frequently located in the peripheral ocular fundus, and the ciliary epithelium is often detached in many cases; these characteristics were observed in the present study. Additionally, the results demonstrated that postoperative visual functions in AD patients were better than those in non-AD patients. This improvement might be due to the younger age and a higher ratio of preoperative macular attachment in the eyes affected by AD compared to non-AD patients. Despite a higher ratio of preoperative macular attachment in the AD group, there was no significant difference in preoperative best-corrected visual acuity between the AD and non-AD groups. This discrepancy might be due to a higher ratio of preoperative cataract in AD patients.

### Do patients with retinal artery occlusion need urgent neurologic evaluation [^112jDjvB]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

To describe a framework for logical, immediate action to manage patients with retinal artery occlusion, a literature review and perspective was conducted. The review included literature on the subject and the author's own experience. Since embolism is the most common factor causing retinal artery occlusion, immediate evaluation and management of the source of embolism are critical to prevent further episodes.

The logical, immediate action to manage patients with retinal artery occlusion involves evaluation of the carotid artery and heart for embolism, checking fasting lipid levels, and conducting a complete blood count, rather than pursuing a neurological evaluation — unless there are neurological symptoms present.

### Interventions for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for preventing retinal detachment [^1133oVfe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration are visible lesions that are risk factors for later retinal detachment. Retinal detachments occur when fluid in the vitreous cavity passes through tears or holes in the retina and separates the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. The creation of an adhesion surrounding retinal breaks and lattice degeneration, with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy, has been recommended as an effective means of preventing retinal detachment. This therapy is of value in managing retinal tears associated with the symptoms of flashes, floaters, and persistent vitreous traction upon the retina in the region of the retinal break, because such symptomatic retinal tears are associated with a high rate of progression to retinal detachment. Retinal tears and holes unassociated with acute symptoms and lattice degeneration are significantly less likely to be the sites of retinal breaks responsible for later retinal detachment. Nevertheless, treatment of these lesions is frequently recommended, despite the fact that the effectiveness of this therapy is unproven.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to treat asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for the prevention of retinal detachment.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, and Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January).

### Parsplana vitrectomy alone versus parsplana vitrectomy combined with phacoemulsification for the treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: a randomized study [^111STpYs]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a sight-threatening disease initiated by the formation of a retinal break. When the separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium occurs, surgical management is required. The incidence of RRD has been reported to be between 6.3 and 17.9 per 100,000 population. RRD is largely more common in adults with myopia or pseudophakic eyes, but it can affect younger patients, particularly those with risk factors such as ocular trauma or hereditary ocular abnormalities.

Although scleral buckling surgery still plays a role in managing some types of RRD, there has been a trend toward parsplana vitrectomy (PPV) as the primary procedure in recent years. This trend may also be because young surgeons are particularly familiar with the latter technique. For phakic RRD, PPV can be performed with or without lens removal, and previous studies have reported advantages and drawbacks for both approaches.

- **Phacovitrectomy (PCV)**: PCV, or phacoemulsification combined with PPV, is associated with:
	- Enhanced retinal visualization during posterior segment surgery
	- Better access to the vitreous base, allowing for a more extensive vitrectomy and endolaser treatment, thereby ensuring more extensive gas filling and better tamponade of retinal breaks
	- Reduced risk through avoiding the need for a second surgery, which can be technically challenging due to the lack of vitreous support

However, there are also disadvantages of PCV, such as the risk of postoperative refractive errors, especially in macula-off cases.

### Scleral buckling in the management of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: Patient selection and perspectives [^114kMqg8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to the previously mentioned variables, vitreous liquefaction and posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) seem to be important factors in scleral buckling (SB) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). The presence of PVD affects the development of RRD, the shape of the retinal break, and the difficulty of SB surgery. Vitreous liquefaction can impact not only the progression of retinal detachment but also the closure of the retinal break and drainage of subretinal fluid (SRF). SB is suitable for RRD with less liquefied vitreous humor without PVD, whereas SB alone is not suitable for RRDs with fluidic vitreous humor and PVD.

The vitreous body is an important factor in the closure of the retinal breaks during SB because it plays the role of an intraocular tamponade to block the passage of fluid. The formed vitreous can be called a "bio-tamponade". A retinal break is closed effectively by SB without additional procedures in RRD associated with less liquefied vitreous. On the contrary, traction to the retinal break associated with PVD and vitreous liquefaction may prevent break closure, and sometimes external drainage of the SRF or injection of gas is required.

### Effect of prophylactic 360° laser treatment for prevention of retinal detachment after phacovitrectomy: (Prophylactic 360° laser treatment for prevention of retinal detachment) [^1111zqXS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of retinal detachment was significantly reduced in the 360° laser group, registering a rate of 0% (0/77 eyes) for retinal re-detachment after vitrectomy at 12 months following surgery for the macular hole (MH) cases, compared to 5.7% (2/35 eyes) in the control group (p = 0.034). One eye in the control group experienced a new retinal break corresponding to the sclerotomy site, while another showed a break in the inferonasal quadrant, unrelated to the sclerotomy. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated a significantly higher rate of retinal detachment in the control group compared to the 360° laser group (p = 0.035).

Postoperative retinal detachment occurred in 5.9% of the control group cases, with 3 eyes presenting new retinal breaks not correlated to the sclerotomy, and 13 eyes experiencing retinal detachment with reopening of causative breaks due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy. In contrast, the rate was 1.9% in the 360° laser group, where 2 eyes showed retinal detachment with reopening of breaks due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy; notably, the retina area treated with the 360° laser retinopexy did not re-detach. However, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.092). No patients developed retinal re-detachment beyond two months post-surgery in either group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no significant difference in retinal detachment rates between the groups in cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) (p > 0.05).

### Long-standing macula-involving diabetic tractional retinal detachments with good visual acuity: How should we manage these patients [^112zPXyZ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Subjects in the Study Group were administered a preoperative intravitreal anti-VEGF injection 1–14 days prior to the surgery. Small-gauge (23- or 25-gauge) PPV by six fellowship-trained retina surgeons under peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia was undertaken utilizing the Constellation Vision System (Alcon, TX, USA) platform. High-speed cutting rates (10,000–20,000 cuts/minute) were applied. Fibrovascular tissue extraction, endolaser photocoagulation placement, and endodiathermy utilization were conducted according to the unique situation of each subject. Careful and methodical preretinal fibrous tissue removal was undertaken until all exerting traction was eliminated. Hemostasis was obtained by meticulous endodiathermy applications to all relevant areas and by surgeon-induced intraocular pressure increases. Endodiathermy drainage retinotomies were made at the judgment of the operating surgeon. Endolaser photocoagulation was administered until all four quadrants of the retina had laser spots at least to the vitreous base. Dye-assisted membrane peeling and internal limiting peeling were conducted according to the inclination of the surgeon and according to patient need. The choice of a vitreous substitute was determined according to the surgeon's judgment. Postoperative positioning was advised according to the unique situation of each patient and according to the operating surgeon's judgment.

Subjects in the Control Group were managed in an office-based setting with one or more anti-VEGF injections, one or more sessions of PRP, or a combination of anti-VEGF therapy and PRP.

### Efficacy of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator in central retinal artery occlusion: report from a randomized, controlled trial [^114r4LwA]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion is a stroke of the eye caused by a platelet-fibrin thrombus or embolic occlusion. Observational studies suggest that thrombolytics may restore ocular perfusion and visual function. We hypothesized that intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) administered within 24 hours of symptom onset might restore ocular perfusion and visual function.

- **Methods**: A placebo-controlled, randomized trial of intravenous tPA versus intravenous saline was performed in patients with clinically defined central retinal artery occlusion within 24 hours of symptom onset. tPA was administered at a total dose of 0.9 mg/kg, with 10% given as a 1-minute bolus and the remainder over 1 hour. An improvement of visual acuity of 3 lines or more was considered significant.

- **Results**: Twenty-five percent (2 of 8) of the tPA group experienced the primary outcome at 1 week after tPA versus none of the placebo group. One patient had an intracranial hemorrhage. The visual acuity improvement of these 2 patients was not sustained at 6 months. In both patients, tPA was administered within 6 hours of symptom onset.

- **Conclusions**: Although essentially a negative study, it adds to the evidence base of reperfusion in central retinal artery occlusion by showing that the time window for intervention is likely to be less than 6 hours. Reocclusion is a potential problem and may require adjuvant anticoagulation. Future studies should concentrate on determining the efficacy of thrombolytics in the less than 6-hour time window.

### The prognostic influence of chronicity of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment on anatomic success after reattachment surgery [^11527jFk]. American journal of ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to investigate anatomic success after surgery for chronic retinal detachment.

- **Design**: Retrospective, case series review.

- **Methods**: The surgical outcomes of reattachment surgery for 36 eyes of 35 patients with chronic retinal detachments are reported and compared with the outcomes for 129 fresh retinal detachments.

- **Results**: After exclusion of retinal detachments secondary to retinal dialysis and cases with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), success following a single procedure was seen in eight of 14 (57.1%) chronic retinal detachments, compared with 92 of 107 (86.0%) fresh retinal detachments (P = 0.0161).

- **Conclusions**: Chronicity of retinal detachment at presentation is an important and poor prognostic indicator for reattachment surgery.

### Retinal detachment associated with AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis: Risk factors in a resource-limited setting [^112Emx6N]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine risk factors predictive of retinal detachment in patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in a setting with limited access to ophthalmic care, a case-control study was conducted. Sixty-four patients with CMV retinitis and retinal detachment were identified from the Ocular Infectious Diseases and Retina Clinics at Chiang Mai University. Three control patients with CMV retinitis but no retinal detachment were selected for each case, matched by calendar date.

The medical records of each patient were reviewed, with patient-level and eye-level features recorded for the clinic visit used to match cases and controls, and also for the initial clinic visit at which CMV retinitis was diagnosed. Risk factors for retinal detachment were assessed separately for each of these time points using multivariate conditional logistic regression models that included one eye from each patient.

Patients with a retinal detachment were more likely than controls to have low visual acuity (odds ratio [OR], 1.24 per line of worse vision on the logMAR scale; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.33) and bilateral disease (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 0.92–4.90). Features present at the time of the initial diagnosis of CMV retinitis that predicted subsequent retinal detachment included bilateral disease (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.18–6.08) and lesion size (OR, 2.64 per 10% increase in lesion size; 95% CI, 1.41–4.94).

Bilateral CMV retinitis and larger lesion sizes, each of which is a marker of advanced disease, were associated with subsequent retinal detachment.

### A paradigm shift in the management approaches of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: Role of anti-VEGF therapy [^113KQyGB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is considered one of the leading causes of vision loss globally. It principally causes upregulation of pro-angiogenic, proinflammatory, and vascular permeability factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to neovascularisation. The advanced stage of DR or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is of more concern, as it leads to vitreous haemorrhage and traction retinal detachment. Various risk factors associated with PDR include hyperglycemia, hypertension, neuropathy, dyslipidemia, anaemia, nephropathy, and retinal complications of drugs used for diabetes.

Management approaches for PDR have been stratified and involve pan-retinal photocoagulation, vitrectomy, and anti-VEGF agents. Given the emerging role of anti-VEGF agents as a favourable adjunct or alternative therapy, they have a critical role in the management of PDR. The review emphasizes management approaches for PDR, focusing on anti-VEGF therapy. It also highlights the risk/benefit evaluation of the various approaches employed for PDR management in various clinical scenarios.

### Subretinal injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and gas tamponade to displace acute submacular haemorrhages secondary to age-related macular degeneration [^1153CHBx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

This study included 25 eyes of 25 consecutive patients referred to our unit due to SMH secondary to neovascular AMD. In 13 eyes (52%), SMH was the first clinical manifestation of age-related maculopathy (with diagnostic confirmation after primary vitrectomy), while in 12 eyes (48%), it occurred during the standard course of treatment with anti-VEGF. Only two (8%) eyes showed mild vitreous haemorrhage at presentation that did not preclude the scheduled preoperative exams for proper assessment of the SMH characteristics, and, for these reasons, all patients were offered PPV with subretinal injection of rtPA.

The mean time from symptoms to surgery was 9.24 ± 3.37 days, ranging from three to 14 days (95% CI = 7.85–10.63). Antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy was suspended/replaced in time, according to the cardiologist's indications in five (20%) and six (24%) patients, respectively, before proceeding with the scheduled surgery. Combined phacoemulsification with the PPV was performed in 17 eyes (68%) of patients. Surgery was accomplished without intraoperative complications in all cases.

- **Primary outcome**: The mean ± SD preoperative SMH area at presentation was 68.34 ± 42.42 mm² and ranged from 10.49 to 170 mm² (95% CI = 51.24–85.43). Successful displacement of the SMH was obtained in 25 out of 25 eyes (100%) one month after surgery. A complete and partial displacement was obtained in 15 (60%) and 10 (40%) cases, respectively.

### Vitrectomy after intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin) for retinal detachment in retinopathy of prematurity [^111iXYE5]. Retina (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of performing vitrectomies after using bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) for the management of retinal detachments in retinopathy of prematurity.

- **Methods**: Eleven eyes of eight children with retinopathy of prematurity retinal detachment, which developed despite peripheral ablation with an indirect diode laser, were injected with 0.625 mg bevacizumab. Injections were given through the pars plicata, and the status of the central retinal artery was checked with indirect ophthalmoscopy. A vitreoretinal surgery was scheduled for one week after the bevacizumab injection. All eyes underwent surgery using 25- or 23-gauge instrumentation. Demographic data, neovascular activity, and the anatomic status of the retina were evaluated. Systemic and local perioperative complications were recorded.

- **Results**: The average gestational birth weight was 950 g, and the average gestational age at birth was 25.7 weeks. Although nine eyes had stage 4A, two had stage 4B retinal detachments. Six eyes had zone II, and five eyes had zone I disease. Bevacizumab was injected at an average postgestational age of 38 weeks. A notable reduction in the vascular activity could be observed one week later when vitrectomy was performed. With a mean follow-up of 8.5 months (range, 2–13 months), a favorable outcome could be observed in all eyes. Only one eye with persistent vitreous hemorrhage required reoperation. No complications attributable to the bevacizumab injections were noted.

- **Conclusion**: These data show that vitrectomy after intravitr

### Evaluation and management of suspected retinal detachment [^1113cD7j]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment is often a preventable cause of vision loss. There are three types of retinal detachments: exudative, tractional, and rhegmatogenous. The most common type is rhegmatogenous, which results from retinal breaks caused by vitreoretinal traction. Risk factors for retinal detachment include advancing age, previous cataract surgery, myopia, and trauma. Patients typically present with symptoms such as light flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, and blurred vision. Early intervention facilitates prevention of retinal detachment after the formation of retinal breaks and improves visual outcomes of retinal detachment surgery. Patients with an acute onset of flashes or floaters should be referred to an ophthalmologist.

### Vabysmo [^115VSCY1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments**: Intravitreal injections, including Vabysmo, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering Vabysmo. Patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay, to permit prompt and appropriate management [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

- **Increase in intraocular pressure**: Transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with Vabysmo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. IOP and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Thromboembolic events**: Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the Vabysmo clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause).

	- The incidence of reported ATEs in the nAMD studies during the first year was 1% (7 out of 664) in patients treated with Vabysmo compared with 1% (6 out of 662) in patients treated with aflibercept [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

	- The incidence of reported ATEs in the DME studies from baseline to week 100 was 5% (64 out of 1,262) in patients treated with Vabysmo compared with 5% (32 out of 625).

### Retinal detachment in association with pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome [^115edzb6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review case reports of retinal detachment in women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia.

- **Methods**: Medline was searched for case reports of retinal detachment associated with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. Articles written in English, Spanish, or Portuguese and published between 1990 and 2010 were reviewed.

- **Results**: A total of 28 cases of retinal detachment were identified: 15 were associated with severe pre-eclampsia (3 of these probably had hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets [HELLP] syndrome), 9 with HELLP syndrome, 2 with eclampsia, and 2 with both HELLP syndrome and eclampsia. The majority (60%) of women were nulliparous. Additionally, 4 had abruptio placentae, and cesarean delivery was performed in 76%. Retinal detachment was bilateral in 89% of cases and associated with delivery of the fetus in 96%; 69% were diagnosed postpartum. Within 2–12 weeks postpartum, all patients had complete recovery of vision with clinical management.

- **Conclusion**: Retinal detachment in pre-eclampsia/eclampsia might be associated with HELLP syndrome, indicating that microangiopathic hemolysis might play a role in the pathophysiology of retinal detachment. Its occurrence might not be correlated with the severity of pre-eclampsia because pre-eclampsia is a constellation of signs and symptoms (persistent vasospasms with hemolysis and hypoalbuminemia) rather than simply being hypertension.

### Delayed macular hole formation after demarcation laser photocoagulation for subclinical retinal detachment [^116SJHE8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlike large, symptomatic retinal detachments that are almost always treated by surgical repair, the standard treatment for small, subclinical retinal detachments is not as well defined. A recent review of retinal surgical practices in the UK showed that surgery was the most commonly recommended management for asymptomatic retinal detachment, followed by demarcation laser photocoagulation (DLP), and thirdly, by observation alone.

The popularity of DLP is growing as surgeons search for less invasive ways to manage certain types of retinal detachment. A recent case series demonstrated that DLP is an effective method to manage acute or chronic primary or macula-sparing rhegmatogenous retinal detachments without associated proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Another study expanded on these findings by showing that DLP is an effective alternative to scleral buckling or vitrectomy for treating asymptomatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, but not for symptomatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

However, most of these studies evaluated the effectiveness of DLP by simply looking at the progression of the retinal detachment after treatment. Other sequelae of DLP are still widely unknown. One recent report suggested that DLP for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment may promote retinal neovascularization. Macular hole formation after DLP has never been reported. We describe here three cases of DLP for subclinical retinal detachment followed by idiopathic macular hole formation within 1.5 years of treatment.

This report highlights the successful management of a large submacular haemorrhage associated with idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy in a woman in her late 50s who presented with sudden vision loss in her left eye. Multilayered haemorrhages involving the macula were confirmed through funduscopy and swept-source optical coherence tomography. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal recombinant tissue plasminogen activator injection, fluid-gas exchange with sulphur hexafluoride, and intravitreal ranibizumab, followed by prone positioning postoperatively. At one week, significant resolution of subretinal haemorrhage and improvement in exudative retinal detachment were observed. By three months, best-corrected visual acuity improved to 20/60, with consolidation of the haemorrhage and shrinkage of the pigment epithelial detachment.

### Tamponade in the surgical management of retinal detachment [^117TMqBo]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite treatment advances, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) can have poor visual outcomes even with prompt and appropriate therapy. Pars plana vitrectomy is a leading management modality for the treatment of RD. This procedure is generally accompanied by the use of internal tamponade. Various gases and silicone oils may yield beneficial outcomes. Heavy silicone oils have been approved in some European nations but are not available in the United States. Different tamponade agents have unique benefits and risks, and the choice of agent should be individualized according to the characteristics of the patient and RD, as well as perioperative and postoperative factors.
