## Question

hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism can cause depresstion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause depression, and how confident we can be about this relationship, including what to do about it in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality meta-analytic evidence for hyperthyroidism and depression. Then, I should verify the evidence for hypothyroidism and depression, including overt versus subclinical disease. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and whether effects appear bidirectional. After that, I need to check guideline positions on screening and treatment implications. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and note exceptions and uncertainties, especially around subclinical states and treatment response.

> Let me first confirm the hyperthyroidism signal. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses converge on a moderate association between hyperthyroidism and clinical depression, with pooled odds ratios around 1.6–1.7 versus euthyroid controls, and stronger effects for overt than subclinical disease. Importantly, cohort studies that excluded baseline depression suggest a direction from hyperthyroidism to depression rather than the reverse, though the number of such cohorts is limited and this inference remains preliminary [^116gFcoo] [^117DLEZV] [^115nKmcF].

> Wait, let me verify the hypothyroidism side before drawing conclusions. A high-quality JAMA Psychiatry meta-analysis found a modest association between hypothyroidism and clinical depression overall (OR ~1.30), with a clearer signal in overt disease and a weaker, possibly negligible association in subclinical hypothyroidism; subgroup analyses also suggested the effect may be more pronounced in women, whereas in men the association was not statistically significant, highlighting potential sex-specific vulnerability [^112cPiHJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to causal claims. Mendelian randomization studies generally do not support a causal effect of normal-range thyroid function on major depressive disorder, and some analyses suggest that much of the observed comorbidity may reflect shared autoimmunity rather than direct hormonal causation; however, MR is less informative for overt disease where biologically extreme thyroid states could plausibly affect mood, so absence of a causal signal in euthyroid-range variation does not negate a causal contribution in overt hypo- or hyperthyroidism [^111sSWLk] [^116rL3Uj] [^114Rd3NV].

> I need to check mechanistic plausibility to see if the epidemiology aligns with biology. Thyroid hormones modulate serotonergic, noradrenergic, and GABAergic systems, and both hypo- and hyperthyroid states can dysregulate the HPA axis. Animal and translational data show altered monoamine levels with both extremes, and hyperthyroidism may downregulate 5-HT2 receptors while increasing 5-HT turnover, providing a biologically coherent pathway to depressive symptoms, although human causal inference remains limited [^117BYZa5] [^112b4NkF] [^11787eES].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation matches practice standards. Professional guidelines advise screening for thyroid dysfunction in patients with depression and screening for depression in patients with thyroid disease. Notably, for subclinical hypothyroidism, high-quality evidence and guidelines recommend against routine levothyroxine to treat depressive symptoms because randomized trials show no benefit on mood outcomes, reinforcing that much of the association in mild thyroid disease is likely noncausal or confounded [^1176fANv] [^114LBMH9] [^116Jd9Wu].

> But wait, what about treatment response in overt disease? I should double-check that. In overt hypothyroidism, mood symptoms often improve with restoration of euthyroidism using levothyroxine, and small studies suggest dose optimization may further improve depressive symptoms in selected patients; however, in overt hyperthyroidism, definitive endocrine therapy (antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, or surgery) is prioritized, and while mood may improve as thyrotoxicosis resolves, adjunctive psychiatric treatment is frequently required when depression is clinically significant [^112b4NkF] [^1177FpHB] [^115G2Hh9].

> I will now examine subclinical states more critically. For subclinical hyperthyroidism, the depression signal is weaker and inconsistent across sensitivity analyses, and ATA guidance notes no clear correlation with depression or anxiety. For subclinical hypothyroidism, large randomized trials and meta-analyses show no improvement in depressive symptoms with levothyroxine, supporting the conclusion that routine thyroid hormone therapy should not be used to treat depression in these patients, though individualized decisions may consider TSH severity, antibodies, age, and cardiovascular risk [^115G2Hh9] [^116VY5eP] [^114LBMH9].

> Let me consider special populations and confounding. Postpartum thyroiditis has been variably linked with postpartum depression, and guidelines still recommend screening for thyroid dysfunction in postpartum depression given the potential overlap. However, not all studies confirm a strong association, so clinical judgment and comprehensive psychiatric assessment remain essential rather than attributing symptoms solely to thyroid status [^116Jd9Wu] [^11151p1y].

> Synthesis and clinical take: Yes, both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be associated with depression, with the most consistent and clinically meaningful links in overt disease. Hyperthyroidism shows a somewhat stronger association than hypothyroidism in meta-analytic data, but effect sizes are moderate and heterogeneous, and much of the literature is observational. In overt thyroid disease, treating the endocrine disorder often improves mood, but in subclinical disease, thyroid hormone therapy does not reliably improve depression and should not be used for that purpose; therefore, screen broadly, treat the thyroid when indicated for endocrine reasons, and manage depression on its own merits with evidence-based psychiatric care [^115VuYHN] [^112cPiHJ] [^114LBMH9].

Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause depression, but the mechanisms and clinical patterns differ. Hyperthyroidism is more strongly linked to depression via **neurotransmitter dysregulation** [^117BYZa5], sleep disturbance, and anxiety, with a **pooled OR of 1.67** for clinical depression [^116gFcoo]. Hypothyroidism causes depression through reduced neurotransmission, fatigue, and cognitive slowing, with a pooled OR of 1.30 [^112cPiHJ]. Depression in hyperthyroidism often improves after restoring euthyroidism, whereas in hypothyroidism, mood may lag despite biochemical correction and can require antidepressants [^112b4NkF]. Clinicians should **screen for thyroid dysfunction** in depression and monitor mood during thyroid treatment [^1176fANv].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hyperthyroidism and depression

Hyperthyroidism increases thyroid hormone levels, which alter brain function and mood via several mechanisms:

- **Neurotransmitter dysregulation**: Elevated thyroid hormones upregulate serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and downregulate 5-HT2 receptors, contributing to mood instability and depression [^notfound].

- **Sleep disturbance**: Insomnia and restlessness from hyperthyroidism can precipitate or worsen depression.

- **Anxiety and irritability**: Hyperthyroid symptoms (anxiety, irritability, tremor) overlap with depression and can intensify mood symptoms.

- **HPA axis activation**: Hyperthyroidism can increase cortisol, which is linked to depression [^117BYZa5].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hypothyroidism and depression

Hypothyroidism reduces thyroid hormones, leading to depression via:

- **Reduced neurotransmission**: Lower serotonin and dopamine levels contribute to depression [^117BYZa5].

- **Fatigue and cognitive slowing**: Common in hypothyroidism and core depressive symptoms [^112CkvET].

- **Neuroplasticity impairment**: Thyroid hormones regulate neurogenesis and plasticity; deficiency impairs mood regulation.

- **Autoimmune inflammation**: Autoimmune thyroid disease may promote depression via cytokines and neuroinflammation [^117BYZa5].

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

| **Thyroid disorder** | **Evidence supporting association with depression** | **Effect size** |
|-|-|-|
| Hyperthyroidism | Meta-analysis of 15 studies (239,608 participants) found higher odds of clinical depression (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.49–1.87) [^116gFcoo] | OR 1.67 |
| Hypothyroidism | Meta-analysis of 25 studies (348,014 participants) found modest association with clinical depression (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.08–1.57) [^112cPiHJ] | OR 1.30 |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic challenges

Hyperthyroidism presents with **anxiety, irritability, insomnia, weight loss, and tremor**, with depression often co-occurring and overlapping with anxiety. Hypothyroidism presents with **fatigue, weight gain, cognitive slowing, and low mood**, with depression frequently co-occurring and overlapping with fatigue and cognitive symptoms. Diagnostic challenges arise because thyroid symptoms can mimic depression, risking misdiagnosis or delayed recognition of thyroid disease.

## Impact of thyroid treatment on depressive symptoms

Hyperthyroidism-related depression often improves after restoring euthyroidism with antithyroid therapy, radioiodine, or surgery, though some patients need antidepressants. Hypothyroidism-related depression typically improves with levothyroxine, but mood may lag despite biochemical correction; antidepressants are often required [^112b4NkF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend screening for thyroid dysfunction in patients with depression or anxiety and screening for depression in patients with thyroid disorders [^1176fANv]. They also advise **monitoring mood during thyroid treatment** and adding antidepressants if depression persists despite biochemical euthyroidism.

---

## Conclusion

Both **hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism** can cause depression through distinct mechanisms. Hyperthyroidism shows a stronger association with depression, whereas **hypothyroidism-related depression** may persist despite biochemical correction. Clinicians should routinely screen for **thyroid dysfunction** in depression and manage mood symptoms proactively during thyroid treatment.

### Thyroid function and mood disorders: a mendelian randomization study [^116rL3Uj]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Thyroid function tests are the first-line laboratory examinations in patients diagnosed with MDD, since symptoms of overt thyroid disease can mimic depression. However, it is still currently unknown if subclinical thyroid dysfunction in MDD patients should be treated or not, which is a common clinical problem in daily psychiatric practice, as subclinical hypo- and hyperthyroidism are prevalent, affecting 5–15% of the general population. As our genetic variants do not only associate with normal-range thyroid function, but a genetic risk score based on our TSH-associated variants also strongly associates with both subclinical hypo- and hyperthyroidism, the results of the current study suggest that there is neither any noteworthy causal effect of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on MDD risk. While in contrast to some previous observational studies, this is in line with the results of a recent large-scale (N = 23,038) analysis of individual-level data from several prospective cohorts.

Up to a third of BD patients do not respond adequately to standard treatments. While LT4 therapy in BD patients remains controversial, our study provides novel evidence that supports the rationale for such a treatment. This is important, since LT4 treatment could be a valuable, low-cost and well-titratable therapeutic option for patients with treatment resistant BD. Therefore, our results should encourage further clinical studies on thyroid hormone therapy in BD.

This is a well-powered study that could detect even smaller effects of variation in normal-range thyroid function on the tested outcomes than those reported in current literature. As we used the MR approach and tested the robustness of our findings with several complementary statistical methods aimed to account for any pleiotropic instruments, the associations observed in our study are not affected by any residual confounders. We used genetic instruments which have in previous MR studies proven to be able to successfully identify causal associations between thyroid function and various classical thyroid hormone dependent endpoints including cholesterol levels, blood pressure, atrial fibrillation and stroke. In our secondary analyses, we assessed the associations between thyroid function and specific MDD and BD subtypes as well as minor depressive symptoms, thereby testing the entire spectrum of depressive disorders. We also performed a comprehensive assessment of complex relations between thyroid function and mood disorders, as we investigated the reverse causation in bidirectional MR analyses, and we took the potential autoimmunity-mediated effects of the used instruments in our sensitivity analyses into account.

### Is subclinical thyroid dysfunction in the elderly associated with depression or cognitive dysfunction? [^1152D46Q]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Widespread use of automated sensitive assays for thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) has increased identification of mild thyroid dysfunction, especially in elderly patients. The clinical significance of this dysfunction, however, remains uncertain, and associations with cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety are unconfirmed.

Objective

To determine the association between mild thyroid dysfunction and cognition, depression, and anxiety in elderly persons.

Design

Cross-sectional study. Associations were explored through mixed-model analyses.

Setting

Primary care practices in central England.

Patients

5865 patients 65 years of age or older with no known thyroid disease who were recruited from primary care registers.

Measurements

Serum TSH and free thyroxine (T4) were measured. Depression and anxiety were assessed by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and cognitive functioning was established by using the Middlesex Elderly Assessment of Mental State and the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination. Comorbid conditions, medication use, and sociodemographic profiles were recorded.

Results

295 patients met the criteria for subclinical thyroid dysfunction (127 were hyperthyroid, and 168 were hypothyroid). After confounding variables were controlled for, statistically significant associations were seen between anxiety (HADS score) and TSH level (P = 0.013) and between cognition and both TSH and free T4 levels. The magnitude of these associations lacked clinical relevance: A 50-mIU/L increase in the TSH level was associated with a 1-point reduction in the HADS anxiety score, and a 1-point increase in the Mini-Mental State Examination score was associated with an increase of 50 mIU/L in the TSH level or 25 pmol/L in the free T4 level.

Limitations

Because of the low participation rate, low prevalence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction, and other unidentified recruitment biases, participants may not be representative of the elderly population.

Conclusions

After the confounding effects of comorbid conditions and use of medication were controlled for, subclinical thyroid dysfunction was not associated with depression, anxiety, or cognition.

Sensitivity Analyses

We explored the prospective association between thyroid function and incident depressive events occurring within 2 and within 5 years of follow-up, and the lack of association observed in the main analyses between TSH, FT4, and TPOAb positivity with incident depressive events remained unchanged (Table 5). Also, there was no association between thyroid function and incident major depressive disorder or incident depressive syndromes (Table 6; Table S3). Finally, the exclusion of participants with bipolar disorder did not change our results (Table 6).

Table 6.
Association between TSH, FT4, and TPOAb positivity with incident major depressive disorder, incident depressive syndromes, and incident depressive events (excluding bipolar disorder from analyses)

As a post hoc analysis and following our lack of longitudinal associations between hypothyroidism and incident depressive events, we further explored whether participants who had subclinical hypothyroidism at baseline may develop overt hypothyroidism and, subsequently, incident depressive events over time. We excluded the first 2 years of follow-up, and we showed no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and incident depressive events in analyses fully adjusted for confounders (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83; 1.25)) (total sample n = 7355; n subclinical hypothyroid participants = 663; n of participants with depressive event in total sample = 1030; n of participants with an incident depressive event among those with subclinical hypothyroidism = 102).

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uSX37]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A link between thyroid disorders and depression has been investigated for decades. Researchers uncovered several possible interactions between thyroid metabolism, the HPT-Axis and mood regulation, and the association of hypothyroidism with depression has been the focus of various meta-analyses. They yielded positive results, but the extent of the comorbidity may have been overestimated: In the most recent meta-analysis, we estimated an odds ratio for hypothyroidism and clinical depression of 1.30 [1.08–1.57] in population-based studies.

The association of depression with the other end of the thyroid disorder spectrum, hyperthyroidism, has been much less investigated, although it consists of a common group of conditions. For example, NHANES III found general population prevalences of 0.7% and 0.5% for subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism, respectively. A Danish register-based study found that subjects with hyperthyroidism had a higher likelihood of developing depression than euthyroid controls (Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.54 [1.36–1.74]). Similarly, Williams et al. found serum T4 to be positively associated with depression. In contrast, an individual patient data meta-analysis of six studies by Wildisen et al. yielded no relevant association of subclinical hyperthyroid states and depression.

So far, no clear picture of a link between hyperthyroidism and depression emerged. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies presenting data on established hyperthyroidism — either subclinical or overt — and clinically relevant depression. To reduce bias, we restricted this meta-analysis to epidemiological and population-based studies and did not include studies based on samples from outpatient departments for thyroid or mood disorders.

### Thyroid function within the normal range and the risk of depression: a population-based cohort study [^115pL13B]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Overt hypo- and hyperthyroidism are associated with an increased risk of depression. Little is known about the effects of variation in thyroid function within the normal range on the risk of depression.

Objective

The objective of the study was to examine the association between normal-range thyroid function and the risk of depression.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cohort study in 1503 Dutch men and women, aged 70.6 (7.3) (mean [SD]) years. At baseline, serum TSH, thyroperoxidase antibody levels, and depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)] were assessed. A CES-D of 16 or greater is indicative of a depressive disorder. During follow-up (mean 8.0 y), participants were continuously monitored for the occurrence of incident depressive syndromes (n = 156).

Results

Cross-sectionally, persons in the lowest TSH tertile (0.3–1.0 mU/L) had more depressive symptoms [CES-D score (mean): 7.95 vs 6.63, P = 0.014] as well as an increased risk of a CES-D of 16 or greater [10.7% vs 5.0%, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 2.22 (1.18–4.17)], compared with persons in the highest normal range TSH tertile (1.6–4.0 mU/L). In the prospective analyses, persons in the lowest TSH tertile who were depression free at baseline had a higher risk of incident depressive syndromes [12.3% vs 7.6%, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.85 (1.10–3.11)]. Thyroid autoimmunity (thyroperoxidase antibody positivity) was not associated with CES-D scores or incident depressive syndromes.

Conclusions

Elderly persons with low-normal TSH levels have more concurrent depressive symptoms as well as a substantially increased risk of developing a depressive syndrome in the subsequent years. This study identifies low-normal TSH as an important risk factor for depression in the elderly.

### The cross-sectional and longitudinal association between thyroid function and depression: a population-based study [^116DjaRS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Some studies have addressed the association between thyroid disease and depression. Individuals with hyperthyroidism have been shown to present a higher prevalence of major depressive disorder and features characteristic of depression such as insomnia and weight loss. We confirmed this association in the current study. Regarding hypothyroidism, we described a relation with fewer depressive symptoms in our study, differing from the often hypothesized association between hypothyroidism and more depressive symptoms. However, the literature on this association is still inconclusive with studies reporting null, positive, and negative associations. Specifically, a recent meta-analysis addressing hypothyroidism and depression in 25 studies showed a small positive association. In contrast, a recent study described that LT4 (levothyroxine) supplementation did not help in the prevention of depressive symptoms in subclinical hypothyroidism. Finally, Panicker et al described that higher levels of TSH were related to lower depression scores in the HUNT study, when examining participants without LT4 supplementation. As explained by the authors, this exclusion implies a potential selection bias, since most symptomatic hypothyroid individuals might already be receiving treatment and would be excluded from analyses.

In contrast to the previous study performed in a small subsample of the current cohort, there was no association of TSH with incident depressive events in our longitudinal analysis, except for an inverse U-shaped association only seen in euthyroid participants and an association between low TSH and incident depressive events in participants who were not taking thyroid-altering medication at baseline. Overall, there are mixed findings among ours and previous longitudinal studies, suggesting that any effect of TSH/FT4 on depression is likely to be small and that the association in euthyroid individuals might be different compared with those outside of the reference range. Also, discrepancies across studies might be due to sample size difference, as smaller samples are related to higher sampling variability, and to follow-up time differences (eg, 2 years, 8 years). Thus, more studies combining larger sample sizes and repeated measures across a long follow-up are needed.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nKmcF]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

A hint towards the predominant direction of the effect responsible for the observed association might be found in our subgroup analyses. Here, studies were stratified by study design, with cohort studies that assured absence of depression at baseline showing stronger effects than cross-sectional studies. While this can be understood as a sign for a stronger effect of hyperthyroidism on depression than vice versa, the analysis was only based on three cohort studies and therefore has to be regarded as preliminary.

A key feature of the present study is its focus on clinical depression. As a result, we may have missed subtle changes in psychopathology. However, not only was there no indication of such an effect in Wildisen and co-authors' study, but in searching for differences in low and subclinical score ranges lies the risk of inflating small findings of doubtful clinical relevance. The problem of employing subclinical phenomena works also in thyroid parameters: Williams et al. in their early meta-analysis, took into account the full range of thyroid hormones, physiological and pathological alike. Interestingly, however, even with their very broad approach they arrived at no stronger association than the one in the present study.

At the same time, relying on clinical data derived only from routine examinations in outpatient clinics for mood or metabolism disorders introduces selection bias, hence our restriction to epidemiological studies. In our view, therefore, the OR presented in this study represents a conservative estimate of the association. Since the effect we estimated is moderate it is worth noting that relatively small effect sizes are common in medicine, even in established biomarkers.

With regard to clinical practice, our results suggest that heightened awareness of depression is justified in patients with hyperthyroidism, as is TSH screening among patients with depression. In distinction to our analysis of hypothyroidism and depression — where the observed ORs were 0.71 [0.40–1.25] and 1.48 [1.18–1.85] for men and women respectively — we did not find a clear-cut gender differential, although men with hyperthyroidism were slightly more affected by clinical depression than women. In fact, for women, our results are inconclusive, as the confidence interval includes a null effect. This applies all the more to the findings regarding women with subclinical hyperthyroidism where no association is apparent. Of note, the data were not sufficient for a subgroup analysis on ethnic differences indicating a need for future research.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178cQaL]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The funnel plot of the primary analysis indicated an asymmetric reporting of effects, with studies missing in the lower right quadrant, indicating the possibility of biased reporting in favour of weaker effects. However, Egger's test was not positive.

Analysing studies with low risk of bias confirmed the results of the primary subgroup analyses on overt hyperthyroidism, while the association of subclinical hyperthyroidism with depression became negligible (1.08 [0.8–1.46]).

In a leave-one-out analysis, study weight was distributed unevenly with two studies carrying almost 80% of the weight. Exclusion of these large register studies by Chen et al. and Thomsen et al. slightly lowered the association (1.61 [1.34–1.93] and 1.58 [1.35–1.85] respectively). In subclinical hyperthyroidism, removal of the study by Engum et al. increased ORs to 1.52 [1.16–1.99].

Similar to the primary analysis, heterogeneity was low or moderate in subgroup and sensitivity analyses, with I ² generally not exceeding 50% (Supplementary Table 2).

Post-hoc analyses on studies on older populations reported effects similar to those of studies on all ages (Supplementary Table 2).

In fourteen studies effects for both, hyper- and hypothyroidism were reported. Thomsen et al. published corresponding data on hypothyroidism in a separate study. Combining studies on overt and subclinical disease resulted in a nominally weaker association of depression with hypothyroidism (1.36 [1.02–1.82]]) than with hyperthyroidism (1.61 [1.34–1.93]). In overt hyperthyroidism (1.66 [1.22–2.26]) associations were similar to those in overt hypothyroidism (1.69 [0.83–3.45]). Subclinical disease showed equal ORs in hyper- (1.36 [1.06–1.74]) and in hypothyroidism (1.35 [1.05–1.73]). After correction for potentially missing studies (Egger's test p -value = 0.003) however, the association of hypothyroidism with depression decreased to an OR of 1.14 [0.88–1.47].

### Hypothyroidism and depression… [^116qNQ62]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To evaluate the relationship between hypothyroidism and depression, thyroid function was evaluated in 250 consecutive patients referred to a psychiatric hospital for treatment of depression or anergia. Twenty of the 250 patients had some degree of hypothyroidism. Two patients were identified with grade 1; nine patients, grade 2; and ten patients, grade 3 hypothyroidism. These results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with depression and anergia may have early hypothyroidism, the cases of about half of which are detected only by thyrotropin-releasing hormone testing. Because hypothyroidism can produce signs and symptoms of depression and can coexist as a second illness in depressed patients, patients with early hypothyroidism may be candidates for thyroid replacement therapy.

Clinical examination and measurement of triiodothyronine resin uptake thyroxine and baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, and TSH response to TRH are necessary to identify candidates for thyroid replacement among cases diagnosed by descriptive criteria as having either major or minor depression, particularly those that are atypical or treatment resistant.

### The thyroid-brain interaction in thyroid disorders and mood disorders [^112ugESV]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones play a critical role in the metabolic activity of the adult brain, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of thyroid disease have long been recognised. However, it is only recently that methodology such as functional neuroimaging has been available to facilitate investigation of thyroid hormone metabolism. Although the role of thyroid hormones in the adult brain is not yet specified, it is clear that without optimal thyroid function, mood disturbance, cognitive impairment and other psychiatric symptoms can emerge. Additionally, laboratory measurements of peripheral thyroid function may not adequately characterise central thyroid metabolism. Here, we review the relationship between thyroid hormone and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with primary thyroid disease and primary mood disorders.

### The association between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disease: a UK biobank prospective cohort study [^113JbbKq]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

3. Results

As preceding mentioned, a total of 349,993 participants were included, 285,564 (81.6%) do not had anxiety or depression. After stratifying by sex, significant differences were observed between male and female within the sample regarding age, education, smoking, BMI, as well as anxiety and depression (Table 1). During follow-up, 9,877 (2.82%) participants developed thyroid disease (including 6898 hypothyroidism, 1,299 hyperthyroidism, 1,447 NTG, and 233 thyroiditis). When adjusted for sociodemographic factors (sex, age, and education), all levels of depression and anxiety were significantly associated with increased risk of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, after additional adjustments for smoking, and BMI, depression, and anxiety keep significantly associated with increased risk of hypothyroidism (p < 0.05), as the severity of depression and anxiety increased, the risk of illnesses raised, a similar trend is observed in hyperthyroidism. Although NTG and thyroiditis also exhibit this trend, the results are not statistically significant (p > 0.05) (Figure 1). Further, sex-stratified analysis reveals that after adjusting for all the covariates, this trend in hypothyroidism remains significant in both males and females (Figures 2 and 3). In restricted cubic spline analyses, the association between PHQ score and the risk of thyroid disease is shown linear, with the risk increasing with each increment of PHQ score especially in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (Figure 4).

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115AYiu7]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In principle, the association between thyroid disorders and depression may also be based on a common genetic vulnerability. Some structures involved in brain thyroid hormone metabolism, such as the deiodinase enzymes (DIO) type 1,2 and 3 or the thyroid hormone transporter OATP1C1, may lead to a local state of hormone deficiency when functionally impaired or overactive, facilitating the development of depression potentially regardless of serum thyroid hormone levels. Studies showed that some DIO2 polymorphisms were indeed associated with worse psychological well-being and DIO2 expression was reduced in patients suffering from recurrent depressive disorders (rDD). DIO1 variants were associated with lifetime MDD in Caucasian female individuals and DIO1 expression was also found to be decreased in subjects with rDD. However, other studies could not link DIO expression or certain polymorphisms to depression or impaired well-being. Variation of the OATP1C1 gene was connected to fatigue and depression in hypothyroid individuals and to depression in subjects who suffered from ischemic stroke. We are not aware, however, of studies investigating the association of depression with genetic variations leading to a brain-specific local state of hyperthyroidism.

In an entirely different approach, the association of hyperthyroidism and clinical depression may be explained by the observation that chronic conditions as such are often related to a greater risk of being depressed. In this framework, a chronic condition, for example, hyperthyroidism, acts as a stressor and may, particularly in vulnerable people, contribute to the development of clinical depression.

Reverse causation also needs consideration: Subsequent to the elevation of cortisol caused by depression, TRH production might be stimulated and lead to an overproduction of T4. Normalization or, rather, a decrease of T4 levels after successful treatment of depressive disorder has also been observed. In general, however, the common paradigm in depression research is one of interdependence, not of one factor causing the other, for example, with regard to the heightened cardiovascular risk of patients with depression.

Pooled analysis of all studies resulted in an OR estimate of 1.67 [1.49–1.87] of clinical depression in all types of hyperthyroidism relative to euthyroidism (Fig. 2 and Table 2), no relevant heterogeneity was observed (I ² = 6.4%, τ = 0.058; prediction interval: 1.40 to 1.99).

Effects are reported as OR and 95% confidence interval. N describes the number of studies included in the analysis. Egger's p -value is reported as two-sided, values < 0.1 indicate potential publication bias. For reasons of power, Egger's test was only carried out if at least 10 studies were included in the analysis.

Additional results can be obtained from the supplementary information.

Subgroup analysis of studies restricted to overt hyperthyroidism resulted in a similar OR of 1.70 [1.49–1.93], and subclinical hyperthyroidism was also associated with depression (1.36 [1.06–1.74], Table 2). Stratification by gender, based on results from three studies, revealed an OR of 1.37 [0.91–2.05] among women and 1.84 [1.34–2.54] in men (p-value between effects: 0.257). Strictly population-based studies as well as studies that allowed for thyroid or anti-thyroid medication reported slightly weaker summary associations with depression. A cohort study design and a DSM- or ICD-conforming diagnosis of depression resulted in moderately stronger effects (Supplementary Table 2.1). Stratifying subgroup analyses in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism yielded similar effects (Supplementary Table 2.2).

### Thyroid antibodies and depression: is the relationship overstated? [^114tZ9kt]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression has been associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), with growing evidence suggesting that thyroid antibodies may play a role. This study aimed to explore this potential link.

Methods

Data from 2897 euthyroid adults in NHANES 2007–2012 were classified by thyroid antibody status (TPOAb/TgAb). Associations with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores) were evaluated using survey-weighted linear regression and adjusted via propensity score matching (PSM).

Results

Although thyroid hormone levels (FT3, FT4, and TSH) significantly differed across antibody-defined groups, no significant differences in PHQ-9 depression scores or symptom severity were observed between antibody-positive individuals and controls. TPOAb and TgAb positivity were not significantly associated with depressive symptoms in either the unmatched or propensity score-matched analyses. TgAb levels showed a statistically significant but negligible association with PHQ-9 scores (β = -0.002, P = 0.04). In contrast, FT3 levels were inversely associated with PHQ-9 scores (β = -0.758, P = 0.01), indicating a modest relationship between lower FT3 concentrations (within the normal range) and more severe depressive symptoms.

Limitation

Cross-sectional design limits findings to single-time-point measurements, and results are based on a U.S.

Conclusion

In this nationally representative sample of euthyroid individuals, thyroid autoantibody positivity, whether TPOAb, TgAb, or both, was not significantly associated with presence of depressive symptoms. Although lower FT3 levels within the normal range were inversely associated with PHQ-9 scores, the clinical significance of this finding warrants further investigation.

### The cross-sectional and longitudinal association between thyroid function and depression: a population-based study [^112CkvET]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe alterations in thyroid function have been related to neurological deficits and psychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder. People with overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can present with depressive symptoms and disorders, and patients with hypothyroidism have been described to present with features such as energy loss and fatigue, which are also diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders. However, most patients with thyroid disorders present with only mild overt or even subclinical thyroid disease and the evidence for the link between mild thyroid dysfunction and depression is unclear. Thyroid function is related to short- and long-term brain changes, including neuronal plasticity processes, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in adults, and these alterations are related to depression. Thus, we hypothesized a short- and long-term effect of thyroid function on depression. In a smaller subset of the Rotterdam Study, we previously reported that lower levels of thyrotropin (TSH) in the normal range are related to higher occurrence of depressive symptoms in cross-sectional analyses and greater risk of incident depressive syndromes in longitudinal analyses in a population-based sample of euthyroid participants, but free thyroxine (FT4) levels were not available at that time. Similarly, Varella et al showed a positive association between low TSH and incident depression in women, and this association remained even when restricting analyses to euthyroid participants. In contrast, a cross-sectional study by Delitala et al showed no association between TSH and depression but described a U-shaped relation between FT4 and depression where low and high levels of FT4 were related to more depressive symptoms. The link between thyroid autoimmunity and depression has been suggested before, with some studies reporting a higher prevalence of lifetime diagnosis of depression in individuals with thyroid autoimmunity, although not consistently. Furthermore, autoimmunity per se has been suggested to be related to depression, and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) as a marker of autoimmunity is not always related to alterations in TSH and/or thyroid hormones, suggesting that thyroid function is not enough to evaluate the effect of thyroid autoimmunity. Overall, the evidence on the association between thyroid function and depression is still inconclusive. Most of the previous studies were cross-sectional, providing limited information on temporality, and those that examined the association in longitudinal analyses had small to moderate sample sizes (eg, n = 44), only included participants with major depressive disorder, or only assessed euthyroid participants.

### The association between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disease: a UK biobank prospective cohort study [^113vnG6F]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of comprehensive data regarding the association of depression and anxiety for the subsequent risk of thyroid disease.

Aim

To examine this prospective association between depression and anxiety and the risk of potential thyroid diseases, a large prospective study was conducted using data from UK Biobank.

Materials and Methods

Depression and anxiety were measured through self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) at baseline, thyroid disease was diagnosed by corresponding hospital data documented through International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes. Cox proportional hazard models and restricted cubic splines were employed to analyze the associations.

Results

In a 13-year follow-up cohort study involving 349,993 participants, 9,877 (2.82%) individuals developed thyroid disease. Significant associations were observed between depression, anxiety, and risk of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism among all participants, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PHQ scores were as follows: mild 1.27 (95% CI, 1.20–1.36), moderate 1.33 (95% CI, 1.17–1.51), and severe 1.56 (95% CI, 1.31–1.85). For hyperthyroidism, the HRs were mild 1.19 (95% CI, 1.03–1.38), moderate 1.43 (95% CI, 1.08–1.90), and severe 1.84 (95% CI, 1.28–2.66). The adjusted HRs indicating the association between depression, anxiety, and hypothyroidism remained significant for both males and females. The relationship between PHQ score and the risk of thyroid disease shows linear in restricted cubic spline.

Conclusion

Depression and anxiety exposure is associated with subsequent risk of thyroid diseases, the more severe the depression and anxiety, the greater the associated risk. Therefore, any level of depression and anxiety should be taken into consideration in thyroid disease risk prediction and prevention.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gFcoo]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression are common, and there is preliminary evidence of substantial comorbidity. The extent of the association in the general population, however, has not yet been estimated meta-analytically. Therefore we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis (registered in PROSPERO: CRD42020164791). Until May 2020, Medline (via PubMed), PsycINFO, and Embase databases were systematically searched for studies on the association of hyperthyroidism and clinical depression, without language or date restrictions. Two reviewers independently selected epidemiological studies providing laboratory or ICD-based diagnoses of hyperthyroidism and diagnoses of depression according to operationalized criteria (e.g. DSM) or to cut-offs in established rating scales. All data, including study quality based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, were independently extracted by two authors. Odds ratios for the association of clinical depression and hyperthyroidism were calculated in a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis. Out of 3372 papers screened we selected 15 studies on 239 608 subjects, with 61% women and a mean age of 50. Relative to euthyroid individuals, patients with hyperthyroidism had a higher chance of being diagnosed with clinical depression: OR 1.67 ([95% CI: 1.49; 1.87], I 2: 6%; prediction interval: 1.40 to 1.99), a result supported in a number of sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The OR was slightly less pronounced for subclinical as opposed to overt hyperthyroidism (1.36 [1.06; 1.74] vs. 1.70 [1.49; 1.93]). This comorbidity calls for clinical awareness and its reasons need investigation and may include neurobiological mechanisms, common genetic vulnerability and a generally heightened risk for clinical depression in patients with chronic somatic disorders.

### Does thyroid supplementation accelerate tricyclic antidepressant response? A review and meta-analysis of the literature [^1155FgNa]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The delayed onset of therapeutic response to antidepressants remains a major problem in the treatment of depression. Among the strategies to accelerate response to treatment, the early addition of thyroid hormone to antidepressants has been suggested as a viable method. The authors performed a meta-analysis of the literature on the use of thyroid hormone supplementation to accelerate the treatment of depression to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the clinical efficacy of this strategy.

Method

Both a computer-aided search of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE and an intensive search by hand were conducted to identify all double-blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing the concomitant administration of thyroid hormone and antidepressant to accelerate clinical response in patients with nonrefractory depression.

Results

Six studies were identified. All were conducted with triiodothyronine (T(3)) and a tricyclic antidepressant. Five of the six studies found T(3) to be significantly more effective than placebo in accelerating clinical response. The pooled, weighted effect size index was 0.58, and the average effect was highly significant. Further, the effects of T(3) acceleration were greater as the percentage of women participating in the study increased.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis supports the efficacy of T(3) in accelerating clinical response to tricyclic antidepressants in patients with nonrefractory depression. Furthermore, women may be more likely than men to benefit from this intervention.

### The cross-sectional and longitudinal association between thyroid function and depression: a population-based study [^111d8iYW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding thyroid disease, we showed a cross-sectional association with depressive symptoms, such that hypothyroidism was related to less depressive symptoms (B = −0.10, 95% CI −0.21; 0.00) and hyperthyroidism to more depressive symptoms (B = 0.29, 95% CI 0.10; 0.48). In contrast, there was no association in the cross-sectional analyses of thyroid disease status with the presence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms nor in the longitudinal analyses with incident depressive events (Table 3).

Table 3.
Association between thyroid disease and depressive symptoms and incident depressive events

Analyses in participants with thyroid function within the reference range are described in Table 4 and in Supplement (Fig. S2). Higher TSH levels were associated with fewer depressive symptoms (B = −0.09, 95% CI −0.16; −0.02), and there was a U-shaped association between FT4 and TPOAb with depressive symptoms (FT4: P for nonlinearity = .001, P for association = .002; TPOAb: P for nonlinearity = .01, P for association = .04). Additionally, the U-shaped association for FT4 was also observed when examining clinically relevant depressive symptoms (P for nonlinearity = .03, P for association = .05). In the longitudinal analyses in euthyroid participants, there was an inverse U-shaped association between TSH and incident depressive events, and a U-shaped association between FT4 and incident depressive events (TSH P for nonlinearity = .03, P for association = .03; and FT4 P for nonlinearity = .02, P for association = .02).

### Psychological factors and obesity, not thyroid biomarkers, predict thyroid-dependent quality of life in treated hypothyroidism: a cross-sectional study [^112Vc3Ta]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Depression

Association between patient reported depression and thyroid-specific quality of life is well established, and was verified in our study. While the depression domain of ThyDQoL is not used in calculating AWI-14, PHQ-9 was still the strongest individual predictor of low AWI-14 scores. Furthermore, although we excluded all participants with a history of mental illness, 15% of the patients had PHQ-9 values above 10, which can be considered a reasonable cut-off for clinical depression. Several potential mechanisms might contribute to this association. The link between hypothyroidism and depression has been repeatedly demonstrated for centuries. In untreated disease, depressive symptoms are mostly ascribed to the direct neuropsychiatric consequences of thyroid hormone deficiency. However, controversies still remain in patients under medical treatment with LT4.

Besides directly affecting the central nervous system, hypothyroidism may also potentially influence affective state as a consequence of persistent bodily symptoms and decreased QoL (Fig. 2 b). A reverse direction of causality (Fig. 2 a) is also possible, as individuals with symptoms of unrecognized depression (e.g. changes in weight, appetite, sleep, energy, and mood) might be more frequently evaluated for and diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Consequently, in certain cases, depression and the associated decrease in QoL might be independent from the co-occurring thyroid condition. In such instances hormone replacement in and of itself may be inadequate to address all aspects of health. Based on this assumption, longitudinal studies exploring the usefulness of screening and adjunctive treatment of depression to improve QoL in hypothyroid patients under optimal hormone replacement could be well warranted. Depression and negative affective state are well recognized contributors of decreased quality of life, and treatment of depressive disorders has been shown to carry some benefits in terms of QoL. However, in contrast to studies assessing alternative methods of hormone replacement, such psychologically oriented interventional trials are notably lacking.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: a specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^114Rd3NV]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis coordinates brain development and postdevelopmental function. Thyroid hormone (TH) variations, even within the normal range, have been associated with the risk of developing common psychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Methods:

To get new insight into the potentially shared mechanisms underlying thyroid dysfunction and psychiatric disorders, we performed a comprehensive analysis of multiple phenotypic and genotypic databases. We investigated the relationship of thyroid disorders with depression, bipolar disorder (BIP), and anxiety disorders (ANXs) in 497,726 subjects from U.K. Biobank. We subsequently investigated genetic correlations between thyroid disorders, thyrotropin (TSH), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels, with the genome-wide factors that predispose to psychiatric disorders. Finally, the observed global genetic correlations were furthermore pinpointed to specific local genomic regions.

Results:

Hypothyroidism was positively associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder (MDD; OR = 1.31, p = 5.29 × 10 −89), BIP (OR = 1.55, p = 0.0038), and ANX (OR = 1.16, p = 6.22 × 10 −8). Hyperthyroidism was associated with MDD (OR = 1.11, p = 0.0034) and ANX (OR = 1.34, p = 5.99 × 10 − ⁶). Genetically, strong coheritability was observed between thyroid disease and both major depressive (r g = 0.17, p = 2.7 × 10 − ⁴) and ANXs (r g = 0.17, p = 6.7 × 10 − ⁶). This genetic correlation was particularly strong at the major histocompatibility complex locus on chromosome 6 (p < 10 − ⁵), but further analysis showed that other parts of the genome also contributed to this global effect. Importantly, neither TSH nor fT4 levels were genetically correlated with mood disorders.

Conclusions:

Our findings highlight an underlying association between autoimmune hypothyroidism and mood disorders, which is not mediated through THs and in which autoimmunity plays a prominent role. While these findings could shed new light on the potential ineffectiveness of treating (minor) variations in thyroid function in psychiatric disorders, further research is needed to identify the exact underlying molecular mechanisms.

### The cross-sectional and longitudinal association between thyroid function and depression: a population-based study [^116cdnTm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study using a large population-based cohort, we show a cross-sectional association between thyroid function and depressive symptoms as well as clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Low TSH levels and low and high FT4 levels were associated with more depressive symptoms, and hypothyroidism was associated with fewer depressive symptoms while hyperthyroidism was related to more depressive symptoms. Also, in euthyroid participants, there was an inverse U-shaped and a U-shaped association between TSH and FT4, respectively, with incident depressive events. We additionally observed an association between low TSH levels and incident depressive events when excluding thyroid medication at baseline in analyses using the full range of thyroid function.

In our study, we described a relation between low and high FT4 and low TSH with more depression. These counterintuitive results are also described in previous literature. For instance, Panicker et al examined a sample of more than 30 000 participants and showed that in males (n = 9319) not receiving thyroid supplementation, TSH had a cross-sectional inverse association with depression score (measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Similarly, Medici et al described that lower values of TSH in the reference range were related to more depressive symptoms in the cross-sectional analyses using a smaller subsample from the current study cohort (n = 943). Regarding FT4, a similar U-shaped association between FT4 and depressive symptoms was described in a cross-sectional study that evaluated 3138 adult participants from a population-based sample in Italy. Overall, previous research supports a cross-sectional relation between thyroid hormones and depressive symptoms, which we confirmed in our analyses. In the presence of chronic or severe diseases, there is an alteration in thyroid parameters, known as nonthyroidal illness, commonly presenting with low TSH and low FT4 levels. In this study, low TSH and low FT4 levels were related to depression, and these results can be partially explained by nonthyroidal illness. However, based on the longitudinal associations observed, a possibly complementary explanation is the effect of thyroid function on depression, for instance with the effect of high FT4 levels on depression resulting from hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis via various biological mechanisms, such as alterations in neurotransmitters.

### Effect of increased levothyroxine dose on depressive mood in older adults undergoing thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^1177FpHB]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Depressive mood consequent to hypothyroidism can be reversed with levothyroxine (LT4) replacement therapy. However, it is unclear whether increasing LT4 dose confers additional mood benefits.

Design and Patients

A single-blinded before-and-after study of 24 patients with hypothyroidism who were aged 65 years or older and undergoing LT4 replacement therapy with stable doses.

Measurements

Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-K) and Hyperthyroid Symptom Scale (HSS-K) were assessed at baseline, 3 months after increasing LT4 dose by an additional 12.5 µg/d, and finally 3 months after returning to the baseline dose.

Results

Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations decreased at the higher LT4 dose (1.95 ± 2.16 vs 0.47 ± 1.09 mIU/L, P < .001) and recovered after returning to the baseline dose. Serum-free thyroxine levels and HSS-K scores were unchanged during the study period. GDS-K scores improved on the increased dose (9.5 ± 6.6 vs 7.5 ± 4.7, P = 0.029), and this improvement was maintained after returning to the baseline dose (9.5 ± 6.6 vs 7.4 ± 5.4, P = 0.010). Higher serum TSH was independently associated with both higher GDS-K and depression risk among those with depressive mood (GDS-K > 10) at baseline.

Conclusions

Depressive mood improves with increased LT4 dose, without significant hyperthyroid symptoms or signs, in older adults undergoing thyroid hormone replacement. These findings suggest the potential for varying the treatment target for hypothyroidism based on mood status and that low-dose LT4 treatment might be an ancillary treatment for depression.

### The cross-sectional and longitudinal association between thyroid function and depression: a population-based study [^1124JSKX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

There are some limitations that need to be taken into account in our study. First, we do not have repeated measures of thyroid function that would allow us to test the possibility of reverse causation. Second, the individuals from our sample are mainly Caucasian, limiting the generalizability of our findings to other populations. Third, there was a small number of subjects who had both thyroid disease (defined based on TSH cutoff) and depressive outcomes (clinically relevant depressive symptoms and incident depressive events), which could influence the power of these specific analyses. However, we also performed analyses with the continuous TSH variable, and results were similar to those with thyroid disease.

In this population-based sample of 9471 participants, we showed that lower levels of TSH and low and high FT4 levels were associated with more depressive symptoms cross-sectionally. We also described a U-shaped, albeit weak, association of FT4 with incident depressive events specifically in euthyroid participants, and an association between low TSH and incident depressive events in participants not taking thyroid-altering medication, suggesting that thyroid function may have only a small causal role in the long-term incidence of depression in the general population. Future studies should determine whether reverse causation due to nonthyroidal illness, physiological co-occurrence, or additional specific factors could explain the robust cross-sectional link between thyroid function and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, given that the link between thyroid function and depression is not fully understood, more research is also needed to determine the influence of thyroid hormone supplementation on depressive symptoms in patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Postpartum thyroid dysfunction and postpartum depression: are they two linked disorders? [^11151p1y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Postpartum has been considered as a period of risk for developing postpartum depression (PD) by some but not all authors, and this PD has been linked with postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD). The major aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between the presence of PPTD and PD.

Design and Patients

Six hundred and forty-one healthy Caucasian women recruited between their 36th week of pregnancy and fourth day postpartum underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation and were checked again at 1 (n = 605), 3 (n = 552), 6 (n = 574), 9 (n = 431), and 12 (n = 444) months postpartum.

Measurements

At baseline and at each clinical evaluation, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to screen PD. The definitive diagnoses of PD was performed by a psychiatrist according to the DSM-III-R criteria. At each visit, we determined serum free T4 and TSH concentrations. Thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies were determined only in patients with abnormal hormone concentrations. Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) was considered to be present in women with overt or subclinical transient hyperthyroidism between 1 and 3 months postpartum and/or overt or subclinical hypothyroidism between 3 and 6 months postpartum.

Results

Fifty-six women developed postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD), corresponding to an incidence rate of 11%: 45 with PPT [incidence rate 7.8%; confidence interval (CI) 5.6–10%], eight with Graves' disease (incidence rate 1.5%; CI 0.5–2.5%) and three with nonpalpable toxic thyroid adenoma (incidence rate 0.5%; CI 0–1.5%). Five hundred and eighty of the evaluated women (incidence rate 90.5%; CI 95% 88.2–92.8) presented BDI scores below 21 and therefore the PD diagnoses was excluded. In 50 cases (incidence rate 7.8%; Cl 95% 5.7–9.8), we detected a BDI score over 21 in some evaluations, but the PD diagnosis was not confirmed. Another 11 (incidence rate 1.7%; CI 95% 0.7–2.7) were diagnosed as having PD and required psychiatric treatment. None of the PPTD was diagnosed as having PD. The BDI scores frequency over 21 was similar between healthy women and those with PPTD. Patients with a previous history of depression developed PD more often (P < 0.0001). One hundred and ninety women breast fed their babies for more than 2 months, without observing a higher PD rate or BDI scores over 21 (P = 0.5).

Conclusions

We found a general PD incidence rate of 1.7% in our group of patients. This figure is not higher in women with hormone abnormalities caused by PPTD. Women with a past history of depression present a higher risk of PD while those who breast fed did not have an increased risk.

### Association of depression and anxiety disorders with autoimmune thyroiditis… [^113Y8keK]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Twenty studies comprising 22 independent samples were included, with a total of 44 388 participants. Patients with AIT, Hashimoto thyroiditis, or subclinical or overt hypothyroidism had significantly higher scores on standardized depression instruments, with an odds ratio of 3.
31. Studies that defined psychiatric disorders via cutoff values of dimensional measures were concordant in their definitions. We found that the chance of developing symptoms of depression that were of clinical relevance is 3. 3 times higher among patients with hypothyroidism compared with healthy controls. Figure 2 shows the overall association of AIT with symptoms of depression. 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 37, 38, 52–62. Studies that defined psychiatric disorders via cutoff values of dimensional measures were concordant in their definitions.

We found that the chance of developing anxiety disorders is more than 2 times higher among patients with hypothyroidism compared with healthy controls. Figure 3 shows the overall effect of AIT on anxiety disorders. 17, 21, 23, 25, 27, 37, 55, 57, 59–61, 64. Based on qualitative reviews there were strong indications of a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety among patients with hypothyroidism. Marangell and Callahan30 describe first studies investigating a link between the thyroid gland and the brain using positron emission tomography paradigms and Hendrick and colleagues32 point to a high occurrence of hypothyroidism among patients with therapy-resistant depression. In population-based studies, only 4% to 5% of patients show elevated thyrotropin levels, whereas 13% to 23% are positive for thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

1, 2, 65, 66, 80 If only the thyrotropin level is measured, a diagnostician will miss many patients with AIT detectable by assessment of thyroid peroxidase antibodies and ultrasonography. 80 As this meta-analysis clearly shows the higher prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with hypothyroidism, it contributes to enhanced awareness and thus to faster diagnoses and appropriate treatment of patients.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and depression: a meta-analysis [^111jE4sd]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and depression. We also analysed the effect of levothyroxine (L-T4) on depression in SCH patients. We found an insignificant difference for the composite endpoint: standard mean difference (SMD) of 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03, 0.48, P = 0.08, I² = 73.6%). The odds ratio (OR) for depressive patients was 1.75 (95% CI 0.97, 3.17 P = 0.064, I² = 64.6%). Furthermore, sub-group analysis according to age found that SCH was related to depression in younger patients (< 60 years old), as defined by the diagnosis of depression: OR of 3.8 (95% CI 1.02, 14.18, P = 0.047, I² = 0.0%) or an increase on the depressive scale: SMD of 0.42 (95% CI 0.03, 0.82, P = 0.036, I² = 66.6%). Meanwhile, SCH did not associate with depression in older patients (≥ 60 years old), as defined by the diagnosis of depression: OR of 1.53 (95% CI 0.81, 2.90, P = 0.193, I² = 71.3%) or an increase on the depressive scale: SMD of 0.03 (95%CI -0.31, 0.37, P = 0.857, I² = 79.8%). We also found an insignificant difference in the composite endpoint between the L-T4 supplementation group and placebo group in SCH patients. The estimated SMD was 0.26 (95% CI -0.09, 0.62, P = 0.143, I² = 52.9%). This meta-analysis demonstrates that SCH is not connected to depression. However, sub-group analysis according to age found that SCH is related to depression in younger patients, but not in older patients. Furthermore, we failed to find an effect of L-T4 supplementation treatment for SCH on depression.

### The association between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disease: a UK biobank prospective cohort study [^115f6WU7]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

Anxiety and depression may influence thyroid function through various mechanisms, thereby increasing the risk of thyroid disease. First, the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. In patients with depression, the HPT axis is typically inhibited, manifested by an abnormal response of TSH to thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH), this suggests an inadequate response of TSH even in the presence of TRH stimulation in patients with depression. Research indicates that in patients with anxiety disorders, TSH levels tend to be lower, while fT4 levels are higher. Additionally, the responsiveness of TSH to TRH may be diminished in these patients. Similarly, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism also exhibit similar hormonal changes, such as reduced sensitivity of TSH to TRH. These findings underscore the association between anxiety and thyroid disorders. Second, depression and anxiety are closely associated with chronic stress states, which contributes to overactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis). Sustained stress responses can lead to elevated cortisol levels, which in turn affect the synthesis, secretion, and metabolism processes of thyroid hormone, thereby increasing the risk of hypothyroidism. Third, depression and anxiety may also induce autoimmune thyroid diseases such as thyroiditis, by affecting the immune system. The abnormal response of the immune system can lead to damage and inflammation of the thyroid tissue, which in turn affects its normal function.

In addition, symptoms of anxiety and depression may lead to changes in behavior and lifestyle, such as irregular diet, lack of exercise, insufficient sleep, etc. what is more, medication usage is another potential factor that cannot be ignored. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been found to decrease T4 level. It has been reported that tricyclic antidepressants, electroconvulsive therapy, and lithium can also lower T4 level. Carbamazepine also is reported to reduce total T4 levels by decreasing the function of thyroxine-binding globulin, all of which may negatively impact thyroid health. This study indicates that in both males and females' patients with hypothyroidism, the severity of depression and anxiety is positively correlated with the risk of hypothyroidism. However, for hyperthyroidism, although a similar trend exists, it is less pronounced in females. Conversely, in males, the risk of developing hyperthyroidism triples when experiencing severe levels of anxiety and depression. This gender disparity may be attributed to physiological and psychological differences in how males and females cope with anxiety and depression.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113XYqtX]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In regard to therapy, both conditions, hyperthyroidism and depression, demand guideline-oriented treatment. We are not aware of an established treatment that would target the two diseases in one approach.

Hyperthyroidism is not as prevalent as hypothyroidism in the general population. Assuming a population of 332.5 million people in the US, a hyperthyroidism prevalence of 1.3%, and a 12-months depression prevalence of 6.7%, an OR of 1.67 translates into about 484 thousand people with the comorbidity, 194 thousand of those presumably due to hyperthyroidism. Provided that there are 22.3 million people with depression each year, in a model assuming that hyperthyroidism causes depression, hyperthyroidism contributes about 0.9% to the pandemic of depression.

We focussed on population-based studies, but the term leaves some room for debate: For example, a sample of civil servants, such as the one investigated by Benseñor et al. is not population-based in the strict sense. However, while it is likely that prevalence differs contingent on the sample, it seems implausible that the association between hyperthyroidism and depression differs meaningfully in such a large and diverse group of people. Reassuringly, sensitivity analysis restricted to strictly population-based studies yielded no substantially different results (Supplementary Table 2). In the same vein, exclusion of register studies did not substantially change the summary estimate.

In conclusion, there is an association of hyperthyroidism with clinical depression (1.67 [95% CI: 1.49–1.87]), that is stronger in overt than in subclinical hyperthyroidism, pointing to a possibly biological association of both conditions. This should raise awareness in clinicians and researchers alike: Not only hypothyroid but also, and especially, hyperthyroid patients are at higher risk for depressive disorders and should be monitored for signs of clinical depression. How a hyperthyroid metabolism influences mood is not yet explained and, particularly regarding sex, deserves greater attention in the future research of thyroid–brain interactions.

### Thyroid function and mood disorders: a mendelian randomization study [^116HqWRB]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Taken together, the above studies suggest that thyroid function and mood disorders are closely related, but it is essential to clarify whether the observed associations are causal or not. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a commonly used approach that can provide the information on causality when RCTs are not feasible or lacking. This approach uses genetic variants as proxies to evaluate the causal effect of an exposure (e.g. thyroid function) on the outcome of interest (e.g. MDD or BD). It draws from the fact that genetic variants segregate randomly from parents to offspring, which can be compared to randomization used in RCTs. As genetic variants can affect the outcome of interest but not the other way around, an association between the genetically predicted exposure and the tested outcome can provide evidence for causality.

In this novel study, we performed a two-sample MR to investigate the causal effects of variation in normal-range TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) levels on MDD and BD risk. In secondary analyses, we analyzed the effects of thyroid function on specific MDD and BD subtypes, while reverse MR analyses were performed to assess the effects of MDD and BD on TSH and FT4 levels.

### Lithium for bipolar disorder and thyroid dysfunction and chronic kidney disease… [^114SJE8t]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

eTable 4. Sensitivity Analyses on Risk of Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism and Chronic Kidney Diseases in Bipolar Disorder Patients With Lithium and Other Mood-Stabilizers Data Sharing Statement aHR indicates adjusted hazard ratio. aBonferroni correction for multiple comparison was applied. In this cohort study of individuals with BD in Hong Kong, 4752 were analyzed hypothyroidism, 4500 for hyperthyroidism, and 7029 for CKD; lithium was associated with increased risk of hypothyroidism and CKD stage 3 or higher, but not more advanced CKD, compared with other mood stabilizers. Although lithium was associated with increased risk of hyperthyroidism in the sensitivity analyses when restricting the sample to lithium users with lithium as their first-used mood stabilizer and with mean lithium serum levels greater than median serum levels of the entire lithium group, these associations became nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction. The ROC analyses showed that the mean lithium serum level was significantly associated with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism.

Our findings concur, at least partially, with a systematic review21 and a recent study6 indicating hyperthyroidism as a lithium-related adverse effect despite its comparatively lower prevalence rate. Intriguingly, consistent with an earlier, large-scale UK study, 11 our results showed that shorter lithium exposure duration was associated with increased risk of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, suggesting that thyroid dysfunction might occur early after initiation of lithium treatment.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and depression: a meta-analysis [^115cNxNt]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this meta-analysis

This analysis has four main limitations. First, some data were obtained from observational studies, many of which are cross-sectional studies. Second, probable bias existed in the selection of the included studies, including quality problems in the original articles, inevitable heterogeneity, publication bias, and confounding factors. To restrict bias in the selection of the included studies, moderate inclusion criteria were utilised to identify studies that produced measurable data related to the risk of depression in participants with SCH. Third, possible bias may have existed due to the heterogeneity of the meta-analysed studies in terms of SCH definition (based on the upper limit of TSH) and in the depressive evaluations (diagnosis of depression and depressive scales). Fourth, none of the selected reports applied age-adjusted expected limits, resulting in the unavoidable misclassification of older adults as suffering from SCH. In addition, the diagnosis of SCH was typically based on a unitary assessment of TSH without at least a second verified measurement. This method can lead to the potential misclassification of normal thyroid hormone participants who only have a transient elevation in the serum TSH level.

Despite these limitations, the current meta-analysis has enhanced the statistical power by pooling the results of the studies. Thus, the overall number of cases and controls was adequately large to support the conclusion of the meta-analysis. Additionally, we evaluated the benefit of L-T4 administration for depression in SCH patients based on RCTs. We used precise methodology. Consistent with the distinct original data, we chose different effect models. Consistent with the diverse original reports, we applied different methods of evaluating the quality.

Depression — screening for thyroid dysfunction: The diagnosis of subclinical or overt hypothyroidism must be considered in every patient with depression. In fact, a small proportion of all patients with depression have primary hypothyroidism — either overt or subclinical, and those with autoimmune disease are more likely to have depression as are those with postpartum thyroiditis regardless of whether the hypothyroidism is treated or not.

### Thyroid disease and cognition [^117LyUXd]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Overt hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are associated with significant decrements in mood and cognitive function, and therapy usually leads to improvement in these symptoms. In contrast, major affective or cognitive dysfunction is not typical of subclinical thyroid disease. Subtle deficits in specific cognitive domains (primarily working memory and executive function) likely exist in subclinical hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis, but these are unlikely to cause major problems in most patients. Patients with mild thyroid disease and significant distress related to mood or cognition most likely have independent diagnoses that should be evaluated and treated separately.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: a specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^115BTGyQ]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid hormone (TH) plays a key role in brain development and neurocognitive function. Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism have been associated with an increased risk of various psychiatric diseases, including depression, bipolar, and anxiety disorders (ANXs). More recently, it has even been shown that minor subclinical variations in thyroid function, even within the normal range, are associated with these psychiatric diseases, although some studies report contradicting findings. A better understanding of the biological processes underlying these associations could have highly valuable implications for both clinical psychiatry and endocrinology.

The most common forms of thyroid dysfunction have an autoimmune origin and there is increasing evidence that the immune system and inflammatory response are also relevant for the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Next to the direct effects of TH on brain, the effects of thyroid dysfunction on psychiatric diseases could thus be mediated by more generally associated autoimmune processes. Various cellular mechanisms have been proposed for this phenomenon, ranging from binding of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies to human astrocytes, coinciding anticentral nervous system auto-antibodies in thyroid diseases, to increased production of monocyte- and T lymphocyte derived cytokines. Vice versa, psychiatric disorders have also been shown to be associated with abnormalities in thyroid function tests. These include mild elevations, as well as decreases in TH levels, blunting of the thyrotropin (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation, and absence of the nocturnal surge of TSH. In addition, psychiatric disorders have also been suggested to be associated to altered autoimmune processes.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: a specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^112Sj9sM]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis coordinates brain development and postdevelopmental function. Thyroid hormone (TH) variations, even within the normal range, have been associated with the risk of developing common psychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: To get new insight into the potentially shared mechanisms underlying thyroid dysfunction and psychiatric disorders, we performed a comprehensive analysis of multiple phenotypic and genotypic databases. We investigated the relationship of thyroid disorders with depression, bipolar disorder (BIP), and anxiety disorders (ANXs) in 497,726 subjects from U.K. Biobank. We subsequently investigated genetic correlations between thyroid disorders, thyrotropin (TSH), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels, with the genome-wide factors that predispose to psychiatric disorders. Finally, the observed global genetic correlations were furthermore pinpointed to specific local genomic regions. Results: Hypothyroidism was positively associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder (MDD; OR = 1.31, p = 5.29×10–89), BIP (OR = 1.55, p = 0.0038), and ANX (OR = 1.16, p = 6.22×10–8). Hyperthyroidism was associated with MDD (OR = 1.11, p = 0.0034) and ANX (OR = 1.34, p = 5.99×10 - ⁶). Genetically, strong coheritability was observed between thyroid disease and both major depressive (r g = 0.17, p = 2.7×10 - ⁴) and ANXs (r g = 0.17, p = 6.7×10 - ⁶). This genetic correlation was particularly strong at the major histocompatibility complex locus on chromosome 6 (p < 10 - ⁵), but further analysis showed that other parts of the genome also contributed to this global effect. Importantly, neither TSH nor fT4 levels were genetically correlated with mood disorders. Conclusions: Our findings highlight an underlying association between autoimmune hypothyroidism and mood disorders, which is not mediated through THs and in which autoimmunity plays a prominent role. While these findings could shed new light on the potential ineffectiveness of treating (minor) variations in thyroid function in psychiatric disorders, further research is needed to identify the exact underlying molecular mechanisms.

### Effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^113K2g5H]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Update of Meta-analysis

As this study is, to our knowledge, the biggest trial to investigate the effect of levothyroxine on depressive symptoms in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, we also updated a recent meta-analysis on 278 participants with the results from this ancillary study on the TRUST trial on 427 participants. Because studies used different scores to assess depressive symptoms, we pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) using a random effects model. A negative SMD indicates benefit of levothyroxine therapy, with −0.2, −0.5, and −0.8 corresponding to small, moderate, and large effects, respectively. Heterogeneity was assessed with I 2 statistics (might not be important: 0%-40%; moderate: 30%-60%; substantial: 50%-90%; considerable: > 75%). Two reviewers (L.W. and M.F.) independently evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. The certainty of evidence reflects the extent to which the confidence in the estimate of the effect is adequate to support a recommendation regarding levothyroxine therapy in participants with subclinical hypothyroidism and depressive symptoms.

In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded studies that were only conducted in elderly participants from the meta-analysis.

All analyses were conducted with STATA version 16 (StataCorp LLC) for Windows.

### The association between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disease: a UK biobank prospective cohort study [^1135oHMW]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

Our study examined the association of depression and anxiety with incident thyroid disease using the UK Biobank population cohort. Among the participants with anxiety and depression in this cohort, the incidence of thyroid disorders was 2.82%, surpassing that of the general population. The high incident risk is especially gathered at the thyroid hormones dysfunctional. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, even after adjusting for various confounding factors, consistent with previous findings. Moreover, the severity of depression and anxiety was positively correlated with the risk of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Further, gender-stratified analysis revealed that the association between depression/anxiety and hypothyroidism remained significant in both males and females.

Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disorders. This relationship has also been observed in certain specific populations. For example, in the elderly population, there is a statistically significant correlation between anxiety and TSH levels in the elderly population, besides, fT3/fT4 ratio (fT4, free tetraiodothyronine) is reported to be negatively associated with the severity of depressive symptoms in female adolescents with depression. Despite the high comorbidity and associations that have been demonstrated, there are still some perplexing results, for example, depressive patients with positive thyroid antibodies may be more severe, but they also might have a better treatment response.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VuYHN]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis investigating both subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism and its association with clinical depression in the general population. We found a statistically significant association of hyperthyroidism and depression, with small confidence as well as prediction intervals indicating a robust effect. The results are supported by a variety of subgroup as well as sensitivity analyses and by low heterogeneity. Therefore, even though fewer studies have been carried out on hyper- than on hypothyroidism (OR: 1.30 [1.08–1.57]), we consider the evidence of an association with clinical depression and the effect itself marginally stronger in hyperthyroidism (OR 1.67 [1.49–1.87]).

These findings challenge earlier research on hyperthyroidism and depression: Wildisen et al. for example, reported no relevant effect of subclinical hyperthyroidism on BDI-scores. However, they did not analyse patients with overt hyperthyroidism. Of note, more in line with Wildisen and co-authors' study, our results point to a weaker, if any, association of subclinical hyperthyroidism with clinical depression than in overt hyperthyroidism.

### Effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^116VY5eP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does levothyroxine treatment have an effect on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism?

Findings

In this ancillary study of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 427 participants with subclinical hypothyroidism, there was no statistically significant difference in the adjusted between-group difference in the mean Geriatric Depression Score at 12 months between the levothyroxine and placebo groups.

Meaning

These results do not provide evidence in favor of levothyroxine therapy in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism to reduce the risk of developing depressive symptoms.

### Effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^111hsXcS]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

In subgroup analyses, we assessed the difference in GDS-15 scores at 12 months separately for men and women, for participants above and below 75 years of age, for different TSH levels (4.5 to < 7.0, 7.0 to < 10.0, and 10.0–20 mIU/L), and for participants with GDS-15 scores above and below 2, as the minimal clinically relevant difference on the GDS-15 scale is 2 (first clinically relevant difference from 0).

We excluded participants without depressive symptom measurements (Figure 1). We used ipsative imputation for participants with partially incomplete GDS-15 questionnaires, which means we divided the number of positive answered questions by the number of not-missing questions and multiplied this by 15 (amount of questions of the GDS-15 scale ÷ maximal score). This calculation is a valid imputation method to impute data from the 15-item GDS scale if the percentage of its missing items is 20% or less. From 427 participants (211 in treatment and 216 in the placebo group) with available data on depressive symptoms, 4 participants had an incomplete GDS-15 questionnaire at baseline, and 8 had an incomplete GDS-15 questionnaire at 12-month follow-up (only 1 participant with more than 20% missing answers was included).

### The association between thyrotropin and clinically relevant depression: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^115dEazF]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Thyroid dysfunction and mood disorders are chronic health conditions with a significant impact on quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the association between thyrotropin (TSH) and clinically relevant depression (CRD) in patients with and without mood disorders, in a population-based sample. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included all consecutive adults (≥ 18 years) who had TSH and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) within 6 months of the index visit, between October 2016 and May 2021, at the University of Utah Health. Data on demographics, hypothyroidism diagnoses, TSH, thyroid hormone replacement (THR), PHQ-9, antidepressant (AD) medications, and mood disorder diagnoses (using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes; Major depressive disorder single episode-F32, recurrent-F33, persistent mood disorder-F34, bipolar disorder-F30+F31, and mood disorder not otherwise specified-F39) were extracted electronically. CRD was defined as PHQ-9 ≥ 10. t -Test and chi-square test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Logistic regression models were formulated to evaluate the association between TSH and CRD, after adjusting for covariates. Results: The cohort included 33,138 patients, mean age 42.41 ± 16.10 years, 80.67% Caucasian, 69.10% females, and mean PHQ-9 score 10.11 ± 6.94. A total of 45.23% (n = 14,989) patients had a diagnosis of mood disorders, and 49.70% had CRD. Patients with mood disorders were more likely to be female, Caucasian, non-Hispanic/Latino, on AD, had hypothyroidism diagnoses, on thyroid medications, had higher mean PHQ-9 scores, and had CRD. TSH level was associated with an increased odds of CRD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01, confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.02, p < 0.009) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and use of THR and AD. Both the low TSH and high TSH groups showed increased odds of CRD, with respective ORs of 1.19 (CI: 1.04–1.37) and 1.26 (CI: 1.13–1.40). Conclusions: Thyroid dysfunction is associated with an increase in the odds of depression. Future longitudinal cohort studies are recommended to investigate the association between thyroid function and incident depression.

### The causal relationship between major depression disorder and thyroid diseases: a mendelian randomization study and mediation analysis [^114UAzrV]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies have been conducted on the relationship between depression and thyroid diseases and function, its causal relationship remains unclear.

Methods

Using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of European and East Asian ancestry, we conducted 2-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization to estimate the association between MDD and thyroid function (European: normal range TSH, T4, T3, fT4, TPOAb levels and TPOAb-positives; East Asian: T4) and thyroid diseases (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis), and used Mediation analysis to evaluate potential mediators (alcohol intake, antidepressant) of the association and calculate the mediated proportions.

Results

It was observed a significant causal association between MDD on hypothyroidism (P = 8.94 × 10–5), hyperthyroidism (P = 8.68 × 10–3), and hashimoto's thyroiditis (P = 3.97 × 10–5) among European ancestry, which was mediated by Alcohol intake (alcohol intake versus 10 years previously for hypothyroidism (P = 0.026), hashimoto's thyroiditis (P = 0.042), and alcohol intake frequency for hypothyroidism (P = 0.015)) and antidepressant (for hypothyroidism (P = 0.008), hashimoto's thyroiditis (P = 0.010)), but not among East Asian ancestry (P MDD-hypothyroidism = 0.016, but β direction was different; P MDD-hyperthyroidism = 0.438; P MDD-hashimoto ' s thyroiditis = 0.496). There was no evidence for bidirectional causal association between thyroid function mentioned above and MDD among both ancestry (all P > 0.05).

Conclusion

We importantly observed a significant causal association between MDD on risk of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and hashimoto's thyroiditis among European ancestry, and Alcohol intake and antidepressant as mediators for prevention of hypothyroidism, hashimoto's thyroiditis attributable to MDD.

### Thyroid function and mood disorders: a mendelian randomization study [^111sSWLk]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Observational studies suggest that even minor variations in thyroid function are associated with the risk of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, it is unknown whether these associations are causal or not. We used a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate causal effects of minor variations in thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels on MDD and BD risk. Materials and Methods: We performed two-sample MR analyses using data from the largest publicly available genome-wide association studies on normal-range TSH (n = 54,288) and fT4 (n = 49,269) levels, MDD (170,756 cases, 329,443 controls) and BD (20,352 cases, 31,358 controls). Secondary MR analyses investigated the effects of TSH and fT4 levels on specific MDD and BD subtypes. Reverse MR was also performed to assess the effects of MDD and BD on TSH and fT4 levels. Results: There were no associations between genetically predicted TSH and fT4 levels and MDD risk, nor MDD subtypes and minor depressive symptoms. A one standard deviation increase in fT4 levels was nominally associated with an 11% decrease in the overall BD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80–0.98, p = 0.022) and a 13% decrease in the BD type 1 risk (OR = 0.87, CI = 0.75–1.00, p = 0.047). In the reverse direction, genetic predisposition to MDD and BD was not associated with TSH nor fT4 levels. Conclusions: Variations in normal-range TSH and fT4 levels have no effects on the risk of MDD and its subtypes, and neither on minor depressive symptoms. This indicates that depressive symptoms should not be attributed to minor variations in thyroid function. Borderline associations with BD and BD type 1 risks suggest that further clinical studies should investigate the effect of thyroid hormone treatment in BD.

### Effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^112evKdX]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Previous trials on the effect of levothyroxine on depressive symptom scores in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism were limited by small sample sizes (N = 57 to 94) and potential biases.

Objective

To assess the effect of levothyroxine on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism in the largest trial on this subject and to update a previous meta-analysis including the results from this study.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This predefined ancillary study analyzed data from participants in the Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) trial, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial conducted from April 2013 to October 31, 2016. The TRUST trial included adults aged 65 years or older diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as the presence of persistently elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (4.6–19.9 mIU/L) with free thyroxine (T4) within the reference range. Participants were identified from clinical and general practitioner laboratory databases and recruited from the community in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, and the UK. This ancillary study included a subgroup of 472 participants from the Netherlands and Switzerland; after exclusions, a total of 427 participants (211 randomized to levothyroxine and 216 to placebo) were analyzed. This analysis was conducted from December 1, 2019, to September 1, 2020.

Interventions

Randomization to either levothyroxine or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Depressive symptom scores after 12 months measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms (minimal clinically important difference = 2).

Results

A total of 427 participants with subclinical hypothyroidism (mean [SD] age, 74.52 [6.29] years; 239 women [56%]) were included in this analysis. The mean (SD) TSH level was 6.57 (2.22) mIU/L at baseline and decreased after 12 months to 3.83 (2.29) mIU/L in the levothyroxine group; in the placebo group, it decreased from 6.55 (2.04) mIU/L to 5.91 (2.66) mIU/L. At baseline, the mean (SD) GDS-15 score was 1.26 (1.85) in the levothyroxine group and 0.96 (1.58) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) GDS-15 score at 12 months was 1.39 (2.13) in the levothyroxine and 1.07 (1.67) in the placebo group with an adjusted between-group difference of 0.15 for levothyroxine vs placebo (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.46; p = 0.33). In a subgroup analysis including participants with a GDS-15 of at least 2, the adjusted between-group difference was 0.61 (95% CI, -0.32 to 1.53; p = 0.20). Results did not differ according to age, sex, or TSH levels. A previous meta-analysis (N = 278) on the association of levothyroxine with depressive symptoms was updated to include these findings, resulting in an overall standardized mean difference of 0.09 (95% CI, -0.05 to 0.22).

Conclusions and Relevance

This ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial found that depressive symptoms did not differ after levothyroxine therapy compared with placebo after 12 months; thus, these results do not provide evidence in favor of levothyroxine therapy in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism to reduce the risk of developing depressive symptoms.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- **Epidemiology**: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- **Disease course**: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

### Neuropsychiatric manifestations of thyroid disease [^112b4NkF]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The interface between thyroid hormone action and neuropsychiatric function is intricate, and several mechanisms of thyroid hormone uptake into brain tissues, hormone activation, and influences on neurotransmitter generation have been identified. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, whereas those attributed to thyrotoxicosis may be more characteristic. Neuropsychiatric manifestations triggered by thyroid dysfunction likely respond well to reestablishment of the euthyroid state, although some patients have persistent complaints. The addition of LT3 to ongoing LT4 replacement has yet to be definitively shown to be advantageous. Treatment of euthyroid depression with LT3 in addition to antidepressant therapy lacks convincing evidence of superior outcomes.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^116BsAU2]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine for euthyroid depression — We recommend against the routine use of levothyroxine for the treatment of euthyroid individuals with depression due to a paucity of controlled data examining treatment efficacy in this setting. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. To our knowledge, there are no controlled studies of LT4 therapy in depression, and there are no randomized placebo controlled trials of LT4 therapy for bipolar disorder or depression, with or without concomitant antidepressant therapy; available open-label studies used supraphysiologic doses of LT4 (250–500 μg/d). One randomized trial of T3 potentiation of tricyclic antidepressant nonresponders compared 37.5 μg daily of LT3 to 150 μg daily of LT4, and found greater responses to LT3, compared to LT4, but the study had no placebo arm. Depression is not more common in patients with SCH, LT4 therapy does not improve it when co-existing with mild hypothyroidism, and depressed patients had a slightly higher TSH when compared with controls (1.9 versus 1.5 mIU/L).

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uoZnn]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a systematic review and meta-analysis registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020164791). Its reporting is based on the PRISMA 2020 and MOOSE guidelines.

Data sources and searches

We conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE and PubMed Central via PubMed, in PsycINFO via EBSCOhost, and in Embase to identify epidemiological studies on the association of hyperthyroidism and depression (last update on May 4, 2020). We combined generic terms for depression, hyperthyroidism, and population-based study designs (Supplementary Methods).

Study selection

Inclusion criteria
Study design: Cohort and cross-sectional studies.
Study population: Studies needed to be representative of the general population. If study groups were not randomly sampled from the general population, studies were only eligible if they (1) drew on very broad and diverse populations, such as civil servants or the totality of hospitalized patients in one country, and (2) study reports were not suggestive of biases, i.e. included a complete report of the recruitment and selection process.
Exposure: Hyperthyroid thyroid disorders, either subclinical, overt or, if nothing else was stated, of autoimmune origin (i.e. Graves' Disease, but not Hashimoto thyroiditis). Disorders needed to be diagnosed by established laboratory methods or had to be drawn from registers employing data with documented reliability.
Outcome: Clinically significant depression, either defined as major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis according to established diagnostic systems, e.g. DSM or ICD, or an above-threshold score in established psychopathology rating scales for depression, as specified by study authors. Diagnoses could originate with assessment rating scales, standardized interviews (e.g. WHO-CIDI) or from registers including hospital data with documented reliability. To err on the conservative side we did not associate hyperthyroidism with any change in depression scores, because, in the general population, variations in depression scale scores below a predefined cut-off point for caseness are not indicative of clinical depression and may create pseudo-effects.

Exclusion criteria
Study design: Case-control studies

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: a specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^117LZj1R]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

We cannot exclude a multitude of factors that confound our (and almost every) genetic correlation analyses, such as environmental factors, nonrandom (assortative) mating, gene-by-environment correlations (e.g. diet), and sampling bias. It is noteworthy that individuals with mood disorders are more likely to be investigated for thyroid dysfunction than the general population. Some of such individuals are ultimately diagnosed with mild or subclinical thyroid dysfunction without evidence of intrinsic thyroid disease, and this can be a potential source of (sampling) bias in our work. However, when, for example, focusing on hypothyroidism, 5% of patients with depression in U.K. Biobank were found to have hypothyroidism. By definition, ∼2.5% of the general population have an increased TSH level. So even if all depressed patients with an increased TSH would have been treated (for supposed hypothyroidism), this does not explain the 5%.

Furthermore, we used biobank-derived data for parts of our phenotypic and genotypic correlation analyses. Although sample sizes of large datasets such as U.K. biobank provide strong statistical power, due to costs and practicalities, these data are inherently less detailed with regard to clinical characteristics and comprehensive usage of standard diagnostic criteria. In this regard, our study is prone to the noise of broadly defined mood disorder phenotypes and (sub)clinical conditions that may not fulfill standard diagnostic criteria. However, previous works have shown that clinical phenotypes are strongly genetically correlated with self-declared and broadly defined "proxy" phenotypes, for example, in GWAS applications, even when recorded in subjects' parents and in depression phenotypes in U.K. biobank. Taken together, we believe that the benefits of performing preliminary analyses of such broadly defined phenotypes in large biobank-based samples outweigh such limitations.

### Thyroid function and mood disorders: a mendelian randomization study [^112LxiGP]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study using the MR approach to investigate the causal relationship between thyroid function and mood disorders. Given the availability of large GWAS datasets on thyroid function, MDD and BD, it was now the optimal moment to perform well-powered MR analyses on these endpoints. We found no evidence of causal effects of variation in normal-range thyroid function on MDD risk. Conversely, we observed a nominally significant inverse association between normal-range FT4 levels and BD risk.

Although the epidemiological association between variation in normal-range thyroid function and MDD risk has been reported in several population-based studies, we found no evidence of causal effects of variation in normal-range TSH or FT4 levels on MDD risk in our study. Due to availability of large datasets, we had sufficient power to even detect a 2.7% and 3.8% change in MDD risk per one SD change in TSH and FT4 levels, respectively. Therefore, the negative results of our study show that variation in normal-range thyroid function either does not affect MDD risk at all or, if present, the causal effects are much smaller than those reported in observational studies. As thyroid function might also affect the risk of minor forms of depression, we also tested the risk of depressive symptoms in subjects not meeting formal MDD criteria in order to cover the entire spectrum of depressive disorders, but neither found any associations. Importantly, there is strong evidence for associations between various autoimmune disorders and MDD. As AITD is the most common cause of thyroid dysfunction in the general population, the association between thyroid function tests and MDD reported in observational studies could be driven by the underlying autoimmunity or association with other autoimmune diseases instead of by thyroid function itself. Nonetheless, analyzing the two subsets of TSH associated variants (i.e. AITD and non-AITD associated variants) to separate thyroid from potential autoimmunity-mediated effects, resulted in no associations with MDD for any of the two subsets of instruments. We neither found any evidence of causal effects of MDD on TSH and FT4 levels to support reverse causality. Finally, potential non-linear associations between normal-range thyroid function and MDD risk could explain the absence of associations in our MR analyses. However, this is also unlikely since two large population-based studies investigated the association between normal-range TSH levels and MDD and did not find evidence for a U-shaped association. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that variation in normal-range thyroid function does not have any noteworthy causal effect on the risk of MDD.

### Association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cPiHJ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Hypothyroidism is considered a cause of or a strong risk factor for depression, but recent studies provide conflicting evidence regarding the existence and the extent of the association. It is also unclear whether the link is largely due to subsyndromal depression or holds true for clinical depression.

Objective

To estimate the association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression in the general population.

Data Sources

PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were searched from inception until May 2020 for studies on the association of hypothyroidism and clinical depression.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently selected epidemiologic and population-based studies that provided laboratory or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems diagnoses of hypothyroidism and diagnoses of depression according to operationalized criteria (eg, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) or cutoffs in established rating scales.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated studies based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Summary odds ratios (OR) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prespecified coprimary outcomes were the association of clinical depression with either hypothyroidism or autoimmunity.

Results

Of 4350 articles screened, 25 studies were selected for meta-analysis, including 348 014 participants. Hypothyroidism and clinical depression were associated (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.08–1.57]), while the OR for autoimmunity was inconclusive (1.24 [95% CI, 0.89–1.74]). Subgroup analyses revealed a stronger association with overt than with subclinical hypothyroidism, with ORs of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.13–2.77) and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.01–1.28), respectively. Sensitivity analyses resulted in more conservative estimates. In a post hoc analysis, the association was confirmed in female individuals (OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.18–1.85]) but not in male individuals (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.40–1.25]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the effect size for the association between hypothyroidism and clinical depression was considerably lower than previously assumed, and the modest association was possibly restricted to overt hypothyroidism and female individuals. Autoimmunity alone may not be the driving factor in this comorbidity.

### The cross-sectional and longitudinal association between thyroid function and depression: a population-based study [^114TKvdx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

An association of thyroid function with mood disorders has been widely suggested, but very few studies have examined this association longitudinally.

Objective

We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between thyroid function and depression in a population-based cohort.

Methods

A total of 9471 individuals were included in cross-sectional analyses, of whom 8366 had longitudinal data. At baseline, we assessed thyroid function using serum samples (thyrotropin [TSH], free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid peroxidase antibodies) and depressive symptoms using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Incident depressive events (n = 1366) were continuously followed up with the CES-D and clinical interviews. We analyzed the cross-sectional association of thyroid function and thyroid disease with depressive symptoms using linear and logistic regression, and the longitudinal association with Cox proportional hazard models for depressive events.

Results

Lower TSH levels and lower and higher FT4 levels were cross-sectionally associated with more depressive symptoms with a B value of −0.07 per 1 unit increase of natural log-transformed TSH (95% CI −0.11; −0.04). Furthermore, hypothyroidism was cross-sectionally associated with less depressive symptoms and hyperthyroidism with more depressive symptoms. Longitudinally, there was a U-shaped association between FT4 and incident depressive events but only in euthyroid participants.

Conclusion

We show a cross-sectional association between thyroid (dys)function with depressive symptoms, and a U-shaped association between FT4 and incident depressive events in euthyroid individuals. Our findings suggest an association of thyroid function with the risk of developing depression, albeit small. Reverse causation and additional underlying factors may also contribute to the association.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BYZa5]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

This gradient in effect size may support the notion that it is not primarily autoimmunity that drives the association but possibly the increase in thyroid hormones. Further, in an earlier meta-analysis we could not support an association of TPO-antibody positivity with clinical depression. At the pathophysiological level, the findings are consistent with several hypotheses of neuroendocrine causes of depression: Dysbalanced, thyroid hormones as key regulators of metabolism can contribute to typical symptoms of depression such as sleep disturbance, weight change, fatigue or psychomotor agitation. They also stimulate cortical 5-HT secretion and might act as co-transmitters in the noradrenergic system, influencing monoaminergic transmission in the brain. Several animal models showed that induction of hypo- and hyperthyroid states in rats significantly altered cortical monoamine levels: While in hypothyroidism 5-HT levels decreased in multiple brain regions, in hyperthyroidism, norepinephrine concentration as well as the number of 5-HT2-receptors were downregulated simultaneously with an increase in 5-HT levels. One study reported depression-like behaviour in rats with induced states of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Interestingly, hyperthyroid rats also showed anxiety-like behaviour. Further, both hypo- as well as hyperthyroid disturbances of the HPT-axis can lead to hypercortisolism, which is often found in patients suffering from depression. Possibly, inflammation provides a link between thyroid disorders and depression, because with Hashimoto and Graves' disease, two of the leading causes of thyroid dysfunction result from autoantibodies against thyroid tissue, are characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha), and may have their origins in viral infections. Recently, similar factors have been discussed in the etiology of depression, and common pathways may explain the comorbidity described in primary studies and in this meta-analysis.

### Cognitive and neuropsychiatric aspects of subclinical hypothyroidism: significance in the elderly [^112DSk7r]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

The effects of overt hypothyroidism (HO) on cognition and mood are well established, and HO is considered a common cause of reversible dementia. There is now increasing evidence to suggest that subclinical hypothyroidism (ie, elevated thyroid stimulating hormone in the presence of normal thyroxine concentrations) may be a predisposing factor for depression, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Subclinical hypothyroidism is more common than HO and is most prevalent in the elderly, particularly in women. Older adults may be more vulnerable to the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism, given age-related changes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and there is an association between thyroid status and cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly. The purpose of this review is to summarize existing data on the cognitive and neuropsychiatric consequences of subclinical hypothyroidism, benefits of treatment, and recommendations for screening and monitoring in older adults.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and depression: a meta-analysis [^1177MTxD]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The connection among overt thyroid dysfunction, abnormal mood, and cognitive disorder has been well documented. Overt hypothyroidism is a cause of major mood disorder, including melancholia, and may result in deteriorating dementia. Recently, several reports have focused on subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and its latent neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive outcomes; however, these studies have failed to determine the precise nature and strength of this relationship. SCH or "mild hypothyroidism" is characterised by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free circulating thyroid hormones (FT4) and is a usual dysfunction of the thyroid axis. SCH may impact up to 17.6 percent of patients in the general population.

Several reports have demonstrated a connection between SCH and current depressive symptoms, current major depression, and a lifetime history of major depression. Meanwhile, other papers have failed to detect this association. Moreover, the relationship between depressive symptoms and SCH is controversial, particularly in older patients, as the prevalence of SCH increases with age. SCH may impact up to 22% of women > 60 years old and is slightly less prevalent in men.

In cases of overt thyroid disorder, treating psychiatric symptoms with L-T4 supplementation is well indicated. However, few randomised controlled trials have investigated L-T4 supplementation for the treatment of SCH, and the evidence regarding its effect on depressive symptoms is limited.

We performed a meta-analysis of the available evidence from cross-sectional reports and both prospective and retrospective studies investigating the relationship between SCH and depressive scale. In addition, we examined the association between SCH and depression and the effect of L-T4 replacement on depression in SCH patients.

### Effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^116PDLbc]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

Current guidelines on subclinical hypothyroidism recommend taking into account age, TSH levels, and the presence of related symptoms when deciding whether to treat a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. This ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial found no effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older patients, even among those with a TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L, although this group was relatively small. Findings from this study do reinforce the current recommendation that levothyroxine therapy should not be prescribed to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, with high quality of evidence. However, uncertainty remains on the effect of the treatment among severely depressed patients, as this trial was only conducted in patients with rather low depressive symptom scores at baseline.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and incident depression in young and middle-age adults [^111ttCMC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The role of subclinical hypothyroidism in the development of depression remains controversial. We examined the prospective association between subclinical hypothyroidism and incident depressive symptoms.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of 220,545 middle-age adults without depression who had undergone at least two comprehensive health examinations between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2014. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. The study outcome was incident depressive symptoms, defined as a Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression score > 16.

Results

During a median follow-up period of 2 years, incident depressive symptoms occurred in 7323 participants. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for incident depressive symptoms comparing subclinical hypothyroid and euthyroid participants was 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.09). Similarly, among euthyroid participants (n = 87,822), no apparent association was found between thyroid hormone levels and an increased risk of incident depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

No apparent association was found between subclinical hypothyroidism and incident depressive symptoms in a large prospective cohort of middle-age men and women.

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis functioning in anxiety disorders. A systematic review [^113Jbi4p]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

Depression has repeatedly been linked to subclinical hypothyroidism, and thyroid hormones have successfully been used to augment antidepressant treatment. By contrast, the extent of thyroid dysfunction in anxiety disorders remains less clear. This is surprising, given that anxiety-related symptoms (e.g., nervousness, palpitations, increased perspiration) are highly prevalent in hyperthyroidism. The present study was undertaken to synthesize the literature on hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis functioning in anxiety disorders. The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched. Three types of studies were included: (1) "comorbidity studies" assessing the prevalence of thyroid disorders in individuals with anxiety disorders, (2) "case-control studies" comparing HPT parameters between patients and controls, and (3) "correlational studies" assessing self-reported anxiety levels and HPT parameters. Risk of bias was assessed via a standardized quality rating. Twenty studies were eligible. Nearly all found the comorbidity between anxiety and thyroid disorders was significant. Half of the studies additionally supported the notion of subtle thyroid dysfunction in that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responses to the administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) were blunted and an inverse relationship was observed between self-reported anxiety levels and TSH. Overall, HPT assessments were well conducted, but several studies failed to adjust their analyses for smoking, body mass index (BMI), and depression. The findings resonate well with clinical recommendations to routinely screen for thyroid disorders in patients with anxiety disorders, and with what is known from basic research about thyroid-brain interactions. The results of the risk of bias assessment underscore the importance of further high-quality experimental and longitudinal epidemiological research.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and depression: a meta-analysis [^113vTDr3]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, this meta-analysis indicates that SCH is not linked to depression, which was defined by a diagnosis of depression or an increase on the depressive scale. In the younger patients (< 60 years old), SCH was associated with depression. However, in the older patients (≥ 60), SCH was not related to depression. Furthermore, we failed to find any benefit of L-T4 treatment on depression in SCH patients. Further studies using multiple age-associated TSH reference ranges can provide a better evaluation of the risk of depression in SCH patients.

### Effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^115aa9AM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this ancillary study within a randomized controlled trial among adults aged 65 years or older with subclinical hypothyroidism, levothyroxine therapy for 12 months had no clinical effect on depressive symptom scores. Nor was there a difference in the incidence of mild depression in the levothyroxine group compared with the placebo group after 12 months. The results stayed robust in several subgroup analyses. In this study, we additionally found that participants with slightly increased depression scores at baseline (GDS-15 ≥ 2) did not improve under levothyroxine therapy compared with placebo.

Observational studies on the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and depressive symptoms have yielded conflicting results. Several studies showed that participants with subclinical hypothyroidism had more severe depressive symptoms, but other studies reported no differences. However, our recently conducted individual participant data (IPD) analysis, including younger and older participants, revealed no prospective association between subclinical hypothyroidism and depressive symptoms. Previous clinical trials were rather small and could not find an effect of levothyroxine therapy on depressive symptoms.

Psychiatric comorbidity and lithium — thyroid evaluation and antidepressant augmentation are addressed as follows: All patients receiving lithium therapy require periodic thyroid evaluation because lithium may induce goiter and hypothyroidism, and although some depressed patients with normal thyroid function receive thyroid hormone with antidepressants, no firm evidence has shown that thyroid hormone treatment alone alleviates depression; while animal data make L-triiodothyronine combination with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) an appealing hypothesis, randomized controlled trial data are inconsistent and do not clearly support L-triiodothyronine use in euthyroid depressed subjects, whereas substantial evidence supports thyroid hormone for mood disturbances associated with hypothyroidism.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and depression: a meta-analysis [^111mg2JG]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Another meaningful consequence of the current meta-analysis is demonstrated by the ineffectiveness of therapy for SCH with LT4 supplementation on depression. Recently, a paper from New England found no significant differences in the mean alteration in the Tiredness score or Hypothyroid Symptoms score over a 1-year period between a placebo group and an L-T4 treatment group among older people with SCH. This finding is similar to our results. Furthermore, several non-placebo controlled trials have demonstrated improvements in depressive scores with L-T4 replacement in SCH patients. Based on these outcomes, it seems difficult to believe that L-T4 treatment truly improves depressive symptoms in SCH patients; this conclusion is supported by the similar outcomes in the L-T4 treatment and placebo groups. These similar results suggest that patients are particularly susceptible to the efficacy of being treated regardless of the treatment (the "placebo effect"). However, in animal studies, thyroid hormones affect the neurotransmission of serotonin and noradrenaline, which play critical roles in the pathogenesis of depression and are the targets of current antidepressant therapy –. These publications reveal elevated serotonin levels in the cerebral cortex of rats after T3 administration. Furthermore, lower serotonin levels are observed in brains with hypothyroidism. Serotonin exerts a repressive effect on thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) excretion, suggesting the presence of a feedback loop that permits the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis if serotonin values in the brain are relatively low. Overall, the current evidence does not demonstrate a significant benefit of L-T4 treatment. High-quality placebo-controlled studies with large sample sizes are needed.

### Thyroid dysfunction and women's reproductive health [^115MuEUB]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is extremely common in women and has unique consequences related to menstrual cyclicity and reproduction. Even minimal hypothyroidism can increase rates of miscarriage and fetal death and may also have adverse effects on later cognitive development of the offspring. Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy may also have adverse consequences. Accordingly, thyrotropin (TSH) determination is warranted for all women planning pregnancy or those already pregnant. Replacement doses should be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy because the increased renal iodine loss and estrogen-induced rise in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) often result in a higher dose requirement. Although thyroid abnormalities are part of the standard differential diagnosis of menstrual disorders, recent studies indicate that these are relatively infrequent causes. Nonetheless, TSH is still required as part of the laboratory evaluation of women with abnormal cycles. The incidence of postpartum thyroiditis is high — 6%-8% in various studies. A TSH should be performed in all postpartum patients who are depressed, who complain of unusual fatigue or anxiety or have any of the classical symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Practitioners providing health care for women should be alert to thyroid disorders as possible etiological factors in nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and depression. However, most women with these symptoms are euthyroid; replacement therapy for them is not indicated. The long-standing dogma of thyroidology that replacement with levothyroxine alone is satisfactory for all hypothyroid patients has recently been questioned but results of trials are inconclusive. Nonetheless, satisfactory regimens can be found for the vast majority of patients.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms of depression: evidence from the national health and nutrition examination surveys (NHANES) [^113PRa9a]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with increased risk for depression, yet the findings remain controversial. It is possible that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with some, but not all symptoms of depression. We examined symptom-specific associations between depression and subclinical hypothyroidism.

Methods

Participants (N = 7683 adults) were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2007–2008, 2009–2010, and 2011–2012 We included participants who had data on their thyroid profile and depressive symptoms (measured using Patient Health Questionnaire), and excluded those with overt hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and those on thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Logistic regression with sampling weights was used to examine the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and depression symptoms. We also ran sensitivity analysis using different cut-off points for defining subclinical hypothyroidism.

Results

Of all the participants, 208 (2.7%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and of them only six had depression. Subclinical hypothyroidism was not associated with depression (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.20–1.87) nor with the specific depression symptoms. Using lower criteria for subclinical hypothyroidism diagnosis resulted in similar findings.

Conclusions

In a nationally representative sample of US adults, we observed no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and overall depression risk or any of the individual symptoms of depression.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and depression: a meta-analysis [^117EZQCu]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Overall, this meta-analysis indicates that mild thyroid dysfunction is related to depression in younger patients (< 60 years old) as determined by the diagnosis of depression or an increase on the depressive scale. We found an insignificant connection between depression and SCH in the older patients (≥ 60 years old). Furthermore, we failed to detect an influence of L-T4 supplementation therapy for SCH on depression.

Numerous studies have investigated the mechanism by which overt thyroid disease influences physical, behavioural, and cognitive functions; however, the connection between SCH and these consequent measures has not been rigorously defined, and studies have reported contradictory outcomes –.

In recent years, many publications have paid increasing attention to the relationship between SCH and depression; however, these studies revealed tremendous heterogeneity in the recruited population, particularly in terms of age, gender, and depressive domains. Notably, articles involving participants varying in age may affect mutual comparability. In recent decades, numerous studies have investigated the relationship between age and depression. Many studies have reported that age is an inconvenient element that influences the path and symptomatology of a depressive episode. Depressive episodes accompanied by anxiety and the risk of committing suicide are considerable predictors that differ according to the age of the subjects. We performed a sub-group analysis because of the clinical heterogeneity. SCH was found to be associated with depression in the younger adults (< 60 years old). The only difference between SCH and normal thyroid function is TSH. Two large publications have reported an indistinguishable link with lower T4 and/or higher TSH levels in subjects presenting with depressive syndrome (based on the depression region of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule) among 6869 younger subjects from the United Statesand worse psychological well-being (based on self-reported questionnaires) among 2269 younger men from the United Kingdom. Several studies using animal models have examined the relationship between SCH and depression, which was demonstrated by increased immobility performance on the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). In 2014, an animal study illustrated that the density of hippocampal T3 was slightly lower in the SCH group than the sham group, which indicated a dysfunction in thyroid hormones in the brains of SCH rats even though their plasma thyroid hormones were in the normal range. Many papers have investigated whether SCH promotes depression-like behaviour in rats in conjunction with slight hyper-activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Furthermore, several subsequent studies have investigated the role of the Wnt signalling pathway in mood diseases, such as major depressionand bipolar disorder. Thyroid hormones trigger cell proliferation, restrain the delivery of key elements of the Wnt signalling pathway and suppress β-catenin levels. Consequently, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway appears to participate in SCH-related depression.

### Thyroid function and mood disorders: a mendelian randomization study [^1173jKXx]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), have a global lifetime prevalence of up to 20%. It has been suggested that a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors is involved in the pathogenesis of MDD and BD, but a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still crucial for a further improvement in their prevention and treatment. Thyroid hormones are essential for neurocognitive development and function, and therefore the association between thyroid dysfunction and mood disorders has been extensively studied over the last decades. Indeed, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism have been associated with MDD and/or BD in observational studies. More recently, even variation in normal-range thyroid function has been associated with MDD risk in large cohort studies. Vice versa, it has also been suggested that mood disorders affect the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, as illustrated by a blunted thyrotropin (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation, and a decreased amplitude of the nocturnal TSH surge in patients with MDD. However, it is not clear whether the observed associations are causal, as observational studies are often prone to selection bias, residual confounding and reverse causality. Several experimental studies reported beneficial effects of adjunct treatment with thyroid hormones in euthyroid patients with refractory mood disorders, including both MDD and BD. It has been suggested that thyroid hormones may accelerate the effect of antidepressant treatment as well as induce the response in those who do not respond to standard treatment. However, the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on such treatments provided conflicting results, and none of them can be considered definitive due to their small sample sizes and/or short follow-up periods.

### Paradigm shifts in thyroid hormone replacement therapies for hypothyroidism [^116td1M6]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Impaired psychological well-being, depression or anxiety are observed in 5–10% of hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine, despite normal TSH levels. Such complaints might hypothetically be related to increased free T₄ and decreased free T₃ serum concentrations, which result in the abnormally low free T₄:free T₃ ratios observed in 30% of patients on levothyroxine. Evidence is mounting that levothyroxine monotherapy cannot assure a euthyroid state in all tissues simultaneously, and that normal serum TSH levels in patients receiving levothyroxine reflect pituitary euthyroidism alone. Levothyroxine plus liothyronine combination therapy is gaining in popularity; although the evidence suggests it is generally not superior to levothyroxine monotherapy, in some of the 14 published trials this combination was definitely preferred by patients and associated with improved metabolic profiles. Disappointing results with combination therapy could be related to use of inappropriate levothyroxine and liothyronine doses, resulting in abnormal serum free T₄:free T₃ ratios. Alternatively, its potential benefit might be confined to patients with specific genetic polymorphisms in thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases that affect the intracellular levels of T₃ available for binding to T₃ receptors. Levothyroxine monotherapy remains the standard treatment for hypothyroidism. However, in selected patients, new guidelines suggest that experimental combination therapy might be considered.

### New approaches to managing difficult-to-treat depressions [^111AWheU]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

In a sense, all depression is difficult to treat. Most depressions are episodic conditions that, not infrequently, are slow to fully remit. Most also are complicated by comorbid psychiatric and general medical disorders. However, a minority of such difficult-to-treat depressions are treatment resistant. The most common cause of initial treatment failure is not resistance but undertreatment-that is, an insufficient duration of treatment, a subtherapeutic dosage of antidepressant, and/or poor adherence to the prescribed regimen. Complicating factors such as undiagnosed hypothyroidism or substance abuse can result in apparent treatment resistance unless addressed. Challenging subtypes of illness, including psychotic and bipolar subtypes of depression, are not necessarily inherently refractory but must be met with modified treatment approaches.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Titles and abstracts retrieved in the literature search were independently screened by two authors (HB, BI). "Grey" literature was included and no language or date restrictions applied. We searched bibliographies of every article eventually included. All articles potentially eligible were read independently by two authors (HB, BI), and data of included studies were extracted independently by two authors (HB, BI) using an Excel-based standardized data extraction form in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Disagreements were solved by discussion with the senior author (CB). If no effect sizes or sufficient data for calculation were reported, we contacted authors by e-mail.

All studies included were rated independently by two authors (HB, BI) for their risk of bias, using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) adaptation for cohort and cross-sectional studies. To be rated as "low risk of bias", studies needed to be categorized in the highest NOS-category, i.e. they needed to receive all or all but one star in the rating system.

### Exploring the genetic link between thyroid dysfunction and common psychiatric disorders: a specific hormonal or a general autoimmune comorbidity [^113XpJjG]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

One way to investigate the mechanistic relationship between hypothyroidism and mood disorders is to perform genetic correlation analyses on TPO antibodies and mood disorders. To date, the GWAS of TPO antibodies has not shown a strong heritable signal (h2 SNP < 0.002), probably due to a combination of limited statistical power and the fact that it was performed in population-based cohorts after excluding individuals on thyroid medication, effectively excluding most of the subjects with diagnosed Hashimoto's hypothyroidism. Therefore, future larger GWASs of (thyroid) autoimmune biomarkers and conditions will help elucidating whether the thyroid-mood axis is predominantly mediated through TH levels or pathways involved in (auto)immunity.

Irrespective of the exact underlying mechanisms, our findings also have clinical relevance. Based on the well-known clinical correlations, thyroid dysfunction is among the first somatic disorders to be ruled out in a patient with a newly diagnosed psychiatric disorder. Various studies have investigated whether correction of milder forms of thyroid dysfunction (including subclinical hypothyroidism) improves depressive and anxiety-related symptoms, with disappointing results. Our finding that the genetically determined relationship between hypothyroidism and mood/ANXs is not mediated through THs, but more likely by (general) autoimmunity, is a plausible explanation for this lack of effects and supports a restrictive attitude toward treating mild thyroid dysfunction in psychiatric patients.

Besides psychiatric disorders, milder affective and anxiety related complaints are frequently reported in hypothyroid patients. Unfortunately, these complaints persist in 10–15% of levothyroxine treated patients despite normalization of their TH levels, which is among the largest knowledge gaps in endocrinology. Our findings may not suggest direct psychiatric vulnerability of Hashimoto's hypothyroidism patients, and may highlight that this comorbidity is partly mediated through autoimmunity and not thyroid function, which would be a plausible explanation as to why these patients have persisting complaints despite the normalization of their TH levels after initiating thyroid medication.

Our combined phenotypic and genetic analyses across multiple psychiatric and thyroid traits allowed us to better understand their shared biological underpinnings, more so than we would have in a purely phenotypic analysis. While our evidence for genetic overlap strongly encourages further research into shared molecular mechanisms, the approaches we used remain observational and do not directly exclude alternative causal explanations. For example, heritable lifestyle factors (such as diet and physical activity) are shared predisposing factors to both psychiatric disorders and thyroid diseases, so these could be contributing mediating factors in addition to any directly mediating, purely molecular inflammation pathways. Future research using Mendelian randomizationand longitudinal designs is warranted to better inform on the different possible causal mechanisms.

### Exploring the mental health challenges of children with autoimmune thyroiditis [^111PUNtx]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The most prevalent cause of acquired thyroid dysfunction in children is autoimmune thyroid disorders (ATD), which include Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' disease (GD). Autoimmune thyroid diseases are caused by the infiltration of autoreactive B and T lymphocytes of the thyroid gland and the presence of antithyroid antibodies. This will lead to variations in the thyroid function (GD: hyperthyroidism, HT: normal function, or subclinical/overt hypothyroidism.

Genetic components play a significant role in the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. In addition, maternal and paternal inheritance contributes to autoimmune thyroid diseases as more than 50% of children had a positive family history. Autoimmune thyroid diseases can present at any age but usually at puberty. Females tend to be affected more than males.

Many research and reviews have focused on the psychiatric evaluation of people with various forms of hyperthyroidism, including normal, overt, or subclinical thyroid hormone levels, in conjunction with anti-thyroid medications (ATDs) or thyroidectomy. Beyond the fundamental symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and other associated neuropsychiatric illnesses and disorders, these studies confirmed the incidence of more serious somatic symptoms. According to literature reviews, the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms associated with autoimmune thyroiditis varies greatly. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Slegmann et al. showed that autoimmune thyroiditis is associated with depression and anxiety disorders. Research evaluating behavior in children with thyrotoxicosis is limited.

This study aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory features of autoimmune thyroid disease in our tertiary care center and assess their health-related quality of life and the strengths and difficulties that face them.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and depression: a meta-analysis [^114SqGc2]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Study selection

Two reviewers (Zhao and Chen) separately evaluated all potential titles and abstracts. Articles were precluded if the title and/or abstract were not suitable for the meta-analysis. Subsequently, we collected the full versions of the qualified reports. Disagreements were settled by consensus and the view of a third author (Zhao) as necessary. SCH is characterised by elevated levels of TSH and normal fT4 levels. However, the upper limit of the TSH reference range is controversial. Several experts propose that the TSH upper limit is 4.5–5.0 mIU/L, but other authors recommend for the upper limit to be lowered to 2.5–3.0 mIU/L due to the increased risk of developing overt hypothyroidism and a higher prevalence of anti-thyroid antibodies compared to that among euthyroid participants. Due to this controversy, a particular TSH upper limit for the SCH definition was not pre-identified in this meta-analysis. In addition, the fT4 values were considered regular if they were perceived as normal by the reviewers, even though details regarding the fT4 values were not indicated. The papers were considered qualified if they met the corresponding criteria: published data, cross-sectional study, case control report, prospective study, retrospective study, RCTs, clearance and use of a unique commercial product to perform the TSH assay, specified depressive measurement and domains, and number of depressed patients included (with well-described criteria for depression). Reviews, case reports, letters, nonhuman studies, and conference abstracts were eliminated. Studies involving subjects who were formerly diagnosed with major depressive disorder, neurological diseases such as stroke or Parkinson's or severe medical conditions that could influence mood, such as cancer, studies neglecting to mention the scales used to evaluate depression and studies in which most patients with SCH were treated with L-T4 were excluded from the study.

### Thyroid function and the natural history of depression: findings from the caerphilly prospective study (CaPS) and a meta-analysis [^111ANqd7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Low thyroid function has been associated with depression in clinical populations. We have examined whether thyroid function in the normal range is associated with minor psychiatric morbidity.

Design

Prospective cohort study of 2269 middle aged men (45–59 years) with thyroid function (total T(4) only, TSH unavailable) measured between 1979 and 1983 and with repeat measures of minor psychiatric morbidity (GHQ-30) over a mean of 12.3 years follow-up. We also undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies examining thyroid function and mood.

Results

There was a positive association between total T(4) and chronic psychiatric morbidity (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.02–1.43, P = 0.03), but this was consistent with chance after adjusting for social class, alcohol and smoking behaviours. The association with incident and recovery from psychiatric morbidity was weaker and consistent with chance. We identified seven eligible studies, from our systematic review and included six studies, including our own, in a meta-analysis. The pooled estimate showed a positive association (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.22, P-value = 0.01) between depression and T(4) and an inverse association with TSH (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.88–0.97, P = 0.0007) with no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias.

Conclusion

The results from CaPS and our meta-analysis are consistent and suggest that, if anything, higher levels of thyroxine in the normal range are associated with increased risk of depression. The effects of thyroid hormone on mood may differ in normal populations and patients with clinical thyroid dysfunction.

### Does a combination regimen of thyroxine (T4) and 3, 5, 3'-triiodothyronine improve depressive symptoms better than T4 alone in patients with hypothyroidism? Results of a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [^1114yr6n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Some hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine replacement therapy complain of depressive symptoms despite normal TSH measurements. It is not known whether adding T(3) can reverse such symptoms. We randomized 40 individuals with depressive symptoms who were taking a stable dose of levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism (excluding those who underwent thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid) to receive T(4) plus placebo or the combination of T(4) plus T(3) in a double-blind manner for 15 wk. Participants receiving combination therapy had their prestudy dose of T(4) dropped by 50%, and T(3) was started at a dose of 12.5 micro g, twice daily. T(4) and T(3) doses were adjusted to keep goal TSH concentrations within the normal range. Compared with the group taking T(4) alone, the group taking both T(4) plus T(3) did not report any improvement in self-rated mood and well-being scores that included all subscales of the Symptom Check-List-90, the Comprehensive Epidemiological Screen for Depression, and the Multiple Outcome Study (P > 0.05 for all indexes). In conclusion, the current data do not support the routine use of combined T(3) and T(4) therapy in hypothyroid patients with depressive symptoms.

### Combination treatment with T4 and T3: toward personalized replacement therapy in hypothyroidism? [^114dAJph]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Levothyroxine therapy is the traditional lifelong replacement therapy for hypothyroid patients. Over the last several years, new evidence has led clinicians to evaluate the option of combined T(3) and T(4) treatment to improve the quality of life, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action in hypothyroidism. The aim of this review is to assess the physiological basis and the results of current studies on this topic.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched Medline for reports published with the following search terms: hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid, guidelines, treatment, deiodinases, clinical symptoms, quality of life, cognition, mood, depression, body weight, heart rate, cholesterol, bone markers, SHBG, and patient preference for combined therapy. The search was restricted to reports published in English since 1970, but some reports published before 1970 were also incorporated. We supplemented the search with records from personal files and references of relevant articles and textbooks. Parameters analyzed included the rationale for combination treatment, the type of patients to be selected, the optimal T(4)/T(3) ratio, and the potential benefits of this therapy on symptoms of hypothyroidism, quality of life, mood, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action.

Evidence Synthesis

The outcome of our analysis suggests that it may be time to consider a personalized regimen of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients.

Conclusions

Further prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to clarify this important issue. Innovative formulations of the thyroid hormones will be required to mimic a more perfect thyroid hormone replacement therapy than is currently available.

### Prevalence and risk factors of subclinical hypothyroidism in young and middle-aged patients with first-episode drug-Naïve major depressive disorder [^116XhSei]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular risk and the ability to perform activities of daily living, were associated with thyroid dysfunction in younger age groups and were not replicated in older adults. Although the increased prevalence of hypothyroidism in older adults is accompanied by higher rates of physical and cognitive impairment, depression, and cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism may have a protective effect on the health of older adults. The overall impact of SCH on older adults varies, and individualized treatment and long-term monitoring are appropriate strategies. Although several cohort studies have evaluated the association between SCH and depression, most of these studies have focused on the elderly population, with little evidence of an association between SCH and depression in middle-aged and younger adults. In addition, older adults have complex somatic disorders that may be accompanied by multiple somatic disorders and perhaps include too many confounding factors. At the same time, it has been noted that despite the well-characterized age-related changes in thyroid function, normal TSH reference limits derived for specific age groups are not routinely used to identify thyroid dysfunction in older adults. Hence, this study included younger and middle-aged adults for comparative studies.

Early and routine screening for depression is vital in preventing morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that growth inhibitors and serotonin affect the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis, which links hypothyroidism to depression. SCH has a negative impact on depression. Many depressed patients have elevated antithyroid antibodies. Microsomal antibodies are also common in patients with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. Additional TSH receptor (TSHR) antibodies block the function of TSH, which can lead to hypothyroidism. Diminished TSH response to TRH has been associated with an increased risk of suicide, suicidal ideation, violent suicide attempts, and elevated mortality. Thyroid disease and mood disorders are both common and can occur in the same person, so it is important for psychiatrists to optimize the treatment of patients with these comorbidities. Optimal intervention requires an understanding of the subtle thyroid dysfunction that may be present in patients with mood disorders. Early detection and treatment of SCH may be beneficial to improve patients' quality of life and affect multiple organs.

### The cross-sectional and longitudinal association between thyroid function and depression: a population-based study [^11787eES]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the possible mechanisms underlying the presence of depression in thyroid dysfunction are not well understood, a dysregulation of neurotransmitters, an alteration of the blood–brain barrier, and a dysfunctional gene expression have been described. For instance, our findings of a U-shaped association between FT4 and incident depressive events in euthyroid individuals could be partly explained by alterations in neurotransmitters. Low thyroid hormone levels have been related to a decrease in the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the brain and changes in GABA have been related to neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression. On the other hand, high levels of FT4 are suggested to cause an exhaustion of the noradrenergic system, which leads to the occurrence of depression. Additionally, given that the U-shaped association between FT4 and depressive symptoms was found in all cross-sectional analyses, we cannot rule out the presence of other factors that may underlie the association, the possibility of a bidirectional effect, or that the association between thyroid function and depression is mainly limited to a short-term relation, such as that observed for vitamin D and depression. Regarding the bidirectional effect, a recent study used bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses and showed no evidence for a causal relationship between thyroid function in the reference range and the risk for major depressive disorders or depressive symptoms either, as well as no evidence for a causal effect of major depressive disorder on thyroid function (nonthyroidal illness). However, the low percentage of currently explained variance for thyroid function likely limits the power of these type of studies. Also, there is little evidence from cohort studies on the longitudinal relationship between depression at baseline and alterations of thyroid function in the long-term.

This study offers a comprehensive insight into the relation between thyroid function and depression, as we used a large population-based sample, with a reliable and validated depression measure and a long follow-up to assess incident cases of depressive events, in which the measure of incident depressive events was based on various information sources and the occurrence of depressive events was constantly monitored. While our results in the cross-sectional analyses are in line with previous studies, longitudinal evidence is more mixed. Studies have suggested a biological mechanism underlying the association between thyroid function and depression outcomes; however, more research is needed to understand the underlying pathways and whether differences across studies could be related to sample characteristics or whether a prospective association between thyroid function and incident depressive events is specific to certain subgroups in the population. Importantly, it is worth noting that any potential effect of thyroid (dys)function on depression is likely to be smaller than generally expected.

### Increased risk of developing affective disorder in patients with hypothyroidism: a register-based study [^11651fX5]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Links between thyroid function and depression have been noted in many contexts. We assessed whether hospitalization with hypothyroidism was a risk factor for developing affective disorder.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study using historical data from Danish registers. The observational period was 1977–1999. Three study cohorts were identified: all patients with a first hospital admittance with the resulting index discharge diagnoses hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, or nontoxic goiter. A later hospitalization with a resulting discharge diagnosis of affective disorder was used as event of interest, and rates of readmission were estimated and compared using competing risk models in survival analyses.

Findings

We identified 165,307 patients discharged with an index diagnosis. In the observational period, 1041 events occurred. An index diagnosis of hypothyroidism was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with affective disorder when compared to the control diseases. The risk of hospitalization with affective disorder was greatest in the first year after index hospitalization.

Conclusion

Patients hospitalized with hypothyroidism have a greater risk of readmission with depression or bipolar disorder than control patients. This renders epidemiologic support to theories linking thyroid dysfunction with mood disturbances.

### The association between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disease: a UK biobank prospective cohort study [^111SAeAh]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Thyroid disorder is a broad-spectrum series disfunction of thyroid hormones and morphological changes, which is common with a prevalence of 1.3% in a global context, and the annual incidence rate was 51 cases per 100,000 individuals. Thyroid hormones exert influence across every phase of our lives, playing a pivotal role in regulating growth and metabolism with sex differences. Its dysfunctionality is often associated with various illnesses, such as increased risk of psychiatric illnesses, especially for anxiety and depression. Though nowadays awareness regarding thyroid illnesses has been elevated as well as the measurement of thyroid hormones through sensitive laboratory tests allows for acute diagnosis of thyroid disorders, several of them did not receive timely diagnosis and treatment due to the complicated clinical manifestations, therefore leading to severe consequences.

Depression and anxiety are common mental health illness that not only significantly impairs individuals' social and psychological functioning but also decrease their quality of life, with a prevalence of 6% and 18%, respectively. Studies have indicated a frequent comorbidity between depression, anxiety, and thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune thyroid diseases. For example, most individuals with depression are found to have thyroid function abnormalities, one recent study showed elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in 1,718 first-episode and drug-naïve major depressive disorder patients, another study conducted in 9,471 participants indicated that depressive symptom is cross-sectionally associated with lower TSH levels and higher free tetraiodothyronine (fT4) levels. Besides, individuals with depression are frequently observed to have clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormones have been frequently utilized to enhance the effectiveness of antidepressant treatments. Another study revealed abnormal thyroid function in individuals with anxiety disorder), and antithyroglobulin antibody were found to predict anxiety symptoms in female patients. Conversely, individuals with thyroid disorders are also prone to comorbid with depression and anxiety. For example, lifetime prevalence of depression is significantly higher in patients with subclinical thyroid dysfunction. Individuals with hyperthyroidism had a higher chance of being diagnosed with clinical depression compared to those with normal thyroid function. A recent cohort study included 29,034 patients reported that low TSH was associated with an increased likelihood of depression. Previous research has reported associations between depression, anxiety, and their symptoms often overlap. For instance, depression shares several symptoms with hypothyroidism, such as persistent low energy, lack of concentration, memory impairment, sleep disturbances, and absence of interest. There are also similar symptoms between anxiety and hyperthyroidism, such as nervousness, restlessness, irritability, palpitations, tremors, and insomnia. Though comorbidities are widely seen, causation relationship remains unclear.

### Outcomes of thyroid dysfunction in people aged eighty years and older: an individual patient data meta-analysis of four prospective studies (towards understanding longitudinal international older people studies consortium) [^116Sfiap]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Subclinical and overt thyroid dysfunction is easily detectable, often modifiable, and, in younger age groups, has been associated with clinically relevant outcomes. Robust associations in very old persons, however, are currently lacking. This study aimed to investigate the associations between (sub-)clinical thyroid dysfunction and disability in daily living, cognitive function, depressive symptoms, physical function, and mortality in people aged 80 years and older. Methods: Four prospective cohorts participating in the Towards Understanding Longitudinal International older People Studies (TULIPS) consortium were included. We performed a two-step individual participant data meta-analysis on source data from community-dwelling participants aged 80 years and older from the Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and Japan. Outcome measures included disability in daily living (disability in activities of daily living [ADL] questionnaires), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]), depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]), physical function (grip strength) at baseline and after 5 years of follow-up, and all-cause five-year mortality. Results: Of the total 2116 participants at baseline (mean age 87 years, range 80–109 years), 105 participants (5.0%) were overtly hypothyroid, 136 (6.4%) subclinically hypothyroid, 1811 (85.6%) euthyroid, 60 (2.8%) subclinically hyperthyroid, and 4 (0.2%) overtly hyperthyroid. Participants with thyroid dysfunction at baseline had nonsignificantly different ADL scores compared with euthyroid participants at baseline and had similar MMSE scores, GDS scores, and grip strength. There was no difference in the change of any of these functional measures in participants with thyroid dysfunction during five years of follow-up. Compared with the euthyroid participants, no 5-year survival differences were identified in participants with overt hypothyroidism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI 0.6–1.6]), subclinical hypothyroidism (HR 0.9 [CI 0.7–1.2]), subclinical hyperthyroidism (HR 1.1 [CI 0.8–1.7]), and overt hyperthyroidism (HR 1.5 [CI 0.4–5.9]). Results did not differ after excluding participants using thyroid-influencing medication. Conclusions: In community-dwelling people aged 80 years and older, (sub-)clinical thyroid dysfunction was not associated with functional outcomes or mortality and may therefore be of limited clinical significance.
