## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic and preventive steps to take for a 17-year-old Filipino woman who has been exposed to rubella ("German measles") and has no documented immunity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about her risk of infection and the consequences, especially if she is pregnant or could become pregnant. Then, I should verify the optimal diagnostic approach, including timing and specimen type. Next, I will review post-exposure management, including whether vaccination helps after exposure and what to do if she is pregnant. Finally, I will compare the provided options and choose the best single answer based on evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk. Rubella is transmitted via respiratory droplets and is moderately contagious, with an average incubation of about 14–23 days, and up to half of infections are subclinical, which complicates reliance on symptoms alone [^48f5cc9e] [^3bb62a1c]. Importantly, rubella infection in early pregnancy carries a high risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), with defect risk highest in the first trimester and decreasing after 12 weeks, so I need to ensure we address reproductive risk explicitly [^86bac1af].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic strategy before jumping to conclusions. Serology is the mainstay for diagnosing acute rubella, but timing matters: only about 50% are IgM positive at rash onset, so I should obtain an acute-phase serum now and a convalescent sample 14–21 days later to document seroconversion or a fourfold rise in IgG if clinically suspected, while remembering that in low-incidence settings like the U.S., false-positive IgM can occur and testing should be reserved for those with compatible exposure and symptoms [^335689af]. I initially thought PCR on serum might be useful, but hold on, I should correct that — rubella PCR is best performed on nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, not serum, and is most sensitive when collected early in illness; serum PCR is not the recommended approach for routine diagnosis [^41beb16b].

> I need to check post-exposure management next. Unlike measles, MMR given after rubella exposure does not prevent infection or modify disease, so post-exposure vaccination is not recommended for rubella; instead, if she lacks immunity and is pregnant, immune globulin may be considered in some contexts, though evidence for preventing CRS is limited and use should be individualized with public health consultation [^5390285c]. If she is not pregnant and lacks immunity, routine vaccination should be offered, but it will not act as post-exposure prophylaxis for this exposure; it will protect against future exposures [^2f568095].

> Let me consider the provided options carefully. Vaccination alone does not address the immediate need to determine if she is infected from this exposure, so it is insufficient as a standalone answer here. Vaccination plus mucosal biopsy is invasive, not guideline-supported, and does not improve diagnostic yield for rubella. PCR testing of serum is not the recommended specimen or test for rubella diagnosis. Nasal swab with ELISA combines the correct specimen type (nasopharyngeal or nasal swab) with serology (ELISA for IgM/IgG), aligning with best practice to collect a respiratory specimen for PCR when available and to obtain paired serology for definitive diagnosis, even though I should note that many labs use throat or nasopharyngeal swabs rather than nasal swabs per se [^335689af].

> Hold on, I should verify the nuance about PCR. While I initially implied that PCR is always indicated, I should clarify that in the U.S. — where rubella is rare — PCR may not be routinely available and is prioritized for public health investigations or when CRS is suspected; nonetheless, when PCR is accessible, a nasopharyngeal or throat swab is the preferred specimen and should be collected early if rubella is suspected, alongside serology for confirmation and public health reporting [^335689af]. Given the options, "nasal swab and ELISA" best captures the dual approach of molecular testing on a respiratory specimen plus serology, even if the exact specimen phrasing is imperfect.

> I should double-check pregnancy considerations because they change management. If she is pregnant or could be pregnant, I would add immediate rubella IgG screening to determine susceptibility, counsel on CRS risk, and coordinate with obstetrics and public health; if acute infection is confirmed in early pregnancy, counseling would include the risks of CRS and discussion of options, recognizing that immune globulin does not reliably prevent CRS and decisions should be individualized [^80f14aef] [^86bac1af]. If she is not pregnant and lacks immunity, I would offer MMR vaccination after this exposure window, with counseling to avoid pregnancy for 28 days after vaccination, but again, this will not modify the current exposure outcome [^fe557dad].

> Putting this together, the best single choice among the provided options is nasal swab and ELISA, because it reflects the correct diagnostic approach: obtain a respiratory specimen for PCR when available and perform paired serology to confirm or exclude acute rubella, which is the evidence-based pathway for suspected rubella in a person with a credible exposure history [^335689af]. I should confirm that the acute specimen is collected now and a convalescent specimen is obtained 2–3 weeks later if the initial results are negative or equivocal and suspicion remains, and I should coordinate with public health given the implications for CRS prevention and outbreak control [^335689af].

---

The correct answer is **nasal swab and ELISA** because rubella is best diagnosed by **nasopharyngeal swab PCR** for viral detection and **serum IgM/IgG ELISA** for serologic confirmation, especially in a recent exposure with uncertain immunity [^335689af]. Vaccination is not indicated post-exposure because it does not prevent rubella after exposure, and mucosal biopsy is invasive and unnecessary. PCR of serum is less sensitive than respiratory PCR for rubella detection.

---

## Diagnostic approach to rubella exposure

Rubella diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment plus laboratory confirmation** [^2b68d3ff]. In this case, the patient has a recent exposure and no documented immunity, so testing is warranted even if asymptomatic, as up to 50% of rubella infections are subclinical [^48f5cc9e].

---

### Recommended diagnostic tests

- **Nasopharyngeal swab PCR**: PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab is the most sensitive method for detecting rubella virus RNA and is preferred for early infection [^notfound].

- **Serum IgM/IgG ELISA**: Serology is essential for confirming acute infection. IgM appears within 5–7 days of rash onset, while IgG rises later and indicates recent or past infection; paired sera can show seroconversion or a fourfold rise in IgG to confirm acute infection [^335689af].

- **Timing of testing**: Collect the acute specimen now and a convalescent specimen 14–21 days later if the initial results are negative or equivocal but suspicion remains high [^335689af].

---

### Limitations of alternative options

- **Vaccination**: MMR given after exposure does not prevent rubella and is not recommended as post-exposure prophylaxis [^5390285c].

- **PCR testing of serum**: Serum PCR is less sensitive than respiratory PCR for rubella and is not the recommended specimen for diagnosis [^notfound].

- **Mucosal biopsy**: Invasive and not indicated for rubella diagnosis; no guideline supports its use.

## Clinical implications of rubella infection in a 17-year-old female

Rubella is typically mild in nonpregnant adolescents, but infection during pregnancy — especially in the first trimester — carries a **high risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)** [^86bac1af], including miscarriage, stillbirth, and severe birth defects. Therefore, confirming or excluding infection is critical for counseling and management, particularly if pregnancy is possible or planned [^80f14aef].

---

## Public health considerations

Rubella is a **notifiable disease** in many countries, including the United States. Confirming infection triggers public health actions such as contact tracing, counseling, and vaccination of susceptible contacts to prevent further transmission and CRS [^8de428d2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommended diagnostic approach** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Nasopharyngeal swab PCR | Most sensitive for early detection of rubella virus RNA [^notfound] |
| Serum IgM/IgG ELISA | Confirms acute infection and differentiates from past infection [^335689af] |
| Convalescent serum (14–21 days) | Confirms seroconversion or fourfold rise in IgG if initial results are inconclusive [^335689af] |

---

The best course of action is to perform a **nasal swab for PCR** and **serum IgM/IgG ELISA** to diagnose rubella after exposure, as vaccination is ineffective post-exposure and invasive procedures are unnecessary [^5390285c].

Background and epidemiology of measles — transmission, incubation, and infectious period: Measles is a highly contagious rash illness transmitted from person to person by direct contact with respiratory droplets or airborne spread, and after exposure up to 90% of susceptible persons develop measles. The average incubation period for measles is 10 to 12 days from exposure to prodrome and 14 days from exposure to rash (range: 7–21 days). Persons with measles are infectious 4 days before through 4 days after rash.

### Rubella [^3e43ae04]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

Rubella is still a public health concern in this country. With the great numbers of immigrants welcomed in the United States also comes the risk of diseases that are little known or thought to be of little concern. Obviously, there is a need for continued vaccination of citizens, not only at approximately 1 year of age and school age but also in terms of continued screening for and immunization of susceptible women of childbearing age. Policies need to be developed to address the issue of rubella infection and susceptibility in areas where there is a high population density of people from countries that may not have such strict immunization practices. Vaccination at workplaces that employ high numbers of foreign-born workers or that involve a close working environment, education of workers and health care professionals in the recognition of rubella and its potentially devastating effects, and continued surveillance for and reporting of cases in high-risk areas may be of benefit.

### Measles vaccine recommendations… [^a2df31c6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Presumptive evidence of immunity ACIP recommends that people who don't have presumptive evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella should get vaccinated against these diseases. Presumptive evidence of immunity can be established in any of the following ways:

- Written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella
- Laboratory evidence of immunity
- Laboratory confirmation of disease
- Birth before 1957. Although birth before 1957 is considered acceptable evidence of immunity for healthcare personnel in routine circumstances, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating healthcare personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. Healthcare providers should not accept verbal reports of vaccination without written documentation as presumptive evidence of immunity. Keep ReadingEvidence of Immunity Criteria of MMR | MMWR.

CDC recommends that separate MMR and varicella vaccines be given for the first dose in children aged 12–47 months; however, MMRV may be used if parents or caregivers express a preference. Keep ReadingBirth to 18 Years Immunization Schedule. One dose of MMR vaccine, or other presumptive evidence of immunity, is sufficient for most adults. Providers generally do not need to actively screen adult patients for measles immunity in non-outbreak areas in the United States. After vaccination, it is also not necessary to test patients for antibodies to confirm immunity. There is no recommendation for a catch-up program among adults for a second dose of MMR. Keep ReadingAdult Immunization Schedule by Age.

Considerations for specific groups Measles vaccine is recommended for vaccinating people in specific groups who do not have evidence of immunity against measles, including:

- College students
- International travelers
- Healthcare personnel
- Close contacts of immunocompromised people
- People with HIV infection
- Adults who got inactivated measles vaccine
- Groups at increased risk during measles outbreak Keep ReadingMeasles Vaccination for Specific Groups. Post-exposure prophylaxis for measles People exposed to measles who cannot readily show that they have adequate presumptive evidence of immunity against measles should be offered post-exposure prophylaxis. Public health officials can help identify eligible persons, assess any contraindications, and weigh benefits. There are two types of PEP for measles. To potentially provide protection or modify the clinical course of disease among susceptible persons, administer one of these:

ACIP 2013 MMR recommendations — women of childbearing age specify that all women of childbearing age should be vaccinated with 1 dose of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of rubella immunity, and nonpregnant women lacking documentation or laboratory evidence should be vaccinated with MMR vaccine. Birth before 1957 is not acceptable evidence of rubella immunity for women who could become pregnant, and women who are pregnant should not receive MMR vaccine. Upon completion or termination of pregnancy, women without evidence of rubella immunity should be vaccinated before discharge, and they should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after administration. Prenatal serologic screening is indicated for pregnant women lacking acceptable evidence; screening sera should be tested for rubella IgG only and not IgM unless recent exposure is suspected, because rubella IgM testing might yield false positive and long‑persisting results that are difficult to interpret.

### Rubella eradication: not yet accomplished, but entirely feasible [^3bb62a1c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

As highlighted in this article, epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical data were used to modify the rubella vaccine strategy. Experience with various strategies was reviewed and lessons learned were applied. The WHO updated the recommended strategy in 2020 its latest rubella vaccine position paper. No longer is it recommended to vaccinate women of reproductive age only, but rather such vaccination must be combined with routine childhood vaccination. It is recommended that all countries introducing RCV into their national program should conduct an introductory wide-age campaign.

In 2009, an ad hoc Global Measles Advisory Group was convened by WHO, leading to a global technical consultation to assess the feasibility of measles eradication in 2010. On the basis of this review, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) concluded that measles could and should be eradicated. In 2015, the ITFDE proposed that rubella eradication was also feasible and encouraged discussion on the feasibility and potential timing. At the October 2019 WHO SAGE meeting, the feasibility of measles and rubella eradication was reviewed. It was noted that achievement and maintenance of the elimination threshold for rubella is more likely and would occur earlier than elimination of measles. However, SAGE concluded that while accelerating toward measles and rubella elimination is urgent, eradication is not a realistic outcome in the short or medium term. Establishment of a goal and target date will be considered only when substantial, measurable progress has been made.

Nevertheless, wherever rubella vaccine has been employed, the rash disease and its congenital infection seem to disappear. In contrast, measles outbreaks continue in Europe and the United States, as vaccination coverage is low in certain areas. Why the difference? First, rubella is less infectious than measles, with the reproductive number (Ro) being about 7 for the former but about 12 for the latter. Second, immunity to measles may be less robust, in that vaccinees with lower titers of antibody often show booster responses indicating subclinical infections. Antibody titers after rubella vaccination may drop to low levels, but resistance to infection appears to persist. Also, the incubation period of rubella (14–23 days) is longer on average than that of measles (10–21 days), which means that there is more time for an anamnestic response in vaccinees to suppress rubella virus replication after exposure than to suppress measles virus replication.

Evidence of rubella immunity — criteria and pregnancy considerations specify that documentation of vaccination with at least 1 dose of live rubella virus-containing vaccine at age ≥ 12 months, laboratory evidence of rubella immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or birth before 1957 (except women who could become pregnant) confers acceptable presumptive evidence. Birth before 1957 is not acceptable evidence of rubella immunity for women who could become pregnant. Documented evidence of rubella immunity is important for women who could become pregnant because rubella can occur among some unvaccinated persons born before 1957 and congenital rubella and CRS can occur among the offspring of women infected with rubella during pregnancy.

Rubella immunity after vaccination — follow-up indicates durability of antibody responses: the majority of persons had detectable rubella antibodies up to 16 years after 1 dose of rubella‑containing vaccine, and among persons with 2 doses, approximately 91%–100% had detectable antibodies 12 to 15 years after the second dose; although antibody levels may decrease over time, surveillance suggests that waning immunity with increased susceptibility does not occur.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^0e598356]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination — MMR vaccine is a live, attenuated virus recommended for all individuals without confirmed immunity to rubella. Vaccination should be administered before pregnancy and pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after the last dose; there is no confirmed instance of congenital malformation or significant intrauterine infection linked to MMR, and inadvertent administration during pregnancy is not an indication for pregnancy termination.

Measles postexposure prophylaxis with MMR vaccine — For vaccine eligible persons aged ≥ 12 months exposed to measles, administration of MMR vaccine is preferable to using immune globulin (IG) if administered within 72 hours of initial exposure, and MMR vaccine, if administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, might provide some protection or modify the clinical course of measles; if exposure does not cause infection, postexposure vaccination should induce protection against subsequent exposures, and if exposure results in infection, no evidence indicates that administration of MMR vaccine during the presymptomatic or prodromal stage of illness increases the risk for vaccine-associated adverse events; postexposure MMR vaccination does not prevent or alter the clinical severity of rubella or mumps and is not recommended.

Rubella clinical features and pregnancy risks — severe complications are uncommon, with thrombocytopenic purpura occurring in approximately one out of 3,000 cases and encephalitis in approximately one out of 6,000 cases; in pregnant women, infection, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriages, stillbirths, and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), with the risk for congenital infection and defects highest during the first 12 weeks of gestation, decreasing after the 12th week, and defects rare after the 20th week. Subclinical maternal rubella infection also can cause congenital malformations, and fetal infection without clinical signs of CRS can occur during any stage of pregnancy. Rubella reinfection can occur after wild type infection or after receiving 1 dose of vaccine; asymptomatic maternal reinfection has been considered to present minimal fetal risk (congenital infection < 10%), though isolated CRS has been reported following reinfection during the first 12 weeks of gestation, whereas CRS was not reported when reinfection occurred after 12 weeks gestation.

### Rubella and pregnancy: diagnosis, management and outcomes [^c7ad3205]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

Rubella is a mild viral disease that typically occurs in childhood. Rubella infection during pregnancy causes congenital rubella syndrome, including the classic triad of cataracts, cardiac abnormalities and sensorineural deafness. Highly effective vaccines have been developed since 1969, and vaccination campaigns have been established in many countries. Although there has been progress, the prevention and diagnosis of rubella remain problematic. This article reviews the implications and management of rubella during pregnancy.

### Prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, and mumps, 2013: summary recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^464bfd2b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This report is a compendium of all current recommendations for the prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and mumps. The report presents the recent revisions adopted by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on October 24, 2012, and also summarizes all existing ACIP recommendations that have been published previously during 1998–2011 (CDC. Measles, mumps, and rubella — vaccine use and strategies for elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome and control of mumps: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1998;47[No. RR-8]; CDC. Revised ACIP recommendation for avoiding pregnancy after receiving a rubellacontaining vaccine. MMWR 2001;50:1117; CDC. Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] for the control and elimination of mumps. MMWR 2006;55:629–30; and, CDC. Immunization of healthcare personnel: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR 2011;60[No. RR-7]). Currently, ACIP recommends 2 doses of MMR vaccine routinely for children with the first dose administered at age 12 through 15 months and the second dose administered at age 4 through 6 years before school entry. Two doses are recommended for adults at high risk for exposure and transmission (e.g., students attending colleges or other post-high school educational institutions, healthcare personnel, and international travelers) and 1 dose for other adults aged ≥ 18 years. For prevention of rubella, 1 dose of MMR vaccine is recommended for persons aged ≥ 12 months. At the October 24, 2012 meeting, ACIP adopted the following revisions, which are published here for the first time. These included:

- For acceptable evidence of immunity, removing documentation of physician diagnosed disease as an acceptable criterion for evidence of immunity for measles and mumps, and including laboratory confirmation of disease as a criterion for acceptable evidence of immunity for measles, rubella, and mumps.
- For persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, expanding recommendations for vaccination to all persons aged ≥ 12 months with HIV infection who do not have evidence of current severe immunosuppression; recommending revaccination of persons with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated before establishment of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) with 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established; and changing the recommended timing of the 2 doses of MMR vaccine for HIV-infected persons to age 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years.
- For measles postexposure prophylaxis, expanding recommendations for use of immune globulin administered intramuscularly (IGIM) to include infants aged birth to 6 months exposed to measles; increasing the recommended dose of IGIM for immunocompetent persons; and recommending use of immune globulin administered intravenously (IGIV) for severely immunocompromised persons and pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity who are exposed to measles. As a compendium of all current recommendations for the prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and mumps, the information in this report is intended for use by clinicians as baseline guidance for scheduling of vaccinations for these conditions and considerations regarding vaccination of special populations. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information becomes available.

Mumps — acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity includes documentation of age-appropriate vaccination with a live mumps virus–containing vaccine, or laboratory evidence of immunity, or laboratory confirmation of disease, or being born before 1957. For routine vaccination, acceptable documentation is: preschool-aged children: 1 dose; school-aged children (grades k–12): 2 doses; and adults not at high risk: 1 dose. For students at post-high school educational institutions, health-care personnel, and international travelers, acceptable documentation includes vaccination with 2 doses of live mumps virus–containing vaccine or the laboratory-based alternatives; the second dose of measles- or mumps-containing vaccine should be administered no earlier than 28 days after the first dose.

Adult MMR vaccination — Adults born in 1957 or later should receive at least 1 dose of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine unless they have other acceptable evidence of immunity; however, persons who received measles vaccine of unknown type, inactivated measles vaccine, or further attenuated measles vaccine accompanied by IG or high-titer measles immune globulin should be considered unvaccinated and should be revaccinated with 1 or 2 doses of MMR vaccine; persons vaccinated before 1979 with either killed mumps vaccine or mumps vaccine of unknown type who are at high risk should be considered for revaccination with 2 doses of MMR vaccine; adults born before 1957 can be considered to have immunity to measles, rubella (except for women who could become pregnant), and mumps, but MMR vaccine (1 dose or 2 doses administered at least 28 days apart) can be administered to any person born before 1957 who does not have a contraindication; adults at increased risk for exposure or transmission who do not have evidence of immunity should receive special consideration for vaccination, and students, health-care personnel, and international travelers should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

### Rubella [^2b68d3ff]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Maternal rubella is now rare in many developed countries that have rubella vaccination programmes. However, in many developing countries congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) remains a major cause of developmental anomalies, particularly blindness and deafness. WHO have provided recommendations for prevention of CRS, and, encouragingly, the number of countries introducing rubella vaccination programmes has risen. However, declining uptake rates due to concerns about the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in the UK, and increasing numbers of cases in some European countries coupled with poor uptake rates might jeopardise this progress. Surveillance of postnatally and congenitally acquired infection is an essential component of CRS prevention since rubella is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds alone. Laboratory differentiation of rubella from other rash-causing infections, such as measles, parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus 6, and enteroviruses in developed countries, and various endemic arboviruses is essential. Reverse transcriptase PCR and sequencing for diagnosis and molecular epidemiological investigation and detection of rubella-specific IgG and IgM salivary antibody responses in oral fluid are now available.

### ACOG committee opinion: number 281, December 2002. rubella vaccination [^d90b6785]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The incidence of rubella decreased from 0.45 per 100,000 in 1990 to 0.1 per 100,000 in 1999. Although there is a nationwide shortage of rubella vaccine, women who are rubella susceptible during pregnancy should receive MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination postpartum. In October 2001, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed the recommendations concerning the pregnancy interval after receiving rubella vaccine. This interval has been reduced from 3 months to 1 month.

MMR/MMRV vaccination — pregnancy and post‑vaccination counseling. MMR vaccines should not be administered to women known to be pregnant or attempting to become pregnant, and women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after receipt of MMR vaccine; if the vaccine is inadvertently administered to a pregnant woman or a pregnancy occurs within 28 days of vaccination, she should be counseled about the theoretical risk to the fetus. The theoretical maximum risk for CRS after rubella RA 27/3 vaccine based on the 95% CI with 144 observations was estimated to be 2.6%, and the observed risk was 0%, with other reports documenting no cases of CRS among approximately 1,000 live‑born infants, including approximately 100 vaccinated within 1 week before to 4 weeks after conception. These figures are considerably lower than the ≥ 20% risk associated with wild rubella virus infection of mothers during the first trimester, and MMR vaccination during pregnancy should not be considered an indication for termination of pregnancy.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection — MMR vaccination without severe immunosuppression: Two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are recommended for persons aged ≥ 12 months with HIV infection who lack evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity and do not have evidence of severe immunosuppression; absence of severe immunosuppression is defined as CD4 percentages ≥ 15% for ≥ 6 months for persons aged ≤ 5 years and CD4 percentages ≥ 15% and CD4 count ≥ 200 lymphocytes/mm³ for ≥ 6 months for persons aged > 5 years. When CD4 percentages are not available for those aged ≤ 5 years, absence of severe immunosuppression can be based on age-specific CD4 counts for ≥ 6 months: CD4 count > 750 lymphocytes/mm³ while aged ≤ 12 months and CD4 count ≥ 500 lymphocytes/mm³ while aged 1 through 5 years; for those aged > 5 years, if only counts or only percentages are available, assessment can be based on the available CD4 values. The first dose should be administered at age 12 through 15 months and the second at age 4 through 6 years, or as early as 28 days after the first dose; older children and adults with newly diagnosed HIV infection without acceptable evidence of immunity should complete a 2-dose schedule as soon as possible after diagnosis unless they have evidence of severe immunosuppression, and MMRV vaccine should not be substituted for MMR vaccine.

Key points
- CDC recommends the collection and submission of samples for all suspected measles cases.
- Nasopharyngeal or throat swabs are preferred over urine specimens.
- Get information about collection, storage, and shipment of U. S. or international specimens. Types of tests Serology testing: Detection of specific IgM antibodies in a serum specimens collected within the first few days of rash onset can provide presumptive evidence of a current or recent measles virus infection. Serology uses serum specimens. Keep Reading: Measles Serology Testing Real-time RT-PCR: Detection of measles RNA in a clinical specimen can provide laboratory confirmation of infection. Real-time RT-PCR has the greatest diagnostic sensitivity when specimens are collected at first contact with a suspected case. Real-time RT-PCR uses nasopharyngeal, throat swabs, and urine specimens.

RT-PCR is available at many state public health laboratories and through the APHL/CDC Vaccine Preventable Disease Reference Centers. Keep Reading: Genetic Analysis of Measles Viruses. Specimen collection CDC's Infectious Diseases Laboratories provide guidance for various specimen collection, storage, and shipment, including for measles. Refer to the Infectious Diseases Laboratories Test Directory entry for each test. Preferred specimens CDC recommends that either a nasopharyngeal swab, throat swab, or urine specimen as well as a blood specimen be collected from all patients with clinical features compatible with measles. Nasopharyngeal or throat swabs are preferred over urine specimens. Submitting specimens In addition to the information found on the CDC Infectious Diseases Laboratories Test Directory entry for each test, follow the guidance below for specimen collection and shipping. The instructions also include points of contact for the tests.

Instructions for test types Serologic testing Collect the first serum specimen as soon as possible upon suspicion of measles disease. If the acute-phase serum specimen collected ≤ 3 days after rash onset is negative, and the case has a negative result for real-time RT-PCR, a second serum specimen collected 3–10 days after symptom onset is recommended. This is because the IgM response is not detectable in some cases until 3 days after symptom onset. Collect throat or nasopharyngeal swab specimens as soon as measles disease is suspected. rRT-PCR has the greatest diagnostic sensitivity when specimens are collected at first contact with a suspected case.

### Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination and management of obstetric-gynecologic patients during a measles outbreak [^2650db15]. ACOG (2024). High credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunization — population thresholds, high-risk groups, and immunity documentation are described: An estimated 92–95% of individuals in a community must be immune to prevent ongoing transmission, and measles infects approximately 9 out of every 10 susceptible individuals exposed in close-contact settings. Certain individuals, including unvaccinated and pregnant individuals, infants and children aged less than 5 years, and severely immunocompromised people are at increased risk of severe illness and complications. The best way to document immunity is to verify patients' vaccination records; because obtaining these records can be challenging, clinicians should offer MMR vaccine. If commercial immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody tests are used, be aware that these tests are not 100 percent sensitive and may fail to detect preexisting immunity.

For persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, expanding recommendations for vaccination to all persons aged ≥ 12 months with HIV infection who do not have evidence of current severe immunosuppression; recommending revaccination of persons with perinatal HIV infection who were vaccinated before establishment of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) with 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine once effective ART has been established; and changing the recommended timing of the 2 doses of MMR vaccine for HIV-infected persons to age 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years. For measles postexposure prophylaxis, expanding recommendations for use of immune globulin administered intramuscularly (IGIM) to include infants aged birth to 6 months exposed to measles; increasing the recommended dose of IGIM for immunocompetent persons; and recommending use of immune globulin administered intravenously (IGIV) for severely immunocompromised persons and pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity who are exposed to measles.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^a4334392]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) immunity and post-exposure management — health care workers should have documented immunity to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), with adequate proof of immunity consisting of documented vaccination (2 doses MMR, > 28 days apart with first dose after 1st birthday), laboratory documentation of protective titers, laboratory documentation of disease, or birth before 1957. In the setting of a measles, mumps or rubella outbreak, vaccination with two doses of MMR also is recommended for those born before 1957 who do not otherwise have evidence of immunity. MMR vaccine should not be administered during pregnancy and specific instructions should be provided regarding avoidance of conception for at least 3 months, and because it is a live virus vaccine, MMR should not be administered to individuals with severe immunosuppression. If inadvertent exposure occurs to an infected patient, non-immune health care workers should be furloughed from day 5 following first exposure until day 21 following last exposure for measles, from day 12 following first exposure until day 25 following last exposure for mumps, and from day 7 following first exposure until day 23 following last exposure for rubella (or seven days following onset of rash if the health care worker develops rubella).

### Routine MMR vaccination recommendations: for providers… [^95de2156]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Presumptive evidence of immunity can be established in any of the following ways:

- Written documentation of one or more dosesof a measles-containing vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschool-age children and adults not considered high risk
- Written documentation of two dosesof measles-containing vaccine for school-age children and adults at high risk, including students at post-high school secondary educational institutions, healthcare personnel, and international travelers. One dose of MMR vaccine, or other presumptive evidence of immunity, is sufficient for most adults. Providers generally do not need to actively screen adult patients for measles immunity in non-outbreak areas in the U. S. After vaccination, it is also not necessary to test patients for antibodies to confirm immunity. There is no recommendation for a catch-up program among adults for a second dose of MMR.

MMR vaccine, if administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, may provide some protection or modify the clinical course of disease. Immunoglobulin, if administered within six days of exposure, may also provide some protection or modify the clinical course of disease. For more information on measles outbreak control and post-exposure prophylaxis, healthcare providers should consult their health department and refer to the measles chapter of the. Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases. Presumptive evidence of immunity can be established in any of the following ways:

Measles elimination and postelimination epidemiology — measles was documented and verified as eliminated from the United States in 2000, with elimination defined as the absence of endemic transmission (i.e., interruption of continuous transmission lasting ≥ 12 months), and in 2002 measles was declared eliminated from the WHO Region of the Americas; an expert panel unanimously agreed in December 2011 that measles elimination has been maintained in the United States. From 2001 through 2011, a median of 63 measles cases (range: 37–220) and four outbreaks, defined as three or more cases linked in time or place (range: 2–17), were reported each year in the United States; of the 911 cases, 372 (41%) were importations, 804 (88%) were associated with importations, and 225 (25%) involved hospitalization, with two deaths reported. Among 162 cases reported from 2004 through 2008 among unvaccinated U.S. residents eligible for vaccination, 110 (68%) occurred in persons who declined vaccination because of a philosophical, religious, or personal objection.

### Guidelines for the documentation and verification of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome elimination in the region of the americas [^37ab1b15]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In the region of the Americas, goals for the elimination of endemic measles and rubella/congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) by the year 2000 and 2010, respectively were established. The successful implementation of measles elimination strategies in the region of the Americas resulted in the interruption of endemic measles transmission in 2002 and tremendous progress toward rubella and CRS elimination. In October 2007, the 27th Pan American Sanitary Conference adopted Resolution CSP27.R2 urging member states to begin documenting and verifying the interruption of endemic transmission of the measles and rubella viruses in the Americas. To ensure a standardized approach for the process of documentation and verification, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) developed a regional plan of action to guide countries and their national commissions as they prepare and consolidate evidence of the interruption of endemic measles and rubella transmission. This article summarizes the plan of action including the essential criteria and components of the guidelines.

### Prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, and mumps, 2013: summary recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^18d2053e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Evidence of immunity — general validation and serologic testing for measles, rubella, and mumps is defined as follows: Vaccine doses with written documentation of the date of administration at age ≥ 12 months are the only doses considered valid, and self-reported doses are not considered adequate evidence of immunity; persons who do not have documentation of adequate vaccination or other acceptable evidence should be vaccinated. Serologic screening before vaccination is not necessary and not recommended if a person has other acceptable evidence of immunity, and postvaccination serologic testing to verify an immune response is not recommended. Documented age-appropriate vaccination supersedes the results of subsequent serologic testing. If a person who has 2 documented doses of measles- or mumps-containing vaccines has negative or equivocal titers, it is not recommended that the person receive an additional dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and such persons should be considered to have presumptive evidence of immunity. For rubella, if a person who has 1 dose has negative or equivocal rubella titers, it is not recommended that the person receive an additional MMR dose, except for women of childbearing age; women of childbearing age who have 1 or 2 documented doses and rubella-specific IgG levels that are not clearly positive should be administered 1 additional dose of MMR vaccine (maximum of 3 doses) and do not need to be retested for serologic evidence of rubella immunity.

### Are boosters necessary If adult patients Do not achieve seroconversion after 2 doses of the MMR vaccine? [^16cd90da]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend 2 documented doses of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine for adequate measles, mumps, and rubella immunity for all children and most adults. Sometimes, individuals are asked to provide serologic proof of immunity to measles, mumps, and/or rubella for educational or employment purposes. In other instances, serologic testing may be used to help clarify whether an individual has immunity to measles, mumps, and/or rubella. These serologic tests may sometimes show negative or equivocal antibody titers to measles, mumps and/or rubella, raising the question of adequate immunity. This report provides practical guidance for clinicians on when to use serologic testing to determine measles, mumps, and rubella immunity.

Introduction

Measles, a single-stranded, RNA respiratory tract virus commonly found in children, is one of the most contagious disease of humans, especially in children. Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963, major epidemics occurred every 2–3 years with an estimated 30 million cases and more than 2 million deaths occurring globally each year due to measles, and more than 95% of individuals had been infected with measles virus by the age of 15 years. Similarly, Rubella virus is generally recognized as the most common infectious cause of birth defects, accounting for an estimated 100,000 infants born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) each year worldwide. For both these diseases, the primary strategy for prevention is vaccination.

While the average return on investment (ROI) from the childhood vaccination program with WHO recommended antigens is 44 times the cost of these programs, the highest returns are associated with averting measles, at 58 times the cost through two routine immunization doses. Additionally, the ROI is 2.02 times for rubella. The Immunization Agenda 2030 identifies measles vaccination coverage and incidence recorded by surveillance as tracer indicators to identify communities and population groups that are un- or under immunized. Measles vaccination coverage is also an important indicator for attaining the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.2 which specifically says, "By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborn babies and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births". Measles and rubella elimination and the entire immunization program is expected to have a positive impact on 14 out of the 17 SDGs.

Measles susceptibility in infants — maternal antibody dynamics and seroepidemiology show that infants are typically protected at birth by passively acquired maternal antibodies, with duration dependent on the amount transferred; women with vaccine-derived measles immunity have lower antibody titers and transfer shorter term protection than women who had measles disease. Although foreign-born mothers accounted for 23% of all births in 2010, the majority of U.S. women of childbearing age now have vaccine-derived immunity, and infants born now are more likely to be susceptible to measles at a younger age. Seroepidemiologic studies indicate that 7% of infants in the United States might lack antimeasles antibodies at birth and up to 90% might be seronegative by age 6 months.

### The importance of MMR immunization in the United States [^41ca13ce]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite the established safety and efficacy of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine after almost 50 years of widespread use, the United States is encountering higher levels of measles and mumps disease than has occurred for years. Return of disease threatens the health of those who remain unimmunized by choice as well as those who are immunized appropriately but experience loss of vaccine-induced immunity. The solution to continued threats of illness caused by these untreatable but readily preventable diseases is compliance with recommendations for administration of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Here we examine trends in the epidemiology of measles, mumps, and rubella in recent years and consider the consequences of loss of protective immunity within our country.

### Progress toward rubella elimination-World Health Organization European region, 2005–2019 [^8de428d2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2005, the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (EUR) passed a resolution calling for the regional elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). In 2010, all 53 countries in EUR * reaffirmed their commitment to eliminating measles, rubella, and CRS; this goal was included in the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020. Rubella, which typically manifests as a mild febrile rash illness, is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or a constellation of malformations known as CRS, which usually includes one or more visual, auditory, or cardiac defects. The WHO-recommended measles and rubella elimination strategies in EUR include 1) achieving and maintaining ≥ 95% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine (MRCV) through routine immunization services; 2) providing measles and rubella vaccination opportunities, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), to populations susceptible to measles or rubella; 3) strengthening surveillance by conducting case investigations and confirming suspected cases and outbreaks with laboratory results; and 4) improving the availability and use of evidence to clearly communicate the benefits and risks of preventing these diseases through vaccination to health professionals and the public. This report updates a previous report and describes progress toward rubella and CRS elimination in EUR during 2005–2019. In 2000, estimated coverage with the first dose of a rubella-containing vaccine (RCV1) in EUR was 60%, and 621,039 rubella cases were reported (incidence = 716.9 per 1 million population). During 2005–2019, estimated regional coverage with RCV1 was 93%–95%, and in 2019, 31 (58%) countries achieved ≥ 95% coverage with the RCV1. During 2005–2019, approximately 38 million persons received an RCV during SIAs in 20 (37%) countries. Rubella incidence declined by > 99%, from 234.9 cases per 1 million population (206,359 cases) in 2005 to 0.67 cases per 1 million population (620 cases) by 2019. CRS cases declined by 50%, from 16 cases in 2005 to eight cases in 2019. For rubella and CRS elimination in EUR to be achieved and maintained, measures are needed to strengthen immunization programs by ensuring high coverage with an RCV in every district of each country, offering supplementary rubella vaccination to susceptible adults, maintaining high-quality surveillance for rapid case detection and confirmation, and ensuring effective outbreak preparedness and response.

Measles — acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity by population includes the following options: documentation of age-appropriate vaccination with a live measles virus–containing vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or birth before 1957. For routine vaccination, acceptable documentation is: preschool-aged children: 1 dose; school-aged children (grades k–12): 2 doses; and adults not at high risk: 1 dose. For students at post-high school educational institutions and for health-care personnel, acceptable documentation includes 2 doses of live measles virus–containing vaccine, or laboratory evidence of immunity, or laboratory confirmation of disease, or being born before 1957; for unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence or confirmation, health-care facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval. For international travelers, acceptable documentation includes age-appropriate vaccination with a live measles virus–containing vaccine — infants aged 6–11 months: 1 dose and persons aged ≥ 12 months: 2 doses — or laboratory evidence of immunity, or laboratory confirmation of disease, or being born before 1957; the first dose of MMR vaccine should be administered at age ≥ 12 months and the second dose of measles- or mumps-containing vaccine should be administered no earlier than 28 days after the first dose.

### Measles and rubella elimination initiatives in the americas: lessons learned and best practices [^4e3d11a1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Countries in the World Health Organization Region of the Americas successfully interrupted endemic measles virus transmission 8 years after setting a regional measles elimination goal and have sustained this achievement since 2002. The vast experience from the region clearly demonstrates that measles elimination can be accomplished and maintained over time. This brief report summarizes the lessons learned and the best practices that evolved in the Americas during 3 measles elimination phases (ie, preelimination, elimination, and postelimination phases), as well as the contribution of rubella elimination to strengthening and maintaining measles elimination. The effective measures that have been implemented and adapted by the countries of the Americas to eliminate endemic measles and rubella will serve as an example to other countries and regions embarking on this endeavor.

Immune response to mumps vaccination — serologic and cellular observations: approximately 94% of infants and children develop detectable mumps antibodies after 1 dose of mumps vaccine (range: 89%–97%). Among persons who received a second dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, most mounted a secondary response; approximately 50% had a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titers, and the proportion with low or undetectable titers was significantly reduced from 20% before the second dose to 4% at 6 months post vaccination. Vaccination induces relatively low antibody levels compared with natural infection, and no serologic tests are available for mumps that consistently and reliably predict immunity.

Rubella vaccine is usually given in combination with measles and mumps vaccines as a measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Because it contains live attenuated virus, its use is contraindicated during pregnancy. However, since the introduction of rubella vaccine, no cases of congenital rubella syndrome have been reported following vaccination during pregnancy. We report a case of a female infant, born to a woman inadvertently vaccinated with measles-mumps-rubella vaccination early in pregnancy, who manifested a phenotype of cardiac and neurologic defects, neurodevelopmental delay, and lymphocytopenia consistent with congenital rubella syndrome.

For personnel with 2 documented doses of measles‑ and mumps‑ containing vaccine and other acceptable evidence of immunity, serologic testing is not recommended; if such personnel are tested and have negative or equivocal titers for measles or mumps, an additional MMR dose is not recommended and they should be considered to have acceptable evidence of immunity with no retesting. Similarly, except for women of childbearing age, those with one documented dose of rubella‑containing vaccine and negative or equivocal rubella titers should not receive an additional MMR dose and should be considered to have acceptable evidence of rubella immunity.

### Measles in the 21st century: progress toward achieving and sustaining elimination [^b72ef56b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

MMR vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy owing to theoretical concerns of fetal harm including congenital rubella syndrome. Nevertheless, a systematic review of vaccines given to pregnant women found that among 4918 pregnant women who inadvertently received MMR vaccine while pregnant, no cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported [49]. Similarly, a safety review of 131 reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System of MMR vaccine administered to pregnant women found that most vaccines were given to women early in pregnancy (when they were unaware of their pregnancy), and in the majority of reports, no adverse events were reported [50]. The highly favorable safety profile of MCV has been an essential component of the global measles eradication strategy.

Introduction

Rubella is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Rubella virus infection usually produces a mild febrile rash illness in children and adults. However, infection during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Caring for CRS cases is costly, and rubella vaccination has been shown to be cost-effective in high- and middle-income countries. However, no similar studies have been conducted in low-income countries in Africa or Asia. A single dose of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) can provide lifelong protection against rubella. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011–2020 * included a target to achieve rubella elimination in at least five of the six WHO regions by 2020, and the WHO Immunization Agenda 2030 † includes rubella elimination as a critical impact goal.

During 2000–2022, the number of countries that included RCV in their childhood immunization schedules increased from 99 (52%) of 191 in 2000 to 175 (90%) of 194 in 2022. However, the 2020 WHO Rubella Vaccine Position Paper maintained WHO's 2011 recommendation that countries planning to introduce RCV into their immunization programs should have attained ≥ 80% coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) § through routine vaccination or ≥ 80% coverage with an MCV dose through supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). The rationale for the 80% coverage threshold is to avoid suboptimal RCV postintroduction vaccination coverage, which would have the effect of reducing, but not eliminating, rubella transmission; shifting the age of infection to older children, adolescents, and young adults who were not immune; increasing the interval between rubella outbreaks; and increasing the risk for rubella infection among nonimmune women of childbearing age, potentially leading to a paradoxical increase in cases of CRS compared with the prevaccine rubella epidemiology. Any change to the 80% coverage requirement would require recommendation by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, the principal independent advisory group to WHO for vaccines.

ACIP 2013 measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination — postpartum and IG: MMR vaccine should be administered to persons who have received an IG preparation only after the recommended intervals have elapsed, but postpartum administration to women who lack presumptive evidence of immunity to rubella should not be delayed because anti-Rho(D) IG (human) or any other blood product were received during the last trimester of pregnancy or at delivery. These women should be vaccinated immediately after delivery and tested at least 3 months later to ensure that they have presumptive evidence of immunity to rubella and measles.

### Progress toward control of rubella and prevention of congenital rubella syndrome – worldwide, 2009 [^25851a19]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Rubella, usually a mild rash illness in children and adults, can cause serious consequences when a pregnant woman is infected, particularly in early pregnancy. These serious consequences include miscarriage, fetal death or an infant born with birth defects (i.e., congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)). The primary purpose for rubella vaccination is the prevention of congenital rubella infection including CRS. Since 1969, several rubella virus vaccines have been licensed for use; however, until the 1990s, use of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) was limited primarily to developed countries. In 1996, it was estimated that 110,000 infants with CRS were born annually in developing countries. In 2000, the first World Health Organization rubella vaccine position paper was published to guide introduction of RCV in national childhood immunization schedules. From 1996 to 2009, the number of countries that introduced RCV into their national routine childhood immunization programs increased by 57% from 83 countries in 1996 to 130 countries in 2009. In addition, three of the six WHO regions established rubella control and CRS prevention goals: Region of the Americas and Europe rubella elimination by 2010 and 2015, respectively, and Western Pacific Region-accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention by 2015. Also, during this time period, the number of rubella cases reported decreased from 670,894 in 2000 to 121,344 in 2009. Rubella control and prevention of CRS can be accelerated by integrating with current global measles mortality reduction and regional elimination activities.

### Progress toward rubella elimination-World Health Organization European region, 2005–2019 [^dab3a76e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2005, the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (EUR) passed a resolution calling for the regional elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) (1). In 2010, all 53 countries in EUR* reaffirmed their commitment to eliminating measles, rubella, and CRS (2); this goal was included in the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020 (3,4). Rubella, which typically manifests as a mild febrile rash illness, is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or a constellation of malformations known as CRS, which usually includes one or more visual, auditory, or cardiac defects (5). The WHO-recommended measles and rubella elimination strategies in EUR include 1) achieving and maintaining ≥ 95% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine (MRCV) through routine immunization services; 2) providing measles and rubella vaccination opportunities, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), to populations susceptible to measles or rubella; 3) strengthening surveillance by conducting case investigations and confirming suspected cases and outbreaks with laboratory results; and 4) improving the availability and use of evidence to clearly communicate the benefits and risks of preventing these diseases through vaccination to health professionals and the public (6). This report updates a previous report and describes progress toward rubella and CRS elimination in EUR during 2005–2019 (7). In 2000, estimated coverage with the first dose of a rubella-containing vaccine (RCV1) in EUR was 60%, and 621,039 rubella cases were reported (incidence = 716.9 per 1 million population). During 2005–2019, estimated regional coverage with RCV1 was 93%-95%, and in 2019, 31 (58%) countries achieved ≥ 95% coverage with the RCV1. During 2005–2019, approximately 38 million persons received an RCV during SIAs in 20 (37%) countries. Rubella incidence declined by > 99%, from 234.9 cases per 1 million population (206,359 cases) in 2005 to 0.67 cases per 1 million population (620 cases) by 2019. CRS cases declined by 50%, from 16 cases in 2005 to eight cases in 2019. For rubella and CRS elimination in EUR to be achieved and maintained, measures are needed to strengthen immunization programs by ensuring high coverage with an RCV in every district of each country, offering supplementary rubella vaccination to susceptible adults, maintaining high-quality surveillance for rapid case detection and confirmation, and ensuring effective outbreak preparedness and response.

### Notes from the field: measles-California, January 1-April 18, 2014 [^64bab696]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Fifty-two of the 58 cases were confirmed by laboratory testing (44 by polymerase chain reaction and eight by immunoglobulin M), and six were confirmed by epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed case. Genotypes identified were B3 (32 patients), the measles genotype currently circulating in the Philippines, and D8 (seven patients). Five of the seven patients with D8 genotype reported international travel; the remaining two patients with D8 genotype were epidemiologically linked to the imported cases. Genotyping is pending for two of the four cases with unknown source of infection.

Most of the 58 patients were either unvaccinated (25 [43%]) or had no vaccination documentation available (18 [31%]). Of the 25 patients who were known to be unvaccinated, 19 (76%) had philosophical objections to vaccination, three (12%) were too young (aged ≤ 12 months) for routine vaccination, and three (12%) were unvaccinated for unknown reasons. Eleven (19%) patients had documentation of 2 or more valid doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, including two children and nine adults. Three health-care personnel had documentation of serologic evidence of immunity before exposure, and one additional patient was found to have serologic evidence of immunity when tested as part of a contact investigation before symptom onset.

All persons who were exposed during travel were old enough to have received vaccination before travel (infants traveling to areas with endemic measles can be vaccinated at age 6–11 months). Five of the six unvaccinated travelers were unvaccinated because of philosophical objections; among these, one was not eligible to receive MMR vaccine at the time of travel because of pregnancy. Six adults had no vaccine documentation available, and one had received 2 valid doses.

In the United States, during January 1–April 18, 2014, a total of 129 cases of measles were reported, the highest number reported for this period since 1996. Among the cases were 34 importations, including 17 in travelers to and from the Philippines. The Philippines has been experiencing an explosive outbreak of measles, with approximately 20,000 confirmed or suspected cases reported during January 1–February 28 and 69 confirmed deaths. The increase in importations from this outbreak and subsequent transmission in certain settings in the United States highlights the importance of ensuring age-appropriate vaccination for persons traveling to areas where measles is endemic and maintaining high vaccination coverage at the national and local level.

### Prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, and mumps, 2013: summary recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^b0e5a577]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Evidence of measles immunity — presumptive criteria and vaccination by group include documentation of adequate vaccination for measles at age ≥ 12 months, laboratory evidence of measles immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or birth before 1957. Adequate vaccination for preschool-aged children (i.e., aged ≥ 12 months) and adults not at high risk is documentation of at least 1 dose of live measles virus-containing vaccine. For school-aged children in kindergarten through grade 12, students at post-high school educational institutions, health-care personnel, and international travelers, adequate vaccination is documentation of 2 doses of live measles virus-containing vaccine separated by at least 28 days. For infants aged 6 through 11 months before international travel, adequate vaccination is 1 dose of live measles virus-containing vaccine. Measles-specific IgG detectable by any commonly used serologic assay is adequate laboratory evidence of measles immunity, whereas equivocal serologic test results do not constitute adequate presumptive evidence and such persons should be considered susceptible unless other evidence or subsequent testing indicates immunity.

### Progress in rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-worldwide, 2000–2016 [^d99cae17]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Although rubella virus infection usually causes a mild fever and rash illness in children and adults, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or infants with a constellation of congenital malformations known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella is a leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Preventing these adverse pregnancy outcomes is the focus of rubella vaccination programs. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated guidance on the preferred strategy for introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into national immunization schedules and recommended an initial vaccination campaign, usually targeting children aged 9 months–14 years. The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011–2020 (GVAP), endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012, includes goals to eliminate rubella in at least five of the six WHO regions by 2020. This report updates a previous report and summarizes global progress toward rubella and CRS control and elimination from 2000 to 2016. As of December 2016, 152 (78%) of 194 countries had introduced RCV into the national immunization schedule, representing an increase of 53 countries since 2000, including 20 countries that introduced RCV after 2012.

Reported rubella cases declined 97%, from 2000 (670,894 cases in 102 countries) to 2016 (22,361 cases in 165 countries). The Region of the Americas has achieved rubella and CRS elimination (verified in 2015). Rubella and CRS elimination goals have been set by the European Region (target date: 2015) and Western Pacific Region (target date to be determined), whereas the South-East Asia Region has a rubella and CRS control target. Neither the African Region nor the Eastern Mediterranean Region has set regional rubella goals or targets. To achieve the 2020 GVAP rubella elimination goals, RCV introduction needs to continue when country criteria indicating readiness for introduction are met, and rubella and CRS surveillance needs to be strengthened to ensure that progress toward elimination targets are measured. Because rubella cases are detected through measles surveillance, and because rubella vaccine is usually delivered as a combined measles-rubella vaccine, elimination activities for both diseases are programmatically linked, and measles elimination activities can be leveraged to support rubella elimination.

### Rubella eradication: not yet accomplished, but entirely feasible [^5b89185e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

HISTORY OF RUBELLA VACCINATION PROGRAM STRATEGIES

In 1969, several rubella vaccines were licensed; however, there was no consensus internationally as to which groups to target for vaccination. The 2 basic approaches were (1) universal vaccination (targeting children) or (2) selective vaccination of susceptible adolescent girls and women of childbearing age. The universal approach was designed to interrupt transmission of the virus by vaccinating the reservoir of infection in children, thus reducing the overall risk of infection in adults and providing indirect protection of unvaccinated, postpubertal women. The selective vaccination of women directly protects women at risk of being infected when pregnant, but allows virus to circulate and thus boost vaccine-induced immunity in the population. Countries using the selective vaccination approach were unsuccessful because of the inability to immunize a sufficient proportion of the female population. With this approach, large-scale epidemics continued to occur, and the incidence of CRS did not decline significantly. In addition, countries that set goals to eliminate rubella could not achieve it through the selective vaccination approach. After 20 years of experience, it is clear that the integration of the 2 approaches, vaccination of children and adults, is necessary for maximum control. In 2011, after reviewing the successes with RCVs through mass vaccination in the PAHO and other regions, the WHO rubella vaccine recommendations were updated. Countries that had not introduced rubella vaccination were recommended to take the opportunity offered by measles accelerated control and elimination to introduce rubella vaccine. There are 2 approaches to the introduction of rubella vaccine: (1) universal vaccination, or (2) selective vaccination of women and adolescent girls. The preferred approach for introduction of rubella vaccination is to begin with a campaign targeting a wide range of ages (usually 9 months to 15 years) of both males and females together with an immediate introduction of MR/MMR vaccine into the routine vaccination of infants. In 2020, the WHO updated its guidance for rubella vaccine introduction to recommend that routine vaccination of infants should be the primary focus, with an introductory wide age range campaign (usually 9 months to 14 years).

On October 18, 2001, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed data from several sources indicating that no cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) had been identified among infants born to women who were vaccinated inadvertently against rubella within 3 months or early in pregnancy. On the basis of these data, ACIP shortened its recommended period to avoid pregnancy after receipt of rubella-containing vaccine from 3 months to 28 days.

On May 17, 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated criteria for mumps immunity and mumps vaccination recommendations. According to the 1998 ACIP recommendations for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, for routine vaccination, a first dose of MMR vaccine is recommended at ages 12–15 months and a second dose at ages 4–6 years. Two doses of MMR vaccine also are recommended for students attending colleges and other post-high school institutions. However, documentation of mumps immunity through vaccination has consisted of only 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine for all designated groups, including health-care workers.

### Notes from the field: rubella infection in an unvaccinated pregnant woman-Johnson county, Kansas, December 2017 [^41beb16b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Rubella infection in pregnancy can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which is characterized by low birthweight and birth defects including deafness, cataracts, heart defects, and intellectual disabilities. The severity and nature of defects depend upon the gestational age of the fetus at the time of infection. The risk for CRS ranges from 10%–90% and is highest when infection occurs during the first trimester. Endemic transmission of rubella was eliminated in the United States in 2004 as a result of high levels of coverage with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR).

An obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancies followed the patient for the remainder of her pregnancy. All follow-up testing was negative, and the patient delivered a full-term, apparently normal, infant in May. Echocardiogram, skeletal survey, head ultrasound, hearing, and eye exams were normal. The infant's initial rubella IgM was positive, and two sets of nasopharyngeal and urine specimens, obtained 30 days apart, were negative for rubella RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Until negative results for rubella virus were received, the infant was considered infectious. Based on test results and the absence of congenital defects, indications are that this infant meets the criteria for congenital rubella infection and not CRS. The infant will continue to be followed by an infectious disease specialist.

This case highlights several important points. Per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations, health care institutions should ensure that all persons working in health care facilities have documentation of adequate vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella or evidence of immunity; the hospital staff member who was excluded received the MMR vaccine before returning to work. Health care providers should routinely assess women of childbearing age for evidence of rubella immunity (IgG antibodies) and recommend vaccination when appropriate. Pregnant women testing negative for rubella immunity should be vaccinated immediately after delivery; this case represents a missed opportunity for rubella vaccination after the birth of the patient's first child. When a pregnant woman develops a rash illness, providers should ask about international travel for both the patient and her contacts. Finally, more emphasis and education are required for health care providers on the importance of timely reporting of suspected vaccine-preventable diseases.

Rubella serologic diagnosis and timing — acute infection can be serologically confirmed by documenting seroconversion to IgM and/or IgG positivity or a 4-fold rise in anti-rubella IgG between acute and convalescent sera; only approximately 50% of patients are IgM positive at rash onset, so acute phase serum should be collected upon presentation and again 14–21 days (minimum of 7 days) later. Due to the rarity in the United States and the thus low pre-test probability of infection, serologic evaluation should only be performed in patients with appropriate exposures risks and a clinical presentation highly suggestive of acute rubella; in patients not meeting these criteria, positive rubella IgM results should be interpreted with caution as they may be falsely positive.

MMR/MMRV vaccination — precautions, blood products, and tuberculin testing. Precautions include recent (≤ 11 months) receipt of an antibody‑containing blood product, concurrent moderate or severe illness with or without fever, history of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenic purpura, and tuberculin skin testing; if a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or at least 4–6 weeks after administration of MMR or MMRV vaccine. An additional precaution for MMRV includes persons with a personal or family history of seizures of any etiology. Receipt of antibody‑containing blood products might interfere with the serologic response to measles and rubella vaccine for variable periods depending on the dose of IG administered, and the effect of IG‑containing preparations on the response to mumps vaccine is unknown.

Rubella is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects. Rubella infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or CRS, a constellation of congenital malformations, frequently including visual, auditory, or cardiac defects. CRS is a cause of mortality among infants and children and a shortened lifespan among adults. Rubella and measles elimination activities are programmatically linked because RCV is administered as a combined measles and rubella vaccine, and rubella cases are detected through case-based surveillance for measles or fever and rash illness. The WHO SEAR-recommended strategies to achieve rubella elimination include 1) achieving and maintaining ≥ 95% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine in every district through routine immunization or SIAs; 2) developing and sustaining a sensitive and timely case-based surveillance system for rubella and sentinel site surveillance for CRS that meets recommended performance indicators; 3) developing and maintaining an accredited laboratory network; 4) achieving timely identification, investigation, and response to rubella outbreaks; and 5) linking with other public health initiatives to achieve the first four strategies.

Because the effect of live virus vaccination on tuberculosis interferon-gamma release assay (IGRAs) has not been studied, IGRA testing in the context of live virus vaccine administration should be done either on the same day as vaccination with live-virus vaccine or 4–6 weeks after the administration of the live-virus vaccine.

### Phylogenetic analysis of congenital rubella virus from Indonesia: a case report [^abe38a8c]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of CRS in this study was made relatively late. Studies showed that most laboratory-confirmed CRS cases were diagnosed among cases who were 0- < 6 months of age which contradicts the late presentation of our patient. In Indonesia, the diagnosis of CRS relies on serological testing, which is less sensitive. Serological testing presents only indirect indicators of infection and may be misleading due to delayed antibody production and false-positive results. For CRS diagnosis, nested RT-PCR is a promising method with a more sensitive and rapid technique than the conventional method of virus isolation and serology. However, in a developing country such as Indonesia, the health system is not equally accessed by all members of the society. In this low-resource setting, there are inequalities in access to health care due to the diversity in geographical areas of Indonesia, health insurance coverage, education levels, and economic background.

In all of the cases reported in this study, the mothers of the patients were unaware of the symptoms of rubella infection during pregnancy due to the mild symptoms of a rubella infection such as fever, rash, cough, and adenopathy, which are usually considered as common ailments. Therefore, the diagnosis of rubella infection in pregnancy is very difficult. For developing countries such as Indonesia, with uncontrolled rubella infection rates, a higher vigilance is needed by: (1) serological testing for pregnant women with similar symptoms, (2) rubella vaccination in women of reproductive age before planning a pregnancy, and (3) increasing coverage of rubella vaccination in Indonesia.

The challenge of eliminating congenital rubella syndrome is also more significant than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Several immunization programs have declined due to parents' fear of coming to health service providers, including the hospital. The decline in the measles-rubella vaccination coverage is likely to increase their mortality and morbidity. The pandemic also slowed the implementation of measles and rubella mass vaccination campaigns in many regions and delayed various monitoring and evaluation activities. According to UNICEF and the WHO, many children in remote areas do not receive the first dose of a measles-containing vaccine as part of the routine immunization program each year. As the national coverage in the scheduled COVID-19 vaccinations has increased, a more complete immunization program is slowly emerging and reestablishing the public health platforms needed to meet the goals of disease control and eradication.

### Progress toward rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-worldwide, 2012–2020 [^935c5582]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Progress toward rubella elimination has accelerated since 2012, and in 2020, rubella elimination had been verified in approximately one half of the countries in the world. The considerable progress made toward elimination has been driven by the establishment of regional WHO rubella elimination goals, an increase in commitment to elimination by countries, and the availability of financial support from global partners for RCV introduction.

Progress is reflected in an increase in the number of countries introducing RCV into national childhood immunization schedules and the coverage achieved. From 2012 to 2020, the number of countries that have introduced RCV increased from 132 to 173, and global coverage increased from 40% to 70%. Although vaccine availability increased, as more low-income countries and lower middle-income countries have introduced RCV, coverage estimates continue to reflect barriers to access in lower-income groups; however, coverage declined only one percentage point from 2019 to 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Progress has also been reflected in the decline in reported rubella cases, including a 48% decrease during 2012–2019, with a further decrease in 2020. The extent to which rubella transmission declined in 2020 is unclear, however, because fewer reported cases might reflect the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures or an underreporting of cases in 2020 because of reductions in health care–seeking behavior from patients, health facility availability and reporting, or overall pandemic-related health system disruptions. The increase in the number of reported CRS cases during 2012–2020 reflects improved surveillance in several populous countries that initiated CRS surveillance after 2012, rather than an increase in rubella among susceptible pregnant women and CRS in their infants. The Measles and Rubella Strategic Framework 2021–2030 outlines potential actions to improve surveillance, including strengthening comprehensive surveillance supported by laboratory networks; promoting training of health workers in early detection, notification and investigation of cases using standardized definitions, tools, and templates for collecting data; and supplementing routine data collection with serosurveys to identify immunity gaps.

The importance of high MMR vaccination rates

Another important reason for maintaining high MMR vaccination rates in the population is for protection against mumps and rubella. The latter is particularly important for pregnant women because of congenital rubella syndrome which is now extremely rare because of widespread MMR vaccination worldwide. It has been however previously associated with high rates of congenital defects, miscarriage and fetal death in the pre-vaccine era, especially if infection occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. In England, 0–3 cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported annually before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Much of the national and international effort is rightly targeted towards improving vaccine uptake in young children eligible for MMR vaccination through the national immunisation programme, alongside mass immunisation campaigns, catch-up programmes and opportunistic vaccination of unvaccinated older children and young adults. However, little attention is focussed on the risks and complications of measles infection in pregnancy. In the current environment of high measles transmission in many countries, healthcare professionals in the community and hospitals should take every opportunity to ascertain a clear and detailed immunisation history, establish a dialogue, address concerns, and offer vaccination to those who remain unimmunised, especially against measles and rubella among adolescents and women of childbearing age, with the aim of reducing their risk of acquiring measles infection during pregnancy.

### Global progress toward rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-2000-2014 [^ee0dedbc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Rubella virus usually causes a mild fever and rash in children and adults. However, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of congenital malformations known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated guidance on the preferred strategy for introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into national routine immunization schedules, including an initial vaccination campaign usually targeting children aged 9 months-15 years. The Global Vaccine Action Plan endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012 and the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan (2012–2020) published by Measles and Rubella Initiative partners in 2012 both include goals to eliminate rubella and CRS in at least two WHO regions by 2015, and at least five WHO regions by 2020 (2,3). This report updates a previous report and summarizes global progress toward rubella and CRS control and elimination during 2000–2014. As of December 2014, RCV had been introduced in 140 (72%) countries, an increase from 99 (51%) countries in 2000 (for this report, WHO member states are referred to as countries). Reported rubella cases declined 95%, from 670,894 cases in 102 countries in 2000 to 33,068 cases in 162 countries in 2014, although reporting is inconsistent. To achieve the 2020 Global Vaccine Action Plan rubella and CRS elimination goals, RCV introduction needs to continue as country criteria indicating readiness are met, and rubella and CRS surveillance need to be strengthened to ensure that progress toward elimination can be measured.

### Benefits and challenges in using seroprevalence data to inform models for measles and rubella elimination [^9277b73b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Because natural and vaccine-derived immunity cannot be distinguished, interpreting serological data requires accounting for historical changes in disease incidence and vaccination coverage (achieved both through routine services and SIAs), as we illustrate in this paper. We first delineate expectations for age-specific immunity profiles across a spectrum from endemicity to elimination. We describe how inferring immunity profiles from vaccination coverage data and/or reported case data (the current method used by most countries) can result in biases, showing the potential added value of serology. We then describe how serology can be used to address 2 key questions for the control and elimination of measles and rubella: (1) what are the most effective vaccination strategies to control and eliminate infection, and (2) how effective are current vaccination programs? We conclude by discussing challenges of serological surveys and provide suggestions for improving their feasibility and sustainability.

### Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control and elimination-global progress, 2000–2012 [^6eec7805]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Outbreaks in EUR and WPR indicate that while control and elimination activities are ongoing, some member states within these regions are at risk for large outbreaks. Initiation of CRS control activities focused on vaccinating girls and women, which decreased rubella virus transmission but resulted in a large proportion of susceptible persons, especially males. A large population susceptible to rubella infection (primarily males) has a high risk for outbreak and transmission of rubella virus to unvaccinated pregnant women. Surveillance for rubella infection benefits from integration with measles surveillance systems, but additional effort is required to strengthen the system to ensure that febrile rash illness cases reported in pregnant women or their immediate contacts are fully investigated, including ascertaining pregnancy outcome. Surveillance to detect CRS is needed to monitor the impact of vaccination.

What is already known on this topic?

Rubella virus infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all member states introduce rubella-containing vaccines (RCVs) to control rubella and CRS. The World Health Assembly has set two goals: rubella elimination in two WHO regions by 2015 and measles and rubella elimination in five WHO regions by 2020.

What is added by this report?

The number of countries using RCVs in their immunization program and reporting rubella and CRS surveillance data has steadily increased from 2000 to 2012. As of December 2012, a total of 132 (68%) WHO member states had introduced RCV, a 33% increase from 99 member states in 2000. A total of 94,030 rubella cases were reported to WHO in 2012 from 174 member states, an 86% decrease from the 670,894 cases reported in 2000 from 102 member states.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Near elimination of rubella and CRS in the Americas proves that the tools exist to make elimination possible, and substantial progress is being made globally. However, gaps in surveillance limit the ability to monitor progress toward elimination, and recent outbreaks in Europe and Asia demonstrate the need for sustained, high-quality immunization programs.

*Introductory campaigns and introduction of the vaccine into the routine schedule can occur in different years, with introduction recommended to occur immediately following the campaign.

† Values > 100% indicate that the intervention reached more persons than the estimated target population.

Routine administration of RCV is recommended with the first routine dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) (i.e. as a combination vaccine or simultaneously, at the same visit); this recommendation has been implemented in 144 (95%) of the 152 countries that have introduced the vaccine. Based on individual countries' MCV vaccination schedules, the first RCV dose is scheduled at age 8–11 months in 27 (18%) countries and at age 12–18 months in 125 (83%) countries. RCV is provided as a combination vaccine with measles vaccine in 30 (20%) countries and combined with measles and mumps vaccine (with or without varicella vaccine) in 122 (80%) countries; one country administers rubella vaccine simultaneously with combined measles and mumps vaccine.

### Congenital rubella syndrome in child of woman without known risk factors, new Jersey, USA [^f319db41]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

We found no evidence of secondary rubella transmission. A model has suggested that to interrupt rubella transmission, > 87.5% of the population must be immune. On the basis of the 2010 National Immunization Survey, 86.1% (95% CI 80.4%–91.8%) of New Jersey children 19–35 months of age had received > 1 doses of MMR vaccine, and 92.6% (95% CI 89.1%–96.1%) of adolescents 13–17 years of age had received > 2 doses. Continued rubella elimination relies upon the maintenance of high levels of immunity in the population; thus, public health professionals should continue to strive to achieve high levels of rubella immunization in their communities.

Despite its elimination from the United States, rubella infection and CRS continue to occur rarely: 6 cases of CRS have been reported to CDC since 2004. Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of rubella and CRS and immediately notify public health authorities when either is suspected.

Epidemiology of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) during the prevaccine era — before licensure of live, attenuated rubella vaccines in the United States in 1969, rubella was common and epidemics occurred every 6 to 9 years, with most cases among young children and peak incidence among children aged 5 through 9 years. During the 1964 through 1965 epidemic, an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases occurred in the United States, resulting in approximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis, 11,250 fetal deaths attributable to spontaneous or therapeutic abortions, 2,100 infants who were stillborn or died soon after birth, and 20,000 infants born with CRS.

Immune response to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination among persons with HIV infection — effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART): "Before the availability of effective ART, responses to MMR vaccine among persons with HIV infection were suboptimal" and "it generally was poor". In children with HIV infection, "measles antibodies appear to decline more rapidly" than in children without HIV infection. With early effective ART, "Memory B cell counts and function appear to be normal in HIV-infected children who are started on effective ART early (aged < 1 year), and responses to measles and rubella vaccination appear to be adequate", and "Measles antibody titers were higher" for early versus later ART; similarly, those who "initiated effective ART before vaccination had rubella antibody responses similar to those observed in HIV-uninfected children". However, "effective ART does not appear to reliably restore immunity from previous vaccinations", and "Perinatally HIV-infected youth who received MMR vaccine before effective ART might have increased susceptibility to measles, mumps, and rubella compared with HIV-exposed but uninfected persons".

### Standardization of rubella immunoassays [^eb7e42e8]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Currently, rubella and congenital rubella has been eliminated or is becoming a rare disease in many countries that have implemented effective vaccination programs. In most of these countries, it is recommended and of major importance to screen childbearing age women in order to identify susceptible women and offer them vaccination before pregnancy or after delivery. Immunity to rubella virus (RV) is commonly determined by measuring rubella-specific IgG (RV-IgG). However, looking at literature, it is obvious that standardization of RV-IgG assays is not effective, with different levels of International Units per milliliter (IU/mL) reported for a same sample, and consequently different interpretations of the result. This situation leads to misinterpretation of results, sometimes causing adverse clinical outcomes. This article aimed to review several factors, such as the introduction of large-scale vaccination programs and changes in epidemiology of RV infection, along with the development of new technologies that have complicated appreciation of the immune status of patients. However, there is currently no evidence that these factors may be of any influence on rubella resurgence.
