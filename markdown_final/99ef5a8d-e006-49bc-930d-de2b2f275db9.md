## Question

After the administration of an erroneous dose of intravenous phenytoin for recurrent seizures, a 9-year-old girl is resuscitated because of bradycardia and asystole. Later, the patient is taken to the critical care unit and placed on mechanical ventilation. Neurologic consultation shows hypoxic brain injury. To reduce the incidence of similar events, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Closed-loop communication
B. Computerized physician order entry
C. Root cause analysis
D. Structured handovers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which quality-improvement step is most appropriate to take after a serious pediatric medication error involving IV phenytoin that resulted in bradycardia/asystole and hypoxic brain injury, in order to prevent similar events in the future. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify this event and whether it meets criteria for a sentinel event. Then, I should verify which quality tools are appropriate for a retrospective, systems-level investigation. Next, I will compare root cause analysis with alternatives like CPOE, closed-loop communication, and structured handovers. Finally, I should confirm that the chosen approach aligns with patient-safety frameworks and will yield actionable system fixes rather than individual blame.

> Let me first confirm the event classification. An incorrect IV phenytoin dose causing cardiac arrest and hypoxic brain injury in a child is a sentinel event: unexpected, severe, and generally preventable, warranting a structured investigation and system-level response rather than a superficial review or individual blame, which is precisely the domain of root cause analysis in patient safety programs [^113KwtiV] [^11746Bpe].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism-specific context. IV phenytoin has well-described cardiovascular toxicity when infused too rapidly or in excessive concentrations, including hypotension and arrhythmias; slowing the infusion and correcting the dose typically reverses these effects, underscoring that the harm here is iatrogenic and preventable with proper administration controls and dosing safeguards [^113ys8u1].

> I need to check which quality tool fits a retrospective sentinel event. Root cause analysis is the standard, systems-focused method to identify underlying causes and design corrective actions that prevent recurrence. It moves beyond proximate errors to latent system failures, which is exactly what this case demands [^11272qpe] [^116Lih7g] [^115zk8KJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about implementing CPOE as the next step. CPOE is a valuable upstream intervention for order-entry safety, but it is a prospective tool and does not fulfill the requirement to investigate and learn from a sentinel event that has already occurred; it may be a later implementation after the RCA identifies order-entry as a contributory factor, but it is not the immediate next step here [^113fPpeo].

> Let me consider communication tools. Closed-loop communication and structured handovers are important operational practices that reduce errors, but they are not designed to systematically uncover latent causes of a complex medication error with multi-step failure points. They are adjuncts, not substitutes for a formal sentinel-event investigation [^11272qpe].

> I should confirm alignment with broader safety frameworks. Modern patient-safety science emphasizes systems analysis over individual culpability, and frameworks like the London Protocol and updated systems-analysis methods reinforce the need for structured incident investigation to derive prioritized, evidence-informed recommendations that reduce recurrence risk [^11263eZW] [^113C1eku].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is to convene a multidisciplinary root cause analysis to examine the entire medication-use process — from indication, dosing, preparation, infusion rate, monitoring, and response — to identify system defects and implement corrective actions that prevent future phenytoin-related harm, while maintaining a just culture that supports learning and reporting [^11272qpe] [^113KwtiV].

---

The most appropriate next step to prevent recurrence of a serious medication error like an **erroneous IV phenytoin dose** is to **conduct a root cause analysis (RCA)** [^11272qpe]. RCA is a systematic process that identifies underlying system failures — such as communication gaps, knowledge deficits, or workflow issues — and leads to targeted, sustainable interventions to prevent future harm [^116Lih7g] [^11746Bpe]. While closed-loop communication, computerized physician order entry, and structured handovers are important safety practices, they are best implemented as part of the corrective actions identified by the RCA rather than as standalone solutions [^113C1eku].

---

## Rationale for root cause analysis

RCA is the **standard approach** for investigating serious adverse events, particularly those involving medication errors, because it:

- **Identifies system failures**: RCA uncovers latent factors such as communication breakdowns, knowledge gaps, and workflow inefficiencies that contribute to errors [^115zk8KJ].

- **Prevents recurrence**: By addressing root causes, RCA leads to sustainable interventions that reduce the likelihood of similar errors [^116DMfDG].

- **Promotes learning**: RCA fosters a culture of continuous improvement and shared learning among healthcare professionals [^111zuW9S].

---

## Application to the clinical scenario

In this case, an **erroneous IV phenytoin dose** led to severe cardiovascular complications and hypoxic brain injury. RCA would systematically examine:

- **Order entry and verification**: Whether the order was correctly entered, verified, and communicated [^113fPpeo].

- **Administration process**: Whether the correct patient, medication, dose, and infusion rate were verified before administration [^113ys8u1].

- **Monitoring and response**: Whether appropriate monitoring and escalation protocols were followed [^1173Tvrc].

Potential root causes identified through RCA might include:

- **Communication breakdowns**: Lack of closed-loop communication during order verification and administration [^notfound].

- **Knowledge deficits**: Inadequate staff training on phenytoin administration guidelines and potential complications [^113ys8u1].

- **Workflow issues**: Inefficient processes for order verification and medication administration [^111zuW9S].

---

## Corrective actions resulting from RCA

Based on identified root causes, **targeted corrective actions** could include:

- **Closed-loop communication**: Implement standardized communication protocols for order verification and medication administration [^notfound].

- **Computerized physician order entry (CPOE)**: Adopt CPOE systems with clinical decision support to reduce order entry errors [^notfound].

- **Structured handovers**: Develop standardized handover templates to ensure accurate transfer of critical information [^notfound].

- **Staff training**: Provide targeted education on phenytoin administration guidelines and potential complications [^113ys8u1].

---

## Comparison with other options

While closed-loop communication, CPOE, and structured handovers are important safety practices, they are best implemented as part of a **comprehensive strategy** identified through RCA:

| **Option** | **Description** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Closed-loop communication | Standardized communication protocols | - May not address underlying system failures <br/> - Requires ongoing reinforcement [^notfound] |
| Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) | Electronic order entry with decision support | - May introduce new errors if not properly implemented <br/> - Requires training and workflow adjustments [^113fPpeo] |
| Structured handovers | Standardized templates for information transfer | - May not address upstream errors in order entry or administration <br/> - Requires consistent use [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

The most appropriate next step to prevent recurrence of a serious medication error is to **conduct a root cause analysis (RCA)** [^116DMfDG]. RCA identifies underlying system failures and guides the implementation of targeted interventions, such as closed-loop communication, CPOE, and structured handovers, to prevent future errors [^11272qpe].

Unlabelled

The quality movement in medicine has prompted a shift from a "name, shame, blame" approach to medical errors to one in which each error is regarded as an opportunity to prevent future patient harm. This new culture of patient safety requires the involvement of all members of the health care team and learned skill sets related to quality improvement. A root cause analysis identifies the sources of medical errors, allowing system changes that reduce the risk. In large organizations, sentinel events and signals prompt chart reviews and reduce the reliance on voluntary reporting. Failure mode analysis prompts the development of safety nets in the case of a system failure. The second part of this two-part series on patient safety examines how the culture of patient safety is taught, how medical errors and threats to patient safety can be identified, and how engineering tools can be used to improve patient care. It also examines efforts to measure clinical effectiveness and outcomes in the practice of medicine.

Learning Objectives

After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to improve patient safety through an understanding of both the beneficial and adverse consequences of quality reporting, apply safety engineering tools to the practice of dermatology, and be able to establish a quality improvement plan for a dermatologic practice.

### A trait-based root acquisition-defence-decomposition framework in angiosperm tree species [^112HZTq9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

Root 'acquisition-defence-decomposition' linkages

We observed large interspecific variations in absorptive root traits across 90 angiosperm tree species, with RD and concentrations of tissue N and condensed tannins showing stronger phylogenetic conservation than other root traits (Supplementary Table 1). For tree species (n = 70) in the major taxa (only families with at least three species were retained), we found that RD, CT, and concentrations of tissue N and condensed tannins showed significant phylogenetic signal. We further performed a phylogenetic principal components analysis (pPCA) on six key root traits of 90 angiosperm tree species. The first two axes of pPCA accounted for 69.2% of the total trait variation (Supplementary Table 3). The first axis (PC1) correlated with RD, CT and BI, and the second axis (PC2) correlated with SRL and RTD (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 3).

### Mutation of the doublecortin gene in male patients with double cortex syndrome: somatic mosaicism detected by hair root analysis [^1156fskP]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The molecular basis of double cortex syndrome was investigated in 2 male patients. Magnetic resonance imaging of the patients' heads showed diffuse subcortical band heterotopia, as is seen in female patients. We found a heterozygous mutation for Asp50Lys or Arg39Stop in both patients. Microsatellite polymorphism analysis revealed that both patients had inherited a single X chromosome from their mothers. Restriction enzyme analysis using DNA extracted from the hair roots of each patient showed four different patterns in the combination of cells carrying wild and mutant alleles, which strongly suggest somatic mosaicism. We conclude that somatic mosaic mutations in the doublecortin gene in male patients can cause subcortical band heterotopia, and that molecular analysis using hair roots is a useful method for detecting somatic mosaicism.

### Patient safety: latent risk factors [^117X69v4]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

The person-centred analysis and prevention approach has long dominated proposals to improve patient safety in healthcare. In this approach, the focus is on the individual responsible for making an error. An alternative is the systems-centred approach, in which attention is paid to the organizational factors that create precursors for individual errors. This approach assumes that since humans are fallible, systems must be designed to prevent humans from making errors or to be tolerant to those errors. The questions raised by this approach might, for example, include asking why an individual had specific gaps in their knowledge, experience, or ability. The systems approach focuses on working conditions rather than on errors of individuals, as the likelihood of specific errors increases with unfavourable conditions. Since the factors that promote errors are not directly visible in the working environment, they are described as latent risk factors (LRFs). Safety failures in anaesthesia, in particular, and medicine, in general, result from multiple unfavourable LRFs, so we propose that effective interventions require that attention is paid to interactions between multiple factors and actors. Understanding how LRFs affect safety can enable us to design more effective control measures that will impact significantly on both individual performance and patient outcomes.

### Finite element analysis of bone stress for miniscrew implant proximal to root under occlusal force and implant loading [^117WXHbe]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Because of the narrow interradicular spaces and varying oral anatomies of individual patients, there is a very high risk of root proximity during the mini implants inserting. The authors hypothesized that normal occlusal loading and implant loading affected the stability of miniscrew implants placed in proximity or contact with the adjacent root. The authors implemented finite element analysis (FEA) to examine the effectiveness of root proximity and root contact. Stress distribution in the bone was assessed at different degrees of root proximity by generating 4 finite element models: the implant touches the root surface, the implant was embedded in the periodontal membrane, the implant touches the periodontal surface, and the implant touches nothing. Finite element analysis was then carried out with simulations of 2 loading conditions for each model: condition A, involving only tooth loading and condition B, involving both tooth and implant loading. Under loading condition A, the maximum stress on the bone for the implant touching the root was the distinctly higher than that for the other models. For loading condition B, peak stress areas for the implant touching the root were the area around the neck of the mini implant and the point of the mini implant touches the root. The results of this study suggest that normal occlusal loading and implant loading contribute to the instability of the mini implant when the mini implant touches the root.

### Simple rules for evidence translation in complex systems: a qualitative study [^112YjxQT]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is an urgent need to improve the delivery of high quality healthcare, including the need to improve patient safety and reduce harm, to ensure care is patient centred and compassionate, to improve health and wellbeing, and to reduce inequalities at the local, regional, national and global scale, all within an increasingly constrained financial environment.

To address these challenges, there is a need to bridge the gap between the production of research evidence and the consistent delivery of evidence-based care in routine practice. There is growing acknowledgement that translation of evidence is often ineffective and inefficient, and there is a need to develop a scientific and practical understanding of how to implement evidence into practice and achieve fast and reliable improvements in care.

Traditional approaches to translating evidence into practice have taken a rational-linear approach (where knowledge is created by one set of experts and passed on to another set to be implemented). Evaluations have focused on identifying simple causal relationships between interventions and outcomes, aiming to produce generalisable knowledge about what works. To establish causal relationships, studies tend to be conducted in controlled environments, where interference from context variables is considered problematic and controlled for by randomisation and protocol design.

It is increasingly recognised that context matters; having an 'appropriate' context can support an intervention achieve its outcome. Approaches to translating evidence into practice have taken an interest in how interventions can be adapted to work in different settings, and many researchers have turned to realist evaluations in an attempt to understand 'what works, for whom, in what settings' and establish more nuanced and caveated causal statements.

When designing intervention and implementation strategies, as well as when conducting rigorous evaluations, there is a tendency to reduce messy real world situations into the individual component parts in an attempt to determine the relationships between them. Doing so risks overlooking the complex and intricate patterns that emerge from their interactions.

Complexity sciences provide an alternative approach to studying interventions in complex systems such as healthcare. Complexity science originated in physical chemistry as a 'push-back' against traditional reductionist approaches. Put simply, life is more than molecules and atoms – it is the complex patterns of organisation that emerge between them. Similarly, it has been proposed that healthcare can be considered as a complex system (or complex adaptive system), with the whole being more than simply the sum of its parts. On their own, the professionals, equipment and devices in any healthcare setting achieve nothing; it is the interactions between them, and with patients, that result in the delivery of care.

### Nonlinearity of root trait relationships and the root economics spectrum [^116MTia7]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Allometric relationships between root anatomical structures

The root anatomical structures of both the woody and non-woody species followed allometric relationships for tToS (i.e. thickness of root tissues outside the stele) vs. root diameter and SR (i.e. stele radius) vs. root diameter, with regression slopes for woody species of 0.43 and 0.068 (linear regressions, p < 0.001) and regression slopes for non-woody species of 0.32 and 0.18 (linear regressions, p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 1a; regression equations are presented in Supplementary Data 2). The regression slope of the relationship between tToS and root diameter was higher for woody than for non-woody species (standardized major axis, p < 0.001), while the regression slope between SR and root diameter was lower for woody than for non-woody species (standardized major axis, p < 0.001).

### Root cause analysis in nuclear medicine for sentinel events [^11746Bpe]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

A sentinel event is any unexpected event that results in death or serious physical or psychological injury to a patient unrelated to a patient's illness. Establishing and determining cause-and-effect relationships is key to preventing future sentinel/near-miss events. However, it can be challenging to establish a cause-and-effect relationship when a process involves multiple steps or people. Root cause analysis (RCA) is a technique that can pinpoint the causes of sentinel events for medical procedures involving numerous steps and people. This article provides a rationale for RCA and the basic steps in a nonmedical RCA investigation. The article then describes a more detailed, nine-step RCA approach for investigating sentinel events and illustrates the technique with a nuclear medicine example.

JAMA. 1983; 249: 762–765. doi: 10.1001/jama.1983.03330300046032 Intravenous phenytoin sodium in small volumes of normal saline was administered in a municipal hospital emergency department for treatment of convulsions in 200 patients. A total of 72 complications developed in 51 patients. Twenty-nine complications were burning pain at the IV site, and 36 were related to excessive total dose of phenytoin and resultant drug intoxication. Seven other patients had cardiovascular complications, including hypotension and arrhythmias. These seven complications were related to high concentrations of drug administered at a rapid rate. Both the IV and cardiovascular complications promptly resolved when the IV rate was slowed or temporarily stopped. No patient died, and none was hospitalized because of a complication.

Chronic periodontitis nonsurgical therapy — review scope and primary outcome evaluates the effect of scaling and root planing (SRP) alone and with adjuncts, using clinical attachment level (CAL) as the sole comparative outcome; the Patient-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome questions ask whether SRP (hand or ultrasonic) versus no treatment, supragingival scaling and polish (prophylaxis), or debridement improves CAL, and whether adjunctive local or systemic antimicrobials/antibiotics, agents for biomodification or host modulation, or nonsurgical lasers with SRP provide greater improvement in CAL than SRP alone.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^112Hp5hA]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) error surveillance and safety culture — safe practices involve a broad interplay of providers, departments, and administrative support structures across the many steps of the EN process, and errors can occur from patient assessment to prescribing, order review, and documentation, with most recognized errors focusing on product selection and administration. Maintaining a safety culture depends on continuous surveillance, recognition of potential risk at each step, and systematic reporting of all errors — including near misses, and monitoring and reporting can allow for subsystem improvement upon review by an organization's committee or a national patient safety organization. The improper administration of EN has led to patient harm and even death, and the use of resources such as patient safety reporting databases and national patient safety organizations is vital to identify issues associated with the delivery of EN. As clinicians report events, national patient safety organizations and local healthcare organizations can analyze events, determine root causes or weaknesses in the EN process, and establish changes and new recommendations to prevent future errors, and multidisciplinary review of EN policies and procedures on at least an annual basis will identify issues and can prevent future breakdowns in the process.

### The latitudinal pattern of fine root intraspecific trait variation among species in plant communities [^117BXMTy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Additionally, the ITV of root chemical, morphological, architectural, and physiological traits were positively correlated with the ITV of RD across species (Supplementary Fig. 9). Diameter is a core trait that links to root construction, maintenance, persistence, and function. For example, the length and surface area of a root per unit biomass invested (i.e. SRL and SRA, respectively) increase with decreasing diameter. Therefore, the leading role of diameter in structuring interspecific differences of diverse root traits also plays a key role in determining the magnitude of ITV of root traits. Remarkably, for most root traits, the extent of root ITV (represented by CV) was not influenced by the number of individuals across plant species in the current study (Supplementary Fig. 10). However, this does not mean that a small number of individuals is enough to obtain reliable root ITV of certain plant species within a community. Considering both cost and workload, a sufficient sample size remains essential for increasing the accuracy and stability of the estimated root ITV. Taken together, these findings provide a tractable and promising approach for estimating intraspecific root trait variation across different species, which has the potential to simplify the inclusion of root ITV at different ecological scales in trait-based ecology.

### Effect size of contributory factors on adverse events: an analysis of RCA series in a teaching hospital [^115zk8KJ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patient safety is a worldwide issue which affects quality of care, clinical outcome effectiveness, patients' quality of life, patient satisfaction, and savings of financial resources.

The first principle in medicine is "not to harm the patient", thus avoiding and eliminating injuries and harms to patients is becoming a main concern in health care systems. Approximately, one out of ten patients admitted to hospitals experiences injury or medical error during their staying in hospital which may result in mortality and morbidity of patients.

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported that medical errors lead to nearly 100,000 patient deaths per year. Moreover, an Australian study estimated that cost of adverse events is accounted $4.7 billion a year and it caused patient safety to become an increasingly high priority in health care systems in 1999.

Typically, medical errors are result of a combination of contributing factors such as poor communication, health care system weaknesses, staff's lack of education, etc; rarely there is just one causal factor.

A new approach to medical errors is shifting responsibility from individuals toward the system. Hospitals should investigate sentinel and serious events and analyze their root causes. There are several methods, including reactive and proactive methods, for clinical risk management which enhance the quality of care and guarantee patients' safety. Root cause Analysis (RCA) is a reactive method for investigating an event and finding its underlying factors. In addition, RCA is an answer to the questions about what, how, and why an event happened, and is also used to design preventive interventions. From the mid-1990s, RCA has been introduced and used for improving patient care and safety. It is used for learning from mistakes and preventing future errors or injuries by identifying and removing the root causes of errors.

The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) framework has outlined a process of investigation and analysis of clinical incidents and has provided recommendations for action as well. In this framework, factors influencing clinical practice include nine categories of patient factor, task factor, individual factor, communication factor, team factors, education factor, equipment and resource factor, work condition factors and organizational & management factors.

Therefore, the objective of this article was to review serial RCAs and reveal the distribution of contributory factors on adverse events.

### The latitudinal pattern of fine root intraspecific trait variation among species in plant communities [^1146QaG2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

It is important to note that the latitudinal patterns of root ITV among species in plant community differed between the absorptive-root and fine-root data, which were derived from distinct source studies (Fig. 4f–q). For many plant species, the diameter-defined fine roots (≤ 2 mm in diameter) generally include absorptive and transport fine roots, two distinct pools of fine roots that differ in form and function. The absorptive fine roots involve primarily in the acquisition and uptake of soil resources, whereas the transport fine roots have low metabolic activity and are typically structurally reinforced and responsible for transporting resources. The undetectable amount of transport fine roots in the diameter-based fine roots might result in biases in estimating root ITV. On the other hand, the limited latitude range of the 1 st order root data may restrict the large scale patterns of root ITV that can be observed (Fig. 4b–e). Therefore, the order-based fine root classification is strongly advocated in root traits research to improve comparability between plant species and study sites. In plant ITV research, another key issue is elucidating how individuals of the same species vary in their responses to environmental gradients. Due to the limited widespread species in our root ITV data (Supplementary Fig. 12) and we primarily focused on species' ITV within community, testing root trait plasticity of specific species against an environmental gradient is not feasible and falls beyond the scope of our study.

Collectively, our work shows that intraspecific variation is an important driving force in forming root trait diversity, and physiological traits are likely to be highly plastic in response to biotic and abiotic environments among different categories of root traits. The general trends of root ITV with the size of RD among species, i.e. that thick-root species have higher root ITV compared to thin-root species, provide a convenient way to predict patterns and relative magnitudes of ITV for specific root traits across species. Our results highlight clear correlations between climatic conditions and intraspecific variations of many root traits among species in natural plant communities. The expected change in climate may thus influence root traits expression within species and, in turn, also have dramatic impacts on species coexistence, community assembly, and other ecosystem functions. These findings shed light on understanding the primary forces that shape plant diversity and ecosystem function from a belowground perspective. We advocate for the explicit consideration of root ITV in future trait-based studies, particularly within tropical and subtropical plant communities.

### Investigating the avoidability of hospitalizations of long stay nursing home residents: opportunities for improvement [^116KTqbN]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Procedures and Data Collection Tools

OPTIMISTIC RNs used an adapted version of the INTERACT root cause analysis tool to perform a root cause analysis whenever an OPTIMISTIC resident transferred, as close to the time of acute transfer as possible. The project RN embedded in the facility was responsible for completing the root cause analysis tool. The analysis was performed for as many transfers as possible, including transfers that occurred when the OPTIMISTIC RN was not present in the nursing facility. Once a transfer has occurred, the OPTIMISTIC RNs completed the Transfer Tracking and Quality Improvement tool and include details of the transfer event, a rating of avoidability of the transfer based on clinical judgment, and identification of opportunities for quality improvement. The data collected from the transfer review is entered into the project database and facility specific information is reported back to the facility for quality improvement activities. OPTIMISTIC RNs were trained to use clinical judgment in assessing avoidability. They were instructed to consider: "If conditions were ideal (appropriate nursing care, resources, and communication) would this transfer have happened?" These instructions were provided during training and in a manual that they have available for reference. Project RNs received approximately six hours of training on use of the root cause analysis tool, including principles of root cause analysis and discussion of case examples. They use their clinical judgment and knowledge of the transfer event to answer the avoidability question as objectively as possible for the purposes of quality improvement.

### Nonlinearity of root trait relationships and the root economics spectrum [^112yafVF]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The root economics spectrum (RES), a common hypothesis postulating a tradeoff between resource acquisition and conservation traits, is being challenged by conflicting relationships between root diameter, tissue density (RTD) and root nitrogen concentration (RN). Here, we analyze a global trait dataset of absorptive roots for over 800 plant species. For woody species (but not for non-woody species), we find nonlinear relationships between root diameter and RTD and RN, which stem from the allometric relationship between stele and cortical tissues. These nonlinear relationships explain how sampling bias from different ends of the nonlinear curves can result in conflicting trait relationships. Further, the shape of the relationships varies depending on evolutionary context and mycorrhizal affiliation. Importantly, the observed nonlinear trait relationships do not support the RES predictions. Allometry-based nonlinearity of root trait relationships improves our understanding of the ecology, physiology and evolution of absorptive roots.

### Development of an evidence-based framework of factors contributing to patient safety incidents in hospital settings: a systematic review [^11263eZW]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2012). Medium credibility.

Our review has informed the construction of a framework of contributory factors which includes 20 key domains and suggests the extent to which these are proximal or distal (active or latent failures). This pictorial representation is based on previously described accident causation models, together with the ratings of our expert group. Thus, it should be noted that while the evidence for the domains reflected within the framework is strong, future research is needed to clarify the exact positioning of the domains within the outer rings and the weighting of each domain (perhaps by varying the size of each segment). Although this framework has a greater number of domains than others (eg, the London Protocol includes just seven domains and the WHO classification specifies five main contributing factors) and therefore might be criticised for being more complex, it captures the full range of contributory factors (across different hospital settings) and gives a greater weighting to systems, rather than human failures. Moreover, some interesting findings have arisen from the work reported here, not least the slight differences in the identification of contributory factors for different settings. The fact that this framework differentiates between surgery, where teamwork was frequently identified, and anaesthesia, where equipment and supply issues were more pronounced, highlights its potential to be generalisable across specialties and error types and yet sufficiently detailed to pick up subtle differences between areas of the hospital to allow the targeting of appropriate interventions. Indeed, this framework has the potential to be used in a number of ways to support improvements to patient safety in practice. It can be used to improve the root cause analysis of serious patient safety incidents. For example, it could be used to analyse patient safety incidents to identify the prevalence of contributory factors and to provide feedback on the quality of existing incident analysis processes. The framework could also be used as a basis for the systematic collection of data about the factors contributing to patient safety incidents through the redesign of local and national reporting systems. The quality of the data elicited through existing reporting systems is often poorbecause healthcare professionals who are responsible for reporting errors focus predominantly on the individual and situational factors that are proximal to the error. Without guidance on other factors we may learn little about the organisational interventions that might better support safer practice. The framework may also help clinicians or managers to identify proactively poor safety performance at an organisational level and therefore guide risk management strategies. For example, the framework could be used as the basis for developing a measurement tool for patients to report on the local and organisational factors that impact on their care.

### Unravelling the age of fine roots of temperate and boreal forests [^116PBLvw]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fine roots support the water and nutrient demands of plants and supply carbon to soils. Quantifying turnover times of fine roots is crucial for modeling soil organic matter dynamics and constraining carbon cycle-climate feedbacks. Here we challenge widely used isotope-based estimates suggesting the turnover of fine roots of trees to be as slow as a decade. By recording annual growth rings of roots from woody plant species, we show that mean chronological ages of fine roots vary from < 1 to 12 years in temperate, boreal and sub-arctic forests. Radiocarbon dating reveals the same roots to be constructed from 10 ± 1 year (mean ± 1 SE) older carbon. This dramatic difference provides evidence for a time lag between plant carbon assimilation and production of fine roots, most likely due to internal carbon storage. The high root turnover documented here implies greater carbon inputs into soils than previously thought which has wide-ranging implications for quantifying ecosystem carbon allocation.

### Nonlinearity of root trait relationships and the root economics spectrum [^115DNUQx]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The nonlinear relationships in woody species can reconcile the current debate on the relationship between RTD and root diameter. We found weaker correlations of RTD and RN with root diameter for studies reporting no relationship between RTD and root diameter than for studies reporting negative relationships between RTD and root diameter (Fig. 4). The studies reporting negative relationships also included a higher proportion of species with thin roots and high RTD than studies reporting no relationships. Together, this demonstrates that those studies reporting no relationships focus on the region of slow decrease of RTD with increasing root diameter (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2a). On the other hand, the negative relationship between RTD and root diameter in studies reporting negative relationships may apply only to the part of the curve with a steep decrease. Therefore, nonlinearity of the root trait relationships could underpin how sampling bias from different parts of the nonlinear curves produces contradicting results as shown in recent studies. To gain a global picture of root trait relationships, it is therefore crucial to consider the full global range of trait variation across different lineages of woody species.

Recognition of the nonlinear relationship between RTD and root diameter could substantially improve our understanding of the tradeoffs among root functional traits. Theoretically, for an individual absorptive root (e.g. a single 1st order root), greater investment in dry mass could result in longer root lifespan following the cost-benefit theory, as observed for aboveground plant organs. If we consider a plant root a cylinder formed by concentrically arranged tissues, dry mass of a single 1 st order root must be a function of the total diameter as root volume increases exponentially with diameter (Supplementary Fig. 4). For the nonlinear relationship between RTD and root diameter (Fig. 2a, Supplementary 2c), if the increase of the root dry mass with increasing root diameter cannot be offset by the simultaneous decrease of tissue density, then root dry mass will always increase with root diameter. A modeling simulation based on the allometric relationship between root conductive and cortical tissue shows a monotonical increase of the root dry mass with increasing root diameter (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting a predominant role of root diameter rather than RTD in determining the root dry mass and hence root lifespan. This is also supported by the consistent positive relationship between root lifespan and root diameter, and the lack of a relationship between root lifespan and RTD in woody species (Supplementary Fig. 5).

### Root growth and branching are enabled by brassinosteroid-regulated growth anisotropy and carbon allocation [^114YMKt4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Shoot BR fully rescues the biomass of a BR deficient root

Next, we sought to determine if the RSA in the different graft combinations and the accompanied transcriptomic profiling also reflect the differences in root biomass. To generate sufficient root tissue that can be weighed for comparative analysis, we transferred the plants to pots for an additional 3 weeks (Fig. 1a). Grafts with cpd shoot in both homograft and heterograft had a reduced survival when grown in pots (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Although precise RSA quantification is not feasible for all micrograft combinations in 8-week-old plants, the surviving plants with cpd shoot notably exhibited limited branching, indicating attenuated root growth, and the RSA of cpd roots appeared partially rescued by the WT shoot (Fig. 3a), consistent with the quantified intermediate RSA observed at an earlier age (Fig. 1). Biomass quantification of the roots, both fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW), confirmed that the cpd scion arrested the growth of WT roots (cpd /WT), as apparent from the low weight, which was similar to that of cpd/cpd (Fig. 3c, d). Intriguingly, while WT scion only partly rescued cpd root growth parameters (Fig. 1c–f, Fig. 3a), the poor biomass of the cpd root (in the cpd / cpd homograft) was fully rescued by the WT scion (WT/ cpd) (Fig. 3c, d). Biomass of the WT shoot appeared largely unaffected by root BR, with slight elevation in the WT/ cpd combination (Fig. 3b). To evaluate if the rescue of cpd 's root biomass by shoot BR is also linked to a change in metabolic content, we compared the relative levels of select primary metabolites, using the whole root system of WT/WT, WT/ cpd and cpd/cpd un (Fig. 3e). The heterograft cpd /WT could not be included in the analysis due to the low mass of its roots. Among the 31 metabolites analyzed, 16 showed a significant difference in at least one pairwise comparison; among them 13 differed between WT/WT and cpd/cpd un (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Data 3). This included the elevation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and the reduction of fructose in cpd/cpd un roots vs WT/WT roots, reflecting an overall metabolic imbalance. The levels of most of the tested metabolites were rescued by the WT shoot, in WT/ cpd, demonstrating that shoot BR largely controls the root metabolic balance. Finally, to investigate whether the phenotypic effects of shoot BR production (Fig. 1, Fig. 3) could involve a potential hormone transport to the root, in Arabidopsis, or it is the BR signaling and its downstream effects which impact the observed root growth dynamics, we performed a similar analysis in the BR signaling mutant bri1 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The resulting changes in RSA and the root biomass largely recapitulated the cpd experiments, supporting that it is local shoot BR function that is impacting root growth. The lack of rescue in the primary root and the slightly lower biomass rescue of the bri1 root, compared to the cpd root by the WT shoot, may suggest limited hormone transport or regulation due to the accumulation of a specific BR precursor. However, if this is the case, these traits may not be conserved, as an equivalent grafting experiment using the bri1 tomato mutant recapitulated the Arabidopsis cpd results (see Supplementary Fig. 3 below). Together, BR production and signaling in the shoot are critical for the biomass growth of shoot and root and the effect in the latter is likely a consequence of the BR-dependent shoot size and inherent scaled production of photosynthate-derived sugars.

### Validation of the root analysis score for C5 viability in patients with pan-brachial plexus injury [^117Jjqw8]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Pan-brachial plexus injury patients present a reconstructive challenge. The root analysis score, developed from parsimonious multivariable modeling of 311 pan-brachial plexus injury patients, determines the probability of having a viable C5 nerve based on four categories: positive C5 Tinel test, intact C5 nerve on computed tomography myelogram, lack of hemidiaphragmatic elevation, and absence of midcervical paraspinal fibrillations.

Methods

Root analysis scores were calculated for a separate cohort of patients with pan-brachial plexus injuries. Scores were validated by the presence or absence of a graftable C5 root, based on supraclavicular exploration and intraoperative electrophysiologic testing. Receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, and concordance statistic of the scores were calculated. Patients were divided into three root analysis score cohorts: less than 50 (low), 50–75 (average), and 75–100 points (high) based on dividing the score into quartiles and combining the lowest two. The probability, sensitivity, and specificity of each cohort having an available C5 nerve were based on the intraoperative assessment.

Results

Eighty patients (mean age, 33.1 years; 15 women and 65 men) were included. Thirty-one patients (39%) had a viable C5 nerve. The root analysis calculator had an overall accuracy of 82.5%, a receiver operating characteristic of 0.87, and a concordance statistic of 0.87, demonstrating high overall predictive value; 6.5% of patients with a score of less than 50 (94% sensitivity and 43% specificity), 16.1% of patients with a score of 50–75 (94% sensitivity and 67% specificity), and 77.4% of patients with a score of 75–100 (77% sensitivity and 90% specificity) had a graftable C5 nerve.

Conclusions

The root analysis score demonstrated high accuracy and predictive power for a viable C5 nerve. In patients with a score of less than 50, the necessity of supraclavicular root exploration should balance patient factors, presentation timing, and concomitant injuries.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on the nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis by means of scaling and root planing with or without adjuncts [^116kF4c8]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Balancing level of certainty and net benefit rating to arrive at clinical recommendation strength — under the net benefit columns Benefits Outweigh Potential Harms, Benefits Balanced With Potential Harms, and No Benefits or Potential Harms Outweigh Benefits, High maps to Strong, In favor, and Against; Moderate maps to In favor, Weak, and Against; and Low maps to Expert opinion for or expert opinion against. Net benefit is determined by evaluating a treatment's clinical benefits against its adverse effects (AEs) and by judging whether the benefits clearly outweigh the AEs, the benefits and AEs are balanced closely or uncertain, or the AEs clearly outweigh the benefits. The clinical recommendation strength is a result of crossing the appropriate row and column of Table 2, and the clinician and patient must balance the potential benefits with the potential AEs.

### Implementation of medication reconciliation in outpatient cancer care [^112oPMNV]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The majority of cancer care occurs in the outpatient setting where approximately 20% of patients will experience an adverse drug event; of which 16%–41% may be preventable. Similar to reports from other cancer centres, medication incidents related to adverse drug events (such as drug-drug interactions) and medication errors (such as duplicate prescriptions or dosing errors) are among the most common safety events at our cancer centre. This led us to prioritise improvement of medication safety as a institutional quality priority. Lack of an accurate, up-to-date medication list for each patient and of standardised processes to manage these lists were found to be key root causes for these events.

Medication reconciliation (MedRec), which is a formal two-step process where providers work with patients and their caregivers to create, document and communicate comprehensive medication information, has been shown to reduce medication incidents. MedRec starts with the collection of a best possible medication history (BPMH), compiled systematically from at least two sources, which is a comprehensive record of patients' prescribed and non-prescribed medications, vitamins and supplements, along with detailed documentation of drug name, dose, frequency and route of administration. The list is then reconciled against what the patient is actually taking to identify potential issues with patients' medications such as drug-drug interactions, additions, changes or discontinuations.WHO considers MedRec a top five priority to reduce patient harm.

While substantial work has been done to implement MedRec in the inpatient setting, much less is known about the optimal process for outpatient MedRec, particularly in oncology where shared responsibility between multiple providers, both within and external to the cancer centre, can be difficult to coordinate. A previous scoping review by McCarthy et al of MedRec found that few studies have examined the impact of MedRec in the outpatient settings, with the majority of papers focusing on reporting on whether MedRec was completed correctly, and/or identifying implementation facilitators. Little consensus on who was responsible for documenting the MedRec and how it was undertaken was noted. Given the limited guidance available in the literature on best practices, we first undertook an environmental scan to understand current MedRec practices in outpatient cancer care across Canada using semi-structured interviews before launching our local quality improvement project, the goal of which was to implement a standardised process for MedRec in the outpatient setting at our cancer centre as a way to improve medication safety with a focus on patients for who medication management was a major aspect of their care.

### The regulatory landscape of arabidopsis thaliana roots at single-cell resolution [^116J5fE3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The scarcity of accessible sites that are dynamic or cell type-specific in plants may be due in part to tissue heterogeneity in bulk studies. To assess the effects of tissue heterogeneity, we apply single-cell ATAC-seq to Arabidopsis thaliana roots and identify thousands of differentially accessible sites, sufficient to resolve all major cell types of the root. We find that the entirety of a cell's regulatory landscape and its transcriptome independently capture cell type identity. We leverage this shared information on cell identity to integrate accessibility and transcriptome data to characterize developmental progression, endoreduplication and cell division. We further use the combined data to characterize cell type-specific motif enrichments of transcription factor families and link the expression of family members to changing accessibility at specific loci, resolving direct and indirect effects that shape expression. Our approach provides an analytical framework to infer the gene regulatory networks that execute plant development.

### A continental scale analysis reveals widespread root bimodality [^114Gn4Lk]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

An improved understanding of root vertical distribution is crucial for assessing plant-soil-atmosphere interactions and their influence on the land carbon sink. Here, we analyze a continental-scale dataset of fine roots reaching 2 meters depth, spanning from Alaskan tundra to Puerto Rican forests. Contrary to the expectation that fine root abundance decays exponentially with depth, we found root bimodality at ~20% of 44 sites, with secondary biomass peaks often below 1m. Root bimodality was more likely in areas with low total fine root biomass and was more frequent in shrublands than grasslands. Notably, secondary peaks coincided with high soil nitrogen content at depth. Our analyses suggest that deep soil nutrients tend to be underexploited, while root bimodality offers plants a mechanism to tap into deep soil resources. Our findings add to the growing recognition that deep soil dynamics are systematically overlooked, and calls for more research attention to this deep frontier in the face of global environmental change.

### Irbesartan in Marfan syndrome (AIMS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^113yfudu]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

On the basis of existing information on aortic root dilatation in Marfan syndrome, the original sample size was set up to detect a 0.5 mm reduction in the aortic root diameter on irbesartan compared with placebo with an SD of 1.8 mm. 490 participants were anticipated to detect this difference, assuming up to a 20% drop-out rate and 80% power. Recruitment was slower than expected and trial recruitment was terminated at 192 participants. The loss of power was mitigated by extending follow-up to a maximum of 5 years and statistical analyses for the rate of aortic dilatation that accounted for repeated measurements and missing outcome data.

The primary analysis was the comparison of the change in aortic root diameter per year between the irbesartan and placebo groups. The population in the intention-to-treat analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes included all randomly assigned patients according to their original treatment allocation. An additional analysis of the primary outcome was repeated including patients only up to the point that they were known to have stopped taking the trial treatment (per-protocol analysis). The mean annual rate of aortic root dilatation in each treatment group and the absolute difference in these rates was estimated using a linear mixed effects model for repeated measures. This model accounts for the baseline measure of aortic root diameter, while also incorporating all follow-up measurements, and enables the inclusion of participants with missing measurements. The model used in the primary analysis assumes that aortic root diameter changes linearly over time and a sensitivity analysis that relaxes this assumption was also done as follows: at each timepoint (from 1 to 5 years), the mean aortic root diameter in each treatment group, along with the absolute difference in these means, was estimated using a linear mixed effects model for repeated measures. This model accounts for the baseline measure of aortic root diameter. The model includes a continuous variable for time (in years), random intercepts and slopes, a linear interaction between time and treatment group, and assumes no effect of treatment at baseline. An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used to allow for correlations between the random intercepts and slopes. The model was fitted using restricted maximum likelihood. Patients were followed for between 2 and 5 years and like all linear mixed models, the model assumes that when data on aortic root diameter were missing, they were missing-at-random. Further details of the model are provided in the appendix (p 3).

### Radiology department preparedness for the management of severe acute iodinated contrast reactions: Do we need to change our approach? [^115RUCkb]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to identify opportunities for reducing epinephrine administration errors after a sentinel event entailing an overdose of i.v. epinephrine occurred in a radiology department.

Materials and Methods

A root cause analysis was performed that included review and analysis of current system protocols, a medication audit, and access to treatment algorithms. A proctored three-question multiple-choice test was administered to radiology attending physicians, fellows, residents, and nurses to gauge baseline knowledge of epinephrine use. Chi-square analysis was performed.

Results

Twelve of 13 radiology department central pharmacy automation system locations lacked epinephrine ampules. As a result, personnel had to access i.v. epinephrine stocked on hospital code carts designed for use during cardiac arrest. This led to errors related to appropriate dosing. Test participants included 46 attending physicians, 23 fellows, 28 residents, and 25 nurses (n = 122). Almost all (99%) correctly identified epinephrine as the medication to administer in this situation. Approximately one half (52%) correctly identified the dose of intramuscular epinephrine, but only 29% knew the dose and rate of administration of i.v. epinephrine (p < 0.001). Attending physicians were more likely to administer i.v. epinephrine correctly than were the other groups (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Stocking and routine auditing of medication availability are essential. The use of epinephrine intended for cardiac arrest stocked on code carts should be avoided during contrast reactions. It would be optimal if first-line responders to contrast reactions included attending physicians, but this may not always be the case at academic institutions.

### Root growth and branching are enabled by brassinosteroid-regulated growth anisotropy and carbon allocation [^112kdJe3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Plants function as an integrated system of interconnected organs, with shoots and roots mutually influencing each other. Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling is essential for whole-plant growth, yet the relative importance of shoot versus root BR function in shaping root system architecture (RSA) remains unclear. Here, we directly tackle this question using micro-grafts between wild-type and BR-null mutants in both Arabidopsis and tomato, assisted by phenotyping, transcriptomics, metabolic profiling, transmission electron microscopy, and modeling approaches. These analyses demonstrate that shoot BR, by determining root carbon availability, allows for a full rescue of mutant root biomass, while loss of shoot BR attenuates root growth. In parallel, root BR dictates the spatial distribution of carbon along the root, through local regulation of growth anisotropy and cell wall thickness, shaping root morphology. A newly developed "grow and branch" simulation model demonstrates that these shoot- and root-derived BR effects are sufficient to explain and predict root growth dynamics and branching phenotype in wild-type, BR-deficient mutants, and micro-graft combinations. Our interdisciplinary approach, applied to two plant species and integrating shoot and root hormonal functions, provides a new understanding of how RSA is modulated at various scales.

### Systems analysis of clinical incidents: development of a new edition of the london protocol [^113C1eku]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

The development of recommendations and prioritisation of interventions

An urgent task for research is to develop and evaluate methods of deriving recommendations from contributory factors and other findings. This should include the use of evidence from safety sciences, ergonomics and human factors to provide an explicit strategy for prioritising recommendations and a realistic approach to implementation. More research is also needed on the relative strength, impact and unforeseen consequences of recommendations resulting from incident analyses in practice. Many organisations struggle to complete thematic or aggregate investigations and yet these are most likely to result in focused, strategic recommendations and long-term safety improvements.

Finally, in order to support research and evaluation more generally, we need to encourage the publication of both individual and thematic analyses of incidents where the findings have implications beyond the local setting. Even where sharing is actively encouraged, many healthcare organisations fail to participate through fears of legal action or other reasons. There are some organisations in different countries that publish incident analysis findings in order to share learning, but this needs to be supported more widely (Box 3).

Box 3
Examples of open publications of incident reviews across countries

In the UK, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body supports the open publication of the findings from all national investigations.

In France, the Haute Autorité de Santé releases a series of short publications on prominent safety topics that are informed by a review of adverse events declared to the regional health agency by healthcare organisations.

In Switzerland, the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation releases 'Quick Alerts', which are informed by reviews of incidents reported on its central database and available scientific evidence.

In Norway, the Norwegian Health Investigation Board (Ukom) conducts independent multilevel and multidisciplinary investigations of serious adverse events and concerns involving Norwegian healthcare services, set up to promote system-wide learning and patient safety.

In the USA, the federally listed Patient Safety Organizations are required to submit incident reports to the national database which are then shared widely. The Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority publishes 'safety alerts' based on learning from incident reports on their website.

In Japan, a national reporting and learning system funded by the government and run by the Japan Council for Quality Health Care regularly publishes reports which are generated through a collection and analysis of incidents reported from medical institutions across the country.

In Italy, a maternal mortality surveillance system, including incident reporting and confidential enquiries along with a retrospective analysis of administrative data sources, emerged as the best option for case ascertainment and for promoting avoidable maternal deaths.

### Improving the quality of cytology diagnosis: root cause analysis for errors in bronchial washing and brushing specimens [^114EMhRc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Detailed root cause analysis to determine causes of pulmonary cytology errors has not been used to design specific practice changes. We performed root cause analysis of all false-negative bronchial brushing and washing specimen errors (n = 32) detected by the cytologic-histologic correlation process in 2002. Medical records and all slides were reviewed. Based on the correlation process, 10 errors were interpretive, 16 sampling, and 6 combined interpretive/sampling. Root cause analysis showed that the lesion was not accessible in 8 cases and tumor was readily identified on the slides in only 1 case. In 11 cases, the malignant cells were few and not recognized, and in 13 cases, obscuring artifacts (eg, cellular crushing and air drying) limited interpretation. Sampling issues had a major role in the misdiagnosis in 31 cases (97%), and recommendations for error reduction include immediate interpretation and the use of transmucosal fine-needle aspiration.

### Propensity score matching analysis of valve-sparing versus aortic root replacement in type A aortic dissection patients [^117TEuTS]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

Upon comprehensive analysis utilizing propensity score matching, Valve-Sparing Root Replacement (VSRR) has emerged as the superior surgical option, exhibiting improved 5-year survival outcomes in comparison to Aortic Root Replacement (ARR). This conclusion is fortified by the additional validation achieved through the application of inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis. Additional subgroup analysis revealed significantly higher survival probabilities for VSRR compared to ARR, specifically in patients aged < 60 years and those with a BMI > 24. Collectively, our findings present persuasive arguments in favor of a more widespread adoption of VSRR for appropriate patient cohorts. This strategic shift in surgical approach has the potential to elevate patient outcomes and augment OS rates in the context of aortic root disease management.

Nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis — study design/reporting limitations and potential publication bias: "Most of the included studies were small", and several "tested only 1 site per patient". Attrition reporting was often inadequate — "A major concern… is participant attrition", with many studies lacking retention data — and "investigators often did not report issues regarding safety and adverse events". Review-level choices may add bias, as the team "selected articles only in the English language", "did not assess the results across degrees of disease severity at baseline", and excluded studies reporting only probing depth. For publication bias assessment, they note it "should only be conducted when there are 10 or more studies", and "Only 3 treatments… met this criterion", leaving bias for other treatments unknown.

### Learning from medical errors [^113WhjN6]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Constructive feedback

Constructive feedback plays a pivotal role in the context of medical errors. It provides an avenue for promoting understanding, encouraging learning, and facilitating improvements in clinical practice. Constructive feedback focuses on guiding the interventional radiologist toward optimal patient care by analyzing mistakes in a non-punitive manner and suggesting actionable solutions. Let's delve into the significance of constructive feedback concerning medical errors:

Error recognition and accountability

In interventional radiology, where precise procedures are performed, constructive feedback helps healthcare professionals recognize errors and take ownership of their actions. It creates an environment where professionals can acknowledge mistakes without fear of punitive measures, promoting a culture of transparency and accountability.

Facilitation of continuous learning

Constructive feedback is a catalyst for continuous learning in interventional radiology. It allows radiologists, technologists, and other team members to analyze errors, understand their root causes, and acquire new knowledge and skills to improve future patient care. Learning from mistakes is a cornerstone of professional growth.

Promotion of open dialogue

Open communication is vital in interventional radiology to ensure the safety of patients. Constructive feedback encourages team members to openly discuss errors, share perspectives, and collaborate on solutions. This open dialogue is crucial for addressing errors comprehensively and preventing their recurrence.

Reduction of future errors

Through constructive feedback, healthcare professionals can identify specific areas where errors occurred and work on targeted improvements. This proactive approach helps reduce the likelihood of similar errors happening in future interventional radiology procedures.

Encouragement of reflection

Feedback prompts self-reflection among interventional radiology professionals. It allows them to critically assess their actions, decision-making processes, and procedural techniques. This reflection is essential for identifying areas where improvement is needed.

Strengthening of clinical competence

Constructive feedback serves as a tool to strengthen clinical competence in interventional radiology. By highlighting areas of strength and offering guidance on areas of weakness, it enables professionals to enhance their skills and knowledge.

Building of resilience and coping mechanisms

Medical errors in interventional radiology can be emotionally challenging. Constructive feedback provides a supportive environment where healthcare professionals can cope with the emotional impact of errors. This support contributes to building resilience and the ability to bounce back from adverse events.

In summary, constructive feedback in interventional radiology is integral to error recognition, learning, and continuous improvement. It fosters an environment where errors are seen as opportunities for growth and where patient safety remains paramount. Through constructive feedback, interventional radiology teams can enhance their skills, reduce the risk of errors, and ultimately provide the best possible care to their patients.

### Design and rationale of a prospective, collaborative meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials of angiotensin receptor antagonists in Marfan syndrome, based on individual patient data: a report from the Marfan treatment trialists' collaboration [^113ZEk3B]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome will be the annual rate of change of body surface area (BSA)–adjusted aortic root dimension z-score, measured at the aortic sinuses of Valsalva. The z-score is a dimensionless quantity, representing the signed number of standard deviations (SDs) away from the mean where an observation lies.

For the primary analysis, data from subjects with prior aortic root surgery at enrollment (enrolled in only a minority of trials) will be excluded. For subjects who underwent aortic root surgery or who died during the follow-up period, measurements of aortic root dimensions obtained before aortic surgery or death will be included in the analysis. Measurements of aortic root dimensions obtained after aortic root surgery will not be included.

For each trial, the imaging method of estimating aortic root dimension used for that trial's primary analysis will be used as the primary outcome measure in this meta-analysis. Aortic root dimensions will be scaled for body size and normalized to appropriate reference populations. For each patient, linear slopes of rate of change of BSA-adjusted aortic root dimension z-score will be calculated.

Sources of variation in the method of aortic root measurement (including, for example, leading-edge to leading-edge method, compared to inner-edge to inner-edge method; systolic compared to diastolic measures) and in the methods used for body size indexation and reference population normalization will be explored and reported (see Secondary outcomes below).

Root bimodality predicted by site-level factors.

a Feature importance ranking from a random forest classification model (Methods) identify total fine root biomass (g/m²) as the most important factor in predicting the modality of a site. Of these 12 factors (see Methods, site-level factors), land cover is the only categorical variable, the rest are continuous. The features in the orange bars are highlighted in (b, c). b Unimodal sites (n = 35, 990 g/m²) have nearly 3 times more root biomass than that of bimodal sites (n = 9, 368 g/m²; two-sided Student's t-test, p = 0.004). Note that y axis is on logarithmic scale. c Site modality (bimodal vs. unimodal) are not independently distributed across vegetation types (forest in green, grassland in blue, shrubland in purple, cultivated in red). Bimodal sites are more frequently associated with shrubland but less with grassland (two-sided chi-square test, p = 0.019, χ² = 9.6). In each box plot, the lower and upper bounds of the whiskers denote minima and maxima, the center line denotes the median, and the lower and upper bounds of the boxes represent the 25% and 75% quantiles, respectively.

### RinRK1 enhances NF receptors accumulation in nanodomain-like structures at root-hair tip [^1157sc2n]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To calculate the proportion of fluorescence signal accumulation in root-hair tips, we cut off the susceptible area of transgenic roots of the same length and placed them on a slide. The fluorescence of root hairs was then observed under spinning disk confocal microscopy. The statistical value's denominator was the total number of observed fluorescent root hairs, while the numerator was the value of fluorescence accumulation at the root-hair tips, thereby characterizing the proportion of fluorescence accumulation at the root-hair tips.

For all samples, the roots derived from at least two independent transformations were examined, with images of 5–10 roots/root segments captured per transformation.

Quantification and statistical analysis

For the phenotypic analysis, at least 10 individual plants were examined per accession. For the qRT-PCR analysis, tissue samples from 8–10 individual plants were pooled and three technical replicates were examined. All data are presented herein as the mean ± standard deviation and were compared using One-way ANOVA, Two-way ANOVA or two-tailed, two-sample Student's t -tests (✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01) whenever appropriate. The statistical analysis for each experiment is described in the figure legends.

### The long road to patient safety: a status report on patient safety systems [^112CuA7W]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports on medical errors and quality, national attention has focused on improving patient safety through changes in "systems" of care. These reports resulted in a new paradigm that, rather than centering on individual errors, focuses on the "systems" necessary to facilitate and enhance quality and protect patients.

Objectives

To assess the status of hospital patient safety systems since the release of the IOM reports and to identify changes over time in 2 states that collaborated on a patient safety project funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Survey of all acute care hospitals in Missouri and Utah at 2 points in time, in 2002 and 2004, using a 91-item comprehensive questionnaire (n = 126 for survey 1 and n = 128 for survey 2). To assess changes over time, we also studied the cohort of 107 hospitals that responded to both surveys.

Main Outcome Measures

Responses to the 91-question survey as well as changes in responses to the survey questions over an 18-month period. Seven latent variables were constructed to represent the most important patient safety constructs studied: computerized physician order entry systems, computerized test results, and assessments of adverse events; specific patient safety policies; use of data in patient safety programs; drug storage, administration, and safety procedures; manner of handling adverse event/error reporting; prevention policies; and root cause analysis. For each hospital, the 7 latent variables were summed to give an overall measure of the patient safety status of the hospital.

Results

Development and implementation of patient safety systems is at best modest. Self-reported regression in patient safety systems was also found. While 74% of hospitals reported full implementation of a written patient safety plan, nearly 9% reported no plan. The area of surgery appears to have the greatest level of patient safety systems. Other areas, such as medications, with a long history of efforts in patient safety and error prevention, showed improvements, but the percentage of hospitals with various safety systems was already high at baseline for many systems. Some findings are surprising, given the overall trends; for example, while a substantial percentage of hospitals have medication safety systems, only 34.1% reported full implementation at survey 2 of computerized physician order entry systems for medications, despite the growth of computer technology in general and in hospital billing systems in particular.

Conclusions

The current status of hospital patient safety systems is not close to meeting IOM recommendations. Data are consistent with recent reports that patient safety system progress is slow and is a cause for great concern. Efforts for improvement must be accelerated.

Root cause analysis is often suggested as a means of conducting quality assurance, but few physicians are familiar with the actual process. We describe a detailed approach to conducting root cause analysis, with an illustrative case to explain the technique. By studying how root cause analysis is applied to the case of a missed epidural abscess, the reader will see how the process reveals systems improvements that reduce the risk that such a miss will happen again. Following this process will be helpful in using root cause analysis to fix not just individuals' issues but also but systemwide quality assurance issues to improve patient care.

Subgroup analysis of root procedure

The rate of aortic root replacement was 14.2% (154/1082) in the non-Cabrol shunt group and 50.3% (1107/2201) in the Cabrol shunt group (p < 0.001). Stratified by root procedure, patients with Cabrol shunt were likely to have similar risk of operative mortality compared with those without in patients without root replacement (OR 1.054 (0.747 to 1.487); p = 0.764) and in patients with root replacement (OR 1.194 (0.563 to 2.536); p = 0.644) (P interaction = 0.765). After additional adjustment for multivariable and PS analysis, the results were still similar (figure 2; online supplemental table S1).

### Experience feedback committee in emergency medicine: a tool for security management [^114LuxSi]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In this setting, the EFC is supposed to follow the procedure set up in accordance with the method proposed by Air France Consulting. The EFC is composed of diverse professionals and the meetings are conducted according to a standardised plan: (1) reading the list of incidents reported in the previous month, (2) choosing a priority incident to analyse during the following month, (3) choosing the professional responsible for the analysis, (4) listening to the analysis report from the previous month, (5) choosing corrective actions, and (6) monitoring ongoing actions. The analysis is performed during the month following the EFC by a designated person. The person in charge of the analysis analyses the incident according to the ORION method. This method has six main steps.
Collecting data. The professional responsible for the analysis collects relevant information concerning the incident using debriefing meetings, interviews, document analysis or any other necessary means.
Describing the chronological facts occurring before, during and after the incident. From each fact mentioned, the professional has to determine whether guidelines for good practice exist at the department, hospital or national level and if there is a gap between the facts and these guidelines. Chronological facts, existing guidelines and identified errors have to be described.
Describing the causes of errors (ie, gaps between guidelines and facts) that are sought in different areas: political, organisational, working conditions, team functioning, procedures, actors and the patient.
Looking for and describing the latent factors that could have contributed to the occurrence of the errors. These latent factors are sought in the same areas as the causes of errors. However, their links to the incident are less tangible.
Setting up corrective actions. The aim is to reduce the risk of adverse events by correcting latent factors contributing to them.
Writing a report of the analysis.

Data collection

All written documents from the EFC of the ED were analysed. For the purposes of this study, reported incidents were classified according to the department that had reported the incident, the type of incident and the consequence for the patient using the International Classification for Patient Safety. Written reports from meetings were analysed using a standardised procedure that followed the steps of an EFC analysis (as described above). Analysis reports were analysed using a standardised procedure that followed the steps of the ORION method. The analysis of all documents was performed by two independent investigators. Differences in rating were discussed until a consensus was reached.

Statistical analysis

Qualitative data are reported as numbers and percentages. Quantitative data are reported as medians and IQR.

### Root-cause analysis of an airway filter occlusion: a way to improve the reliability of the respiratory circuit [^117RDUy9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Background

To show how root-cause analysis can identify system-level factors causing critical incidents and accidents, we present an investigation of the occlusion of an airway filter during anaesthesia.

Method

The investigation was based on a framework specifically developed for the analysis of medical accidents. This framework helped to identify the chronology and outcome of the case, the care management problems and the factors that led to the event. Information was obtained by interviewing the anaesthesiologist in charge of the patient.

Results

Occlusion was not recognized because the filter was hidden under the drapes and below the patient's head. To reduce the frequency of this event, we recommend that filters should be visible, placed above the level of the patient's body, or mounted on the expiratory circuit, at a distance from patient's airway.

Conclusions

To allow appropriate corrective actions, critical incidents and accidents should be systematically investigated using root-cause analysis.

### The latitudinal pattern of fine root intraspecific trait variation among species in plant communities [^112oCRL7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) drives plant species performance in natural communities and can have substantial influences on multiple ecological processes. However, current studies on plant belowground (root) ITV are limited in trait coverage, spatial scale and biome type. Here, by conducting in-situ measurements of root traits in three forests from temperate to subtropics and compiling a large-scale dataset of root traits, we explore the latitudinal pattern of root ITV among species within natural plant community, its drivers and implications. Our results show that intraspecific variation constitute a substantial component of the total variation in root traits, and the physiological trait, root exudation, exhibit the highest ITV among traits. The extent of root ITV tends to increase with root diameter across species, with thick-root species having higher root ITV than thin-root species. We also find a significant latitudinal gradient for species' intraspecific root trait variation in natural communities, with increasing ITV towards the equator. These findings can simplify the incorporation of root ITV in trait-based ecology, and contribute to understanding of plant species performance and community assembly under environmental changes.

### Homograft implantation techniques in the aortic position: to preserve or replace the aortic root? [^117YHojY]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

One determinant of durability of the homograft in the aortic position is the implantation technique. This study uses meta-analytical techniques to evaluate the differences in early and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing aortic homograft implantation with either a root replacement or a root preserving technique.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature (1965–2005) reporting results after homograft implantation in the aortic position with emphasis in the implantation technique was performed. Random and fixed-effects models were used. Cumulative and influential meta-analysis, graphic exploration, and sensitivity analysis were carried out to explain the heterogeneity between studies and to investigate potential publication bias.

Results

Eleven studies were included. None of the studies was randomized. There was no significant difference in early mortality between root replacement and root preserving groups (odds ratio = 2.57 with 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68–9.72 in random-effects model) and the root replacement group had a significantly lower rate of reoperation during long-term follow-up (hazard ratio = 0.55 with 95% CI 0.38–0.80 in random-effects model). Subgroup analysis focusing on patients having the subcoronary technique for homograft implantation showed similar results. Significant heterogeneity between studies can be detected. No publication bias was found.

Conclusions

There was no significant difference in early mortality between root replacement and root preserving groups. However, the root replacement technique group had a significantly lower rate of reoperation during long-term follow-up. Excluding outliers identified in a funnel plot reduced the heterogeneity and reached a similar conclusion.

### Comparative single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis revealed localized and cell type-specific pathways governing root-microbiome interactions [^111HvEzZ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Roots can recognize and differentially respond to beneficial and pathogenic microbes, which are fundamental for maintaining root microbiome homeostasis, plasticity, and plant fitness. Meanwhile, roots are highly heterogeneous tissues with complex cell-type compositions and spatially distinct developmental stages. We found that beneficial microbe specifically induces the expression of translation-related genes in the proximal meristem cells, and diverse ribosome proteins and translation regulators are necessary for beneficial microbe-mediated growth promotion. Notably, the root maturation zone can still mount localized immune responses to root pathogens, including genes related to camalexin and triterpene biosynthesis. A triterpene biosynthesis mutant blocked the microbiome reshaping process upon GMI1000 infection. Our results indicate roots may have specialized immune responses in the maturation zone, and provide important insights and vital resources for further elucidating regulators of root-microbe interactions and microbiome reshaping.

### Cell kinetics of auxin transport and activity in arabidopsis root growth and skewing [^113Towjp]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Auxin is a key regulator of plant growth and development. Local auxin biosynthesis and intercellular transport generates regional gradients in the root that are instructive for processes such as specification of developmental zones that maintain root growth and tropic responses. Here we present a toolbox to study auxin-mediated root development that features: (i) the ability to control auxin synthesis with high spatio-temporal resolution and (ii) single-cell nucleus tracking and morphokinetic analysis infrastructure. Integration of these two features enables cutting-edge analysis of root development at single-cell resolution based on morphokinetic parameters under normal growth conditions and during cell-type-specific induction of auxin biosynthesis. We show directional auxin flow in the root and refine the contributions of key players in this process. In addition, we determine the quantitative kinetics of Arabidopsis root meristem skewing, which depends on local auxin gradients but does not require PIN2 and AUX1 auxin transporter activities. Beyond the mechanistic insights into root development, the tools developed here will enable biologists to study kinetics and morphology of various critical processes at the single cell-level in whole organisms.

### Unexpected hypoglycemia in a critically ill patient [^1173Tvrc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Administration of the wrong medication is a serious and understudied problem. Because physicians are not directly involved in the drug administration process, they tend to overlook the possibility of adverse drug events and medication errors in their differential diagnoses of patient illnesses or acute deterioration. This article analyzes the case of a patient with iatrogenic hypoglycemia due to administration of the wrong medication: Insulin instead of heparin was used to flush the patient's arterial line. In addition to assessing the results of the institution's "root-cause analysis" of the factors contributing to this particular adverse event and the institution's response, this article reviews the literature on preventing medication errors. Key strategies that might have been helpful in this case include using checklists for common emergency conditions (such as altered level of consciousness) and automated paging for "panic laboratory values", as well as instituting protocols for medication administration. Changing the system of administering medications by bar coding drugs, with checks of the medication, patient, and provider, could have prevented this accident. Finally, organizations need to strive for a "culture of safety" by providing opportunities to discuss errors and adverse events in constructive, supportive environments and by resisting pressure to find a scapegoat.

### A continental scale analysis reveals widespread root bimodality [^113ovCNd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Implications of root bimodality for subsoil nutrients and carbon

To evaluate the potential impact of root bimodality on plant resource uptake, we next analyzed the spatial distribution of soil nutrients in relation to the vertical distribution of roots. We choose to use root biomass as a surrogate for root uptake as some biomass proliferation represents a direct plant investment for resource acquisition. In natural settings, however, the realized uptake rate often depends on nutrient availability in the soil solution. But the use of root biomass provides a good estimate of resource uptake potential, as one would expect strong correlation between root biomass and realized nutrient uptake when averaged over time and space. Alternative metrics for root uptake also include root surface area and root length (not available in our dataset); both correlate with root biomass.

When expressed relative to the abundance of fine root biomass (see Methods), relative soil nutrients appear to increase in abundance with increasing depth. For example, the relative phosphorus (P) abundance from site "YELL" (Yellowstone National Park NEON) increases with depth (Fig. 4a; r² = 0.85), indicating that subsoil phosphorus is becoming relatively more abundant from the perspective of the roots.

### Aboveground and belowground sizes are aligned in the unified spectrum of plant form and function [^116azrhj]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results remained consistent when root size traits were progressively included into the UPFS (Supplementary Table 2). The original UPFS (without root size traits) had 5.67 equivalent dimensions (END), and including root size traits increased END by much less than expected under the inclusion of an uncorrelated trait (END Random = 6.49, Fig. 4): 2.02% increase when only lateral root spread was added (END UPFS and Lr = 5.68), 24.40% increase when only rooting depth was added (END UPFS and Dr = 5.87), and 12.65% increase when both root size traits were added (END UPFS and Dr+Lr = 5.77). These results indicate that most of the variation introduced by root size in our dataset is already accounted by the UPFS traits. Progressive inclusion of root size did not alter the fundamental structure of the reduced spaces, as indicated by Pearson's correlation coefficients among angles between pairs of traits in the reduced spaces close to 1 (Fig. 5a-c). Effectively, this means that the fundamental relationships between traits in the reduced spaces are not influenced by the inclusion of root-size traits.

Coronectomy is a well-documented surgical technique for the treatment of high-risk third molars, but the fate of retained roots remains controversial. This case report describes the histologic analysis of retained root fragments.

Patient and Methods

A 44-year-old man treated with coronectomy of a left mandibular third molar requested the extraction of the retained roots. The patient was asymptomatic and the retained roots were extracted 18 months after coronectomy at the patient's request.

Results

The extracted roots were histologically evaluated and the results showed the presence of vital pulp tissue.

Conclusion

Histologic analysis showed that retained roots remain vital after coronectomy.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis by means of scaling and root planing with or without adjuncts [^114k25Mp]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic periodontitis — evidence synthesis for SRP with or without adjuncts states that an expert panel appraised 72 randomized controlled trials; on average, SRP compared with no treatment resulted in a 0.5-mm improvement in clinical attachment level (CAL) with a moderate level of certainty; adjunctive use over SRP as a sole treatment averaged between 0.2 and 0.6 mm with certainty either moderate or low; for SDD, 4 trials showed with moderate certainty a small and statistically significant adjunctive benefit; and 24 trials evaluated systemic antimicrobials and regimens.

### Exploring the roots of unintended safety threats associated with the introduction of hospital ePrescribing systems and candidate avoidance and / or mitigation strategies: a qualitative study [^113fPpeo]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hospital electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) systems offer a wide range of patient safety benefits. Like other hospital health information technology interventions, however, they may also introduce new areas of risk. Despite recent advances in identifying these risks, the development and use of ePrescribing systems is still leading to numerous unintended consequences, which may undermine improvement and threaten patient safety. These negative consequences need to be analysed in the design, implementation and use of these systems. We therefore aimed to understand the roots of these reported threats and identify candidate avoidance/mitigation strategies.

Methods

We analysed a longitudinal, qualitative study of the implementation and adoption of ePrescribing systems in six English hospitals, each being conceptualised as a case study. Data included semistructured interviews, observations of implementation meetings and system use, and a collection of relevant documents. We analysed data first within and then across the case studies.

Results

Our dataset included 214 interviews, 24 observations and 18 documents. We developed a taxonomy of factors underlying unintended safety threats in: (1) suboptimal system design, including lack of support for complex medication administration regimens, lack of effective integration between different systems, and lack of effective automated decision support tools; (2) inappropriate use of systems-in particular, too much reliance on the system and introduction of workarounds; and (3) suboptimal implementation strategies resulting from partial roll-outs/dual systems and lack of appropriate training. We have identified a number of system and organisational strategies that could potentially avoid or reduce these risks.

Conclusions

Imperfections in the design, implementation and use of ePrescribing systems can give rise to unintended consequences, including safety threats. Hospitals and suppliers need to implement short- and long-term strategies in terms of the technology and organisation to minimise the unintended safety risks.

### Hair roots as an mRNA source for mutation analysis of usher syndrome-causing genes [^112ya46Z]. Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

mRNA is an important tool to study the effects of particular mutations on the mode of splicing and transcripts. However, it is often difficult to isolate mRNA because the organ or tissue in which the gene is expressed cannot be sampled. We previously identified two probable splicing mutations (c.6485+5G > A and c.8559–2A > G) during the mutation analysis of USH2A in Japanese Usher syndrome (USH) type 2 patients, but we could not observe their effects on splicing because the gene is expressed in only a few tissues/organs, and is not expressed in peripheral lymphocytes. In this study, we used hair roots as a source of mRNA of USH-causing genes, and successfully detected the expression of seven, except USH1C and CLRN1, of the nine USH-causing genes. We used RNA extracted from the hair roots of a patient who has both c.6485+5G > A and c.8559–2A > G mutations in USH2A in a compound heterozygous state to observe the effects of these mutations on transcripts. Reverse-transcription PCR analysis revealed that c.6485+5G > A and c.8559–2A > G inactivated splice donor and splice acceptor sites, respectively, and caused skipping of exons. Thus, RNA extracted from hair roots is a potential powerful and convenient tool for the mutation analysis of USH-causing genes.

### The core metabolome and root exudation dynamics of three phylogenetically distinct plant species [^115EJ51s]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Root exudates are plant-derived, exported metabolites likely shaping root-associated microbiomes by acting as nutrients and signals. However, root exudation dynamics are unclear and thus also, if changes in exudation are reflected in changes in microbiome structure. Here, we assess commonalities and differences between exudates of different plant species, diurnal exudation dynamics, as well as the accompanying methodological aspects of exudate sampling. We find that exudates should be collected for hours rather than days as many metabolite abundances saturate over time. Plant growth in sterile, nonsterile, or sugar-supplemented environments significantly alters exudate profiles. A comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, and Medicago truncatula shoot, root, and root exudate metabolite profiles reveals clear differences between these species, but also a core metabolome for tissues and exudates. Exudate profiles also exhibit a diurnal signature. These findings add to the methodological and conceptual groundwork for future exudate studies to improve understanding of plant-microbe interactions.

### An investigation of radiation treatment learning opportunities in relation to the radiation oncology electronic medical record: a single institution experience [^111zuW9S]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

It is a well-established fact that deviations from standardized processes in medicine are unavoidable due to the so-called human factor and such deviations are, perhaps, even more likely to happen in more complex (modern) radiation oncology environments. The modern RO-EMR represents a sophisticated human-computer interface that has the potential to reduce human driven errors and improve patient safety by way of enhanced and improved communication and by automation of processes that may be more vulnerable to human error. However, if not optimized for accuracy and efficiency of workflow, or if simply misused, the RO-EMR can also affect clinical workflow adversely and, thus, inadvertently contribute to deviations from intended processes that could affect safety and quality of patient treatment. As routinely used, the RO-EMR is a central repository for information and facilitates essential communication between health care workers, with both data input and output functionality. One of the mechanisms for data input to the EMR is a human-computer interface where information is manually entered into the RO-EMR. On the output side, there is another human-computer interface used to deliver information to either a human who must receive, interpret, and execute the output of information, or another computer-computer interface for treatment execution.

As it has been well described in To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System", Not all errors result in harm… Errors that do not result in harm also represent an important opportunity to identify system improvements having the potential to prevent adverse events. Building safety into processes of care is a more effective way to reduce errors than blaming individuals". In our institution, we have identified the importance of documenting incidents to enable the opportunities for future improvements and established an internal incident learning system (ILS) more than one decade ago. Additionally, to encourage all level of staff members to identify any unsafe conditions (with or without harms) to promote the culture of safety, we have started to identify these cases as "learning opportunities" (LO), instead of using terms such as errors, events, or incidents. We believe that recording of circumstances that lead to unintended deviations from standard process can allow for learning through root cause analysis, and potentially lead to effective mitigation strategies, which can ultimately improve quality of care and patient safety. Lastly, evaluation of "families" of related LO from an ILS, based on their relationship to the RO-EMR, may help identify more meaningful workflow deficiencies compared with common root cause analysis practices.

### Evolutionary conservation of a core root microbiome across plant phyla along a tropical soil chronosequence [^115xcSX3]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Cooloola core root microbiome

The number of Cooloola core root OTUs varies depending on analysis — 369 with indicator species analysis(Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3), 302 using a univariate Welch's t -test implemented in STAMP(Supplementary Table 4), and 30 with sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLSDA) implemented in mixOmics(Supplementary Table 5). Nevertheless, core root OTUs from the three analyses completely overlap phylogenetically except for the bacterial genus Methylovirgula indicated in STAMP (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 6), and represent 47 and 40 classifiable and unclassifiable bacterial genera, respectively. The core root OTUs comprise up to 33.2% of root communities based on relative abundance depending on analysis (Supplementary Tables 3–5), some of which are well-known plant–root-associated bacteria, notably Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Burkholderia, and Azospirillum. Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium are best known as root-nodulating bacteria of legumes, and supply their hosts with biologically fixed nitrogen. The high relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium across multiple plant phyla in the present study suggests that their association with non-legumes may be more widespread than previously appreciated. Non-leguminous plants including Arabidopsis, corn, and tomato respond to Bradyrhizobium nodulation factors using a common molecular mechanism, suggesting that this association predates the evolution of legumes within the eudicots.

### The core metabolome and root exudation dynamics of three phylogenetically distinct plant species [^1146ATgM]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The core metabolome of roots and exudates

We were further interested which compounds were present in roots and exudates of all three plant species, as they could represent a 'core metabolome'. These compounds could be present in roots and exudates of many plant species and could thus be important for interaction with the core microbiome associated with plant roots.

To investigate this question, the relative abundance data of metabolites was converted to presence/absence data (present if above background in more than 50% of samples), as the metabolite extraction procedures of exudates and tissues did not allow for quantitative comparison. Overall, 150 metabolites were detected in roots and exudates. Inspection revealed that half of the metabolites (43%) was present in roots of all species, comprising the root core metabolome (Fig. 6). One fifth of metabolites (21%) was detected in exudates of all species, comprising the core exudate metabolome (Fig. 6). The exudate core metabolites were also detected in roots of all species and are thus a subset of the core root metabolome (total root core metabolome: 43% + 21% = 64% of all metabolites). The chemical classes detected in the root and exudate core metabolomes were similar, comprising of amino acids and other organic acids, nucleosides and derivatives, carbohydrates and conjugates, and in the case of roots, lipids (Fig. 6). The root core metabolites did not show a diurnal signature, whereas 53% of the exudate core metabolites showed a differential abundance between exudate end-of-day and end-of night timepoints (Fig. 6).

### Nonlinearity of root trait relationships and the root economics spectrum [^114tqrkX]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In woody species, we also tested whether the data source (i.e. studies reporting correlated trait relationships not supporting the RES: negative RTD-root diameter and positive RN-root diameter correlations vs. studies reporting uncorrelated traits) influenced the relationship between root diameter and RTD using a linear mixed model using the lmerTest packagein R. There were a few studies on woody species with low RTD reporting trait relationships only partially supporting the RES (e.g. both positive RTD-root diameter and RN-root diameter relationships, see Supplementary Data 1 for details). To test whether these few studies could influence the nonlinear root trait relationships for studies reporting correlated trait relationships, we tested the trait relationships both with and without these studies using the anova method in R. The influence of these studies was not significant (F = 0.93, p = 0.54 for the RTD-root diameter relationships; F = 0.54, p = 0.93 for the RN-root diameter relationships). Therefore, we added these studies to the studies reporting correlated trait relationships not supporting the RES. Then, using a linear mixed model, we tested the effects of the fixed factors (i.e. root diameter, data source, root sampling, climatic zone, and the study nested within the data source) and the interactions of root diameter with the data source and with root sampling, respectively. Climatic zones were classified as tropical, subtropical, temperate, boreal, and Mediterranean. Study (see Supplementary Data 1) was not considered as a random factor because they were not classified randomly but assigned to one of the data sources according to their trait relationships. Root sampling referred to studies collecting the first order roots and studies collecting roots up to the third order, respectively. Furthermore, for woody species, we explored whether the contradicting relationships between root diameter and RTD (see Introduction and Supplementary Data 1) as observed in previous studies were due to different species pools. To do so, we first compared the frequency of species with high RTD between studies reporting correlated trait relationships and studies reporting uncorrelated traits. The mean RTD (0.236 g cm⁻³) across these studies was used to separate low- and high-RTD roots. We then ran nonlinear regressions for the relationships between RTD and root diameter and between RN and root diameter.

### Root-cause analysis and health failure mode and effect analysis: two leading techniques in health care quality assessment [^11272qpe]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

In this review article, the authors provide a detailed series of guidelines for effectively performing root-cause analysis (RCA) and health failure mode and effect analysis (HFMEA). RCA is a retrospective approach used to ascertain the "root cause" of a problem that has already occurred, whereas HFMEA is a prospective risk assessment tool whose aim is to recognize risks to patient safety. RCA and HFMEA are used for the prevention of errors or recurring errors to create a safer workplace, maintain high standards in health care quality, and incorporate time-saving and cost-saving modifications to favorably affect the patient care environment. The principles and techniques provided here should allow reviewers to better understand the features of RCA and HFMEA and how to apply these processes appropriately. These principles include how to organize a team, identify root causes, seed out proximate causes, graphically describe the process, conduct a hazard analysis, and develop and implement potential action plans.

Definitions generally used in patient safety

To discuss patient safety, it is important to understand some key definitions commonly used in this field. Here are several definitions frequently referenced in the context of patient safety:

Patient safety

Patient safety refers to the prevention of harm to patients during their interactions with healthcare systems. It involves minimising risks, avoiding errors, and improving the overall quality of care to ensure the well-being and safety of patients.

Adverse event

An adverse event refers to an unintended or harmful incident that occurs during healthcare delivery. It can result from medical errors, system failures or a combination of factors and may cause injury, disability, or even death to a patient.

Medical error

A medical error is an act of commission (doing something wrong) or omission (failing to do the right thing) that leads to an unintended outcome or patient harm. It can occur at any stage of the healthcare process, including diagnosis, treatment, medication administration and communication.

Near miss

A near miss, also known as a close call or a near-incident, is an event or situation that could have resulted in harm to a patient but was prevented or did not cause harm due to timely intervention, luck or other mitigating factors. Near misses are important opportunities for identifying and addressing potential risks in healthcare processes.

Root cause analysis

Root cause analysis is a systematic approach used to identify the underlying causes or factors that contribute to adverse events or errors. It involves investigating the event, identifying contributing factors, and developing strategies to prevent future occurrences.

Safety culture

Safety culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours within an organisation or healthcare setting that prioritise and promote safety. It encompasses the collective commitment to open communication, learning from errors and continuous improvement to ensure patient safety.

Sentinel event

A sentinel event is a severe, unexpected and generally avoidable adverse event that results in serious harm, death or the risk of serious harm to a patient. Sentinel events often trigger in-depth investigations, reporting and the implementation of preventive measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Just culture

Just culture refers to a fair and balanced approach to managing errors and adverse events, emphasising accountability while also recognising that errors can result from system failures rather than individual negligence. It aims to foster a non-punitive environment that encourages reporting, learning, and improvement.

Understanding these definitions provides a foundation for discussing patient safety and enables the implementation of effective strategies to improve healthcare practices and enhance patient outcomes.

### The latitudinal pattern of fine root intraspecific trait variation among species in plant communities [^11487dbi]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Here, we focus on identifying the structure of root trait variation across ecological scales and the latitudinal pattern of root ITV among species in plant communities on a large scale, by conducting in-situ measurements in three geographically distant forests and by compiling a large scale dataset of root ITV at the species level in natural habitats. For the in-situ measurements in forests differing in terms of climate, species composition and richness, and soil nutrient conditions, we target seven root traits associated with chemistry, morphology, architecture and physiology (RN, root tissue density [RTD], root diameter [RD], SRL, SRA, branching intensity [BI] and RE; 51 species in total). For large scale analysis, we target four readily available root traits in worldwide databases (RN, RTD, RD, and SRL; 478 species in total). All these root traits underpin the main dimensions of root functions and are linked to multiple ecosystem processes such as community assembly and nutrient cycling. Specifically, we decompose root trait variation across four nested ecological scales, i.e. individuals, species, plant functional types, and sites, and quantify the relative contribution of intraspecific variation to overall root trait variation based on our in-situ measurements. We also evaluate root ITV in a number of root traits on a relatively large scale, and attempt to reveal the latitudinal gradient of root ITV among species in natural plant communities and explore how climate and species attributes influence root ITV. We hypothesize that the degree of intraspecific root trait variation among species within community increases from high to low latitudes, given the contrasting effects of environmental filtering (inhibition) and plant competition (facilitation) on the conspecific trait diversity (Fig. 1).

### Niche and host-associated functional signatures of the root surface microbiome [^116i71ih]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Plant microbiomes are critical to host adaptation and impact plant productivity and health. Root-associated microbiomes vary by soil and host genotype, but the contribution of these factors to community structure and metabolic potential has not been fully addressed. Here we characterize root microbial communities of two disparate agricultural crops grown in the same natural soil in a controlled and replicated experimental system. Metagenomic (genetic potential) analysis identifies a core set of functional genes associated with root colonization in both plant hosts, and metatranscriptomic (functional expression) analysis revealed that most genes enriched in the root zones are expressed. Root colonization requires multiple functional capabilities, and these capabilities are enriched at the community level. Differences between the root-associated microbial communities from different plants are observed at the genus or species level, and are related to root-zone environmental factors.

### Root cause analysis of NaI contamination [^111sASok]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

Establishing a cause-and-effect relationship for an adverse event is one of the key steps in preventing them and involves multiple people, resources, and steps, thus requiring a root cause analysis. Here, we describe a root cause analysis performed in the nuclear medicine department for an event involving Na 131 I contamination. Oral administration of Na 131 I in a capsule minimizes the risk of contamination and spills. However, the patient must be able to swallow a capsule. Na 131 I in capsule form is currently in widespread use for treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. Na 131 I in liquid form is rarely available immediately on demand and must be ordered at least 24–48 h in advance of the planned administration. The events leading to the incident, immediate remedial steps taken, and subsequent root cause analysis are described. The corrective actions taken after the root cause analysis, as well as the subsequent effectiveness of these actions, are mentioned. There may be one or multiple causes for an adverse event. It is important to identify the root cause. Corrective actions derived from the root cause can help prevent similar adverse events in the future. Therapeutic procedures in nuclear medicine involve unsealed radioactive sources, further adding a separate layer of immediate steps and reporting to the root cause analysis itself.

### Aboveground and belowground sizes are aligned in the unified spectrum of plant form and function [^113WaMSj]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The recent integration of the global spectrum of plant form and functionand the root economics spaceshowed that these can be summarised in a four-dimensional space where aboveground and fine root strategies of plants are independent(UPFS, Fig. 1). Yet, it remained unclear how root size would fit into this scheme. By integrating maximum rooting depth and lateral root spread to the UPFS framework, we demonstrate that (1) above- and belowground plant sizes are strongly aligned, forming a single dimension of variation; and consequently, (2) the inclusion of root size traits does not impact the dimensionality and fundamental structure of the UPFS.

### Evolutionary history resolves global organization of root functional traits [^1179FFvK]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Plant roots have greatly diversified in form and function since the emergence of the first land plants, but the global organization of functional traits in roots remains poorly understood. Here we analyse a global dataset of 10 functionally important root traits in metabolically active first-order roots, collected from 369 species distributed across the natural plant communities of 7 biomes. Our results identify a high degree of organization of root traits across species and biomes, and reveal a pattern that differs from expectations based on previous studies of leaf traits. Root diameter exerts the strongest influence on root trait variation across plant species, growth forms and biomes. Our analysis suggests that plants have evolved thinner roots since they first emerged in land ecosystems, which has enabled them to markedly improve their efficiency of soil exploration per unit of carbon invested and to reduce their dependence on symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. We also found that diversity in root morphological traits is greatest in the tropics, where plant diversity is highest and many ancestral phylogenetic groups are preserved. Diversity in root morphology declines sharply across the sequence of tropical, temperate and desert biomes, presumably owing to changes in resource supply caused by seasonally inhospitable abiotic conditions. Our results suggest that root traits have evolved along a spectrum bounded by two contrasting strategies of root life: an ancestral 'conservative' strategy in which plants with thick roots depend on symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi for soil resources and a more-derived 'opportunistic' strategy in which thin roots enable plants to more efficiently leverage photosynthetic carbon for soil exploration. These findings imply that innovations of belowground traits have had an important role in preparing plants to colonize new habitats, and in generating biodiversity within and across biomes.
