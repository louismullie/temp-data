## Question

Anticoagulation in afib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical rationale and magnitude of stroke risk in AF. Then, I should verify the risk stratification framework and thresholds for anticoagulation. Next, I will compare anticoagulant options, including DOACs versus warfarin, and special populations. After that, I need to check peri-cardioversion and peri-ablation anticoagulation strategies. I will then examine bleeding risk assessment and how to use it in decision-making. Finally, I should review practical implementation, monitoring, and special scenarios like device-detected AF, ACS/PCI, and CKD, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale. AF increases stroke risk approximately fivefold, and strokes in AF are more often cardioembolic and disabling, which is why stroke prevention is a cornerstone of AF management and why anticoagulation confers substantial absolute risk reduction in appropriately selected patients [^56000611] [^08b94442].

> I need to verify the risk stratification framework. Contemporary guidelines use CHA2DS2-VASc to estimate annual thromboembolic risk and guide therapy; anticoagulation is recommended when the estimated annual risk is at least 2% (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women), and considered when the risk is 1–2% (CHA2DS2-VASc 1 in men or 2 in women), with shared decision-making emphasized in intermediate risk [^754f89b5] [^974e97a2] [^67320774].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about AF pattern. I should confirm that the temporal pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent) does not alter anticoagulation indications; guidelines explicitly advise that stroke risk and anticoagulation decisions should not be based on AF pattern, so even paroxysmal AF warrants anticoagulation if risk thresholds are met [^5407e296] [^0f857faf].

> Next, I should review anticoagulant choices. DOACs are first-line over warfarin for most patients with nonvalvular AF because they reduce intracranial hemorrhage and, in several trials, reduce stroke/systemic embolism versus warfarin; exceptions include moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves, where warfarin remains standard, and dabigatran should be avoided in mechanical valves [^8b0157aa] [^5c9080f1].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative safety profile. DOACs consistently lower intracranial hemorrhage versus warfarin, but gastrointestinal bleeding risk varies by agent; apixaban tends to have the most favorable GI bleeding profile, whereas dabigatran 150 mg, edoxaban 60 mg, and rivaroxaban carry higher GI bleeding risk than warfarin, which matters when selecting among DOACs in patients with GI risk factors [^8b0157aa].

> I will now examine peri-cardioversion anticoagulation. For elective cardioversion when AF duration is ≥ 48 hours, uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before and continued for at least 4 weeks after is recommended, or alternatively, pre-cardioversion transesophageal echocardiography to exclude LAA thrombus with heparin bridging if a thrombus is found; for unscheduled cardioversion, initiate anticoagulation as soon as possible and continue for at least 4 weeks afterward [^026d338c] [^8145c17a] [^7da60f34] [^a2dd2a27].

> Let me consider peri-ablation anticoagulation. Uninterrupted oral anticoagulation is recommended for AF ablation; for warfarin, uninterrupted therapy with INR 2.0–3.0 is standard, and for DOACs, either uninterrupted or minimally interrupted strategies are acceptable, with intraprocedural heparin used universally to maintain activated clotting time targets [^c6d07061] [^20857c24] [^721aa398].

> I should double-check bleeding risk assessment. HAS-BLED helps identify modifiable bleeding risks and prompts closer follow-up, but it should not be used in isolation to deny anticoagulation; even patients with high HAS-BLED often have a favorable net clinical benefit from anticoagulation when stroke risk is elevated, so the score's best use is to mitigate bleeding risks rather than to withhold indicated therapy [^cae7c5d3] [^e2f6d6ec].

> Next, I should review practical implementation. Before starting a DOAC, assess renal and hepatic function and recheck at least annually; avoid non–evidence-based DOAC dosing, which increases both thrombosis and bleeding; manage drug–drug interactions, particularly CYP3A4 and P-gp modulators; and for warfarin, target INR 2.0–3.0 with attention to TTR and interaction management to minimize preventable events [^53adea19] [^39ae9e2c] [^1c16a6e6] [^f263b557].

> But wait, what about special populations. In ACS/PCI, prefer DOACs over VKAs and minimize triple therapy duration, typically using dual therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor plus OAC after early aspirin cessation; in CKD, dose-adjust DOACs per label and avoid certain agents in ESRD; in device-detected subclinical AF, evidence is evolving and routine anticoagulation is not mandated, so decisions should be individualized pending trial data; in critical illness with new-onset AF, data on anticoagulation benefit are limited and decisions should be cautious and individualized [^3d8ee8ee] [^5c9080f1] [^65cd2e65] [^e453d0b3].

> I should confirm the role of aspirin. Aspirin is not recommended for stroke prevention in AF unless there is another compelling indication such as CAD; multiple trials and meta-analyses show aspirin is inferior to anticoagulation and should not be used solely for AF stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF [^30e8123f] [^e2f6d6ec].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis. Anticoagulation is indicated for AF patients at elevated stroke risk by CHA2DS2-VASc, with DOACs preferred in most nonvalvular AF, uninterrupted anticoagulation around cardioversion and ablation, bleeding risk mitigation rather than using bleeding scores to deny therapy, and periodic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risks to adjust therapy over time; this approach maximizes net clinical benefit and aligns with contemporary ACC/AHA/ACCP and ESC guidance [^754f89b5] [^52741812] [^0f857faf].

---

Anticoagulation is indicated for **AF patients with elevated stroke risk** [^754f89b5] (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women) [^c0505b5e] to prevent ischemic stroke and systemic embolism [^ae61dbf4]. DOACs are **preferred over warfarin** [^8b0157aa] for most patients because they lower intracranial hemorrhage and are more convenient, but warfarin remains first-line for mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^5c9080f1]. For low-risk patients (CHA₂DS₂-VASc 0 in men or 1 in women), **no anticoagulation is recommended** [^e2f6d6ec]. Bleeding risk should be assessed (HAS-BLED) [^e2f6d6ec] to guide monitoring and risk mitigation, but high bleeding risk alone should not preclude anticoagulation when stroke risk is high [^cae7c5d3]. Anticoagulation should be interrupted peri-procedurally only when necessary, with minimal interruption and no routine bridging [^9b79f7dc].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation

Anticoagulation is **recommended for AF patients with elevated thromboembolic risk** [^754f89b5], stratified by the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score:

| **Cha₂ds₂-vasc score** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women | Oral anticoagulation recommended [^754f89b5] [^c0505b5e] |
| 1 in men or 2 in women | Consider anticoagulation (shared decision-making) [^974e97a2] [^e2f6d6ec] |
| 0 in men or 1 in women | No anticoagulation recommended [^e2f6d6ec] |

---

## Choice of anticoagulant therapy

DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) are **preferred over warfarin** [^8b0157aa] for most patients with nonvalvular AF because they offer:

- Lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage [^8b0157aa]
- Fewer dietary and drug interactions
- No routine laboratory monitoring required [^310cf6d5]

Warfarin remains **first-line for patients with mechanical heart valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis** [^5c9080f1] because DOACs are contraindicated in these settings.

---

## Risk stratification tools

The **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score** is the standard tool for assessing stroke risk in AF [^67320774]. The **HAS-BLED score** assesses bleeding risk and guides monitoring and risk mitigation strategies, but high bleeding risk alone should not preclude anticoagulation when stroke risk is elevated [^cae7c5d3].

---

## Peri-procedural management

Anticoagulation should be **managed carefully around procedures**:

- **Elective cardioversion**: Uninterrupted anticoagulation for ≥ 3 weeks before and ≥ 4 weeks after, or TEE-guided strategy if anticoagulation is interrupted [^026d338c] [^8145c17a].
- **Catheter ablation**: Uninterrupted anticoagulation is recommended [^c6d07061] [^20857c24].
- **Temporary interruption**: Minimal interruption without routine bridging; resume based on bleeding risk [^9b79f7dc].

---

## Special populations and clinical scenarios

- **Chronic kidney disease**: DOACs require dose adjustment; warfarin is an alternative when DOACs are contraindicated [^310cf6d5].
- **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**: DOACs are preferred over VKAs, and triple therapy should be minimized to reduce bleeding risk [^3d8ee8ee].
- **Device-detected AF**: Anticoagulation decisions should be individualized based on stroke risk and AF burden [^65cd2e65].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is **essential** to monitor for bleeding, assess adherence, and reassess stroke and bleeding risks periodically [^52741812]. Renal and hepatic function should be checked at least annually for patients on DOACs [^5c9080f1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Anticoagulation is indicated for AF patients with elevated stroke risk** (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women) [^754f89b5].
- **DOACs are preferred over warfarin** for most patients with nonvalvular AF [^8b0157aa].
- **Warfarin remains first-line for mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis** [^5c9080f1].
- **Bleeding risk should be assessed and mitigated**, but high bleeding risk alone should not preclude anticoagulation when stroke risk is high [^cae7c5d3].
- **Peri-procedural management should minimize interruption and avoid routine bridging** [^9b79f7dc].

---

Anticoagulation is a **cornerstone of AF management** [^56000611], reducing stroke and systemic embolism. DOACs are preferred for most, with warfarin reserved for specific valvular indications, and decisions should be individualized based on stroke and bleeding risk, with regular reassessment and shared decision-making.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation has become more complex due to the introduction of new anticoagulant agents, the number and kinds of patients requiring therapy, and the interactions of those patients in the matrix of care. The management of anticoagulation has become a "team sport" involving multiple specialties in multiple sites of care. The American College of Cardiology, through the College's Anticoagulation Initiative, convened a roundtable of experts from multiple specialties to discuss topics important to the management of patients requiring anticoagulation and to make expert recommendations on issues such as the initiation and interruption of anticoagulation, quality of anticoagulation care, management of major and minor bleeding, and treatment of special populations. The attendees continued to work toward consensus on these topics, and present the key findings of this roundtable in a state-of- the-art review focusing on the practical aspects of anticoagulation care for the patient with atrial fibrillation.

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^dd73c500]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and contributes greatly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management, briefly focusing on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodelling, the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion, the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development. The background of every controversy is reviewed and our opinions expressed. Here, we hope to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address unresolved issues.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

### New anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation management [^3d3aff7d]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Three new oral anticoagulants have been evaluated in large registration trials and are now available in many jurisdictions for patients with atrial fibrillation. Questions arise whether these drugs are equally effective and safe for all patients. Now when we are moving away from decades with only one orally available drug for anticoagulation there is opportunity to tailor the therapy according to patient characteristics and preferences. This review addresses the interaction of various patient characteristics with the treatment and what features can assist the physician in the choice of anticoagulant for the individual patient.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^08b94442]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The use of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate or high risk of stroke, estimated by established criteria, improves outcomes. However, to ensure that the benefits exceed the risks of bleeding, appropriate patient selection is essential. Vitamin K antagonism has been the mainstay of treatment; however, newer drugs with novel mechanisms are also available. These novel oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors) obviate many of warfarin's shortcomings, and they have demonstrated safety and efficacy in large randomized trials of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. However, the management of patients taking warfarin or novel agents remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations when selecting anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. This review will discuss the rationale for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation; risk stratification for treatment; available agents; the appropriate implementation of these agents; and additional, specific clinical considerations for treatment.

Anticoagulation thresholds in atrial fibrillation — intermediate risk: although risk stratification schemes identify patients who benefit most and least from anticoagulation, the threshold for use of anticoagulation is controversial, and opinion is particularly divided about anticoagulation for those at intermediate risk (stroke rate 3% to 5% per year); some advocate routine anticoagulation at this level, whereas others favor selective anticoagulation with weight given to bleeding risks and preferences, and the threshold of benefit at which AF patients choose anticoagulation varies, with some at intermediate risk electing anticoagulation whereas others do not.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) antithrombotic therapy — stroke prevention conclusions state that stroke is a serious complication of AF with risk varying across patient groups and that antithrombotic prophylaxis is associated with increased bleeding risk; recommendations are based on net clinical benefit across varying stroke-risk levels. Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score ≥ 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, decisions require an individualized approach considering patient values and preferences, bleeding risk, and non-CHADS2 stroke risk factors. The role of oral anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in AF will evolve with results of large, ongoing, phase 3 RCTs of new oral anticoagulants and as experience with these new agents in clinical practice continues to grow.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke: a practical guide [^0bc38d1e]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurologists and stroke physicians will be familiar with atrial fibrillation as a major cause of ischaemic stroke, and the role of anticoagulation in preventing cardioembolic stroke. However, making decisions about anticoagulation for individual patients remains a difficult area of clinical practice, balancing the serious risk of ischaemic stroke against that of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation management requires interdisciplinary collaboration with colleagues in cardiology and haematology. Recent advances, especially the now-widespread availability of direct oral anticoagulants, have brought opportunities to improve stroke care while posing new challenges. This article gives an overview of the contemporary diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation, and the associated evidence base. Where there is uncertainty, we describe our own approach to these areas, while highlighting ongoing research that will likely guide future practice.

### Antithrombotic therapy: triple therapy or triple threat? [^499016ff]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy plays an essential role in the management of some of the most common and morbid medical conditions. Triple oral antithrombotic therapy (TOAT) is defined as the administration of both therapeutic oral anticoagulation (OAC) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to patients with indications for both treatments. The current societal guidelines regarding TOAT are derived from observational studies and some trials of the use of warfarin in addition to antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. The general apprehension to administer TOAT is due to the heightened concern for bleeding, rendering warfarin's pharmacokinetic properties concerning. Newer anticoagulant agents may serve as appealing alternatives, and further investigations are warranted. The results of the recent trials that have studied the use of these agents in atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome offer some useful applications to TOAT. Ultimately, selecting the most favorable antithrombotic strategy is going to involve weighing the risks and benefits for each patient.

### Key recommendations… [^5c9080f1]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Anticoagulation is recommended for AF at a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score of 2 for men and 3 for women without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. The score has not been validated for mitral stenosis or mechanical valves. Key Recommendations HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE Based on high-quality evidence, oral anticoagulants should be prescribed for women with AF and a CHA. Direct oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are preferred to warfarin unless the patient has concomitant moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Based on new data, the recommended set-points for anticoagulation have been increased, and the previous recommendation to prescribe an anticoagulant for all patients with AF who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack has been removed.

Warfarin is the recommended anticoagulant for patients with AF and moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Dabigatran should be avoided in patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve. Renal and hepatic function should be assessed before initiating direct oral anticoagulant therapy, then at least each year thereafter. Anticoagulant therapy is not necessary for men with AF and a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score of 0 or for women with AF and a score of 1, except in the presence of moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Warfarin or apixaban can be considered in men with AF, end-stage renal disease or on dialysis, and a CHA. Based on expert opinion, patients with AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve who are taking warfarin, but whose international normalized ratio is not being maintained in a therapeutic range, should have their treatment regimen changed to a direct oral anticogulant.

Because there are no data indicating that the benefits are greater than the harms, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban should be avoided in patients with AF and ESRD or on dialysis. Editor's Note: In addition to this update, the American College of Chest Physicians recently updated its recommendations on anticoagulation for AF. These ACCP guidelines recommend the same CHA.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^69a61efe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

### Contemporary approach to stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: risks, benefits, and new options [^b203b692]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common diagnosis affecting nearly 3 million adults in the United States. Morbidity and mortality in these patients is driven largely by the associated increased risk of thromboembolic complications, especially stroke. Atrial fibrillation is a stronger risk factor than hypertension, coronary disease, or heart failure and is associated with an approximately five-fold increased risk. Mitigating stroke risk can be challenging and requires accurate assessment of stroke risk factors and careful selection of appropriate therapy. Anticoagulation, including the more recently introduced direct oral anticoagulants, is the standard of care for most patients. In addition, emerging non-pharmacologic mechanical interventions are playing an expanding role in reducing stroke risk in select patients. In this review we highlight the current approach to stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation and discuss in detail the mechanism, risks, and benefits of current and evolving therapies.

### Atrial fibrillation [^56000611]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation has evolved greatly in the past few years, and many areas have had substantial advances or developments. Recognition of the limitations of aspirin and the availability of new oral anticoagulant drugs that overcome the inherent drawbacks associated with warfarin will enable widespread application of effective thromboprophylaxis with oral anticoagulants. The emphasis on stroke risk stratification has shifted towards identification of so-called truly low-risk patients with atrial fibrillation who do not need antithrombotic therapy, whereas oral anticoagulation therapy should be considered in patients with one or more risk factors for stroke. New antiarrhythmic drugs, such as dronedarone and vernakalant, have provided some additional opportunities for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation. However, the management of the disorder is increasingly driven by symptoms. The availability of non-pharmacological approaches, such as ablation, has allowed additional options for the management of atrial fibrillation in patients who are unsuitable for or intolerant of drug approaches.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

Atrial fibrillation with recent stroke or TIA — antithrombotic management: Unless a clear contraindication exists, patients with a recent stroke or TIA should be treated with long-term anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy, there is no evidence that combining anticoagulation with an antiplatelet agent reduces the risk of stroke compared with anticoagulant therapy alone, and for those who sustain cardiocembolic events while receiving low-intensity anticoagulation, anticoagulation intensity should be increased to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 rather than routinely adding antiplatelet agents.

### The future of atrial fibrillation management: integrated care and stratified therapy [^2535a9f2]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the major cardiovascular health problems: it is a common, chronic condition, affecting 2–3% of the population in Europe and the USA and requiring 1–3% of health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure, unplanned hospital admissions, and other complications. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ideally before the first complication occurs, remains a challenge, as shown by patients who are only diagnosed with the condition when admitted to hospital for acute cardiac decompensation or stroke. Once diagnosed, atrial fibrillation requires chronic, multidimensional management in five domains (acute management, treatment of underlying and concomitant cardiovascular conditions, stroke prevention therapy, rate control, and rhythm control). The consistent provision of these treatment options to all patients with atrial fibrillation is difficult, despite recent improvements in organisation of care, knowledge about atrial fibrillation, and treatment options. Integrated care models that provide patient-centred care in, or close to, the patient's community while maintaining access to all specialist treatment options, emerge as the best approach to achieve consistent delivery of these chronic treatments to all patients with atrial fibrillation. Ongoing research efforts will establish when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, quantify the prognostic effect of early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, including atrial fibrillation ablation, and delineate optimum methods to reduce bleeding complications in patients treated with anticoagulation. Additionally, research efforts are needed to define different types of atrial fibrillation on the basis of the main causes of atrial fibrillation to pave the way for the clinical development of stratified atrial fibrillation therapy.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation: a contemporary viewpoint [^68e0532d]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation is important. This review consists of three parts: chronic anticoagulation, anticoagulation for cardioversion, and a brief comment on anticoagulation around the time of left atrial radiofrequency ablation. The risk stratification scheme of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines for chronic anticoagulation is briefly reviewed. Although there are several other similar schemes, they are not identical. The key point is the balance between benefit and risk. Some emerging controversies are outlined. Two specific questions explored are: is well-controlled hypertension a risk factor, and does paroxysmal atrial fibrillation confer the same risk as continuous atrial fibrillation? Differences in the risk of bleeding while taking a vitamin K antagonist noted in recent compared with older data are discussed. Risk of bleeding in the elderly and combined antithrombotic therapy with a vitamin K antagonist and an antiplatelet agent in high-risk patients are briefly discussed. Recent failures of studies attempting to find a suitable alternative to vitamin K antagonists are outlined. The treatment guidelines for anticoagulation for cardioversion are briefly reviewed. The risk of thromboembolism according to international normalized ratio and use of low-molecular-weight heparin as an alternative to warfarin are discussed. Anticoagulation before and after left atrial radiofrequency ablation is empirical, and long-term anticoagulation seems advisable for high risk patients at the present time. The two most pressing needs for further investigation are (1) clarification, simplification, and consolidated of risk stratification schemes and treatment recommendations and (2) discovery of alternatives to warfarin.

Risk-based selection of oral anticoagulation — In patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have an estimated annual risk of stroke or thromboembolic events ≥ 2%, selection of therapy to reduce the risk of stroke should be based on the risk of thromboembolism, regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent (COR 1, LOE B-R). In patients with AF at risk for stroke, reevaluation of the need for and choice of stroke risk reduction therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risk, net clinical benefit, and proper dosing (COR 1, LOE B-NR).

### Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines on atrial fibrillation: a commentary [^14e476f1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide a commentary on the recommendations for stroke prevention from the 2012 focused update of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation and the evidence (or lack of it) supporting these recommendations. These guidelines strongly advocate a major clinical practice shift towards initially focusing on the identification of 'truly low risk' patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy. After this initial decision-making step, effective stroke prevention - that is, oral anticoagulation therapy (whether as well-controlled adjusted dose warfarin or with one of the novel oral anticoagulants) - could be offered to patients with atrial fibrillation with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. The 2012 focused update guideline also provides additional guidance on advances in stroke and bleeding risk assessment that are evident since publication of the 2010 guideline, as well as recommendations on the use of the novel oral anticoagulants and the left atrial appendage occlusion devices that have been increasingly used in European clinical practice over the last 2 years.

Atrial fibrillation is an increasingly common arrhythmia associated with substantial but largely preventable risk of ischemic stroke. There has been an exponential increase in research related to atrial fibrillation in recent years, resulting in some major advances in the therapeutic management. Novel oral anticoagulant agents have become available and require thorough assessment of risk-to-benefit ratio. While the knowledge is rapidly accumulating, the basic principles of atrial fibrillation management remain proper recognition, risk stratification, and appropriate prevention of thromboembolic complications. This review highlights some common misconceptions about atrial fibrillation.

### Stroke prevention in atrial… [^563638d7]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Clinical Trials of Anticoagulation in Nonvalvular AF General consensus has been reached regarding the recommendations for anticoagulation in patients with rheumatic AF. However, until recently, clear-cut recommendations have not been available for management of patients with nonvalvular AF. Since 1989, many large, prospective, randomized trials have been conducted to evaluate the risks and benefits of warfarin or aspirin therapy in the prevention of stroke. The results of these trials provide a strong foundation for recommendations regarding the use of anticoagulation therapy in patients with nonvalvular AF.

A reduction in the risk of thromboembolism with anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents as compared with placebo was noted in the following trials: the Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation Aspirin and Anticoagulation Study, 8 the Boston Area Anticoagulation Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, 15 the Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation Study 16 and the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation trial. 6, 7, 17–19. 20 the incidence of an embolic event was
0. 8 percent in the group receiving anticoagulant therapy, compared with 5. 3 percent in the group not receiving anticoagulant therapy. These results are impressive because the number of patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension and rheumatic heart disease was greater in the anticoagulation group than in the group not receiving anticoagulation.

Based on these observations, it is generally recommended that anticoagulation be instituted for three weeks before cardioversion is attempted in patients with AF of more than two days' duration. To minimize thromboembolic complications, anticoagulants should be continued for four weeks after cardioversion. This period is required for recovery of atrial mechanical contractility after conversion to a sinus rhythm. Such a recommendation is based more on tradition and theory than on findings from controlled trials. Final Comment Anticoagulation with warfarin is clearly beneficial in patients with non-rheumatic AF who are at moderate risk for stroke and have a low risk of bleeding as a result of anticoagulation. 26, 27 Anticoagulation with warfarin should also be instituted in patients with a high risk of emboli unless the risk of bleeding is very high.

### Comparing the guidelines: anticoagulation therapy to optimize stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^f170f6ab]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for stroke. According to a pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials with warfarin, anticoagulation therapy reduces stroke risk by 62%. However, clinicians must decide whether the benefit of long-term anticoagulation therapy with available agents outweighs the risk of bleeding for individual patients. Guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians and by the joint American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology task force recommend antithrombotic therapy to protect AF patients from stroke based on risk-stratification algorithms. Risk factors for stroke AF patients include age ≥ 75 years; hypertension; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; congestive heart failure; and history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism. Patients at high risk for stroke experience greater absolute benefit from anticoagulation therapy than patients at low risk. The guidelines are consistent in recommendations for high-risk patients (warfarin therapy, international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0) and low-risk patients (aspirin 325 mg), but differ for intermediate-risk patients with diabetes or heart disease. The guidelines continue to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to incorporate new clinical data, including the CHADS(2) algorithm for determining risk and the results of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial, the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation study, and the Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation II to V trials.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status and near-future directions [^3f2fca5f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke is an important part of atrial fibrillation management. However, stroke risk is not homogeneous and varies with associated morbidities and risk factors. Risk stratification schemes have been developed that categorize patients' stroke risk into classes based on a combination of risk factors. According to the calculated level of risk, guidelines recommend patients with atrial fibrillation receive antithrombotic therapy either as a vitamin K antagonist or aspirin. Despite recommendations, however, many patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. We will discuss some of the underlying reasons, in part related to the drawbacks associated with vitamin K antagonists. These highlight the need for new anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation. The novel oral anticoagulants in development may overcome some of the limitations of vitamin K antagonists and address their underuse and safety concerns.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e2f6d6ec]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### Modifiable risk factors and atrial fibrillation [^dc62e05a]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

There has been increasing focus on the rising burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) since the turn of the millennium. The AF epidemic is projected not only to have an impact on morbidity and mortality, but also to result in increasing healthcare use and cost. Intensive research over the previous decades has improved our understanding of this complex arrhythmia while unraveling more knowledge gaps and inadequacies of current therapeutic options. Specifically, the advances in catheter ablation technology and strategies have not translated into significant gains in procedural success rates over recent years. Therefore, strategies aiming at lowering the risk of AF development and progression are urgently needed to curtail the AF epidemic and improve outcomes in affected individuals. Recent research has highlighted the potential beneficial effects of lifestyle and risk factor management for AF as upstream noninvasive therapy. The evidence supporting this treatment paradigm beyond routine clinical AF management argues for change in the delivery of care to patients who have this debilitating arrhythmia. In this review, we highlight the contributory role of risk factors to AF pathogenesis from both bench and bedside studies. Next, we discuss the rationale and potential benefits of risk factor modification for sinus rhythm maintenance. Last, we propose an integrated care model to incorporate risk factor modification as the fourth pillar of AF care in conjunction with established pillars of rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation therapy.

### Risk stratification for stroke in atrial fibrillation: a critique [^bbbdc5ed]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the demonstrable success of oral anticoagulants in reducing the rate of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, they continue to be seriously underutilized. Indications for their use as stated in the guidelines incorporate a number of risk score algorithms, the most widely used being the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Nonetheless there are several limitations to the various scores currently in clinical use and a critique of these is the focus of this review. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and its role in thromboembolic stroke risk. We amalgamate this with the basis of major professional society anticoagulation recommendations with regards to the strengths and limitations of current risk stratification strategies and discuss gaps in our current evidence base and next steps to address those gaps.

### Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation… [^e594e9e8]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Although anticoagulation decreases the risk of stroke by about two thirds in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, this therapy continues to be significantly underused. Current guidelines for clinical practice are complex and may appear confusing and inconsistent to physicians. Thomson and colleagues used a systematic literature review to develop a decision analysis model for the use of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and applied the model to data on more than 200 patients. Published studies were identified through MEDLINE and other databases, and were appraised using the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group. When possible, original data were reanalyzed to meet objective end points. Overall, the data indicated that anticoagulated patients had 42 percent of the stroke risk of placebo-treated patients. Large community-based studies were used to calculate risk of death, disability and subsequent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Interviews with 57 patients with atrial fibrillation were used to provide data on quality of life associated with different health states. Finally, cost estimates were formulated for stroke and for anticoagulant therapy and its complications. The treatment decisions were modeled as a Markov process using a hypothetic cohort of patients followed over several time cycles. All assumptions were made to replicate, as closely as possible, a real practice situation. If necessary, a group consensus model was used to make or validate these assumptions. The model indicated that warfarin should be used in all patients with atrial fibrillation who had three or more risk factors for stroke. In men with atrial fibrillation, warfarin should be used whenever left ventricular hypertrophy and at least one other risk factor are present. Aspirin therapy should be considered in patients with atrial fibrillation who have contraindications to warfarin or anticoagulation.

The authors also prepared a set of decision tables to help physicians determine the risks and likely benefits of warfarin therapy in individual patients based on age, sex, blood pressure and risk factors such as smoking or diabetes.

### Registries in atrial fibrillation: from trials to real-life clinical practice [^d4af3cba]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent improvements in atrial fibrillation diagnosis and management have prompted the initiation of various registries, predominantly to assess adherence to new guidelines but also to address the pending questions of safety and effectiveness of newly introduced management options in "real-world" clinical practice settings. In this review, we appraise antithrombotic treatment patterns for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation registries.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane databases for registries focusing on stroke thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation.

Results

Registry data show that over the last decade, the proportion of patients receiving oral anticoagulation has increased (from ∼67% to > 80%), whereas the proportion of those treated with aspirin only or untreated has diminished. Vitamin K antagonists are being replaced gradually by non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants as the more prevalent option. Regional and country differences in anticoagulation are evident, with its highest uptake in Europe (90.2%) and lowest in Asia (57.4%). Moreover, oral anticoagulation is given to approximately 50% of patients with no stroke risk factors, whereas more than one third of high-risk subjects are not anticoagulated but often prescribed antiplatelet therapy alone or untreated. Guideline-nonadherent thromboprophylaxis results in an increase in all-cause mortality and thromboembolism.

Conclusions

Registry data show that despite an increase in anticoagulation rates over the last decade, management gaps in stroke prevention are still evident with approximately one third of patients not treated in line with the guidelines. Mortality rates of atrial fibrillation patients remain relatively high, mostly because of the comorbid disease.

Antiplatelet therapy in atrial fibrillation — evidence and directive: A meta-analysis of AF trials from the 1990s and early 2000s found that while antiplatelet therapy reduced stroke and systemic embolism compared with placebo, antiplatelet therapy was inferior to warfarin. In AVERROES, the trial was stopped early due to the benefit of apixaban over aspirin to prevent stroke or systemic embolism, with similar major bleeding between arms; in ACTIVEW, the trial was stopped prematurely due to the superiority of anticoagulation with VKAs. Unless there is an indication for antiplatelet therapy such as CAD or vascular disease, patients with AF should not be prescribed antiplatelet therapy to reduce stroke risk.

### Association of direct oral anticoagulation management strategies with clinical outcomes for adults with atrial fibrillation [^a7c36ef3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are system-level direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy management services associated with anticoagulation-related outcomes for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) relative to usual care?

Findings

This cohort study evaluated 44 746 patients with AF initiating DOACs (managed using 2 different system-level care models or usual care) and warfarin therapy (managed by warfarin clinics). Patients receiving DOACs vs warfarin were less likely to experience adverse outcomes overall, but neither system-level DOAC management service was appreciably superior to usual DOAC care.

Meaning

Randomized trials are needed to confirm the findings of this study, which suggest that there is no effectiveness advantage to system-level DOAC therapy management services vs usual care for patients with AF.

### Atrial fibrillation: is there a role for low-molecular-weight heparin? [^5aa79ff9]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of tachyarrhythmia and carries a significant risk of serious thromboembolic complications. Anticoagulation is used for long-term thromboprophylaxis and for short-term management in a number of clinical situations, among which is the medical or electrical cardioversion of AF to sinus rhythm. Current guidelines recommend prompt cardioversion with heparin cover for AF of < 48 h duration, and several weeks of warfarin therapy prior to cardioversion when the duration of disease is longer. Recent animal and human studies, however, have shown that swifter cardioversion is likely to be more successful in achieving sinus rhythm and in reducing the risk of recurrence of AF. Other observations have demonstrated that thrombi can develop within a few hours of the development of AF. These considerations suggest that cardioversion should be carried out as early as possible in all cases, and that the most sensitive means of detecting atrial thrombi, currently transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), should be used to screen all patients prior to cardioversion. Within this context, there is growing interest in the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an anticoagulant therapy in AF. Compared with unfractionated heparin, LMWH therapy does not involve prolonged intravenous administration, hospitalization, or laboratory monitoring; LMWH therefore has the potential to greatly simplify anticoagulation therapy for AF, especially pericardioversion. Recent studies have demonstrated that LMWH can be used safely and effectively in place of unfractionated heparin for acute treatment at the onset of AF and during early cardioversion. For example, in patients with AF, a strategy of immediate administration of dalteparin (100 IU/kg s.c. twice daily) continued for 11 days, combined with early TEE and immediate cardioversion in patients with no thrombus, resulted in sinus rhythm in 74% of patients after a median of 7 days. Low-molecular-weight heparin therapy may also find a role perioperatively and in selected patients, notably those with warfarin intolerance, as a replacement for warfarin following cardioversion. Controlled clinical studies are still required, however, to establish a firm, evidence-based foundation for the use of LMWHs in AF.

Atrial fibrillation — low stroke risk (CHADS2 score = 0) management: For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), including those with paroxysmal AF, "we suggest no therapy rather than antithrombotic therapy (Grade 2B)". For patients who do choose antithrombotic therapy, "we suggest aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) rather than oral anticoagulation (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B)". Remarks note that additional risk factors "including age 65 to 74 years and female sex" may influence decisions and that "The presence of multiple non-CHADS2 risk factors for stroke may favor oral anticoagulation therapy".

### Oral anticoagulant use around the time of atrial fibrillation ablation: a review of the current evidence of individual oral anticoagulant use for periprocedural atrial fibrillation ablation thromboembolic prophylaxis [^6a392683]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and ablation is becoming more prevalent as a treatment option. Appropriate treatment of atrial fibrillation mandates thromboembolic prophylaxis, and atrial fibrillation ablation periprocedural management of oral anticoagulation is paramount because of the unique susceptibility for thromboembolism that exists for a patient undergoing ablation. Uninterrupted warfarin therapy is the current standard approach for periprocedural atrial fibrillation anticoagulation. Novel oral anticoagulants, including direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, are being used more frequently for thromboembolic prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation patients, but the best strategy for using novel oral anticoagulants in periprocedural anticoagulation is unknown. Optimal periprocedural anticoagulation management strategies with oral anticoagulants, limitations of using novel oral anticoagulants, and future directions in this field are discussed.

Bleeding risk scores and anticoagulation decision-making — Unless an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation is present, bleeding risk scores have limitation in clinical decision-making because the most commonly used scores (HAS–BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, and ATRIA) are based on clinical factors that indicate higher risks of both stroke and bleeding, and patients with higher risk of bleeding also tend to have a higher risk of stroke. Furthermore, a bleeding risk score cannot be interpreted in isolation because it does not assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation or balance the risk of bleeding against the risk of stroke. Population-based studies suggest that the benefits of stroke prevention with anticoagulation generally outweigh the risks of bleeding, even in patients determined to be at high risk for bleeding. Decision-making about oral anticoagulation should be based on consideration of both benefits and harms, not by using bleeding risk scores in isolation, and the best utility of these scores may be identifying potential modifying risk factors.

### Direct effects of activation and inhibition of the coagulation system on the atrial Fibrillation substrate: is anticoagulation antiarrhythmic? [^57eb42df]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent clinical problem that is becoming more common with population aging, and presents a broad range of therapeutic challenges. An improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is central to improving management options for the arrhythmia.

The most significant complication of AF is thromboembolism, particularly stroke. AF-related stroke is effectively prevented by oral anticoagulation (OAC), achieved traditionally by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin, and more recently by direct-acting agents (DOACs) such as the thrombin-antagonist dabigatran and the Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Because of the attendant bleeding risk, OAC therapy has been targeted to patients with elevated stroke risk, although with the reduced bleeding seen with DOACs versus VKAs, the threshold for OAC therapy has decreased and the emphasis has shifted to identifying true low-risk individuals who may safely be managed without OAC.

It has long been known that thrombin possesses proinflammatory effects mediated by protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1and that both thrombin and FXa have profibrotic effects. Furthermore, thrombin-inhibition has antifibrotic effects. Atrial fibrosis is a major potential contributor to the substrate for AF maintenance, and therefore beyond its role in clotting, activated thrombin or FXa could contribute to the progression of the AF substrate. Conversely, inhibitors of thrombin or FXa such as the DOACs could have an AF-suppressing effect.

### Use of oral anticoagulation in a real-world population with device detected atrial fibrillation [^1ea9f9db]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Current US guidelines strongly support the use of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ≥ 2 stroke risk factors, without regard of AF duration or burden. 1 Device‐detected AF of various durations, often referred to as subclinical AF, has been shown to be associated with increased stroke risk, though at a rate less than that of clinically detected AF. 2, 3, 4 Anticoagulation recommendations for clinical AF are based on studies of stroke risk in the clinical AF population. 1 While patients may have both clinical and subclinical AF, the increasing use of implantable and consumer‐grade technologies capable of detecting AF will likely increase the latter population significantly. There is, however, considerable clinical equipoise about the management of these episodes of subclinical AF, particularly those that are paroxysmal and of short duration. Even the 2019 update of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines noted that it is not yet clear what the optimal management strategy is in these patients with regards to anticoagulation. 1 There are trials currently being conducted to answer this question, but in the meantime, clinicians are presented with such clinical scenarios daily. 5, 6

A recent statement from the American Heart Association noted the considerable evidence gap in answering this clinical question. 7 Given the uncertainty of anticoagulation management in device‐detected AF and the absence of randomized trial results for guidance, it is of interest to determine the practice patterns of anticoagulation use in patients with device‐detected AF among US physicians.

Atrial fibrillation — risk stratification for thromboembolism includes four directives: Patients with AF should be evaluated for their annual risk of thromboembolic events using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc; patients with AF should be evaluated for factors that specifically indicate a higher risk of bleeding, such as previous bleeding and use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, in order to identify possible interventions to prevent bleeding on anticoagulation; patients with AF at intermediate annual risk by risk scores (eg, equivalent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women) who remain uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation can benefit from consideration of factors that might modify their risk of stroke to help inform the decision; and in patients deemed at high risk for stroke, bleeding risk scores should not be used in isolation to determine eligibility for oral anticoagulation but instead to identify and modify bleeding risk factors and to inform medical decision-making, labeled "1 B-NR", "1 B-NR", "2a C-LD", and "3: No Benefit" respectively.

Comprehensive care for atrial fibrillation (AF) — core recommendations and supporting data: Patients with AF should receive comprehensive care addressing guideline-directed LRFM, AF symptoms, risk of stroke, and other associated medical conditions to reduce AF burden, progression, or consequences; in patients with AF, use of clinical care pathways, such as nurse-led AF clinics, is reasonable to promote comprehensive, team-based care and to enhance adherence to evidence-based therapies for AF and associated conditions. Randomized and programmatic evidence includes that the RACE 3 trial found that multifaceted treatment for patients with AF and early heart failure improved maintenance of sinus rhythm, and in a cluster randomized trial of elderly patients with AF, an integrated care intervention consisting of quarterly AF check-ups by trained nurses in primary care, monitoring of anticoagulation therapy in primary care, and easy-access availability of consultants from cardiologists and anticoagulation clinics led to patients assigned to integrated care experiencing a 45% reduction in all-cause mortality when compared with usual care.

Oral anticoagulants — vitamin K antagonists — note that "Since the 1950s, warfarin was used as a first-line therapy until DOACs came into practice", but its "narrow therapeutic window" with INRs, monitoring, drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and "low clinical safety profile affected the routine use of warfarin in practice". Due to affordability barriers to DOACs, "warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs", and utilization data show "About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quarter of 2017".

Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation — supportive evidence for periprocedural anticoagulation states that "all patients undergoing catheter ablation require intraprocedural intravenous anticoagulation with heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors in those with heparin allergies", and among warfarin-treated patients, "optimal efficacy and safety is achieved with uninterrupted warfarin". In the COMPARE trial, interrupting warfarin was "highly associated with periprocedural thromboembolic events (OR, 13 [95% CI, 3.1–55.6]; P < 0.001)", and uninterrupted warfarin yielded "lower rates of thromboembolic events (5% versus 0.25%; P < 0.001)" and lower periprocedural bleeding versus stopping or interrupting warfarin. Meta-analyses "have demonstrated lower risks of major bleeding with uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulation compared with uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism", trials "have demonstrated the noninferiority of uninterrupted direct-acting oral anticoagulation compared with uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism", and outcomes with "minimally interrupted direct-acting oral anticoagulation are not different compared with continuous oral anticoagulation".

Over the last decade, these three Triple Aim preconditions — the role of the successful integrator, the defined population, and equitable care — have been examined in the anticoagulation therapy and management research. The literature, however, remains somewhat unbalanced in favor of the first two preconditions while leaving the issue of equity relatively unexplored. A considerable body of research has focused on optimal 'integrative' models for oral anticoagulant management, by exploring cost effectiveness, quality of care, and patient outcomes for anticoagulation services in physician offices, in dedicated anticoagulation clinics, and in patient self management. – A second stream of research has focused on defining the appropriate patient population for oral anticoagulation therapy based on specific clinical needs. – This research has demonstrated that oral anticoagulants are highly efficacious for patients with conditions such as valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and venous thrombo‐embolism. The final Triple Aim precondition that is grounded in equitable care for all, however, remains the least well studied. In order to achieve a balance in the anticoagulation management literature that supports all three preconditions for the Triple Aim, a further examination of equity in access and quality of care is required.

### Anticoagulation after stroke: persistent uncertainties [^5dbf4a2d]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are the mainstay of anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Persistent uncertainties remain in different areas, and this review discusses current dilemmas based on selected studies.

Recent Findings

Optimal timing of DOAC initiation after a recent ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is currently unknown and subject of ongoing randomized controlled trials. Ischaemic stroke despite anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation is frequent, constitutes heterogeneous causes (competing stroke cause, medication error and cardioembolism despite anticoagulation) and optimal treatment is currently unknown. Thorough etiological work-up is justified. Recent randomized controlled trials found no beneficial effect of DOAC therapy in unselected patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Currently ongoing trials targeting subgroup of ESUS patients with additional atrial cardiopathy will provide novel data. Cerebral mircobleeds combined in a novel risk score (MICON score) provide good predictive value to stratify the risk of intracranial haemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulants. Use of DOAC after intracerebral haemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation is subject of ongoing trials.

Summary

There are still significant uncertainties in anticoagulant management in patients with stroke. Ongoing trials will soon provide novel data to improve management of these patients.

In most patients with AF who take oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI, early discontinuation of aspirin (1–4 wk) and continuation of dual antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y12 inhibitor is preferred over triple therapy (OAC, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin) to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding (1 A).

Atrial fibrillation — anticoagulation efficacy and risk score use notes that randomized trials published in the 1990s established the superiority of anticoagulation, at that time limited to warfarin, to reduce stroke, and more recent trials comparing direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with warfarin reported that DOACs were favored for lower risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and ICH. Patients at intermediate risk (1%-2%/y) can also benefit from anticoagulation. For calibration of risk scores, a CHADS2 score of 1 gave a stroke rate of 1.20 in ATRIA and 2.4 in a Swedish cohort, and it is practical to use a validated risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc, ATRIA, or GARFIELD-AF.

In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, anticoagulation may be interrupted to prevent bleeding at the site of peripheral arterial puncture, the vitamin K antagonist should be resumed as soon as possible and the dose adjusted to achieve an INR in the therapeutic range; the maintenance regimen should then consist of clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, plus warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) with clopidogrel for a minimum of 1 mo after a bare metal stent, at least 3 mo for a sirolimus-eluting stent, at least 6 mo for a paclitaxel-eluting stent, and 12 mo or longer in selected patients, and when warfarin is given with clopidogrel or low-dose aspirin the dose intensity must be carefully regulated (Level of Evidence: C).

Integrated, Team‐Based Care

Background

AF poses a high burden on the healthcare system; in the United States, AF accounts for $28.4 billion (US$2016) dollars in healthcare spending; about 29.8% of healthcare costs are for AF‐related hospitalizations and 29.4% for ambulatory care. Moreover, AF management can be complex and demanding and should include rate control, rhythm management, stroke prevention, risk factor management, and lifestyle modification.

Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of risk factor modification to significantly reduce the burden of AF and maintain sinus rhythm. Questions have emerged, including whether such comprehensive care can be appropriately provided by a single healthcare professional and what is the optimal role of the patient in managing AF.

Novel models of AF care have been identified to prevent fragmentation of care and potentially improve clinical outcomes. Integrated care in this context is an approach that includes 4 fundamental and indispensable elements: (1) active involvement of the patient, including shared decision‐making and self‐management; (2) a multidisciplinary team approach; (3) use of technology to support integrated care; and (4) a comprehensive care approach involving rate and rhythm control, anticoagulation, and risk factor management, as appropriate. International guidelines for clinical AF management recommend integrated care as the leading approach to manage AF, to improve guideline adherent therapy, and to improve outcomes. The Australian and New Zealand Guidelines considered integrated care to have a high strength level and high evidence grade, whereas in 2020, the European Guidelines gave integrated management (AF Better Care holistic pathway) a class IIa recommendation, level of evidence B. In contrast, the US guidelines do not address the topic of integrated care.

### Are atrial fibrillation patients receiving warfarin in accordance with stroke risk? [^63fb240e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter provide recommendations for anticoagulation based on patients' overall risk of stroke. To determine the real-world compliance of physicians with these recommendations, we conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the utilization of warfarin in atrial fibrillation/flutter patients by stroke risk level.

Methods

Patients with a qualifying atrial fibrillation/flutter diagnosis during ≥ 18 months' continuous enrollment between January 2003 and September 2007, and with ≥ 6 months' eligibility after the first atrial fibrillation/flutter diagnosis, were identified from the US MarketScan database (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY). Warfarin use within 30 days of the first diagnosis was assessed according to stroke risk, estimated using the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age > 75 years, Diabetes, Stroke (CHADS(2)) score.

Results

Of 171,393 patients included in the analysis, 20.0% had a CHADS(2) score of 0 (low risk), 61.6% a score of 1–2 (moderate risk), and 18.4% a score of 3–6 (high risk). Warfarin, recommended for high stroke-risk patients, was given to only 42.1% of those with a CHADS(2) score of 3–6. A similar percentage of patients with moderate (43.5%) or low stroke risk (40.1%) received warfarin. Only 29.6% of high-risk, 33.3% of moderate-risk, and 34.1% of low-risk patients who were started on warfarin received uninterrupted therapy for 6 months following their initial prescription.

Conclusions

These data suggest that guideline recommendations that anticoagulation should be provided in accordance with stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patients are not routinely followed in clinical practice. The causes and clinical implications of under-utilization of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation patients with high stroke risk warrant further study.

Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^8b0157aa]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): DOACs were developed to address the disadvantages of warfarin and are currently recommended as the first-line therapy over warfarin in patients with AF (except moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve recipients). Across pivotal trials, major bleeding risks were lower in the apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, and edoxaban 30 mg or 60 mg daily dose groups versus warfarin, while differences were nonsignificant for the dabigatran 150 mg twice daily group or the rivaroxaban group; all DOAC groups showed significantly lower risks of intracranial hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal bleeding risks were significantly higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin, whereas apixaban did not significantly increase gastrointestinal bleeding versus warfarin.

Atrial fibrillation — bleeding risk assessment highlights that anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding, so patients with AF are generally evaluated for bleeding risk as part of decision-making. Currently used bleeding risk scores — HAS-BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, and ATRIA — with listed components such as age ≥ 65 years, older age [≥ 75 years], and elderly age ≥ 75 years, discriminate poorly between patients with and without an increased risk of bleeding and include many nonspecific factors that predict an increased risk of stroke as well as an increased risk of bleeding. Assessment of factors that specifically predict an increased risk of bleeding without predicting an increased risk of stroke is more helpful when balancing risks and benefits of anticoagulation.

Atrial fibrillation — bleeding risk assessment emphasizes limitations of common bleeding scores and focuses on modifiable bleeding factors. The most studied bleeding risk scores (HAS-BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, ATRIA) "discriminate poorly between patients with and without bleeding" with c-index 0.58 to 0.59, and overlapping factors with stroke risk complicate anticoagulation decisions. Consideration of bleeding-specific factors and targeted actions — such as discontinuing antiplatelet or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or using LAAO devices — may better inform decisions.

### Viewpoint: stroke prevention in recent guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: an appraisal [^586bef0c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Formal guidelines play an important role in disseminating the best available evidence knowledge and are expected to provide simple and practical recommendations for the most optimal management of patients with various conditions. Such guidelines have important implications for many disease states, which thereby could be more professionally managed in everyday clinical practice by clinicians with divergent educational backgrounds, and also more easily implemented in wards or outpatient clinics, eliminating inequalities in health care management. In this brief Viewpoint we provide an appraisal on the recommendations pertinent to the prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke or systemic thromboembolism, as provided in recently published guidelines for the management of this arrhythmia.
