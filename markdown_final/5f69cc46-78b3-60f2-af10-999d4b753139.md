## Question

Salmonella uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Salmonella urinary tract infection (UTI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining Salmonella UTI and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify risk factors and pathogenesis. Next, I will review clinical presentation and diagnostic strategy. After that, I need to check antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and resistance concerns. Then, I will outline treatment principles, including empiric and definitive therapy, duration, and source control. Finally, I should consider special populations, follow-up, and prevention, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't overstate rarity. Salmonella UTI is an extra-intestinal manifestation of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) involving the urinary tract, with reported frequencies around 0.01–0.1% of UTIs, though surveillance and case series suggest higher detection in selected cohorts, and it remains uncommon relative to classic uropathogens like E. coli and Klebsiella [^b54a77b3] [^1e85149a] [^1215154d].

> I need to check who gets this and why. Risk factors consistently include older age, diabetes, immunosuppression, and structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities such as stones, obstruction, neurogenic bladder, or chronic kidney disease; these align with the broader paradigm that complicated UTI phenotypes reflect host susceptibility and anatomic or physiologic defects that impair clearance or promote bacterial persistence [^b740471c] [^b54a77b3] [^1e85149a] [^dffd6966].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without considering both hematogenous and ascending routes. Hematogenous spread from gastroenteritis can seed the kidney, while ascending infection from the urethra is plausible in the presence of obstruction or instrumentation; biofilm formation and intracellular reservoirs may explain recalcitrance and recurrence in some cases, which is clinically relevant when planning duration and follow-up [^a074dccb] [^dc26a5db].

> Next, I should review how it presents so I don't miss atypical features. Patients may have classic lower UTI symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency) or upper UTI features (flank pain, fever, costovertebral tenderness), and some are asymptomatic, particularly if bacteriuria reflects colonization or chronic carriage; concurrent or antecedent gastrointestinal symptoms can occur but are not universal, so I should confirm with culture rather than assume contamination [^b740471c] [^a074dccb] [^e1c6bf58].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, and I need to ensure I anchor it to stewardship principles. Urine culture with organism identification and susceptibility testing is essential; in catheter-associated cases, replace the catheter before obtaining culture to reduce contamination and improve diagnostic yield; blood cultures are indicated when there is systemic illness or suspected bacteremia; I should avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except in defined scenarios like pregnancy or urologic procedures, and I should remember that routine stool testing is not required unless there is a diarrheal illness or public health indication [^de1bad2e] [^e54f3891] [^1a72a468] [^6df2fa6d].

> Wait, let me verify resistance patterns before recommending empiric therapy. Fluoroquinolone resistance and decreased susceptibility are increasingly reported in NTS, including urinary isolates, and nalidixic acid resistance correlates with reduced ciprofloxacin activity; ESBL and AmpC phenotypes also occur, so local antibiograms and travel history matter, and I should avoid reflexive fluoroquinolone use when resistance risk is elevated [^040f023a] [^4d8cbc6e] [^de7ee165].

> For empiric therapy, I should double-check guideline-concordant options and caveats. In stable, non-septic patients, oral fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin are reasonable if local resistance is low and there is no recent fluoroquinolone exposure; TMP-SMX is an alternative when susceptibility is likely; in severe illness or when parenteral therapy is needed, a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) is appropriate, with consideration of an aminoglycoside for synergy in critical illness; I should avoid nitrofurantoin for suspected upper tract involvement because it does not achieve adequate tissue levels [^f2778097] [^2b710199] [^98f590f5] [^eb6d1dac].

> Let me think about definitive therapy and duration, and I should confirm that I'm aligning with contemporary guidance. Once susceptibilities return, tailor to the narrowest active agent; for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, shorter effective courses are acceptable if the patient is improving: 5–7 days for a fluoroquinolone or 7 days for a non-fluoroquinolone, counting from the first day of effective therapy; for bacteremic cUTI, 7 days is reasonable if the patient is clinically improving; for uncomplicated cystitis, 3 days of TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone is standard if susceptible, though I should individualize based on host factors and prior response [^fc1d9dae] [^dd9942a8] [^eb6d1dac].

> But wait, what if the infection persists despite appropriate therapy? I need to ensure source control is addressed. Evaluate for obstruction, stones, strictures, or foreign bodies; decompress with stenting or drainage when indicated; in select refractory cases with a nonfunctional, infected renal unit, nephrectomy may be curative; I should also consider whether the isolate reflects chronic carriage from the biliary tract, in which case cholecystectomy may be necessary to eradicate the reservoir [^b22f5786] [^d521901d] [^8fc5bc8c].

> I should confirm special population nuances. In children, treat febrile UTI for 7–14 days and base route on practical considerations, as oral and parenteral therapy are comparably effective; in pregnancy, avoid fluoroquinolones and TMP-SMX near term and prefer beta-lactams; in older adults with functional or cognitive impairment and asymptomatic bacteriuria, do not treat unless there is a clear indication such as sepsis or a urologic procedure; in immunocompromised hosts, maintain a lower threshold for parenteral therapy and longer courses given risk of invasive disease [^1cf32f4d] [^aa79cd55] [^1a72a468] [^6df2fa6d].

> Next, I should review follow-up and prevention so I don't miss recurrence. Repeat urine culture 48–72 hours after initiating therapy in complicated cases or if symptoms persist; counsel on hydration and bladder emptying; address modifiable risk factors such as glycemic control and urologic abnormalities; for recurrent UTI, consider methenamine prophylaxis after eradication of active infection, and reserve fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for carefully selected patients given resistance and adverse effects [^60857047] [^0474eebf].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis aligns with the strength of evidence. Much of the Salmonella UTI literature consists of case series and reports, so recommendations rely on extrapolation from UTI and Salmonella guidelines, antimicrobial stewardship principles, and pathophysiologic reasoning; nonetheless, the approach of culture-directed therapy, attention to host factors, judicious empiric choices, and source control is consistent with high-quality IDSA and EAU guidance for complicated UTI and resistant Gram-negative infections [^fc1d9dae] [^8144d778] [^f2778097].

> In summary, Salmonella UTI is uncommon but clinically important, especially in older adults with comorbidities or urinary tract abnormalities; confirm with culture, assess for complications and source control needs, choose empiric therapy based on severity and local resistance, narrow to active therapy promptly, and treat for 5–7 days for complicated infections when improving, extending or individualizing in bacteremia or persistent disease; persistent or recurrent infection warrants evaluation for obstruction, stones, or biliary carriage and may require procedural management [^b740471c] [^fc1d9dae] [^dd9942a8] [^d521901d].

---

Salmonella UTI is rare and typically occurs in patients with **structural urinary abnormalities**, **immunosuppression**, or **diabetes** [^b740471c] [^b54a77b3]. Diagnosis relies on **urine culture** with antimicrobial susceptibility testing, as resistance is common [^e1c6bf58]. Empiric therapy should be guided by local resistance patterns; **fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporins** are common choices, with adjustments based on susceptibilities [^f2778097] [^eb6d1dac]. Treatment duration is generally 7–14 days, longer for complicated cases or immunocompromised hosts [^1cf32f4d] [^fc1d9dae]. Recurrence is frequent, so evaluate for underlying urinary pathology and consider prolonged or suppressive therapy if indicated [^b740471c] [^60857047].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Salmonella UTI is uncommon, accounting for approximately 0.01% to 0.1% of UTIs [^b54a77b3]. It is more frequently observed in patients with **underlying risk factors**, including:

- **Structural urinary tract abnormalities**: Such as neurogenic bladder, urethral strictures, or urinary tract obstruction [^b740471c] [^b54a77b3].

- **Immunosuppression**: Including HIV infection, malignancy, or immunosuppressive therapy [^b740471c].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Increases susceptibility to infections, including Salmonella UTIs [^b740471c].

- **Elderly patients**: Advanced age is a significant risk factor [^b740471c].

---

## Clinical presentation

Salmonella UTI presents similarly to other bacterial UTIs, with symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, and occasionally hematuria [^b740471c]. Systemic symptoms, including fever and chills, may occur, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with upper urinary tract involvement [^b740471c]. In some cases, gastrointestinal symptoms may precede or accompany the urinary symptoms, reflecting the pathogen's primary enteric nature [^a074dccb].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate diagnosis of Salmonella UTI requires **laboratory confirmation**:

- **Urine culture**: Essential for identifying Salmonella species and determining antimicrobial susceptibility [^e1c6bf58].

- **Blood culture**: Recommended in patients with systemic symptoms or immunocompromise to assess for bacteremia [^notfound].

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound or CT scan may be indicated to evaluate for structural abnormalities or obstruction, particularly in recurrent or complicated cases [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment of Salmonella UTI should be guided by **antimicrobial susceptibility testing**, as resistance patterns vary [^e1c6bf58]. Empiric therapy may be initiated based on local resistance patterns and adjusted once susceptibility results are available [^0b65ff30].

| **Antibiotic class** | **Recommended agents** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluoroquinolones | Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin | - First-line therapy for uncomplicated and complicated Salmonella UTIs <br/> - High oral bioavailability and excellent tissue penetration [^notfound] |
| Third-generation cephalosporins | Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime | - Severe infections <br/> - Hospitalized patients <br/> - Or when fluoroquinolone resistance is suspected [^notfound] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | TMP-SMX | Alternative oral therapy for susceptible strains [^notfound] |

---

Duration of therapy typically ranges from 7 to 14 days, depending on the severity of infection, presence of bacteremia, and patient-specific factors such as immunocompromise [^1cf32f4d] [^fc1d9dae]. Prolonged or suppressive therapy may be considered in patients with recurrent infections or chronic structural abnormalities [^60857047].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

The prognosis of Salmonella UTI is generally favorable with appropriate antibiotic therapy [^notfound]. However, recurrence is common, particularly in patients with underlying urinary tract abnormalities or immunocompromise [^b740471c]. Persistent or recurrent infections warrant further evaluation for structural abnormalities, obstruction, or chronic bacterial carriage states [^fc1d9dae].

---

## Prevention

Preventive strategies focus on **addressing underlying risk factors**, including:

- **Structural abnormalities**: Surgical correction or management of urinary tract obstructions or neurogenic bladder dysfunction [^b22f5786].

- **Immunosuppression**: Optimization of immunosuppressive therapy and management of underlying conditions such as HIV infection or diabetes mellitus.

- **Hygiene and food safety**: Emphasizing hand hygiene and safe food handling practices to prevent initial Salmonella infection [^8cd715d6].

---

Salmonella UTI is a rare but clinically significant infection, particularly in patients with underlying urinary tract abnormalities or immunocompromise. Accurate diagnosis and **culture-guided therapy** are essential, with management tailored to individual patient factors and local resistance patterns.

### Salmonella-related urinary tract infection in an elderly patient [^6d98dcfd]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

An elderly female patient with an uncomplicated urinary tract infection from Salmonella newport is presented. Radiological and laboratory studies were performed because of her systemic and exposure risk factors as well as prior urinary tract abnormalities. While this patient was successfully treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, complications and recurrence are common and deserve close follow-up with repeat urine cultures at a minimum. Further laboratory and radiological testing should be guided by patient gender, risk factors and recurrence.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^51ff1b50]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This IPD systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-IPD Statement, and Cochrane instructions for IPD-MA. Considering the priority of the results for decision-making, and taking into account expected new evidence from a large ongoing trial in the topic, we conduct this review as a living systematic review. For the living systematic review we will repeat the search every 12 months. Updates of the meta-analysis will be conducted when new evidence that is likely to influence the results will be identified.

We included RCTs comparing short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia, as defined in individual trials. We included only trials evaluating patients with Gram-negative bacteremia as their target population. Trials evaluating various infection types (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection), and reporting bacteremic patients as a sub-group were not included. We excluded trials addressing source of bacteremia requiring prolonged treatment (endocarditis/endovascular infections; necrotizing fasciitis; osteomyelitis; abdominal abscesses and other unresolved abdominal sources requiring source control (surgery/drainage); central nervous system infections; empyema; any uncontrolled focus of infection (undrained abscess/deep seated intra-abdominal infection, undrained moderate to severe hydronephrosis). We also excluded patients with intracellular pathogens including Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp.

Interventions tested were antibiotics with in vitro activity against the pathogen for ≤ 7 vs > 7 days. Any choice and route of administration of antibiotics (oral or intravenous) were eligible for inclusion. Any source of bacteremia not requiring prolonged treatment (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, etc.) and any place of acquisition (community or hospital) were eligible for inclusion.

Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality; relapse of bacteremia; length of hospital stay; readmissions; local suppurative and distant complications; restarting of Gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy; emergence of resistance to study antibiotics; functional capacity and time to return to baseline capacity; new clinically or microbiologically documented infection; and adverse events: any diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, acute kidney injury, and rash (for secondary outcomes definitions, see Appendix).

### Urinary tract infection due to non-typhoidal Salmonella: report of 19 cases [^b740471c]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is rare. The aims were to know the frequency and clinical characteristics of this infection in our area.

Patients and Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with bacteriuria due to NTS diagnosed in our hospital from January 1990 to December 2005.

Results

Nineteen patients with bacteriuria caused by NTS were diagnosed, representing 0.07% of the UTIs diagnosed in our area over the same period. The mean age was 62.5 years old. Eighteen patients (94.7%) had symptoms of UTI (12, cystitis; 6, pyelonephritis), and 1 remained asymptomatic. Fourteen patients (73.6%) had chronic diseases; diabetes mellitus was present in 8 of them (42.1%) and 7 patients (36.8%) were undergoing immunosuppressor treatment. Eight patients (42.1%) had urologic abnormalities. S. enteritidis was the most common serotype isolated (16 cases). Eleven patients required antibiotic treatment over 2 or more weeks. Four patients had recurrent Salmonella UTIs (22.2%), and in 2 of them recurrence occurred after prolonged treatment during 3.5 and 5 weeks, respectively.

Conclusions

UTI due to NTS was predominantly observed in elderly patients with underlying diseases, especially diabetes mellitus, urologic abnormalities and immunosuppression. Prolonged antibiotic treatment should be considered due to the high frequency of complicating conditions, although the infection can be recurrent despite prolonged treatment.

### Impact of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment on outcome of non-critically ill children with bacterial infections [^a16c52e0]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection was defined as pyuria and > 50,000 CFU/ml of a single urinary pathogen. Gastrointestinal infection was defined as having more than 3 watery stools in 24 h. Antibiotics were empirically used for gastroenteritis in cases of bloody diarrhea and for gastroenteritis with prolonged fever where Salmonella bacteremia was clinically suspected. Other gastrointestinal illnesses included perforated appendicitis and ascending cholangitis (in patients with biliary atresia who underwent Kasai procedure).

Head and neck infections included mastoiditis, otitis media with associated bacteremia and bacterial parotitis. Pneumonia was defined as combination of clinical signs and symptoms (such as fever and cough) with radiologic documentation of lobar infiltrates. Hospital acquired infection was considered if signs and symptoms started more than 48 h after admission to the hospital.

We defined Inadequate antibiotic therapy as the microbiological documentation of an infection with a causative pathogen that was resistant to the empirical treatment based on in-vitro susceptibly tests. When multiple antibiotic treatments were prescribed, we defined inadequate therapy is the pathogen was resistant to all empirical antibiotics prescribed. Antibiotic penetration to the site of infection and adequate dosing were also taken into consideration by a pediatric infectious diseases specialist. The following pathogens in blood cultures were categorized as contamination and were excluded: coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium species, Bacillus other than Bacillus anthracis, Cutibacterium acnes, alpha-hemolytic streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter species other than Acinetobacter baumannii, Micrococcus species and nonfermenting Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria other than Neisseria meningitidis.

Patients who received adequate empirical treatment were compared with those who received inadequate treatment in terms of demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables.

The primary endpoint was the length of hospitalization in days, from emergency department admission to discharge. The secondary endpoints included time to switch to oral antibiotic treatment (some patients were discharged with intravenous home therapy) and the presence of long-term complications as documented in the discharge letter or ambulatory follow-up (need for rehabilitation in a long term facility, neurological deficits at discharge after meningitis)Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method, according to the CLSI standards. ESBL determination was performed phenotypically with ceftazidime/ceftazidime clavulanate and cefotaxime/cefotaxime clavulanate disks, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).

### Chronic and acute infection of the gall bladder by Salmonella typhi: understanding the carrier state [^8fc5bc8c]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Despite major treatment and prevention efforts, millions of new typhoid infections occur worldwide each year. For a subset of infected individuals, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi colonizes the gall bladder and remains there long after symptoms subside, serving as a reservoir for the further spread of the disease. In this Progress article, we explore recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which Salmonella spp. — predominantly S. Typhi — colonize and persist in the human gall bladder.

### Bacteriuria due to typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella: a report of three cases from south India [^b54a77b3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) with Salmonella is uncommon, accounting for merely 0.01% to 0.1% of cases of UTIs. It is reported more frequently in the presence of predisposing factors such as structural abnormalities of the urinary tract or weakened immune system. We present a case series of three patients with Salmonella bacteriuria and their susceptibility patterns. All three patients had underlying urologic features such as neurogenic bladder, chronic kidney disease, and urethral stricture, and two presented with urinary tract involvement symptoms.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^dc26a5db]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Symptom control usually required the maximum tolerated dose of an antibiotic and, in some patients, more than one drug. This reality is not surprising given what we now know about host/pathogen interactions in rUTI. Polymicrobial infections are not unusual. Given that genomic and other more modern approaches began to reveal bacterial diversity in this patient population, antibiotics targeting fastidious organisms were also introduced. In addition, several common uropathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica, are known to invade urothelial cells and form intracellular bacterial communities. Such reservoirs may be resistant to antibiotics present in the lumen, as many such drugs are not cell-permeant. This means that any sequestered bacteria are free to emerge later to reinitiate infection. The deeper layers of the bladder mucosa may harbour bacterial reservoirs, and cell turnover is slow. Uropathogens can also form biofilms that elaborate a polymeric capsule, conferring intrinsic antibiotic resistance. Most bacteria within these biofilms divide little, thereby failing to express a therapeutic target for most antimicrobial drugs. These insights might account for the protracted treatment periods required to achieve disease regression. Recurrent relapse, experienced by some patients in association with antimicrobial withdrawal, might be explained by similar mechanisms. The failure of some patients to tolerate antimicrobial withdrawal represents a significant clinical challenge that needs to be addressed in future work.

It is worth noting that intracellular reservoirs and biofilms clinging to shed urothelial cells are unlikely to be recovered during routine MSU culture. This test samples very small volumes of urine supernatant (typically 1–10 µl), whereas infected cells settle quickly to the bottom of sample tubes. Our laboratory and others have found that enhanced collection methods involving collecting sediment via centrifugation provide the necessary sensitivity.

The damped oscillations in pyuria demonstrated by most patients under treatment in this study suggest that antibiotic inhibition in the lower urinary tract is partial. Damped oscillations are seen in systems in which the retarding force, in this case antimicrobial therapy, is smaller than the force it opposes. The damped oscillator and long treatment periods needed support the use of maximum antibiotic doses. These oscillations also argue against our results being explained by simple regression to the mean.

### Nontyphoidal Salmonella as a Rare cause of UTI: a case report, systematic review, and analysis of Surveillance data [^1e85149a]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS; NTS-UTI) are uncommon. Although NTS infections typically result in gastroenteritis, cases of isolated UTIs have been documented. This report examines over 300 NTS-UTI cases described since 1980, highlighting trends in patient demographics, clinical presentation, and environmental exposure.

Methods

A search of the PubMed database was conducted for NTS-UTI reports published between 1980 and 2025. Urine isolate data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) across the USA between 2020 and 2024 were analyzed to estimate the incidence of Salmonella Bareilly (S. Bareilly) UTI. Correlation between S. Bareilly incidence and both chicken and egg production was assessed to explore potential associations.

Results

A total of 321 patients with NTS-UTI were identified in our systematic review. The cohort had an average age of 54.5 ± 24.0 years and an approximate male-to-female ratio of 8:10. Contributing factors for NTS-UTI included comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, and underlying urological conditions, including urolithiasis and recurrent UTI. Analysis of CDC surveillance data revealed a higher incidence of S. Bareilly UTI in the Four-State Area (Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma) compared with the national average.

Conclusions

Our findings highlight the importance of considering nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) in the differential diagnosis of UTI. Environmental exposure, comorbid conditions, and genitourinary abnormalities appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of NTS-UTI. A better understanding of these contributing factors may help to identify at-risk populations in regions where enhanced surveillance may be warranted.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^72f58a6d]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

---

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^404a297f]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — fluoroquinolone therapy by infection outlines conditions, likely pathogens, and agents that "are effective therapy." For urinary tract infection (UTI) due to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, Citrobacter species, and Serratia species, ciprofloxacin is listed. For acute otitis media or sinusitis with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, and for pneumonia with S pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, levofloxacin is listed. For gastrointestinal infections due to Salmonella species or Shigella species, ciprofloxacin is listed. For conjunctivitis caused by S pneumoniae or H influenzae, options include besifloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ofloxacin. For acute otitis externa or tympanostomy tube–associated otorrhea with P aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or mixed Gram-positive/Gram-negative organisms, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are listed, with formulations "Available with and without corticosteroid." Use assumes susceptibility ("Assuming that the pathogen is either documented to be susceptible or presumed to be susceptible to fluoroquinolones."), and for topical therapy "the use of topical agents should be determined by suspected pathogens, efficacy for mucosal infection, tolerability, and cost."

### Ampicillin sodium (ampicillin) [^f2222ffb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Ampicillin for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions:

 Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae, and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.

 Bacterial Meningitis caused by E. coli, Group B streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria.

 Septicemia and Endocarditis caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including Streptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci, and enterococci. Gram-negative sepsis caused by E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp. responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy. The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis.

 Urinary Tract Infections caused by sensitive strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis.

 Gastrointestinal Infections caused by Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever), other Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. (dysentery) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy.

Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ampicillin for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ampicillin for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

### Intersecting social and environmental determinants of multidrug-resistant urinary tract infections in east Africa beyond antibiotic use [^de7ee165]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Measurement of ABR and MDR

The patient urine samples underwent microbiological culture, pathogen identification and AST. Full methodological details and descriptive findings are reported elsewhere. Our analytical sample comprises patients infected with Gram-positive (n = 601) and Gram-negative (n = 1009) bacteria. Gram-positive infections were more common in Kenya vs. Tanzania or Uganda. Susceptibility to the tested ABs (see supplementary Table S1 for a full list of ABs tested) was determined by using the breakpoints (zone diameter interpretive criteria) indicated in the 2021 guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Our primary outcome was multidrug-resistant urinary tract infection (MDR UTI) (a binary classification) defined as urinary isolates resistant to at least one agent in three or more defined categories of antimicrobial agents, following the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidelines. We modified this to include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim, two ABs routinely used for treating UTIs in this region that are not included in the ECDC guidelines (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, for those species/genera not incorporated in the ECDC, i.e. Salmonella spp. Shigella spp. and Streptococcus spp. the MDR rates were calculated as above, but considering the resistance to a selected pool of tested ABs (Table S3). For the main analysis, isolates that showed intermediate resistance to a given AB were considered resistant, following local clinical practice. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis where we classified intermediate ASTs as susceptible. We constructed a secondary ABR outcome to reflect UTI treatment in East Africa (EA ABR). EA ABR was defined as resistance to any of the recommended ABs for treating uncomplicated upper and lower UTI from the National Treatment Guidelines (NTGs) for that country (for list see Table S4).

### Clinical overview of salmonellosis… [^8ef229d3]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview Salmonellosis, the illness caused by Salmonella bacteria, primarily results in mild to severe acute gastroenteritis. Laboratory testing, particularly culture, is recommended for the diagnosis of salmonellosis. With some Salmonella becoming less susceptible to essential antibiotics, antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be necessary. Most patients with salmonellosis require only supportive care. Antibiotic treatment should be considered only for patients with severe infections and patients at risk for invasive disease. Clinical features Symptoms of acute gastroenteritis due to infection with Salmonella can include:

- Sudden onset of diarrhea
- Abdominal cramps
- Fever usually present
- Nausea, vomiting, and headache may occur, though less frequent Diarrhea may last for several days and lead to potentially severe dehydration, especially young children and older adults.

Even after clinical symptoms are no longer obvious, Salmonella may be found in stool for several weeks.
- Occur in about 8 percent of persons with laboratory-confirmed Salmonellainfection
- Most commonly occur among young children, older adults, and people with a compromised immune system
- Can be severe and potentially life-threatening
- May occur as
- Bacteremia
- Meningitis
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic arthritis
- Bacteremia. Some patients might need antibiotic treatment.

Antibiotic treatment should be considered only for certain patients, such as
- People with severe diarrhea, blood infection, or extra-intestinal infections, and
- People at risk for invasive disease, such as
- Infants
- People who are 50 years and older with atherosclerosis
- People with immunosuppression, heart disease, or major joint disease
- Infants. Treatment recommendations
- Limit use of antibiotics for patients with an acute diarrheal illness to those with clinical indications.
- Recommended first-line antibiotics include fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and third-generation cephalosporins.
- Follow-up stool culture may be needed with prolonged diarrhea. See Also: Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea | Infectious Disease Society of America, 2017.

### Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options [^1215154d]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^38cfbfed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe? [^3ad70182]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

### Ampicillin sodium [^e69da20e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Ampicillin for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions:

Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae, and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.

Bacterial Meningitis caused by E. coli, Group B streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria.

Septicemia and Endocarditis caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including Streptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci, and enterococci. Gram-negative sepsis caused by E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp. responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy. The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis.

Urinary Tract Infections caused by sensitive strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis.

Gastrointestinal Infections caused by Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever), other Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. (dysentery) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy.

Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin for injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin for injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

### Refractoryinfection resulting in nephrectomy [^d521901d]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infections, though commonly associated with gastroenteritis, can demonstrate focal non-gastrointestinal organ involvement. We present the case of a mid-30s woman who presented with long-standing left flank pain and was subsequently diagnosed with refractory Salmonella pyelonephritis in the setting of nephrolithiasis, severe hydronephrosis and parenchymal thinning suggestive of renal atrophy despite normal serum creatinine and a normal appearing contralateral kidney. Despite several guideline-based antibiotic courses, we failed to clear her multidrug-resistant Salmonella species bacteriuria. We then established percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) drainage but still were unable to clear her infection, and it was noted PCN output dropped below 30cc per day suggesting a non-functional renal unit. This patient was successfully managed with minimally invasive laparoscopic robotic-assisted left nephrectomy which finally cleared her bacteriuria. This case illustrates challenges in the management of refractory atypical Salmonella infections and highlights the rare indication of nephrectomy in such cases.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^3e051995]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants

We recruited adults seeking care in EMERGE ncy ID NET, a network of 10 university-affiliated urban US EDs. All 10 study sites (Technical Appendix) provided institutional review board approval.

We enrolled patients > 18 years of age who sought care during July 2013–December 2014 and had flank pain or costovertebral tenderness; temperature > 38.0°C (100.4°F) measured by any method (i.e. oral, rectal, or axillary); and a presumptive diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (i.e. patient received treatment for this infection during ED visit or was prescribed treatment at discharge). All sites conducted an audit to compare characteristics of enrolled and nonenrolled eligible patients to estimate case-finding sensitivity and detect enrollment biases (online Technical Appendix).

Design and Measurements

We conducted a cross-sectional study by using a convenience sample of prospectively identified patients. ED physicians or study coordinators who used standardized forms at the time of care collected the following: demographic characteristics (i.e. age, sex, race, ethnicity); symptom duration; urinary tract abnormalities; UTI within the previous year; concurrent and immunocompromising conditions; antimicrobial drug use within the previous 2 and 60 days; a fluoroquinolone- or ceftriaxone-resistant UTI within the previous 90 days and 1 year; long-term care residence; hospitalization; travel outside North America within the previous 90 days; illness severity; disposition; and treatments provided. The study population consisted of patients with urine specimens that grew a single uropathogen at > 10 4 CFU/mL. We defined a uropathogen as an organism known to be associated with UTI; among possible pathogens, we found E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Salmonella species; Staphylococcus aureus or S. saprophyticus; and Enterococcus and Aerococcus species. If a urine specimen grew > 1 organism, we considered it to be contaminated and excluded it. We also excluded specimens that grew Lactobacillus, non- saprophyticus coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, or Corynebacteria species; or α- or γ-hemolytic streptococci.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1a72a468]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Time to switch from CLSI to EUCAST? A southeast Asian perspective [^b970fce7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Comparison of published zone diameter breakpoints revealed important differences. CLSI provides zone diameter breakpoints for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, whereas EUCAST has so far deemed disk diffusion unreliable for these organisms and provides only MIC criteria. Within EUCAST breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae there are no zone diameter criteria for azithromycin– Salmonella Typhi, and the nitrofurantoin breakpoint applies only to urinary Escherichia coli with the justification that other members of the Enterobacteriaceae are more likely to cause complicated or upper urinary tract infections for which nitrofurantoin is inappropriate. Breakpoints are rarely aligned between the two systems, and the proportion containing an intermediate category is markedly higher in CLSI guidelines. Using the Enterobacteriaceae as an example, 64/69 (93%) of CLSI breakpoints included an intermediate category compared to 24/48 (50%) with EUCAST, and EUCAST resistance cut-offs were higher in 26/33 directly comparable zone diameter breakpoints. Our susceptibility interpretation comparisondemonstrated that these discrepancies would have significantly increased reported co-amoxiclav and ciprofloxacin resistance rates amongst clinical isolates of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae had EUCAST 2018 breakpoints been used. It must be noted that from 1st January 2019, EUCAST changed its definition of the intermediate category to 'Susceptible, increased exposure'for when there is a high likelihood of therapeutic success because exposure to the agent is increased by adjusting the dosing regimen or by its concentration at the site of infection. As well as providing unequivocal interpretation of this category, this aims to extend the range of therapeutic options in an era of increasing AMR. The previous definition was more aligned with that of the CLSI as an area of uncertain therapeutic efficacy that included a buffer zone to allow for uncontrolled technical variation. Reporting of results in laboratories adopting EUCAST breakpoints will therefore need to reflect the new definition, requiring additional engagement with laboratory users.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella paratyphi a… [^040f023a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Fluoroquinolones have been the drug of choice for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever since the beginning of the 1990s. Multidrug-resistant strains began to prevail in disease-endemic areas, and former first-line antimicrobial drugs, such as chloramphenicol, were sometimes ineffective. In recent years, however, strains with decreased susceptibility to quinolones have emerged, and clinical treatment failure is a serious concern.

An 87-year-old woman was referred from a local clinic to Yokohama Municipal Citizen's Hospital in July 2002 because Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A was detected in her urine. She had no subjective symptoms such as pain on urination or urinary urgency, and her temperature was normal. She had never had paratyphoid fever, and she had not traveled abroad. No other person in the community had paratyphoid. Before being admitted to the hospital, she had experienced frequent episodes of urinary tract infection and had been empirically treated each time with oral antimicrobial drugs, including ciprofloxacin. She had been given a dose of 600 mg/day for 7 days, 25 times in the last 4 years.

The patient did not display any abnormal findings on physical examination. S. Paratyphi A was not detected in the urine but was confirmed in the stool; therefore, the previous report of bacteriuria could have been due to contamination of a urine sample with feces. An ultrasound showed a polyp and multiple stones in her gallbladder. A carrier state was suspected. Bile was obtained by duodenal aspiration and was positive for S. Paratyphi A. The patient was considered to be an asymptomatic cholecystic carrier of S. Paratyphi A.

On disk diffusion susceptibility testing, the isolate was resistant to nalidixic acid (NA) and to ofloxacin. The MIC of ofloxacin was as high as 256 µg/mL, and the MIC of ciprofloxacin was128 µg/mL (Table). An open cholecystectomy was performed for treatment of the polyp, the stones, and the highly quinolone-resistant bacteria. A routine perioperative intravenous antimicrobial agent, cefmetazole, was administered as surgical prophylaxis. The polyp was malignant, and the operation was curative. The patient resumed normal activities, and had no further fecal excretion of S. Paratyphi A.

### Unexpected source ofbacteraemia [^0e3e5d7f]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is emerging as a treatment alternative for infected aneurysms, with a 2-year survival rate of over 70% and EVAR has been successfully done in patients who are deemed as being high risk for open surgery. There is, however, concern of ongoing infection and surgical treatment should be considered for patients with aneurysm rupture or persistent fevers. Given the patient's age and comorbidities in our case, EVAR was the preferred surgical option.

Pneumonia with an effusion is an unusual source for P. mirabilis bacteraemia and therefore we should have actively pursued a vascular source of infection prior to her discharge. In retrospect, we believe that Proteus bacteraemia, in this case originated from either the urinary tract or less likely from an intravenous cannula site during her cardiology admission, resulting in seeding of the susceptible atherosclerotic thoracic aorta.

Learning points

When the cause of the gram-negative bacteraemia remains elusive after preliminary investigations, one should actively look for vascular infections as a source especially in patients with significant vascular risk factors.
Pneumonia is an unusual source for Proteus mirabilis bacteraemia, and therefore the clinicians should actively pursue a vascular source of infection after excluding the common causes.
Mycotic aneurysms from gram-negative microorganisms present with a higher incidence of aneurysm rupture and mortality compared with those from gram-positive microorganisms.
The clinical outcome in patients with infected aneurysms is poor, especially in patients with infection caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella species.

### Laboratory-based surveillance of paratyphoid fever in the United States: travel and antimicrobial resistance [^4d8cbc6e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of paratyphoid fever, including paratyphoid fever caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains, is increasing globally. However, the epidemiologic and laboratory characteristics of paratyphoid fever in the United States have never been studied.

Methods

We attempted to interview all patients who had been infected with laboratory-confirmed Salmonella serotypes Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, or Paratyphi C in the United States with specimens collected from 1 April 2005 through 31 March 2006. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), isolates underwent serotype confirmation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing.

Results

Of 149 patients infected with Salmonella Paratyphi A, we obtained epidemiologic information for 89 (60%); 55 (62%) of 86 were hospitalized. Eighty-five patients (96%) reported having travel internationally, and 80 (90%) had traveled to South Asia. Of the 146 isolates received at the CDC, 127 (87%) were nalidixic acid resistant; nalidixic acid resistance was associated with travel to South Asia (odds ratio, 17.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.8–75.9). All nalidixic acid-resistant isolates showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration, ≥ 0.12 microg/mL). Of 49 patients infected with Salmonella Paratyphi B, only 12 (24%) were confirmed to have Paratyphi B when tested at the CDC. Four (67%) of 6 patients were hospitalized, and 5 (83%) reported travel (4 to the Andean region of South America). One case of Salmonella Paratyphi C infection was reported in a traveler to West Africa with a urinary tract infection.

Conclusions

Physicians should be aware of the increasing incidence of infection due to Salmonella Paratyphi A and treatment options given its widespread antimicrobial resistance. A paratyphoid fever vaccine is urgently needed. Continued surveillance for paratyphoid fever will help guide future prevention and treatment recommendations.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^a008a86f]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

Global number of deaths and age-standardised mortality rate per 100 000 population by bacterial pathogen and infectious syndrome, 2019

Figure 1
Global number of deaths (A) and YLLs (B), by pathogen and infectious syndrome, 2019

Columns show total number of deaths for each pathogen, with error bars showing 95% uncertainty intervals, with the bars split into infectious syndromes. LRI = lower respiratory infection. iNTS = invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella. Salmonella Typhi = Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Salmonella Paratyphi = Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi. UTI = urinary tract infection. YLLs = years of life lost.

The age-standardised mortality rate associated with these 33 bacterial pathogens varied by super-region in 2019 but was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, at 230 deaths (95% UI 185–285) per 100 000 population, and lowest in the high-income super-region, at 52·2 deaths (37·4–71·5) per 100 000 population. Central African Republic was the country with the highest age-standardised mortality rate associated with these 33 bacterial pathogens, with 394 deaths (297–518) per 100 000 population, while Iceland had the lowest rate, with 35·7 deaths (25·1–49·3) per 100 000 population in 2019 (figure 2; appendix 1 [section 10]). The pathogens linked to the most deaths varied across locations. S aureus was the leading bacterial cause of death in 135 countries, followed by E coli (leading cause in 37 countries), S pneumoniae (leading cause in 24 countries), and K Pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii (leading causes in four countries each; figure 3A; appendix 2). S aureus, E coli, K pneumoniae, and S pneumoniae were among the five leading pathogens associated with the greatest death count and the greatest YLL burden in every super-region (figure 4). S aureus was also the pathogen with the highest age-standardised mortality rate in 16 of 21 GBD regions, S pneumoniae had the highest rate in three regions (Oceania, South Asia, and western sub-Saharan Africa), and E coli had the highest rate in South Asia and central and eastern Europe (appendix 1 [section 10]). The pathogens associated with the greatest age-standardised YLL burden varied across locations (figure 3B). S aureus was the leading pathogen in 111 countries, followed by S pneumoniae in 69 countries, and E coli in 20 countries (appendix 2).

### Cranberry constituents prevent SOS-mediated filamentation of uropathogenic [^931c1f59]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The rise in antibiotic-resistant organisms has created a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials. The average cost for the development of an antimicrobial can reach billions of dollars. Ultimately, targeting virulence traits that are shared by multiple pathogenic strains will increase the utility of a potential therapeutic. Filamentous morphotypes are readily observed in urine samples obtained from patients who suffer from UTI caused by UPEC, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. In addition, filamentous morphotypes are observed within human samples or in preclinical models of infection for Haemophilus, Salmonella, Legionella, Yersinia, Mycobacterium, and Citrobacter. Moreover, we have identified SulA-dependent filamentation as an essential virulence trait of both UPEC and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. In addition, the SulA-FtsZ protein interaction that controls filamentation is highly conserved, further suggesting that agents that prevent UPEC filamentation will also be effective against other pathogens. As with any therapeutic, there is the potential for bacterial adaptation to escape the new treatment. However, mutations that prevent cranberry components from binding to SulA would also prevent the SulA-FtsZ protein interactions. Thus, the bacteria would remain in the bacillary morphology and be susceptible to phagocyte-mediated killing and antimicrobial agents that act on the cell division machinery. In addition, targeting of the filamentous morphotypes due to the induction of SulA should also help reduce the accumulation of antibiotic-resistant strains through enhanced clearance of the individual bacteria that are capable of error-prone DNA damage repair through the SOS response.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Updated recommendations for the use of typhoid vaccine – advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2015 [^df9c1a8d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Vaccine Usage

Routine typhoid vaccination is not recommended in the United States.

Vaccination is recommended for the following groups:

Travelers to areas where there is a recognized risk for exposure to Salmonella serotype Typhi (the most recent guidelines are available at). Risk is greatest for travelers who have prolonged exposure to possibly contaminated foods and beverages, although short-term travelers are also at risk. Most travel-associated typhoid fever cases in the United States occur among travelers who are visiting friends or relatives; many travelers in this group do not seek pre-travel health care. Multidrug-resistant strains of Salmonella serotype Typhi have become common in many regions, and cases of typhoid fever that are treated with drugs to which the organism is resistant can be fatal. Travelers should be cautioned that typhoid vaccination is not a substitute for careful selection of food and beverages. Typhoid vaccines are not 100% effective, and vaccine-induced protection can be overwhelmed by large inocula of Salmonella serotype Typhi.
Persons with intimate exposure (e.g. household contact) to a documented Salmonella serotype Typhi chronic carrier (defined as excretion of Salmonella serotype Typhi in urine or stool for > 1 year).
Microbiologists and other laboratory workers routinely exposed to cultures of Salmonella serotype Typhi or specimens containing this organism or who work in laboratory environments where these cultures or specimens are routinely handled.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance 1990–2021: a systematic analysis with forecasts to 2050 [^7db2ace4]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Overview

To estimate AMR burden, we used the same broad methodological approach as the global burden of AMR in 2019 study. The detailed methods of that study are published elsewhereand are summarised here, along with important methodological improvements.

We developed an approach for estimating the burden of AMR that builds on death and select incidence estimates for different underlying conditions from GBD 2021 (appendix 1 pp 16–74, 80). First, we collected data from multiple sources, ensuring that we included information available by year, age, and location across our ten estimation steps wherever possible. We estimated the AMR burden associated with and attributable to 11 of the 22 modelled infectious syndromes (bloodstream infections; meningitis; lower respiratory infections; endocarditis; peritoneal and intra-abdominal infections; diarrhoea; urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis; infections of bones, joints, and related organs; infections of the skin and subcutaneous systems; tuberculosis; and typhoid, paratyphoid, and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella), 22 bacterial pathogens, 16 drug categories or combinations of drugs for which there is resistance, and 84 pathogen–drug combinations (appendix 1 pp 51–52). We modelled all-age and age-specific deaths and DALYs for 204 countries and territories, and we present aggregated estimates globally and for each of the seven GBD super-regions and 21 GBD regions. For a complete list of GBD locations by region see appendix 2 (pp 18–35).

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Salmonella (salmonellosis) [^8cd715d6]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Salmonella are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness and fever called salmonellosis. Salmonella can be spread by food handlers who do not wash their hands and/or the surfaces and tools they use between food preparation steps, and when people eat raw or undercooked foods. Salmonella can also spread from animals to people. People who have direct contact with certain animals, including poultry and reptiles, can spread the bacteria from the animals to food if they do not practice proper hand washing hygiene before handling food. Pets can also spread the bacteria within the home environment if they eat food contaminated with Salmonella. Symptoms Most people infected with Salmonella will begin to develop symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness, salmonellosis, usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps.

More severe cases of salmonellosis may include a high fever, aches, headaches, lethargy, a rash, blood in the urine or stool, and in some cases may become fatal. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that approximately 450 persons in the United States die each year from acute salmonellosis. Due to the range in severity of illness, people should consult their healthcare provider if they suspect that they have developed symptoms that resemble a Salmonella infection. At-Risk Groups Children younger than five, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe salmonellosis infections. Learn more about People at Risk of Foodborne Illness. Foods Linked to U. S. Outbreaks of Salmonellosis Past U. S.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

Blood cultures were obtained in 339 patients, of which 80 (24%) had bacteremia with growth of E. coli in the majority of the cases (n = 67, 84%).

Both treatment regimens resulted in a high clinical cure rate at short-term follow-up in the ITT population (90% vs. 95% in patients treated for 7 or 14 days, respectively) (Table 3). The difference in short-term clinical cure rate between both treatment arms was 4.5% (90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7, P non-inferiority = 0.072). Accordingly, the criteria for non-inferiority were not met as the 90% CI exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The median time to defervescence did not differ between the two groups: 2 (IQR, 1–2) days in 7-day antimicrobial treatment, 2 (IQR, 1–3) days in 14-day antimicrobial treatment. Short-term clinical cure was 85% in non-randomized patients, whereas median time to defervescence amounted to 2 (IQR, 1–3) days. Among all analysis performed, there were no significant differences between ITT and PP analysis. Therefore, within the following, only outcomes of ITT analysis are presented.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^dffd6966]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

Proquin XR is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms listed below. Proquin XR is not interchangeable with other ciprofloxacin extended-release or immediate release oral formulations. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PROQUIN XR IN TREATING PYELONEPHRITIS, COMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS, AND INFECTIONS OTHER THAN UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. Alternative therapy should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic or develop fever and back pain while on treatment with Proquin XR.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Proquin XR and other antibacterial drugs, Proquin XR should only be used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and sensitivity information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Infectious syndrome estimates

Detailed methods on the estimation process for infectious syndromes have been published previouslyand are in appendix 1 (section 4). Briefly, we used the available data described in the Input data section (multiple cause of death, hospital data with patient discharge status, linkage data, and CHAMPS) to determine the infectious syndrome responsible for sepsis by underlying cause, age, sex, and geographical location. Within our modelling framework, an infectious syndrome is the infection directly responsible for sepsis and serves as the bridge between the underlying cause of death and sepsis. We estimated 11 infectious syndromes: meningitis and other bacterial CNS infections; cardiac infections; peritoneal and intra-abdominal infections; lower respiratory infections and all related infections in the thorax; bacterial infections of the skin and subcutaneous systems; infections of bones, joints, and related organs; typhoid, paratyphoid, and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella; diarrhoea; urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis; bloodstream infections; and gonorrhoea and chlamydia. We then used syndrome-and-age-specific mixed effects logistic regression models (using sex, Healthcare Access and Quality Index, and syndrome-specific bias covariates and a nested random effect on underlying cause) to estimate the fraction of sepsis-related deaths that were caused by each infectious syndrome for each underlying cause of death, age, sex, and geographical location. Applying this fraction to the estimate of number of infection-related deaths from the previous step, we determined the number of deaths that occurred due to a given infectious syndrome by underlying cause of death, age, sex, and geographical location. We estimated deaths with an infectious syndrome as the sum of deaths with the syndrome as an underlying cause of death (ie, for those syndromes considered to be underlying causes) plus deaths with a non-infectious underlying cause where the syndrome was estimated to occur (eg, all deaths where the underlying cause was meningitis plus all road traffic injury deaths in which meningitis occurred). Bloodstream infections; infections of bones, joints, and related organs; and peritoneal and intra-abdominal infections are not estimated in GBD, so for these three infectious syndromes, we assumed they had a non-infectious underlying cause to estimate deaths.

### Metabolic state-driven nutrient-based approach to combat bacterial antibiotic resistance [^639a49cc]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

It was recently shown that nutrient metabolite-enabled killing of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is a successful strategy in mice, an important advance in the field. More specifically, mannitol improved outcomes following treatment of chronic E. coli biofilm infections with gentamycin in a mouse model for urinary tract infectionsand indole-3-acetic acid and ciprofloxacin synergistically promoted survival of high-fat diet-fed mice infected with persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Similarly, when pathogenic E. tarda EIB202 and ATCC15947 biofilms were seeded via catheter into the urinary tracts of mice, kanamycin plus alanine and/or glucose or fructose more effectively inhibited infection of mouse urinary tract and kidneys than kanamycin alone. Pyruvate, citrulline, and glutamine plus aminoglycosides more effectively inhibited infection of mouse blood, liver, and spleen by gentamicin-resistant V. alginolyticus or apramycin-resistant Salmonella than antibiotic alone. Extending these in vivo observations to another species, glucose, pyruvate, or fructose plus gentamicin synergistically inhibited bacterial infections in zebrafish or chicken and were more effective than gentamicin alone. More importantly, a combined antibacterial agent with an antibiotic and glutamine, which is identified by metabolic state-driven approach, is being developed by Guangdong Litai Pharmaceutical Co.

These data support future clinical applications using synergistic combinations of metabolites and antibiotics to prevent or mitigate infections with antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.

### Clinical overview of salmonellosis | Salmonella infection… [^e1c6bf58]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview Salmonellosis, the illness caused by Salmonella bacteria, primarily results in mild to severe acute gastroenteritis. Laboratory testing, particularly culture, is recommended for the diagnosis of salmonellosis. With some Salmonella becoming less susceptible to essential antibiotics, antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be necessary. Most patients with salmonellosis require only supportive care. Antibiotic treatment should be considered only for patients with severe infections and patients at risk for invasive disease. Clinical features Symptoms of acute gastroenteritis due to infection with Salmonella can include:

- Sudden onset of diarrhea
- Abdominal cramps
- Fever usually present
- Nausea, vomiting, and headache may occur, though less frequent Diarrhea may last for several days and lead to potentially severe dehydration, especially young children and older adults.

Even after clinical symptoms are no longer obvious, Salmonella may be found in stool for several weeks. Extra-intestinal infection Sometimes, Salmonella infection spreads to urine, blood, bones, or other internal organs, causing symptoms related to that body part or system. Some of these extra-intestinal infections can have long-term effects, depending on which part of the body is infected. Invasive infections, and
- People at risk for invasive disease, such as
- Infants
- People who are 50 years and older with atherosclerosis
- People with immunosuppression, heart disease, or major joint disease
- Infants.

Treatment recommendations
- Limit use of antibiotics for patients with an acute diarrheal illness to those with clinical indications.
- Recommended first-line antibiotics include fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and third-generation cephalosporins.
- Follow-up stool culture may be needed with prolonged diarrhea. See Also: Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea | Infectious Disease Society of America, 2017.

### Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infections: evaluation of methodological quality using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation II instrument [^c10af6fc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Reliance on evidence-based medicine requires high methodological standards from guideline developers. We sought to determine the methodological quality of guidelines on pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). We included guidelines published by national or international committees in the last 10 years providing recommendations for antibiotic type or duration. We applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II checklist, adding under each item the specific focus relevant to bacterial infections, addressing antibiotic resistance and local epidemiology. Three assessors scored each guideline independently. Mean aggregated scores, converted to percentage per domain, are presented. We included 13 guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia and seven guidelines for the treatment of UTI. 'Scope and purpose' scored 69.4% for pneumonia and 71.4% for UTI. Guidelines were downgraded for lack of an epidemiological overview relevant to intended users. 'Stakeholder involvement' scored 39.5% for pneumonia and 44.5% UTI, with the major fault being lack of patient consultation. 'Rigour of development' scored 42.8% for pneumonia and 56.9% for UTI. Commonly, the search process lacked precision, no risk of bias assessment was performed, outcomes in primary studies were not critically assessed or used to direct recommendations, and there was no formal methodology for formulating recommendations. 'Clarity of presentation' scored highest: 67.7% for pneumonia and 68.5% for UTI. 'Applicability' of the guidelines in antibiotic stewardship programmes was usually not addressed: 16.9% and 25.4%, respectively. 'Editorial independence' scored 30.6% for pneumonia and 55.6% for UTI. Formal examination of guidelines in infectious diseases showed worrying findings related to core methodology and potential bias caused by competing interests.

### Global spread of mobile antimicrobial drug resistance determinants in human and animal Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains causing community-acquired infections [^1ac272f1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial drugs used in human infection treatment and animal husbandry may select for drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, which are increasingly observed worldwide. We sought to examine the extent to which identical mobile drug resistance elements are shared across common pathogens isolated from human and animal sources.

Methods

We compared the distribution of one class of mobile elements — integrons and gene cassettes — among uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates from human diarrhea cases, and E. coli and Salmonella isolates from nonhuman sources in the United States. The sequences of the gene cassettes were also compared with those deposited in GenBank.

Results

Class 1 integrons were detected in 68 (49%) of 139 uropathogenic E. coli isolates, 16 (72%) of 22 human and animal Salmonella isolates, and 120 (28%) of 436 nonhuman E. coli isolates. The most prevalent cassettes were those encoding aminoglycoside adenyltransferase A (aadA) and dihydrofolate reductase A (dfrA). Sequences of aadA1, dfrA12-orfF-aadA2, and dfrA17-aadA5 gene cassettes from 35 urinary tract infection E. coli isolates and of aadA2 and aadA12 gene cassettes from 7 Salmonella isolates were 100% identical to the corresponding cassette sequences from food animal E. coli isolates and those deposited in GenBank from a wide variety of bacteria isolated from animal hosts from distinct regions of the world.

Conclusion

Common community-acquired human drug-resistant infections are caused by bacterial strains that harbor mobile drug resistance determinants of identical sequences that are found in diverse bacterial species from varied animal sources worldwide.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^3389b020]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^dd9942a8]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Methenamine hippurate (Hiprex) [^60857047]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS

HIPREX is indicated for prophylactic or suppressive treatment of frequently recurring urinary tract infections when long-term therapy is considered necessary. This drug should only be used after eradication of the infection by other appropriate antimicrobial agents.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of HIPREX and other antibacterial drugs, HIPREX should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^fde217b5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^2be4e0aa]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Salmonella enterica serovar agbeni, British columbia, Canada, 2011 [^a074dccb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Culture results of urine samples were positive for 3 (38%) of the 8 ill persons; feces were not tested. All 3 persons had symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI), and 2 had fever. All were men and were the oldest persons reported. Two had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms before UTI symptoms. For 1 person, the interval between onset of GI and UTI symptoms was 15 days.

Approximately 1% of nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. infections are detected in urine. In British Columbia, ≈3% of Salmonella isolates submitted to the reference laboratory are isolated from urine (British Columbia Centre for Disease Control's Public Health Microbiology and Reference Laboratory, unpub. data). Salmonella spp. are more often recovered from urine in adults > 60 years of age, children, and female patients. Immunocompromising conditions and urinary tract structural abnormalities also are risk factors for isolating the organism in urine. Also, certain Salmonella serogroups or serotypes are more likely than others to be isolated from urine. GI symptoms concurrent with or preceding UTI are rare. We found no literature to suggest whether S. enterica ser. Agbeni is more likely to cause systemic illness or UTI. The only risk factor identified among the persons reported here was older age. Unlike persons in other reports, persons in our report were all men, and 2 reported GI symptoms. The mechanism for UTI in these cases is unclear but could have included ascending and hematogeneous spread.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^2aca5aa2]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.
