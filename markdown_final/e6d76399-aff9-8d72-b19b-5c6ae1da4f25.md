## Question

What are the potential risks of hypotension when combining telmisartan and nifedipine XL with sildenafil?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential risks of hypotension when combining telmisartan, nifedipine XL, and sildenafil. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms of each agent and how they converge on blood pressure. Then, I should verify the direct drug–drug interaction signals from authoritative sources. Next, I will quantify the expected magnitude of blood pressure reduction using guideline and FDA data. After that, I need to assess patient-level risk modifiers and clinical scenarios that amplify hypotension. Finally, I will translate this into practical management and monitoring recommendations, including dose timing and what to avoid, and I will double-check for any overlooked contraindications or special populations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis for concern. Telmisartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor, reducing systemic vascular resistance. Nifedipine XL is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that causes arterial vasodilation. Sildenafil inhibits PDE5, increasing cGMP and producing vasodilation, including systemic effects beyond the pulmonary circulation. Together, these represent three independent vasodilatory mechanisms with additive potential for blood pressure lowering, which is precisely why guidelines flag PDE5 inhibitors as generally safe with antihypertensives but advise caution due to additive hypotension risk [^e17ec969] [^9c8358d1] [^f71d6d0d].

> Wait, let me verify the direct interaction signals for the exact triad. DrugBank explicitly notes that sildenafil increases the antihypertensive effects of telmisartan and that sildenafil combined with nifedipine increases the risk or severity of hypotension; it also flags that telmisartan may decrease nifedipine excretion, which could raise nifedipine levels and further potentiate vasodilation, though the clinical significance of this PK effect is less certain and may vary by patient and formulation [^2c225b0a]. Hold on, I should also confirm the broader regulatory stance: FDA labeling repeatedly warns that PDE5 inhibitors can augment the blood pressure–lowering effects of antihypertensives, with additive effects most clearly quantified with amlodipine and alpha-blockers, supporting the plausibility of a similar additive effect with nifedipine and telmisartan [^9c8358d1] [^fe98b8d5].

> I will now examine the magnitude of effect to anchor risk. With sildenafil 100 mg plus amlodipine 5–10 mg, the FDA reports a mean additional reduction of about 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic; while this is not identical to nifedipine XL, the class effect of dihydropyridine CCBs supports a comparable order of magnitude when combined with sildenafil, and the addition of telmisartan would be expected to contribute further reduction, albeit modestly, given ARB effects on vascular resistance [^9b1ee1f6] [^9c8358d1]. Let me consider the ARB contribution: although I initially thought telmisartan might add 5–10 mmHg, I should double-check; valsartan data show roughly 80% inhibition of angiotensin II pressor responses at peak with persistent effect, but translating that to absolute BP reduction is dose- and patient-dependent, so a safer estimate is that telmisartan may add a few mmHg of reduction, with the dominant additive effect coming from sildenafil plus the CCB, totaling roughly 10–15 mmHg or more in susceptible patients [^ccf97d61] [^9c8358d1].

> Next, I should review patient-level risk modifiers that make symptomatic hypotension more likely. Volume depletion, elderly age, autonomic dysfunction, and preexisting low blood pressure all increase susceptibility; concurrent alpha-blockers, alcohol, or CYP3A4 inhibitors can further amplify hypotension, and nifedipine itself carries warnings for severe hypotension, particularly with CYP3A4 interactions or in vulnerable patients [^9c8358d1] [^11ef8504] [^1789d2de]. Hold on, I should verify the CYP angle: nifedipine is a CYP3A substrate, and strong CYP3A inhibitors can raise nifedipine exposure and hypotension risk; sildenafil is also CYP3A-metabolized, so coadministration with potent CYP3A inhibitors can increase sildenafil levels and hypotension risk, compounding the additive vasodilation [^11ef8504] [^639106ac].

> I need to ensure I address special clinical contexts. In heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, guidelines caution against combining PDE5 inhibitors with agents that also augment cGMP signaling, such as riociguat, due to profound hypotension; while telmisartan is not a guanylate cyclase stimulator, the principle that stacking vasodilatory pathways can precipitate hypotension remains relevant, and patients with HFrEF or PAH may have limited hemodynamic reserve, so even modest additive BP drops can be consequential [^040bcf9d] [^f71d6d0d]. But wait, what if the patient is using this combination for high-altitude illness? Wilderness guidelines explicitly advise avoiding combined nifedipine with sildenafil or tadalafil due to hypotension risk, underscoring that the interaction is clinically meaningful in real-world settings [^ac21d637] [^9dc5fe62].

> Let me translate this into practical management. I should confirm that the patient is stable on telmisartan and nifedipine XL before adding sildenafil, and if sildenafil is initiated, start at the lowest effective dose, typically 25–50 mg, with consideration of 25 mg in older adults or those with borderline BP. Separate dosing by several hours to blunt peak overlap, and counsel on slow positional changes, hydration, and alcohol avoidance on dosing days [^9c8358d1] [^55bb34b2]. I should double-check for interacting drugs: avoid strong CYP3A inhibitors when possible, and if they must be used, consider further sildenafil dose reduction and closer monitoring; likewise, monitor for nifedipine-related edema and hypotension, adjusting the CCB dose if needed [^11ef8504] [^639106ac].

> Next, I should review monitoring. Home BP checks before and after sildenafil dosing for the first few uses are prudent, with explicit return precautions for dizziness, syncope, or visual symptoms. In clinic, reassess BP within 1–2 weeks of initiating or changing sildenafil, and review all concomitant vasodilators, diuretics, and CYP3A inhibitors at each visit to mitigate cumulative effects [^9c8358d1] [^e17ec969]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not missing a contraindication: nitrates and riociguat are absolute contraindications with PDE5 inhibitors, so I need to ensure neither is present before any sildenafil use [^cc39de44] [^3cb7292a].

> I should confirm special populations and exceptions. In pregnancy, nifedipine is commonly used, but sildenafil is not standard for maternal hypotension concerns and should be avoided unless there is a compelling obstetric indication under specialist supervision. In older adults with autonomic dysfunction or on multiple vasodilators, the threshold for starting sildenafil should be higher and the initial dose lower, with close follow-up [^7dd55e95] [^9c8358d1]. Let me reconsider the overall risk framing: while many patients tolerate this combination without symptoms, the additive vasodilation is real, and the clinical impact is unpredictable in those with marginal baseline BP or volume status, so a conservative, monitor-closely approach is warranted [^e17ec969] [^9c8358d1].

> In summary, the principal risk is additive systemic vasodilation leading to symptomatic hypotension, with an expected additional BP reduction on the order of roughly 10–15 mmHg or more in susceptible patients, driven largely by sildenafil plus the CCB and modestly augmented by telmisartan. The interaction is pharmacodynamic and dose-related, with risk amplified by volume depletion, age, autonomic dysfunction, and CYP3A-mediated increases in drug exposure, so I recommend stabilizing antihypertensives first, starting sildenafil low, separating doses, avoiding interacting drugs, and monitoring BP and symptoms closely during initiation and titration [^2c225b0a] [^9b1ee1f6] [^9c8358d1] [^e17ec969].

The combination of telmisartan, nifedipine XL, and sildenafil increases the risk of **symptomatic hypotension** due to additive vasodilation [^e17ec969]. The risk is highest when sildenafil is first introduced or the dose is increased, especially in patients with volume depletion, elderly patients, or those with autonomic dysfunction [^9c8358d1]. Typical additional BP reductions of 8–10 mmHg systolic and 6–8 mmHg diastolic are expected, with larger drops in susceptible patients [^9b1ee1f6]. To mitigate risk, start sildenafil at the lowest dose, separate dosing by several hours, monitor BP closely, and counsel on orthostatic precautions [^55bb34b2].

## Pharmacological mechanisms contributing to hypotension

Each agent lowers blood pressure via distinct but complementary mechanisms, producing **additive effects**:

- **Telmisartan**: Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that blocks AT1 receptors, reducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone, thereby lowering BP [^1789d2de].

- **Nifedipine XL**: A dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits vascular smooth muscle calcium influx, causing arterial vasodilation and reduced peripheral resistance [^ccf97d61].

- **Sildenafil**: A PDE5 inhibitor that increases cGMP, causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation, including systemic arterial effects [^f71d6d0d].

Together, these agents produce **additive vasodilation**, which can precipitate symptomatic hypotension, particularly when sildenafil is introduced or uptitrated [^9c8358d1].

---

## Clinical evidence of hypotension risk

Clinical data and labeling consistently show **additive BP effects** when sildenafil is combined with antihypertensives:

- **Sildenafil with antihypertensives**: Sildenafil 100 mg with amlodipine 5–10 mg lowered supine BP by about 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic; similar or greater effects are expected with nifedipine XL due to its potent vasodilation [^9b1ee1f6].

- **Sildenafil with alpha-blockers**: Coadministration with doxazosin caused mean additional reductions of 7–11 mmHg systolic and 5–7 mmHg diastolic, with symptomatic hypotension in some patients [^66a23235].

- **Nifedipine XL**: Monotherapy can cause hypotension, and combining with other vasodilators (e.g. sildenafil) increases risk, especially in volume-depleted or elderly patients [^11ef8504].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **higher risk** of hypotension with this combination:

- **Elderly patients**: Greater susceptibility to orthostatic hypotension and falls.

- **Patients with autonomic dysfunction**: Impaired baroreflexes increase hypotension risk [^00ae0d6b].

- **Volume-depleted patients**: Diuretic use or dehydration amplifies hypotension [^1789d2de].

- **Patients with cardiovascular disease**: Coronary artery disease or heart failure may worsen with hypotension [^00ae0d6b].

---

## Clinical manifestations of hypotension

Hypotension with this combination may present with:

- Dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope [^9c8358d1]

- Orthostatic hypotension, especially on standing [^66a23235]

- Fatigue, blurred vision, or confusion

- Rarely, ischemic events in patients with coronary disease [^notfound]

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **cautious use** and monitoring:

- **Start low, go slow**: Initiate sildenafil at the lowest dose (25–50 mg) and titrate cautiously [^55bb34b2].

- **Separate dosing**: Consider separating sildenafil from antihypertensives by several hours to blunt peak effects.

- **Monitor BP**: Check BP before and after sildenafil, especially early in therapy or after dose changes [^66a23235].

- **Counsel patients**: Educate on orthostatic precautions, hydration, and alcohol avoidance [^55bb34b2].

---

## Practical clinical management strategies

To minimize hypotension risk:

| **Strategy** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Dose adjustment | Start sildenafil at 25–50 mg; titrate slowly based on tolerance and BP response [^55bb34b2] |
| Timing of administration | Separate sildenafil from antihypertensives by several hours when feasible |
| Monitoring | - Home BP monitoring <br/> - Clinic visits after dose changes <br/> - Watch for symptoms [^66a23235] |
| Patient education | - Rise slowly from supine/seated <br/> - Stay hydrated <br/> - Avoid alcohol <br/> - Report dizziness/syncope promptly [^55bb34b2] |
| Alternative therapies | Consider non-vasodilating ED options (e.g. psychotherapy, devices) in high-risk patients |

---

## Summary of hypotension risk

The combination of telmisartan, nifedipine XL, and sildenafil produces **additive vasodilation** and a predictable risk of symptomatic hypotension, with larger drops in elderly, volume-depleted, or autonomically impaired patients. Typical additional reductions of 8–10 mmHg systolic and 6–8 mmHg diastolic are expected, with larger falls in susceptible individuals. Use the lowest effective sildenafil dose, separate dosing, monitor BP, and counsel on orthostatic precautions to mitigate risk [^e17ec969] [^9c8358d1].

### Cardiovascular safety of sildenafil citrate (viagra): an updated perspective [^56528176]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) relaxes vascular smooth muscle, resulting in modest reductions in blood pressure that are insufficient to stimulate a reflex increase in heart rate. These blood pressure reductions are similar for healthy men and men with coronary artery disease (CAD) or who use antihypertensive drugs. Sildenafil does not affect the force of cardiac contraction, and cardiac performance is unaffected. Sildenafil is mildly vasodilating in the coronary circulation and does not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. During exercise and recovery, sildenafil does not cause clinically significant alterations in hemodynamic parameters in men with CAD, and it has no negative effects on coronary oxygen consumption, ischemia, or exercise capacity. Clinical trial data from > 13,000 patients, 7 years of international postmarketing data, and observational studies of > 28,000 men in the United Kingdom and 3813 men in the European Union reveal that (1) there are no special cardiovascular concerns when sildenafil is used in accordance with product labeling and (2) the risk for serious events such as myocardial infarction or death is not increased. However, because safety has not been established in patients with recent serious cardiovascular events, hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, or retinitis pigmentosa, physicians should consult their current local prescribing information before prescribing sildenafil for these patients. Among men with erectile dysfunction treated with sildenafil, the adverse event profile is similar overall to that in men with comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is similar between those with and without CAD, and it is similar between those who take and those who do not take antihypertensive drugs (regardless of the number or class). In a controlled interaction study of sildenafil and amlodipine, the mean additional reduction in supine blood pressure was 8 mm Hg systolic and 7 mm Hg diastolic. Sildenafil should be used with caution in patients who take alpha-blockers because coadministration may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some individuals. When sildenafil is coadministered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy before initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Also, in the absence of information specific to mixed alpha/beta blockers, such as carvedilol and labetalol, similar care should be taken as for alpha-blockers. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using organic nitrates in any form, either regularly or intermittently, is contraindicated. Before prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying CVD could be affected adversely by resuming sexual activity. Management recommendations based on cardiovascular risk, from the Second Princeton Consensus Conference, are presented.

5.4 Hearing Loss

Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.5 Hypotension when Co-administered with Alpha-blockers or Anti-hypertensives

Alpha-blockers

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may occur. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).

Consideration should be given to the following:

Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor.
In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.
Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.

Anti-hypertensives

Sildenafil has systemic vasodilatory properties and may further lower blood pressure in patients taking anti-­hypertensive medications.

In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and sildenafil, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information)

 Nitrates

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil with regular and/or intermittent use of nitric oxide donors, such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form [see Contraindications (4.1)].

 Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil with use of guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat [see Contraindications (4.3)].

 Concomitant Use with Drugs Which Lower Blood Pressure

Physicians should advise patients of the potential for sildenafil to augment the blood pressure lowering effect of alpha-blockers and anti-hypertensive medications. Concomitant administration of sildenafil and an alpha - blocker may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. Therefore, when sildenafil is co-administered with alpha-blockers, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

 Cardiovascular Considerations

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Patients who experience symptoms (e.g., angina pectoris, dizziness, nausea) upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of sacubitril / valsartan (LCZ696) and sildenafil in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [^8f6db8fa]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

In healthy subjects and patients with hypertension, sildenafil's effect on ABPM reduction did not differ significantly between waking and sleeping hours, suggesting that daytime effects observed following a morning dose in the present study may be extrapolated to night time. 20 The ABPM reduction following evening dosing of 100 mg sildenafil in the pooled population of healthy and hypertensive subjects, –5.8/–4.5/–5.3 mmHg SBP/DPB/MAP, is consistent with the daytime ABPM reduction observed in the present study (–6.4/–4.3/–5.1 mmHg) with coadministration of sildenafil and sacubitril/valsartan. 20 Further, in clinical use, the plasma concentrations of sacubitril/valsartan are expected to be 2‐fold lower (morning or evening) than the concentrations observed in the current study due to use of twice the prescribed dose of sacubitril/valsartan (200 mg b.i.d.). Therefore, the evening dosing of sildenafil in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan does not pose a relevant additional risk to patients beyond the risk identified in this study.

Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.

Anti-hypertensives

Sildenafil citrate has systemic vasodilatory properties and may further lower blood pressure in patients taking anti-hypertensive medications.

In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and sildenafil citrate, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Nitrates

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil citrate with regular and/or intermittent use of nitric oxide donors, such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil citrate with use of guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat [see Contraindications (4.3)].

Concomitant Use with Drugs Which Lower Blood Pressure

Physicians should advise patients of the potential for sildenafil citrate to augment the blood pressure lowering effect of alpha-blockers and anti-hypertensive medications. Concomitant administration of sildenafil citrate and an alpha-blocker may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. Therefore, when sildenafil citrate is co-administered with alpha-blockers, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil citrate treatment and sildenafil citrate should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Cardiovascular Considerations

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Patients who experience symptoms (e.g., angina pectoris, dizziness, nausea) upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.4 Hearing Loss

Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.5 Hypotension when Co-administered with Alpha-blockers or Anti-hypertensives

Alpha-blockers

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may occur. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).

Consideration should be given to the following:

Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor.
In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.
Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.

Anti-hypertensives

VIAGRA has systemic vasodilatory properties and may further lower blood pressure in patients taking anti-hypertensive medications.

In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and VIAGRA, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Effect of sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction taking antihypertensive therapy. sildenafil study group [^25101c3a]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Oral sildenafil is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), which is a common complaint for patients with hypertension and those taking antihypertensive agents. This post hoc subanalysis assessed the efficacy and safety of sildenafil in men with ED who were receiving concomitant antihypertensive medication. Efficacy was assessed in 3414 men (1218 of whom were taking antihypertensive medication) who received sildenafil (5 to 200 mg) or placebo for 6 weeks to 6 months in 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The significant improvements in erectile function demonstrated by sildenafil-treated patients were comparable in patients taking and those not taking antihypertensive medication. Safety was assessed in 3975 men (1094 of whom were taking one or more antihypertensive agent, classified as a diuretic, beta-blocker, alpha1-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker), who received sildenafil or placebo in 18 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. For patients taking sildenafil and antihypertensive medication, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (34%) was similar to that for sildenafil-treated patients not taking any antihypertensive agent (38%). The incidences of the most common adverse events and of adverse events potentially related to blood pressure decreases (eg, hypotension, dizziness, and syncope) were similar in both sildenafil groups. The number of antihypertensive medications taken from among the five classes had no effect on the adverse event profile of sildenafil. Sildenafil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED in patients taking concomitant antihypertensive medication, including those on multidrug regimens.

PRECAUTIONS

The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes, a medical assessment, and the identification of appropriate treatment.

Before prescribing LEVITRA, it is important to note the following:

Alpha-blockers:

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including LEVITRA, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions) leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following:

Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.
In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION).
In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking a PDE5 inhibitor.
Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^ccf97d61]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Sildenafil

When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Valsartan

Valsartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. An oral dose of 80 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 80% at peak with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. No information on the effect of larger doses is available.

Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan; very little effect on serum potassium was observed.

In multiple dose studies in hypertensive patients with stable renal insufficiency and patients with renovascular hypertension, valsartan had no clinically significant effects on glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, creatinine clearance, or renal plasma flow.

Administration of valsartan to patients with essential hypertension results in a significant reduction of sitting, supine, and standing systolic blood pressure, usually with little or no orthostatic change. Valsartan has indications other than hypertension which can be found in the Diovan package insert.

Amlodipine and Valsartan

Amlodipine and valsartan has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. Both amlodipine and valsartan lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance, but calcium influx blockade and reduction of angiotensin II vasoconstriction are complementary mechanisms.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) pharmacotherapy — there is a strong physiologic rationale for phosphodiesterase inhibitors because they cause pulmonary vasodilation and decrease pulmonary artery pressure, but no systematic study has examined tadalafil or sildenafil in HAPE as mono- or adjunctive therapy; combined use of nifedipine and sildenafil or tadalafil should be avoided due to risk of hypotension. Recommendation: Tadalafil or sildenafil can be used for HAPE treatment when descent is impossible or delayed, access to supplemental oxygen or portable hyperbaric therapy is impossible, and nifedipine is unavailable (Recommendation Grade: 2C).

### Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of sacubitril / valsartan (LCZ696) and sildenafil in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [^577d892f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Untreated patients (either newly diagnosed or with a history of hypertension but not receiving any antihypertensive treatment for ≥ 8 weeks prior to screening) with a mean SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and < 170 mmHg, or pretreated patients (receiving stable treatment with not more than two antihypertensive agents for ≥ 8 weeks prior to screening) with a mean SBP ≤ 160 mmHg at screening were enrolled.

The key exclusion criteria were use of antihypertensive prescription drugs, herbal supplements, and/or over‐the‐counter (OTC) medications and dietary supplements (including vitamins) within 2 weeks prior to initial dosing, severe hypertension (mean supine diastolic blood pressure (sDBP) ≥ 100 mmHg and/or mean supine systolic blood pressure (sSBP) ≥ 170 mmHg), or hypotension (mean sDBP < 50 mmHg and/or mean sSBP < 90 mmHg) at screening or at baseline. A 14‐day washout period was sufficient to eliminate the potential for additional drug interactions, other than those under investigation in this study, as it is longer than five half‐lives of all antihypertensive drugs used prior to screening.

### Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of sacubitril / valsartan (LCZ696) and sildenafil in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [^466c5353]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) is indicated for the treatment of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Since patients with HFrEF may receive sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil, both increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate, the present study evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interaction potential between sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil. In this open-label, three-period, single sequence study, patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (153.8 ± 8.2 mmHg mean systolic blood pressure (SBP)) received a single dose of sildenafil 50 mg, sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg once daily for 5 days, and sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil coadministration. When coadministered with sildenafil, the AUC and C max of valsartan decreased by 29% and 39%, respectively. Coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil resulted in a greater decrease in BP (-5/-4/-4 mmHg mean ambulatory SBP/DBP/MAP (mean arterial pressure)) than with sacubitril/valsartan alone. Both treatments were generally safe and well tolerated in this study; however, the additional BP reduction suggests that sildenafil should be administered cautiously in patients receiving sacubitril/valsartan. Unique identifier: NCT01601470.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) — treatment recommendations: We suggest that tadalafil or sildenafil be used for HAPE treatment if descent is impossible or delayed, access to supplemental oxygen or portable hyperbaric therapy is impossible, and nifedipine is unavailable; weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Combined use of nifedipine and sildenafil or tadalafil should be avoided due to a risk of hypotension. We suggest that CPAP or EPAP be considered for treatment of HAPE when supplemental oxygen or pulmonary vasodilators are not available or as adjunctive therapy in patients not responding to supplemental oxygen alone; weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. We recommend that diuretics not be used for treatment of HAPE; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. We recommend that acetazolamide not be used for treatment of HAPE; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. No recommendation can be made regarding dexamethasone for HAPE treatment due to insufficient evidence.

### Is the sildenafil product information adequate to facilitate informed therapeutic decisions? [^50ccfb9d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal therapeutics and the prevention of adverse drug effects begin with complete information. When new drugs are released, the manufacturer's product information is the main and often only readily available source of drug information and, therefore, greatly influences treatment strategies. Thus, it is vital that the information in the package insert is not only complete, but also as relevant as possible for the great diversity of patients that physicians encounter.

Objective

To review the product information for sildenafil for comprehensiveness and accuracy, with respect to whether the information is sufficient to facilitate optimal therapeutics and to prevent avoidable adverse events in the wide diversity of patients with erectile dysfunction seen in clinical practice.

Data Sources

Sildenafil package inserts, unpublished information provided by the manufacturer, Food and Drug Administration reports, and articles retrieved through MEDLINE through March 2000.

Data Synthesis

Deficiencies or inaccuracies persist in the sildenafil product information regarding sildenafil's effects on blood pressure; potential drug interactions with cimetidine, protease inhibitors, some antihypertensive drugs, alcohol, and drugs that may competitively inhibit cytochrome P450 pathways; and recommended sildenafil doses for older patients.

Conclusions

For physicians to practice optimal therapeutics, adequate, clinically relevant drug information is required. Several brief changes and additions in the sildenafil product information would assist physicians in making therapeutic decisions regarding the use of sildenafil in a very diverse patient population and in avoiding preventable adverse events.

### Erectile dysfunction and heart failure: the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors [^86c1567b]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Safety of PDE-5 inhibitors in HF patients

Common adverse effects of PDE-5 inhibitors are generally related to either the vasodilatory (for example, headache or flushing) or gastrointestinal (for example, dyspepsia or reflux) effects. Less commonly described adverse affects are visual complaints (for example, blue-green color tinge or blurry vision) or myalgias. 32 Nitrates are contraindicated during PDE-5 inhibitor use due to hypotension. As sildenafil and vardenafil have approximately 4 h half-lives, nitrates should be avoided for at least 24 h. 33 Tadalafil has a half-life of 17.5 h that prolongs the risk of severe hypotension with concomitant use of nitrates. Kloner et al. 34 demonstrated that nitrates should be avoided for 48 h after tadalafil use. If a patient should develop hypotension secondary to concomitant use of nitrates and PDE-5 inhibitors, then treatment recommended by the American College of Cardiology consensus statement should include placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position, fluid administration and possible further blood pressure support with α- and β-adrenergic agonists or an intraaortic balloon pump. 26, 32

Patients with HF are not exempt from the above adverse effects of PDE-5 inhibitors. However, does the impaired left ventricular function put HF patients at increased risk for adverse effects with PDE-5 inhibitors? Katz et al. 29 evaluated the safety of flexible dosing of sildenafil in 137 HF patients for 12 weeks. Among them, 60% of the treatment group and 48% of the placebo group developed adverse events; only 3 and 5%, respectively, were serious adverse events. Only two patients from each group discontinued treatment secondary to the adverse event. In a study by Webster et al. 30 there were no reports of any adverse effects among 35 HF patients receiving sildenafil treatment over a 6-week period. In a study by Freitas et al. 31 only 1 of 12 HF patients complained of mild headache and visual change associated with sildenafil treatment over a 4-week period. These studies demonstrated that it was safe to treat stable HF patients with sildenafil for their ED, and that their reduced left ventricular function did not put them at increased risk for adverse effects. However, it is important to note that these patients did not have HF secondary to aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Vasodilating medications, including the PDE-5 inhibitors, are generally avoided in patients with aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy because of a possible increase in outflow gradient and hypotension.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension pharmacotherapy — drug–drug interactions involving bosentan, sitaxentan, and sildenafil are highlighted as follows: a combination of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and/or a CYP2C9 inhibitor with bosentan may cause a potentially contraindicated significant increase in plasma bosentan levels and it is contraindicated; sitaxentan is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and its levels may be elevated by drugs that interact with organic anion transporter proteins, and when administered with oral contraceptive agents, sitaxentan increases oestrogen exposure which may result in a theoretically greater risk of thromboembolism; sildenafil is metabolized by CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route); finally, care is needed when PAH-specific medications are co-administered with antihypertensive drugs to avoid excessive systemic hypotension.

Other drugs that reduce blood pressure

Alpha blockers. In drug-drug interaction studies, sildenafil (25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) and the alpha-blocker doxazosin (4 mg or 8 mg) were administered simultaneously to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) stabilized on doxazosin therapy. In these study populations, mean additional reductions of supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 7/7 mmHg, 9/5 mmHg, and 8/4 mmHg, respectively, were observed. Mean additional reductions of standing blood pressure of 6/6 mmHg, 11/4 mmHg, and 4/5 mmHg, respectively, were also observed. There were infrequent reports of patients who experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. These reports included dizziness and light-headedness, but not syncope.

Amlodipine. When sildenafil 100 mg oral was co-administered with amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg oral, to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^911b1573]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Concomitant therapy with the following medications was prohibited: other ARBs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, β-adrenergic antagonists, calcium-channel blockers, any other antihypertensive(s), and potassium-sparing diuretics (for example, spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride), anti-arrhythmic drugs, nitrates, α-adrenergic antagonists and digitalis glycosides. Drugs to treat erectile dysfunction were permitted, except within 24 h (sildenafil, vardenafil) and 48 h (tadalafil) of study visits.

Outcomes

The objectives of this trial were to compare the proportion of patients achieving BP control and the change in MSSBP and MSDBP from baseline between antihypertensive treatment regimens, initiated with valsartan (80 mg), valsartan (160 mg) or valsartan+HCTZ (160/12.5 mg). The primary efficacy variable was change in MSSBP from baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included time to achieve BP goal (defined as the first achievement of the target BP goal of < 140 mm Hg systolic BP and < 90 mm Hg diastolic BP during the 6-week period), in all patients and in patients with stage-1 (SBP 140–159 mm Hg or DBP 90–99 mm Hg) and stage-2 hypertension (SBP⩾160 mm Hg or DBP⩾100 mm Hg).

During study visits, BP and heart rate measurements were obtained and AEs that occurred since the last study visit were recorded. Any unfavourable medical occurrence, regardless of its suspected cause, was considered an AE. The frequency and severity of AEs, as well as their relationship to study medication, were summarized.

### Pharmacology and drug interaction effects of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors: focus on α-blocker interactions [^5ddb03f7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Currently, 3 phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor agents are available worldwide for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED): sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. Each of these agents is effective across a broad range of etiologies, including vasculogenic ED in men. Because PDE5 enzyme is found within the vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of systemic arteries and veins, PDE5 inhibitors are mild vasodilators associated with small (and in general, clinically insignificant) decreases in blood pressure. However, because of the synergistic decrease in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) in the presence of organic nitrates, these 3 agents are contraindicated in patients receiving organic nitrates. The duration of interaction between a PDE5 inhibitor and nitrate administration depends on the specific drug being studied. The interaction between sildenafil or vardenafil and nitroglycerin is no longer observed by 24 hours. A preliminary study with sildenafil and sublingual nitroglycerin suggested the interaction is no longer observable by 4 hours. The interaction between tadalafil and nitroglycerin has dissipated by 48 hours after tadalafil administration. This is consistent with the longer elimination half-life of the drug. When PDE5 inhibitors are administered to patients with hypertension who are taking most antihypertensive agents (eg, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics), there are usually small additive decreases in blood pressure without a significant increase of adverse events. Some patients develop orthostatic hypotension when PDE5 inhibitors are used in conjunction with an alpha-blocker (typically for hypertension or for urologic conditions, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy). Precautions are necessary for all 3 of the PDE5 inhibitors regarding this potential interaction. Some studies suggest that the interaction is less relevant clinically if the patient has been undergoing long-term alpha-blocker therapy. Several analyses have suggested that PDE5 inhibitors do not increase myocardial infarction rates or death rates compared with placebo controls or expected rates from age-matched populations. In contrast, recent studies have shown that PDE5 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for a host of cardiovascular diseases. In general, these agents, when used appropriately, are highly safe and effective.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) WHO FC II — initiation and dose-adjustment guidance for oral agents includes the following: "ETRAs and PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the approved doses". For sildenafil, "the US FDA approved dose… is 20 mg tid", and "titration of therapy up to 80 mg tid has been done in clinical trials". For inadequate response to sildenafil, "we recommend consideration of increasing the dose in 20-mg increments to a maximum of 80 mg tid, or adding another agent". For bosentan, "Treatment with bosentan > 125 mg bid is associated with greater incidence of transaminase elevation and is not recommended". For ambrisentan, "patients should be started at the 5-mg daily dose… and, if well tolerated and treatment goals have not been reached, the dose should be increased to 10 mg", based on "greater improvement in 6MWD" with "10 mg… than 5 mg". For riociguat, "The dose of riociguat requires dose titration", and due to hypotension risk with PDE5 inhibitors, "male patients treated with riociguat should also be cautioned not to use PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction".

The NO Pathway: PDE5 Inhibitors and Riociguat

Endothelial NO induces vasodilation in vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibits platelet aggregation through the activation of sGC and the subsequent increase in production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The production of endothelial NO is reduced chronically in patients with PAH. Therapeutic agents that act on the NO pathway increase intracellular cGMP concentrations ultimately targeting vasodilation of the pulmonary vasculature and PAH symptoms. PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP in pulmonary smooth muscle and also is involved in platelet aggregation.PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil and tadalafil, prevent the breakdown of cGMP and demonstrate antiplatelet activity. Riociguat, a guanylate cyclase stimulator, sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO and directly stimulates sGC receptors, leading to an increase in cGMP.

Considering these mechanisms of action, concomitant use of NO agents with medications that have hypotensive or antiplatelet effects may have compounding additive adverse effects (Table 3). Studies have shown that PDE5 inhibitors generally are safe with most antihypertensives and vasodilating medications, apart from nitrates and some α-adrenergic blockers. Organic nitrates such as nitroglycerin, amyl nitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate are associated with significant risk of life-threatening hypotension when combined with a PDE5 inhibitor or guanylate cyclase stimulator, and therefore are contraindicated. If use of an organic nitrate is mandatory, at least 24 h of separation must elapse between the last dose of sildenafil, and at least 48 h must elapse after the last dose of tadalafil. Given the ubiquitous use of nitrates and the potential for patients with PAH to demonstrate chest pain, it is important to counsel all patients taking sildenafil, tadalafil, or riociguat to warn providers in emergency medical services to avoid nitrates. Nonuroselective α-adrenergic blockers such as doxazosin have demonstrated significant hypotension when used with sildenafil, with decreases in BP of up to 15 mm Hg systolic and 22 mm Hg diastolic. Close monitoring of patients receiving α-adrenergic blockers with NO agents is recommended.

### Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of sacubitril / valsartan (LCZ696) and sildenafil in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [^1adad2a1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil were well tolerated in this study when administered alone and in combination. Most AEs were of mild to moderate intensity and similarly distributed between the different treatment groups. The additional BP reduction observed when sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil were coadministered did not lead to any clinically relevant safety findings. Safety results from this study are therefore consistent with the overall safety and tolerability profile of sacubitril/valsartan reported in previous studies. 5, 6

Thus, this study reports that coadministration of sildenafil and sacubitril/valsartan did not impact the pharmacokinetics of sacubitril or sildenafil, and decreased the exposure to valsartan. A greater decrease in ambulatory BP was observed in patients with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension when sacubitril/valsartan was coadministered with sildenafil compared with the administration of sacubitril/valsartan alone.

The interaction between sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil was not investigated in patients with HFrEF, as the washout of other proven life‐saving concomitant medications was not justifiable. However, a two‐way crossover study with 50 mg sildenafil administered to patients with HFrEF resulted in increased cardiac output resulting from a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, aortic stiffness, and peripheral wave. 30 Sildenafil administered to patients with HFrEF was safe and well tolerated, and observed BP reductions comparable to those observed in the present study. 30 These results, consistent with previous studies, suggest that sildenafil is a suitable treatment for ED also in patients with HFrEF. 31, 32 However, as indicated in the product label, initiation of sildenafil treatment or dose increase in patients with heart failure receiving treatment with sacubitril/valsartan should occur cautiously.

RESULTS

A total of 28 Caucasian male patients with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 51.8 (± 8.5) years, a mean weight of 92.9 (± 13.1) kg, and a mean body mass index of 28.5 (± 4.0) kg/m 2 were enrolled in the study and included in the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic analysis sets. One patient received concomitant medication for the treatment of hypertension starting at Day 2, which was not considered an adverse event (AE). The patient was discontinued from the study due to elevated SBP (175 mmHg) on Day 3, in accordance with protocol predefined discontinuation criteria, without receiving any dose of sacubitril/valsartan. In all, 54% of patients (n/N = 15/28) were receiving pretreatment with antihypertensive drugs at the time of enrollment in the study.

5.6	Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for tadalafil to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions () and Clinical Pharmacology ()].

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions () and Clinical Pharmacology ()], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following:

ED

- Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.

- In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose.

- In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.

- Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs.

[see Dosage and Administration () and Drug Interactions ()].

BPH

- The efficacy of the coadministration of an alpha-blocker and tadalafil for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of tadalafil and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH [see Dosage and Administration (), Drug Interactions (), and Clinical Pharmacology (.)].

- Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting tadalafil for once daily use for the treatment of BPH.

### Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of sacubitril / valsartan (LCZ696) and sildenafil in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [^b764ec28]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Sacubitril/valsartan has been recently approved for the treatment of patients with HFrEF. Sacubitril/valsartan exerts its effects by inhibiting neprilysin and blocking the angiotensin II receptor 1. 2, 3 Neprilysin inhibition results in increased cGMP, the second‐messenger involved in mediating natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and multiple other beneficial effects of the neprilysin substrates ANP, B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C‐type natriuretic peptide (CNP). 3 Sildenafil is a widely prescribed medicine for the treatment of ED and pulmonary hypertension, and exerts its effects by increasing cGMP levels through inhibition of its degradation by PDE5. 7, 14 The recommended dose of sildenafil for treatment of ED is 50 mg once daily but may be increased to 100 mg for improved efficacy, if tolerated. 15 Since there is an overlap in the incidence of heart failure and ED, sildenafil may be coadministered with sacubitril/valsartan. Due to involvement of a second‐messenger, cGMP, common to the mechanism of action of both medicines, this study investigated the potential for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug–drug interaction when sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil are coadministered. Since sacubitril/valsartan is administered daily but sildenafil is likely to be taken intermittently, the study was designed to investigate the potential for a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between sildenafil single dose and steady‐state sacubitril/valsartan.

### Novel phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors: assessing hemodynamic effects and safety parameters [^536e743e]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The relaxing effect of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors on vascular smooth muscle has attracted much attention, especially in persons with cardiovascular disease. The results of early studies showed that sildenafil slightly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressures and has no effect on heart rate, while being safe and well tolerated. Studies also indicate that sildenafil does not contribute to the development of myocardial infarction or ischemia. Similar benign effects on hemodynamics and cardiac events have also been demonstrated for tadalafil and vardenafil. None of the PDE5 inhibitors adversely affects total exercise time or time to ischemia during exercise testing in men with stable angina. It is key to avoid concomitant administration of nitrates with any of the PDE5 inhibitors, because this combination can cause increased vasodilation and a subsequent drop in blood pressure. Sildenafil has an alpha-blocker precaution; tadalafil is contraindicated with alpha blockers except for 0.4 mg tamsulosin; vardenafil is contraindicated with alpha blockers.

METHODS

Study design and patients

The study was performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This single‐center study was conducted at Parexel International (Berlin, Germany) and approved by the local independent Ethics Committee (State Office of Health and Social Affairs, Berlin, Germany). All patients provided written informed consent prior to study participation.

This was an open‐label, three‐period, single sequence study in male patients with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension aged 18–65 years. Patients received a single dose of sildenafil 50 mg on Day 1, sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg q.d. for 5 days on Days 3 to 7, and sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg coadministered with a single dose of sildenafil (50 mg) on Day 8 (Supplemental Figure S2). The effect of sildenafil on BP are transient and not clinically significant in both hypertensive and normotensive patients. 20, 33 The BP‐lowering effect of sildenafil (at 40 mg and 80 mg doses) in healthy subjects lasted 5 h postdosing. 34 Therefore, a 1‐day washout between periods 1 and 2 does allow for a 48‐h separation between first dose of sildenafil and sacubitril/valsartan, which is adequate to avoid a carryover effect with regard to BP reduction. Steady‐state levels of sacubitril/valsartan are achieved in 3 days with twice daily administration of sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg or 400 mg q.d. in healthy individuals. 13, 35

Drug Interactions:

The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants) and may cause increased hypotensive effects\.

Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see Contraindications).

Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see Contraindications).

Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination.

Nitroglycerin at higher dosages may interfere with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Intravenous nitroglycerin can induce heparin resistance.

Administration of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. Do not mix Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with any other medication of any kind.

In the articles included in the present study, side effects following the use of SC were not reported. The maternal tolerance generally in pregnancy was analyzed by Dunn et al. and Ferreira et al. considering that using SC during pregnancy did not cause any serious side effects in the mother and that the available information supports the medication's safety and potential for use as a treatment for specific diseases affecting the mother and fetus. On the other hand, the Dutch STRIDER experiment revealed that newborns exposed to SC had a higher chance of developing neonatal pulmonary hypertension. The study sample consisted of pregnancies at high risk with fetal growth restrictions. However, there is a lack of research examining the safety of SC in pregnancies with normal risk. The controversy and extensive media coverage surrounding the STRIDER trials have raised public awareness of the risks associated with using this drug class in pregnant populations. This view presents significant obstacles for subsequent studies in this particular field. No long-term research followed infants, so we couldn't determine the medicine's childhood impacts. Due to its safety during pregnancy and lack of teratogenic effects, SC may be a potential premature delivery medicine.

Limitations

Our review has some limitations. The first concerns the differences in the baseline characteristics. Subgroup analyses for length of treatment (less than or more than six months) were not possible due to the small number of studies. Similarly, the majority of eligible trials provided data obtained in patients older than 60 years, using sildenafil. Furthermore, the lack of data on gender differences in cardiac outcomes did not permit the exploration of male and female behavior, whereas there have been significant advances with respect to cardiovascular disease in women in the last decade.

The second limitation pertains to the often missing information on cardiac geometry parameters; while considering that for all outcomes, 25% of trials had a risk of reporting bias.

The third concern is that the findings of this study are nonetheless prone to publication bias and that 13 out of 24 trials had unclear potential for selection bias (although none with a high risk), that may threaten their validity. On the positive side, industrial bias seems limited, as most trials were spontaneous studies that received only external support. The fact that some studies did not report data on all basic outcomes reinforces the value of the COMET initiative aimed at defining the minimum standardized set of outcomes that each clinical trial should report for specific health conditions.

A fourth concern is on the high heterogeneity found in the main analysis. In most, but not all, cases, this was reasonably explained by the inclusion criteria of the trials, degree of hypertrophy and chamber dilation, or by duration of treatment.

Finally, conclusions drawn from subgroup analyses considering only two studies are only indicative and should be interpreted with care. See specific limitations in Additional file 1 - Limitations.

### Blood pressure and safety events with vericiguat in the VICTORIA trial [^2f1d9103]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), concerns about hypotension often limit the use of potentially life‐saving medications. In the CHAMP‐HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) registry, lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) was an independent predictor of underuse or under‐dosing of neurohormonal antagonists in eligible patients. Although hypotensive patients should be evaluated for dehydration/overdiuresis with consideration of reducing or removing medications causing hypotension without survival benefit, it should also be emphasized that application of guideline‐directed medical therapies has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in HFrEF despite lowering SBP. Physicians must therefore balance the risk of hypotension with the expected longer‐term therapeutic benefits because withholding effective therapies for this reason may contribute to poor prognosis among patients with HFrEF. Indeed, even when SBP is not limiting, further data from CHAMP‐HF suggest a reluctance of physicians to prescribe or up‐titrate beneficial, but potentially hypotensive‐inducing agents, in the absence of other contraindications. Newer effective therapies in HFrEF that may lower SBP, such as angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), further complicate management of patients with HFrEF given their advanced age, frequent comorbidities, and multiple concomitant medications.

### Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of sacubitril / valsartan (LCZ696) and sildenafil in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [^4069bd8e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Sacubitril/valsartan (also known as LCZ696) is a first‐in‐class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) approved in many countries worldwide, including the USA and European Union, for the treatment of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/valsartan is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure (NYHA Class II–IV) and reduced ejection fraction. 1 Following oral administration, sacubitril/valsartan provides exposure to sacubitril, a prodrug which is further metabolized to the active neprilysin inhibitor sacubitrilat (LBQ657), and valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). 2, 3 Neprilysin inhibition by sacubitrilat increases natriuretic peptide (NP) levels, thereby promoting natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and inhibition of maladaptive fibrotic remodeling via their second‐messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). 3, 4 Along with neprilysin inhibition, simultaneous blockade of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) by valsartan inhibits the deleterious cardiovascular and renal effects of sustained activation of angiotensin II and its effectors. 5, 6

Study selection

Figure 1 shows the literature search process in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and SCOPUS (March 2012 to December 2013 and updated in May 2014). We identified 9,168 studies as potentially relevant. Of these, 8,727 were excluded based on title and abstract content and 417/441 were excluded after full text analysis due to: non-English language, non-human studies, not RCTs, no outcome of interest, PDE5i co-administered with other drugs. RCTs with PDE5i given on demand or for less than 30 consecutive days were excluded. A total of 24 RCTs were eligible and included in the review (18 administering sildenafil, 4 tadalafil and 2 vardenafil).

Safety results

Administration of single‐dose sildenafil 50 mg, sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg once daily (q.d.), and coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil was generally safe and well‐tolerated in this study. There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or AEs leading to study discontinuation. A total of 33 AEs were reported in 17 (60.7%) patients during the study. The number of AEs was comparable across treatment periods. The most commonly reported AEs were headache, dizziness, and diarrhea. Most of the AEs reported during the study were of mild intensity, while eight AEs reported in three patients were of moderate intensity. Overall, 11 patients reported AEs that were suspected to be related to the study drug. Most of these AEs were of mild intensity, with the exception of three that were of moderate intensity (somnolence, dizziness, and headache). The suspected treatment‐related AEs of moderate intensity were reported in the sildenafil single dose (1 AE), and sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil coadministration (2 AEs) study periods. All AEs potentially related to the study drug were resolved by the end of the study, and no action was taken with respect to study conduct. The pattern of AEs was similar when sacubitril/valsartan was administered alone or coadministered with sildenafil. No clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs and electrocardiograms of patients were observed during the study. Routine clinical laboratory tests were performed during the study and found to be within the normal range in all patients (renal parameters are provided in Supplemental Table S1).

### Interactions between drugs for erectile dysfunction and drugs for cardiovascular disease [^1f6e99e1]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

The association of erectile dysfunction (ED) and cardiovascular disease is well-documented in the literature and both conditions share risk factors. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the effect of underlying disease and adverse effects of the drugs and/or interactions between ED drugs and drugs implemented for cardiovascular disease. The known interactions of systemic administered drugs for ED with drugs for cardiovascular disease are mainly pharmacodynamic. Thus, nitrates enhance the production of cyclic GMP and combined with phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors this can lead to severe hypotension. The same is the case for the treatment with phentolamine in patients treated with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Due to increased partial thromboplastin time, the risk of bleeding is enhanced for intracavernous alprostadil injection in heparin-treated patients. Pharmacokinetic interactions of clinical importance have been described for ED drugs with other therapeutic groups such as sildenafil with the antifungal drug, ketoconazole, and apomorphine with the antiparkinson drug, entacapon. Although sildenafil and antihypertensive dihydropyridines like amlodipine are metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP3A4 in the liver, the combination of these drugs does not exhibit a synergistic blood pressure lowering action. Unfortunately documentation concerning drug interactions is often poor and occasional.

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: living with uncertainty [^7dd55e95]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Nifedipine is also available in a short/immediate‐acting capsule and a prolonged‐acting tablet that is usually prescribed 2 to 3 times daily. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and the shorter acting preparations are more likely to be associated with more rapid acute decreases in BP and reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, causing increases in heart rate and headaches, especially when used at higher doses (> 60 mg/d). 15, 16 Moreover, abrupt decreases in BP associated with nifedipine capsules are potentially more problematic for placental perfusion. 17 Dose‐related maternal adverse effects attributable to nifedipine such as headache, tachycardia, hypotension flushing, and nausea have been well documented, 15 although no comparative data exist for amlodipine in pregnancy. Amlodipine, which has a gradual onset of action, 16 is less likely to be associated with vasodilator symptoms and thus may be associated with better compliance and possibly smoother 24‐hour BP control compared with twice‐daily nifedipine tablets. 18 However, if the extended‐release preparation of nifedipine is used, the differences may not be significant in terms of 24‐hour BP control or side effects. 19 The slow onset of amlodipine also implies that antihypertensive effects are delayed (≈8 hours). 16 Limited information suggests that both nifedipine and amlodipine get into breast milk but are unlikely to be associated with adverse fetal effects. 20 Additional questions, not addressed by most studies, assess the impact of drug safety for different maternal diagnoses (eg, preeclampsia versus chronic hypertension) and pregnancy‐related changes in drug pharmacokinetics.

We are left with a situation in which some uncertainty remains regarding important safety issues when prescribing most antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy, despite documentation of use in hundreds of thousands of women. These drugs are not major teratogens, but more subtle and long‐term adverse consequences cannot be ruled out by available studies. The practitioner must carefully consider the risks versus the benefits of antihypertensive use in pregnancy, and clinical trials are needed to compare treatment of hypertension in pregnancy with and without antihypertensive drugs. The CHAP (Chronic Hypertension Associated With Pregnancy) study addresses this question and is nearing completion. In the meantime, although not the last word, Mito and colleagues 7 have contributed to our comfort with respect to amlodipine, but at present there is little reason to preferentially prescribe it over nifedipine XL in pregnant women. The uncertainties surrounding therapeutic interventions in pregnancy are a fact of life and one that is not likely to be easily resolved.

### Sildenafil citrate [^310f4df0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Twenty-five subjects were screened. Two were discontinued after study period 1: one failed to meet pre-dose screening qualifications and the other experienced symptomatic hypotension as a moderately severe adverse event 30 minutes after dosing with open-label sildenafil 50 mg. Of the twenty subjects who were ultimately assigned to treatment, a total of 13 subjects successfully completed dose period 1, and seven had successfully completed the previous doxazosin study (using sildenafil 50 mg).

For the 20 subjects who received sildenafil 100 mg and matching placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were as follows:

The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 100 mg sildenafil or matching placebo are shown in Figure 4.

Blood pressure was measured after administration of sildenafil at the same times as those specified for the previous doxazosin studies. There were three subjects who had a standing SBP of < 85 mmHg. All three were taking sildenafil 100 mg, and all three reported mild adverse events at the time of reductions in standing SBP, including vasodilation and lightheadedness. There were four subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following sildenafil 100 mg, one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following placebo and one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following both sildenafil and placebo. While there were no severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure reported in this study, one subject reported moderate vasodilatation after both sildenafil 50 mg and 100 mg. There were no episodes of syncope reported in this study.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (Caduet) [^fd568754]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Data from a drug-drug interaction study involving 10 mg of amlodipine and 80 mg of atorvastatin in healthy subjects indicate that the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not altered when the drugs are co-administered. The effect of amlodipine on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin showed no effect on the Cmax: 91% (90% confidence interval: 80 to 103%), but the AUC of atorvastatin increased by 18% (90% confidence interval: 109 to 127%) in the presence of amlodipine, which is not clinically meaningful.

No drug interaction studies have been conducted with CADUET and other drugs, although studies have been conducted in the individual amlodipine and atorvastatin components, as described below:

7.1	Impact of Other Drugs on Amlodipine

CYP3A Inhibitors

Co-administration with CYP3A inhibitors (moderate and strong) results in increased systemic exposure to amlodipine and may require dose reduction. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CYP3A Inducers

No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be closely monitored when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inducers.

Sildenafil

Monitor for hypotension when sildenafil is co-administered with amlodipine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.2	Impact of Amlodipine on Other Drugs

Immunosuppressants

Amlodipine may increase the systemic exposure of cyclosporine or tacrolimus when co-administered. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended and adjust the dose when appropriate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3	Drug Interactions that may Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Atorvastatin

Atorvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and transporters (e.g. OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp, or BCRP). Atorvastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP3A4 and transporters. Table 3 includes a list of drugs that may increase exposure to atorvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly and instructions for preventing or managing them [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4	Drug Interactions that may Decrease Exposure to Atorvastatin

Table 4 presents drug interactions that may decrease exposure to atorvastatin and instructions for preventing or managing them.

### Ramipril (Altace) [^e37b077e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Fetal Toxicity

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue ALTACE as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.7 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ALTACE and other agents that affect the RAS.

Telmisartan

The ONTARGET trial enrolled 25,620 patients > 55 years old with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, randomized them to telmisartan only, ramipril only, or the combination, and followed them for a median of 56 months. Patients receiving the combination of telmisartan and ramipril did not obtain any benefit in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and heart failure hospitalization compared to monotherapy, but experienced an increased incidence of clinically important renal dysfunction (death, doubling of serum creatinine, or dialysis) compared with groups receiving telmisartan alone or ramipril alone. Concomitant use of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended.

Aliskiren

Do not co-administer aliskiren with ALTACE in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with ALTACE in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

### Sildenafil citrate [^ea530aef]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 50 mg sildenafil or matching placebo are shown in Figure 3.

Blood pressure was measured after administration of sildenafil at the same times as those specified for the first doxazosin study. There were two subjects who had a standing SBP of < 85 mmHg. In these two subjects, hypotension was reported as a moderately severe adverse event, beginning at approximately 1 hour after administration of sildenafil 50 mg and resolving after approximately 7.5 hours. There was one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30mmHg following sildenafil 50 mg and one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following both sildenafil 50 mg and placebo. There were no severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure and no episodes of syncope reported in this study.

 Study 3: Sildenafil with Doxazosin

In the third study, a single oral dose of sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 3-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with BPH. In dose period 1, subjects were administered open-label doxazosin and a single dose of sildenafil 50 mg simultaneously, after at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin. If a subject did not successfully complete this first dosing period, he was discontinued from the study. Subjects who had successfully completed the previous doxazosin interaction study (using sildenafil 50 mg), including no significant hemodynamic adverse events, were allowed to skip dose period 1. Treatment with doxazosin continued for at least 7 days after dose period 1. Thereafter, sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (14 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (6 subjects) in standard crossover fashion. The mean subject age in this study was 66.4 years.

### Sildenafil citrate [^9b1ee1f6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

 Effect of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Co-administered with Anti-hypertensives: When sildenafil 100 mg oral was co-administered with amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg oral, to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic.

 Effect of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Co-administered with Alcohol: Sildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the hypotensive effect of alcohol (0.5 g/kg) in healthy volunteers with mean maximum blood alcohol levels of 0.08%. The maximum observed decrease in systolic blood pressure was -18.5 mmHg when sildenafil was co-administered with alcohol versus -17.4 mmHg when alcohol was administered alone. The maximum observed decrease in diastolic blood pressure was -17.2 mmHg when sildenafil was co-administered with alcohol versus -11.1 mmHg when alcohol was administered alone. There were no reports of postural dizziness or orthostatic hypotension. The maximum recommended dose of 100 mg sildenafil was not evaluated in this study [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].

 Effects of sildenafil on Cardiac Parameters: Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg produced no clinically relevant changes in the ECGs of normal male volunteers.

Studies have produced relevant data on the effects of sildenafil on cardiac output. In one small, open-label, uncontrolled, pilot study, eight patients with stable ischemic heart disease underwent Swan-Ganz catheterization. A total dose of 40 mg sildenafil was administered by four intravenous infusions.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^f6f16d7d]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

One combination in PAH treatment is the use of bosentan (a CYP3A4 inducer and substrate) with sildenafil, which together demonstrated a 50% reduction in the serum concentration of sildenafil and a 50% increase in bosentan concentration via competitive inhibition. Although this reduction in serum concentration of sildenafil is not considered clinically significant, the sildenafil plus bosentan combination failed to meet the primary endpoint in the Effects of Combination of Bosentan and Sildenafil Versus Sildenafil Monotherapy on Morbidity and Mortality in Symptomatic Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - A Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Group, Prospective, Event Driven Phase IV Study (COMPASS-2) trial, and this interaction may have contributed to this outcome. If bosentan and sildenafil are used together, patients may need to be monitored for increased bosentan adverse effects such as headache, hypotension, postural hypotension, and nasal congestion.

Compared with sildenafil, tadalafil has a longer half-life and is a less sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. If ritonavir must be used, it is advised to stop tadalafil at least 24 h before starting ritonavir because of the risk of hypotension at higher concentrations of tadalafil. As soon as ritonavir is at a steady state, approximately 1 week after initiation, tadalafil may be resumed at a lower dose of 20 mg daily to assess for tolerance before increasing to 40 mg once daily. Of note, long-term use of tadalafil with potent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin is not recommended. Tadalafil exposure when given with rifampin was reduced by 88%. Tadalafil also is not metabolized by CYP2C9. In contrast to sildenafil, when used in combination with bosentan, tadalafil has no clinical effect on plasma concentrations of bosentan. Therefore, tadalafil is less likely to be subjected to drug-drug interactions than sildenafil.

Information for Patients

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of LEVITRA with regular and/or intermittent use of organic nitrates. Patients should be counseled that concomitant use of LEVITRA with nitrates could cause blood pressure to suddenly drop to an unsafe level, resulting in dizziness, syncope, or even heart attack or stroke.

Physicians should inform their patients that in some patients concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors, including LEVITRA, with alpha-blockers can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Patients prescribed LEVITRA who are taking alpha-blockers should be started on the lowest recommended starting dose of LEVITRA (see Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be advised of the possible occurrence of symptoms related to postural hypotension and appropriate countermeasures. Patients should be advised to contact the prescribing physician if other anti-hypertensive drugs or new medications that may interact with LEVITRA are prescribed by another healthcare provider.

Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate use of LEVITRA and its anticipated benefits. It should be explained that sexual stimulation is required for an erection to occur after taking LEVITRA. LEVITRA should be taken approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. Patients should be counseled regarding the dosing of LEVITRA. Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare provider for dose modification if they are not satisfied with the quality of their sexual performance with LEVITRA or in the case of an unwanted effect. Patients should be advised to contact the prescribing physician if new medications that may interact with LEVITRA are prescribed by another healthcare provider.

Sildenafil, a potent and selective inhibitor of the cGMP‐degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), increases the concentration of cGMP. 7 Sildenafil augments nitric oxide (NO)‐induced cGMP‐dependent vasodilation in the corpus cavernosum and is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). 8 Given the high prevalence of ED (∼62%) in patients with heart failure, there is a possibility for coadministration of sildenafil and sacubitril/valsartan. 9

Sacubitril/valsartan analytes do not interact with drugs metabolized by liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that constitute the major metabolic pathway for sildenafil. 10, 11, 12 Although sacubitrilat is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 (IC 50: 40 μM), no impact on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin was observed when sacubitril/valsartan and warfarin were coadministered. 13 Thus, a CYP‐mediated pharmacokinetic drug–drug interaction between sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil is not expected. However, both sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil increase levels of the second‐messenger cGMP, which lowers blood pressure (BP) through its effects on basal vascular tone, indicating a potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil with respect to the magnitude of BP reduction (Supplemental Figure S1). 4, 7 Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the potential for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions between sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil. The study was conducted in patients with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension to account for a potentially greater BP reduction following coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil compared with administration of sacubitril/valsartan or sildenafil alone.

### Cardiovascular effects of tadalafil in patients on common antihypertensive therapies [^e30014fb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Tadalafil is a potent, selective, reversible phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Because some oral agents for ED have vasodilator properties, interaction studies were performed between tadalafil and commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents. In addition, cardiovascular safety assessments were made from a safety database of phase 3 studies comparing patients who were and who were not receiving antihypertensives. In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive therapy, tadalafil administration may result in a reduction in blood pressure, which is, in general, mild and not likely to be of clinical concern. In the phase 3 studies, no statistically significant differences were observed between tadalafil and placebo in the mean changes in blood pressure from baseline in patients taking ≥ 2 antihypertensive agents. The incidence rates of cardiovascular events were comparable between patients who were and were not treated with concomitant antihypertensive therapy, with the exception of events recorded as hypertension, which would be expected to occur periodically in this patient population despite treatment. Hypotension or postural hypotension was not reported in any tadalafil-treated patient, compared with 1 report of each in the placebo-treated patients. Syncope was reported in 1 tadalafil-treated patient (0.1%) who was not on concomitant antihypertensive medication and in 2 patients (1.9%) who received placebo with concomitant antihypertensive agents. The data presented herein suggest that tadalafil is safe in patients receiving ≥ 1 concomitant antihypertensive agent.

### Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction of sacubitril / valsartan (LCZ696) and sildenafil in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [^2c45aef2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Effect on ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM)

The effects of sacubitril/valsartan, sildenafil, and their coadministration on BP were measured through monitoring of 24‐h ABPM at baseline, Day 1 (sildenafil single dose), Day 7 (sacubitril/valsartan steady state), and Day 8 (sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil coadministration).

Single‐dose administration of 50 mg sildenafil resulted in a reduction from baseline of mean ABPM including ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (aDBP), ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP), and ambulatory mean arterial pressure (aMAP) during the daytime, night time, and over a 24‐h period (Figure 3 a–c). Administration of sacubitril/valsartan for 5 days also resulted in reduction from baseline of mean aSBP/aDBP/aMAP during daytime, night time, and over a 24‐h period (Figure 3 a–c). The BP‐lowering effect of sildenafil was smaller than the BP reduction observed with sacubitril/valsartan.

(a) Change in mean aSBP, (b) mean aDBP, and (c) mean aMAP measurements during sildenafil single dose treatment, sacubitril/valsartan steady state treatment, and coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan with sildenafil. aDBP, ambulatory diastolic blood pressure; aMAP, ambulatory mean arterial pressure; aSBP, ambulatory systolic blood pressure.

Coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil resulted in further reduction from baseline of mean aSBP/aDBP/aMAP during daytime, night time, and over a 24‐h period (Figure 3 a–c). Therefore, coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil was associated with a greater reduction in mean aSBP/aDBP/aMAP by approximately –5.4/–3.8/–4.4 mmHg (24‐h ABPM) compared with administration of sacubitril/valsartan alone (Table 3). This additional BP reduction was more pronounced during daytime, but not statistically significant for night time measurements (Table 3).

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension: the task force for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), endorsed by the international society of heart and lung transplantation (ISHLT) [^c18bf91a]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Table 20 — potentially significant drug interactions with PAH-targeted therapies — details key interactions and contraindications across ambrisentan, bosentan, sitaxentan, sildenafil, and tadalafil. For bosentan with sildenafil, "Sildenafil levels fall 50%; bosentan levels increase 50%. May not require dose adjustments of either drug", whereas with cyclosporine, "Cyclosporine levels fall 50%; bosentan levels increase 4-fold. Combination contraindicated". Bosentan exposure can also "decrease by 58%. Need for dose adjustment uncertain", and statin interactions are noted: "Simvastatin levels reduce 50%; similar effects likely with atorvastatin. Cholesterol level should be monitored". With glibenclamide there is an "Increase incidence of elevated aminotransferases… Combination contraindicated". Ambrisentan requires caution: "Caution is required in the co-administration of ambrisentan with ketoconazole and cyclosporine". Sildenafil levels rise with HIV protease inhibitors: "Ritonavir and saquinavir increase sildenafil levels markedly. Sildenafil dose-adjustments are usually required". With bosentan, tadalafil shows "Tadalafil plasma levels decrease by 42%, no significant changes in bosentan levels. May not require dose adjustment". Some combinations carry "Profound systemic hypotension, combination contraindicated". Sitaxentan strongly interacts with warfarin — "warfarin dose needs to be reduced by 80% when initiating sitaxentan and INR monitoring intensified" — and importantly, "Since the original publication of these Guidelines, the drug sitaxentan has been withdrawn from the market due to liver toxicity".

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^639106ac]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil have similar efficacy and safety profiles, they differ in drug-drug interactions because of pharmacokinetic attributes. Sildenafil is highly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, with metabolism by CYP2C9 to a lesser extent. Clearance of sildenafil is reduced when used concurrently with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, leading to higher plasma concentrations and increased severity of adverse effects such as pronounced hypotension, syncope, hearing and vision loss. Coadministration of sildenafil for PAH therapy with potent CYP inhibitors such as ritonavir and cobicistat is contraindicated. Ritonavir inhibits both sites of sildenafil metabolism at CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, resulting in a substantial increase of sildenafil levels. A single dose of sildenafil 100 mg with ritonavir 500 mg increased sildenafil exposure by 1000%. Cobicistat and ketoconazole are equally potent CYP3A4 inhibitors to ritonavir with no inhibition activity at CYP2C9, yet theoretically carry similar concerns for increase in sildenafil concentrations. It is important to recognize these interactions because ritonavir and cobicistat are used as inhibitors in combination medications for COVID-19 and HIV: nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, cobicistat, darunavir/cobicistat, darunavir/cobicistat/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, and elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir. Other CYP2C9 inhibitors do not have clinically established effects on sildenafil levels. Sildenafil also is substantially sensitive to CYP3A4 inducers, which decrease efficacy of sildenafil when coadministered. An approximately threefold increase in clearance of sildenafil was observed when given with St. John's wort, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Therefore, rifampin and phenytoin, potent CYP3A4 inducers, are expected to cause extensive decreases in sildenafil concentrations that necessitate a change in therapy.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^39f4eb3a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension has a major associated risk for organ damage and mortality, which is further heightened in patients with prior cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and renal impairment. Given that most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals, identifying the most appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer potential advantages over free-drug combinations, including simplification of treatment regimens, convenience and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use is recognised in updated hypertension guidelines. Despite a wide choice of SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide selection for individual patients is lacking. However, in patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminura and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. Furthermore, RAS inhibitors attenuate the oedema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a good choice for combination therapy. The occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough supports the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for RAS blockade rather than ACE inhibitors. In this regard, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the calcium CCB, amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with preferential pharmacodynamic profile compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations, telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine. Clinical studies suggest that in CV high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB/CCB combination may be preferred to ARB/HCTZ combinations due to superior renoprotective and CV benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders. However, selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should be dependent on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^74df144b]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension pharmacotherapy — angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) dosing and cautions: Benazepril 10–40 mg/day (daily or divided bid), Enalapril 5–40 mg/day (daily or divided bid), Fosinopril 10–40 mg daily, Lisinopril 10–40 mg daily, and Ramiprilb 2.5–20 mg/day (daily or divided bid) (10 mg daily for CV risk prevention). Avoid in women who are planning to become pregnant or who are pregnant; when pregnancy is contemplated or detected, discontinue as soon as possible, due to potential for fetal and neonatal morbidity and death; patients of child-bearing potential should also be educated about the risks. Do not use if history of angioedema. Avoid concomitant use of ACEI with ARB or direct renin inhibitor due to increased risk of hypotension, syncope, increased K+, and changes in kidney function (see Recommendation 26). Monitor K+ and kidney function; use caution if combined with, K+ sparing diuretic, or K+ supplement. Consider interruption or discontinuation in patients who develop clinically significant decline in kidney function after initiation of therapy, until further work-up, as indicated (e.g., kidney artery stenosis). Compelling indications include: CKD with albuminuria (refer to VA/DoD CKD CPG1); HFrEF; recent MI.

### Sildenafil in patients with cardiovascular disease [^8854522b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Cardiologists are seeing increasing numbers of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED), which frequently coexists with cardiovascular disease. The pharmacologic profile of the new class of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors-specifically PDE5 inhibitors-and their potential effects on hemodynamic variables have therefore become significant factors in therapeutic decision making. Most of the published data linking PDE5 inhibitor effects and cardiovascular disease relate to sildenafil, although ≥ 2 new agents are in various stages of development and clinical trials. Sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors act on vascular smooth muscle, predominantly in the corpus cavernosum. PDE5 is not found in cardiomyocytes, and no effect of PDE5 inhibition on cardiac contractility has been demonstrated. On the basis of a safety database comprising thousands of men with ED, sildenafil has demonstrated minimal adverse effects in men with stable ischemia, hypertension, and/or severe coronary artery disease. Sildenafil has modest effects on hemodynamic variables and has been shown to increase coronary artery flow reserve. Alone or combined with ≥ 1 antihypertensive medication, sildenafil did not increase the incidence of adverse events or hypotensive episodes. Sildenafil-associated decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the result of its vasodilator activity, have been modest. Sildenafil has decreased both elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated pulmonary artery pressures in patients with pulmonary vascular disease. Beneficial changes in hemodynamics have been observed with the use of sildenafil in patients with congestive heart failure with underlying ischemic and other dilated cardiomyopathies. No association between sildenafil and increased cardiovascular morbidity or mortality has emerged in analyses of clinical trial data.

### Recommendations for the use of mechanical circulatory support: ambulatory and community patient care: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^c5a0c839]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support — blood pressure and afterload management states that titration of medical therapy to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure in the normal range is imperative to optimize forward flow and to prevent adverse events; hypertension after ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation is common, and an increase in diastolic pressure with a continuous-flow device may exacerbate or lead to hypertension; increased afterload decreases pump flow and increases the risk of neurological events and end-organ damage; neurohormone-modifying agents including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used to decrease afterload, improve pump function, and potentially contribute to ventricular recovery; diuretics are frequently prescribed for right ventricular (RV) failure and fluid retention; and hydralazine/nitrates and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and tadalafil may also be used for RV failure and pulmonary hypertension.
