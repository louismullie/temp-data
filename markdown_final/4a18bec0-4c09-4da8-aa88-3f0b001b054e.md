## Question

Efficacy of cough medications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the efficacy of cough medications across acute and chronic cough, with special attention to children, and to translate this into practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify cough by duration and etiology. Then, I should appraise the evidence for over-the-counter (OTC) medications in acute cough. Next, I will examine chronic cough therapies, including neuromodulators and P2X3 antagonists. After that, I need to review pediatric-specific data and safety. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and outline a cautious, evidence-based approach to treatment and counseling, noting where the evidence is weak or evolving [^111YV25B].

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework. Cough is typically categorized as acute (< 3 weeks), subacute (3–8 weeks), and chronic (> 8 weeks), and this classification guides both evaluation and treatment choices; chronic cough warrants a structured diagnostic workup to identify treatable causes before labeling it as unexplained or refractory, which frames subsequent therapy decisions [^116GJb6Y] [^116cPiST].

> Now, I will examine OTC medications for acute cough in adults. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence here. Multiple systematic reviews and guidelines conclude there is no consistent benefit of OTC antitussives, expectorants, antihistamines, or combination products for acute viral cough, with heterogeneous, often low-quality trials and conflicting results; some adult studies suggest small effects for dextromethorphan, but these are inconsistent and not clearly clinically meaningful, and codeine has not shown superiority to placebo in acute cough trials [^116zx6CN] [^115j1sKh] [^111cYDA2] [^113oQJpc]. Hold on, I should double-check the older CHEST guidance that endorsed first-generation antihistamine/decongestant combinations or naproxen; yes, earlier ACCP guidance supported these for acute cough, but more recent expert panels have moved toward a conservative stance given limited and inconsistent benefit, so I need to present this as conflicting and context-dependent rather than definitive [^116fEyFX] [^1178JuvT].

> Next, I should review chronic cough therapies in adults. I need to ensure I separate disease-specific treatments from symptomatic antitussives. For refractory or unexplained chronic cough, neuromodulators such as gabapentin and pregabalin can improve cough-specific quality of life and severity, though central nervous system adverse effects are common and require shared decision-making; low-dose morphine is also recommended as a trial in adults with chronic refractory cough by ERS, with attention to risks and monitoring [^113zvd6L] [^114P88QZ]. Let me verify the P2X3 antagonist data. Gefapixant 45 mg twice daily reduces 24-hour cough frequency by about 15–18% versus placebo and improves cough severity and quality of life, but taste disturbance is frequent and dose-related; network meta-analyses consistently rank P2X3 antagonists among the most effective options for refractory chronic cough, acknowledging taste-related adverse events and the need to balance benefit and tolerability [^112UE5cF] [^115ZkJWG] [^112GHQs5] [^113yjF73].

> I will now examine pediatric acute cough. I should confirm that major guidelines align on this point. CHEST and ERS pediatric guidance advise against routine use of OTC cough and cold medications in children due to lack of demonstrated benefit and potential harms; honey may offer modest symptomatic relief in children older than 1 year, but it should not be given to infants under 1 year because of botulism risk; codeine-containing products are contraindicated in children due to respiratory depression risk and variable metabolism [^112HKPwG] [^113W7t1d] [^115ZSRQV]. Wait, I initially thought dextromethorphan might be broadly effective in children, but I need to correct that; evidence does not show consistent benefit for dextromethorphan in pediatric acute cough, and safety concerns persist, reinforcing a conservative approach [^116zx6CN] [^112HKPwG].

> For pediatric chronic cough, I should confirm the principle of etiology-based management. Guidelines emphasize identifying and treating underlying causes rather than using symptomatic cough suppressants; medications such as inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators should be reserved for specific diagnoses like asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis, and there is no evidence for routine use of antitussives in chronic pediatric cough; follow-up to reassess response and discontinue ineffective therapy is essential [^117E6Atf] [^114kvaHj]. Hold on, I should verify whether any antihistamine has a role; a small RCT suggested cetirizine may help in children with seasonal allergic rhinitis and cough, but this is not generalizable to nonallergic chronic cough, so it should not drive routine antihistamine use for cough suppression [^114kvaHj].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In acute bronchitis, contemporary guidance advises against OTC cough medications given insufficient benefit; in stable chronic bronchitis, mucolytics are not routinely recommended for cough relief; in interstitial lung disease, thalidomide showed signal for cough reduction in a small RCT, but this is not standard care and requires careful risk–benefit discussion; for cancer-related cough, evidence is sparse and heterogeneous, with low-dose opioids sometimes used palliatively when cough is refractory [^114XJ6Bx] [^112sjUPJ] [^113CSEFG] [^115w2pZ1]. I should also note that macrolides may be considered in select chronic bronchitis patients refractory to other therapy, balancing antimicrobial stewardship, but they are not for routine chronic cough treatment broadly [^111nRLzy].

> Next, I should review methodological limitations that constrain conclusions. Many cough trials rely on subjective outcomes or nonvalidated instruments, and older studies rarely used objective cough counting; the FDA now recognizes 24-hour ambulatory cough monitoring as the gold standard for antitussive efficacy, but few legacy agents have been tested this way, limiting comparability and confidence in older positive findings; placebo response rates are high in acute cough, further obscuring small drug effects [^114Xr2fx] [^1127KDry]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also emphasize heterogeneity in populations, interventions, and outcomes as a recurring barrier to synthesis across both acute and chronic cough literature, which is why guidelines often issue weak or consensus-based suggestions rather than strong recommendations [^116zx6CN] [^115j1sKh].

> I will now translate this into practical recommendations. For adults with acute viral cough, I should counsel that OTC cough medications have, at best, small and inconsistent benefits, and that nonpharmacologic measures and time are reasonable; if a trial is undertaken, it should be short and stopped if ineffective, with caution regarding sedation and drug interactions, especially with first-generation antihistamines [^111cYDA2] [^1178JuvT]. For adults with chronic cough, I need to ensure a diagnostic workup for common causes before labeling it refractory; if refractory or unexplained, a monitored trial of gabapentin or low-dose morphine may be appropriate, and gefapixant is a reasonable option where available, with upfront discussion of taste-related adverse effects and the modest magnitude of benefit [^113zvd6L] [^114P88QZ] [^112UE5cF] [^115ZkJWG]. For children with acute cough, I should recommend against OTC cough and cold medications, consider honey for those over 1 year, and provide safety counseling; for chronic cough, I must prioritize identifying the cause and avoid symptomatic suppressants, reserving disease-specific therapies for confirmed diagnoses and ensuring close follow-up to assess response and discontinue ineffective treatments [^112HKPwG] [^113W7t1d] [^117E6Atf].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and balanced. Across acute cough, high-quality evidence for OTC medications is limited and inconsistent, so the default should be conservative management and shared decision-making; across chronic cough, neuromodulators and P2X3 antagonists offer modest but real benefits for refractory cases, but adverse effects and patient preferences must guide selection and titration; in pediatrics, the balance of benefit and risk favors avoiding routine cough medications and focusing on diagnosis and supportive care, with honey as a limited exception in older infants [^116zx6CN] [^115ZkJWG] [^112HKPwG].

---

Overall, **OTC cough medicines have limited efficacy** for acute cough in adults and children, with inconsistent benefits and small effect sizes [^116zx6CN] [^115j1sKh]. For chronic cough, **low-dose morphine and neuromodulators** (gabapentin, pregabalin) can improve cough-specific quality of life, but adverse effects limit use [^114P88QZ] [^115tLJ4M]. P2X3 antagonists (e.g. gefapixant) are promising for refractory chronic cough, reducing cough frequency and improving quality of life, though taste disturbance is common [^112UE5cF] [^115ZkJWG]. Honey may help acute pediatric cough, but **OTC cough medicines are not recommended for children under 6 years** due to lack of efficacy and potential harm [^113W7t1d]. In sum, **evidence is weak for most OTC options**, and treatment should be individualized, with caution about adverse effects.

## Over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications

### Adults

- **Antitussives**: Dextromethorphan shows small, inconsistent benefits in acute cough; codeine is ineffective or only modestly helpful and is not recommended for routine use [^115j1sKh] [^111cYDA2].

- **Expectorants**: Guaifenesin has mixed results; some studies suggest slight benefit, others none, and overall evidence is weak [^116zx6CN] [^115j1sKh].

- **Antihistamine-decongestant combinations**: Limited and conflicting evidence; not routinely recommended [^116zx6CN] [^1178JuvT].

---

### Children

- **OTC cough medicines**: No consistent benefit for acute cough; multiple studies show no superiority over placebo, and potential harms exist, especially in young children [^116zx6CN] [^115dHf8S].

- **Honey**: May provide modest relief for acute pediatric cough, but not recommended for children under 1 year due to botulism risk [^112HKPwG] [^113W7t1d].

## Prescription medications for chronic cough

### Adults

Key therapies used in adults with chronic refractory or unexplained cough:

| **Aspect** | **Low-dose morphine** | **Neuromodulators (gabapentin, pregabalin)** | **P2x3 receptor antagonists (e.g. gefapixant)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Indication | Recommended for refractory chronic cough [^114P88QZ] | Recommended for unexplained chronic cough [^113zvd6L] | Refractory chronic cough [^112UE5cF] [^115ZkJWG] |
| Efficacy | improves cough-specific quality of life [^114P88QZ] | improve cough-specific quality of life [^113zvd6L] | Reduce cough frequency and improve quality of life in refractory chronic cough [^112UE5cF] [^115ZkJWG] |
| Safety | limited by sedation and constipation [^114P88QZ] | cause dizziness, fatigue, and cognitive effects [^113zvd6L] | taste disturbance is common but often manageable [^112UE5cF] [^115ZkJWG] |

---

## Safety considerations

- **OTC medications**: Adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, gastrointestinal upset; serious events (e.g. respiratory depression) can occur, especially with codeine-containing products in children [^1135GYQg] [^112HKPwG].

- **Prescription medications**: Morphine and neuromodulators carry risks of sedation, cognitive impairment, and dependence; P2X3 antagonists commonly cause taste disturbance [^112UE5cF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines advise **individualized therapy** and caution against routine OTC use, especially in children [^117E6Atf] [^112HKPwG]. They also recommend neuromodulators or low-dose morphine for refractory chronic cough after addressing underlying causes [^113zvd6L] [^114P88QZ]. P2X3 antagonists are an emerging option for refractory cases, with taste disturbance as the main limitation [^112UE5cF] [^115ZkJWG].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Medication class** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| OTC antitussives | Limited, inconsistent | Generally safe | Use cautiously |
| OTC expectorants | Mixed, weak evidence | Generally safe | Use cautiously |
| OTC antihistamine-decongestant | Limited, conflicting | Sedation, insomnia | Use cautiously |
| Low-dose morphine | Effective in RCC | Sedation, constipation | Recommended |
| Neuromodulators | Effective in RCC | Dizziness, fatigue | Recommended |
| P2X3 antagonists | Effective in RCC | Taste disturbance | Recommended |

---

OTC cough medicines offer **limited benefit**, especially in children, whereas prescription options can help refractory chronic cough but require careful monitoring for adverse effects.

### Assessing efficacy of therapy for cough [^112TVkqS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

An antitussive agent should reduce the amount of coughing experienced by the patient sufficiently for the patient to appreciate an improvement in cough severity and regard the improvement as sufficient to outweigh any adverse effects or risks associated with the treatment. In recent years the development of objective cough counting devices and cough-specific quality of life tools have vastly improved our ability to appropriately assess the effectiveness of anti-tussive agents and hopefully will lead to the development of safe and effective treatments in the future. This article summarizes current knowledge of methodologies available for assessing cough therapies, the patient groups to study, and the design of clinical trials.

### Cough: new pharmacology [^115dRBLN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic coughing has a significant impact on the sufferer's quality of life. Despite this, licensed therapies are currently lacking, and until recently novel efficacious therapies for the treatment of chronic cough have remained elusive. In recent years, a first in class P2X3 antagonist has been found to be efficacious in patients with refractory chronic cough, stimulating much interest in the development of therapies for this problem. The aim of this review is to summarize the current state of development of novel therapies acting both in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Most programs are focused on treating patients with refractory chronic cough, but chronic coughing is also a problem in common respiratory diseases in spite of standard care. However, unraveling of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cough will ultimately be needed to identify the relevant drug targets, better characterize patients, and match them to the most appropriate treatments.

### Over-the-counter cough and cold medications in children: are they helpful? [^115dHf8S]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Over-the-counter cough/cold medications are commonly used in children. Recent recommendations by the Food and Drug Administration and changes to product labeling by cough/cold product manufacturers have reduced use of these products in children younger than four years of age. Data from controlled clinical trials of cough/cold product ingredients do not support their efficacy in young children. Serious adverse effects have been reported from cough/cold product use in infants and children, which largely result from inappropriate use by caregivers. Conservative therapies, including nasal suctioning, humidification, and nasal saline, should be recommended over cough/cold product use for infants and children. Otolaryngologists should educate caregivers of children on the safe and effective use of these products and therapies.

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in community settings [^116zx6CN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine-decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three-day period. Twenty-one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over-the-counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1131Cxg4]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This series of guidance documents on cough, which will be published over time, is a hybrid of two processes: (1) evidence-based guidelines and (2) trustworthy consensus statements based on a robust and transparent process.

Methods

The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee selected a nonconflicted Panel Chair and jointly assembled an international panel of experts in each clinical area with few, if any, conflicts of interest. PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome)-based key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for each clinical topic to inform the comprehensive literature search. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality. Data elements were extracted into evidence tables and synthesized to provide summary statistics. These, in turn, are presented to support the evidence-based graded recommendations. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. Transparency of process was documented.

Results

Evidence-based guideline recommendations and consensus-based suggestions were carefully crafted to provide direction to health-care providers and investigators who treat and/or study patients with cough. Manuscripts and tables summarize the evidence in each clinical area supporting the recommendations and suggestions.

Conclusions

The resulting guidance statements are based on a rigorous methodology and transparency of process. Unless otherwise stated, the recommendations and suggestions meet the guidelines for trustworthiness developed by the Institute of Medicine and can be applied with confidence by physicians, nurses, other health-care providers, investigators, and patients.

### Potential future therapies for the management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114r2Fjh]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

When the etiology of a patient's chronic cough is established, specific antitussive therapy that is aimed at a particular cause of cough is highly effective. Nevertheless, in certain situations, therapy with cough suppressants, which previously were classified as nonspecific antitussive therapy, and which aim at suppressing the cough reflex regardless of the cause of cough, will be necessary.

Methodology

The data for this review were obtained with the aid of a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search, which was performed in June 2004, of literature published in the English language from 1966 to 2004, using the search terms "cough", "antitussive", "pharmacotherapy", "future therapies, " and "potential therapies".

Results/Conclusions

Currently available cough-suppressant therapy is severely limited by a dearth of effective agents and/or their unacceptable side effects. Several classes of pharmacologic agents are currently under investigation in an attempt to develop clinically useful cough suppressants.

### Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^115j1sKh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Many health practitioners recommend non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines as a first-line treatment for cough, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral over-the-counter cough preparations for acute cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June Week 3, 2004); EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2004); and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (December 2003, http://www.update-software.com/National/nrr-frame.html). We also searched personal collections of references and reference lists of articles. We wrote to study investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information on further published or unpublished studies. There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes (such as frequency and severity, continuous and categorical data, using different ways of measurement). The second outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators screened potentially relevant citations independently. Any differences at any stage of the review were resolved by discussion. We also extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. We contacted investigators for additional information and performed quantitative analysis when appropriate data were available.

Main Results

Twenty four trials (17 in adults, seven in children) involving 3,392 people (2,876 adults and 516 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS: 1. Antitussives: Six trials compared antitussives with placebo. Codeine was no more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms. Two studies favoured dextromethorphan over placebo, whereas a third did not show an effect. Moguisteine was no more effective than placebo apart from a reduction of cough in a subgroup of participants with more severe night cough. 2. Expectorants: Two trials compared guaifenesin with placebo. In the larger study, 75 per cent of participants taking guaifenesin stated that the medicine was helpful compared to 31 per cent in the control group. In the second study, both groups showed improvement with respect to cough frequency and severity, with no statistically significant differences between groups. 3. Mucolytics: One trial compared a mucolytic with placebo. Active treatment reduced cough frequency and symptom scores on day four and eight. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations: Two studies compared antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo. Antihistamine-decongestants were significantly more effective than placebo in one of the studies, whereas the other did not show any difference between the study groups. 5. Other drug combinations: Three studies compared combinations of drugs other than antihistamine-decongestant with placebo. Two studies were effective in reducing cough symptoms, and one study showed relief at night but not during the day. 6. Antihistamines: Three trials compared antihistamines with placebo. Antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN: 1. Antitussives: Antitussives were no more effective than placebo (one study) 2. Expectorants: No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. 3. Mucolytics: The results of one trial favoured active treatment over placebo from day four until day 10. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations: Two studies showed no difference between antihistamine-decongestant combinations and placebo. 5. Other drug combinations: One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups. Compared to placebo, both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46 per cent and 56 per cent of children compared to 21 per cent of children in the placebo group. One study compared an antitussive/bronchodilator combination in children, which showed no difference between the treatment groups. 6. Antihistamines: In one trial that tested antihistamines active treatment was no more effective than placebo.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes between studies. The numbers of studies in each group were small, and studies often showed conflicting results. Effect sizes in many studies were unclear and it is questionable as to whether all of the positive results are clinically relevant. More evidence about the effectiveness of OTC cough preparations would be helpful, as identification of effective self-care treatments may help reduce the burden of days lost at work due to acute cough as well as the number of consultations in primary care. Identification of ineffective preparations could avoid costs for consumers and health care providers.

### Efficacy and tolerability of treatments for chronic cough: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113skciY]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Understanding the comparative effectiveness of treatments for patients with unexplained or refractory cough is important to increase awareness of proven therapies and their potential adverse effects in this unique population.

Methods

We performed a literature search for English-language studies published up to June 2012 that compared symptomatic therapies for chronic cough. Two investigators screened each abstract and full-text article for inclusion, abstracted data, and rated quality. Meta-analysis with random-effects models was used to summarize effects of treatments.

Results

We identified 49 studies (3,067 patients) comprising 68 therapeutic comparisons. Of the studied agents, opioid and certain nonopioid and nonanesthetic antitussives had demonstrated efficacy for chronic cough in adults. Compared with placebo, effect sizes (standardized mean differences for cough severity and rate ratios for cough frequency) for opioids were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.38–0.72; P < .0001) and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.36–0.91; p = 0.0260), respectively. For dextromethorphan, effect sizes were 0.37 (95% CI, 0.19–0.56; p = 0.0008) and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.18–0.85; p = 0.0248), respectively. The overall strength of evidence was limited by inconsistency and imprecision of results and by small numbers of direct comparisons. Nonpharmacologic therapies and the management of cough in children were infrequently studied.

Conclusions

Although evidence is limited, opioid and certain nonopioid and nonanesthetic antitussives demonstrated efficacy for treating chronic cough in adults. There is a need for further studies in patients with unexplained or refractory cough as well as for more systematic study designs, assessment of patient-centered outcomes, and reporting.

### Cough and gastroesophageal reflux: identifying cough and assessing the efficacy of cough-modifying agents [^115DZ99s]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

From a symptom research standpoint, much has been learned about the management of cough in general and cough caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease in particular. Yet, before further advances can be made in our understanding of how to best manage patients with this common symptom, methodologic challenges remain to be solved. One of the most basic is the development of valid and reliable methods by which to identify cough, assess its impact on patients, and assess the efficacy of cough therapies. Herein, we review the characteristics of cough that relate to its assessment and how the effect of drug treatment on cough has been assessed. Perspective is provided on evaluating the efficacy of cough-modifying agents and the optimal method for identifying a cough and linking it with a reflux event. Investigators should use both subjective and objective methods, because they have the potential to measure different aspects of cough. Subjective measures, such as a cough-specific quality-of-life instruments, are likely to best reflect the severity of cough from the patient's standpoint, because a subjective response most likely integrates both cough frequency and intensity. The ideal objective method should allow cough to be automatically counted over 24 hours in an ambulatory setting. Although it is theoretically possible to design and construct such a device that is also relatively unobtrusive, reliable, and accurate, one is not yet available.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116C3ZhR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Acute cough is perhaps the most common symptom to afflict mankind. While it is usually a benign and self-limiting illness, the amount of morbidity endured as a consequence of acute viral respiratory tract infection has enormous consequences on humanity. By the use of evidence-based treatment, significant improvement in patient outcomes can be achieved. While there are many gaps in the knowledge of our therapy in acute cough, our improved understanding of the mechanism of cough hypersensitivity brings rational treatment choices a step closer. A greater understanding of how drugs may normalise this aberrant reflex, thus bringing relief and shortening the duration of illness, may be of enormous benefit to the whole of society.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^117RL3er]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute cough common cold — outcomes and study appraisal prioritized symptom-focused measures where cough was the primary symptom or could be teased out, including severity and duration of acute cough, side effects of therapies (benefits vs harms), and rating scales such as visual analogue scale (VAS) or health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Included articles underwent quality assessment, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials, and the Documentation and Appraisal Review (Local Instruments International Network) for systematic reviews; studies at high risk of bias or of poor quality were excluded. Recommendations were graded by the quality of the body of evidence (low, moderate, or high) and by strength (either strong or weak).

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications to reduce cough as an adjunct to antibiotics for acute pneumonia in children and adults [^111vnKoC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is often distressing for patients with pneumonia. Accordingly they often use over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications (mucolytics or cough suppressants). These might provide relief in reducing the severity of cough, but conversely, suppression of the cough mechanism might impede airway clearance and cause harm.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of OTC cough medications as an adjunct to antibiotics in children and adults with pneumonia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2006); OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); EMBASE (1980 to December 2006) and the list of references in relevant publications.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children and adults comparing any type of OTC cough medication with a placebo, or control medication, with cough as an outcome and where the cough is secondary to acute pneumonia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently selected trials for inclusion. Data were extracted from these studies, assessed for methodological quality without disagreement, and analysed using standard methods.

Main Results

Four studies were included with a total of 224 participants; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults. One using an antitussive had no extractable pneumonia-specific data. Three different mucolytics (bromhexine, ambroxol, neltenexine) were used in the remaining studies, of which only two had extractable data. They demonstrated no significant difference for the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved' for mucolytics. A secondary outcome of 'not cured' was reduced (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.77; number needed to treat (NNT) 5, 95% CI 3 to 16 for children and OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75; NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 19 for adults). In a post hoc analysis combining data for children and adults, again there was also no difference in the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved' (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.80) although mucolytics reduced the secondary outcome 'not cured' (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 8).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to decide whether OTC medications for cough associated with acute pneumonia are beneficial. Mucolytics may be, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend them as an adjunctive treatment of acute pneumonia. This leaves only theoretical recommendations that OTC medications containing codeine and antihistamines should not be used in young children.

### Cough medicines for children-time for a reality check [^115ZSRQV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Cough medicines have been in use for over a century to treat the common and troublesome, but often helpful, symptoms of cough in children. They contain various combinations of "anti-tussive" drugs including opioids, antihistamines, herbal preparations, mucolytics, decongestants and expectorants. Whilst theoretically attractive for symptom relief when children are suffering, as time has passed these popular over the counter medicines have been shown to lack efficacy, delay more serious underlying diagnoses, and can cause complications and sometimes death. This has resulted in clinician concerns, a citizen petition to the American Food and Drug Association in 2007, some self-regulation from manufacturers and escalating restrictions on their use from regulatory agencies across the world over the last twenty years. This article will review the protective role of cough, juxtapose the conflicting treatment goals of suppressing a dry cough and promoting expectoration for a wet cough, consider the evidence basis for prescribing cough medicines in comparison to other more specific treatments such as for asthma [beta agonists] or infection [antibiotics], regulatory interventions, and conclude with the view that over counter cough medicines should not be used in children, especially young children.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for subacute cough in children [^115ZsnCJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is the most common symptom presenting to primary healthcare services. Cough in children is associated with significant morbidity for both children and their parents. While inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can potentially reduce cough associated with airway inflammation and airway hyper-reactivity, use of ICS in children is not without potential adverse effects. Therefore, it would be beneficial to clinical practice to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of ICS in reducing the severity of cough in children with subacute cough (defined as cough duration of two to four weeks) systematically.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of ICS in reducing the severity of cough in children with subacute cough.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. The latest searches were performed in November 2011.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICS with a control group in children with subacute cough were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Search results were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. Two sets of review authors independently selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. Study authors were contacted for further information where required. Data were analysed as 'intention to treat'.

Main Results

The search identified 1178 potentially relevant titles; however, there were no published studies that were specifically designed to answer this question. Two studies met criteria for inclusion in the review and 98 children were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of children 'not cured' at follow-up (primary outcome measure), with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.55). However, the included studies were limited in their ability to answer the review question by the fact that all participants were infants, post acute bronchiolitis illness, and cough duration at the start of study medication was ill-defined.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to support the use of ICS for treatment of subacute cough in children. However, this systematic review is limited by the small number of studies available for analysis and the size, quality and design of these studies. Further well-designed RCTs are required to support or refute the efficacy of treatment with ICS in children with subacute cough.

### Chronic cough related to acute viral bronchiolitis in children: CHEST expert panel report [^112PoMsw]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis is common in young children, and some children develop chronic cough after their bronchiolitis. We thus undertook systematic reviews based on key questions (KQs) using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format. The KQs were: Among children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks) after acute viral bronchiolitis, how effective are the following interventions in improving the resolution of cough? (1) Antibiotics. If so what type and for how long? (2) Asthma medications (inhaled steroids, beta 2 agonist, montelukast); and (3) Inhaled osmotic agents like hypertonic saline?

Methods

We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form these suggestions. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus.

Results

Several studies and systematic reviews on the efficacy of the three types of interventions listed in the introduction were found but no data were relevant to our KQs. Thus, no recommendations on using the interventions above could be formulated.

Conclusions

The panel made several consensus-based suggestions and identified directions for future studies to advance the field of managing chronic cough post-acute bronchiolitis in children.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^116shMpx]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. This study had two aims: to identify therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients (internationally), and to consider the evidence required to address these unmet needs.

Methods

A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was performed to identify articles describing therapeutic principles in the treatment of pediatric cough. An online survey of international pediatric cough experts was conducted, with questions on the definitions, diagnosis, treatment, and unmet needs in pediatric cough management.

Results

Cough guidelines have differing definitions of pediatric patients (≤ 12–18 years), acute pediatric cough (< 2–3 weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 4–8 weeks). Similarly, among 18 experts surveyed, definitions varied for pediatric patients (≤ 10–21 years), acute pediatric cough (< 3–5 days to < 6 weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 2–8 weeks). Guidelines generally do not recommend over-the-counter or prescription cough medicines in acute pediatric cough, due to lack of evidence. In the expert survey, participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for treating acute pediatric cough, and noted that effective treatments are lacking for cough-related pain and sleep disruption. Overall, guidelines and experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires diagnostic investigations to identify the underlying cough-causing disease and thereby to guide treatment. There are unmet needs for new effective and safe treatments for acute pediatric cough, and for randomized controlled trials of existing treatments. Safety is a particular concern in this vulnerable patient population. There is also a need for better understanding of the causes, phenotypes, and prevalence of pediatric cough, and how this relates to its diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusions

Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. There is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114rmk98]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Cough guideline methodology — PICO refinement, literature searches, and quality assessments are outlined as follows: Each topic-specific committee drafted key clinical questions that a frontline clinician and consumer representative agreed would provide important guidance, and with a methodologist these key questions were formulated to examine descriptors of the relevant PICO; these PICO elements then informed the search strategies, including synonyms, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for study screening and acceptance. Searches were conducted in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse and Guidelines International Network Library, with additional searches for published systematic reviews in PubMed and the Cochrane Library; when no reasonable quality systematic reviews were identified, primary literature searches were conducted in at least two databases using the predefined search strategies, and Medline and the Cochrane Library were always searched for relevant English language studies and, depending on the topic, other databases (eg, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched. Identified English-language articles were initially screened by title and abstract, using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria followed by full-text screening of qualified articles; search strategies are available upon request at science@chestnet.org, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses were preferentially assessed using DART, which was adopted in 2011 for CHEST guidelines and consensus statements; quality was assessed for individual studies and the body of relevant evidence, with randomized controlled trials primarily indicating benefits and observational studies helpful in identifying harms and examined when RCTs were not available.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1118Nify]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic cough (CC) is defined as a cough lasting for > 8 weeks. Currently, CC has an estimated global prevalence of 9.6%. Moreover, up to 46% of patients with CC suffer from persistent cough despite optimal treatment for the disease associated with CC. If the cause of the cough is unknown after investigations, it will be defined as unexplained chronic cough (UCC) and if it does not resolve after empirical or etiology-specific treatment, it will be defined as refractory chronic cough (RCC). RCC is an intractable clinical problem that has been associated with decreased quality of life. Although the optimal management of RCC is still unclear, pharmacotherapy remains a common and reasonable treatment strategy.

Recent research has suggested several targeted therapeutics that act on various sites related to cough, including neuromodulator, P2X3 antagonist, voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, transient receptor potential (TRP) modulator, and neurokinin-1 (NK-1) antagonist. According to a previous systematic review, gefapixant, a P2X3 antagonist, was found to have favourable anti-tussive outcomes in patients with a chronic cough. However, adverse events (AEs) associated with P2X3 antagonist continue to be obvious, particularly for dysgeusia. Furthermore, there are yet insufficient randomised control trials (RCTs) on NK-1, and the previous RCTs suggested that we may revisit the therapeutic role of TRP modulator. Amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, morphine, and tramadol are all centrally acting neuromodulators that can improve cough-specific quality of life and/or cough severity in patients with RCC. There is still a lack of enough evidence and a high risk of bias to compare the efficacy and safety of various medications for RCC. Overall, the best choice of pharmacotherapy for RCC remains controversial.,

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively investigate the efficacy and safety of medications for RCC/UCC and to identify the current optimal medication via network meta-analysis.

### Inhaled anti-cholinergics for prolonged non-specific cough in children [^112YTFXs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including inhaled anti-cholinergic medications.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications in the management of prolonged non-specific cough in children.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Airways Group, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched. Relevant pharmaceutical companies were contacted. The latest searches were performed in July 2003.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled anti-cholinergic medication with a placebo medication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified and thus no data were available for analysis. A single small trial in adults has been reported.

Main Results

No randomised-controlled trials that examined the efficacy of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications in the management of prolonged non-specific cough in children were found.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to support the use of inhaled anti-cholinergics for symptomatic control of non-specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of this intervention is needed.

### Codeine versus placebo for chronic cough in children [^113B2iKi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cough in children is a commonly experienced symptom that is associated with increased health service utilisation and burden to parents. The presence of chronic (equal to or more than four weeks) cough in children may indicate a serious underlying condition such as inhaled foreign body or bronchiectasis. Codeine (and derivative)-based medications are sometimes used to treat cough due to their antitussive properties. However, there are inherent risks associated with the use of these medications such as respiratory drive suppression, anaesthetic-induced anaphylaxis, and addiction. Metabolic response and dosage variability place children at increased risk of experiencing such side effects. A systematic review evaluating the quality of the available literature would be useful to inform management practices.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of codeine (and derivatives) in the treatment of chronic cough in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946 to 8 June 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 8 June 2016), the online trials registries of the World Health Organization and ClinicalTrials.gov, and the bibliographic references of publications. We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered studies eligible for analysis when: the participant population included children aged less than 18 years with chronic cough (duration equal to or more than four weeks at the time of intervention); and the study design evaluated codeine or codeine-based derivatives against placebo through a randomised controlled trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to determine eligibility against a standardised criteria, and we had a pre-planned method for analysis.

Main Results

We identified a total of 556 records, of which 486 records were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. We retrieved the remaining 70 references in full to determine eligibility. No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review, and thus we found no evidence to support or oppose the use of codeine or derivatives as antitussive agents for chronic cough in children. While chronic cough is not the same as acute cough, systematic reviews on the use of codeine efficacy for acute cough in children conclude an overall lack of evidence to support or oppose the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications containing codeine (or derivatives) for treatment of acute cough in children. The lack of sufficient evidence to support the use of these medications has been consistently reaffirmed by medical experts in international chronic cough guidelines and by governing medical and pharmaceutical authorities in the United States, Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence to support efficacy, and the known risks associated with use - in particular the increased risks for children - these medications are now not recommended for children less than 12 years of age and children between 12 to 18 years with respiratory conditions.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has highlighted the absence of any randomised controlled trials evaluating codeine-based medications in the treatment of childhood chronic cough. Given the potential adverse events of respiratory suppression and opioid toxicity, national therapeutic regulatory authorities recommend the contraindication of access to codeine in children less than 12 years of age. We suggest that clinical practice adhere to clinical practice guidelines and thus refrain from using codeine or its derivatives to treat cough in children. Aetiological-based management practices continue to be advocated for children with chronic cough.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^113KthhB]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

A postviral cough is generally unresponsive to conventional pharmacological intervention, but has shown limited responsiveness to the anticholinergic drug, tiotropium, which leaves a major hole in our therapeutic armamentarium. Currently, treatment merely consists of dampening the inflammatory response with the use of antiinflammatories (such as naproxen), and cough suppressants (codeine-containing products and dextromethorphan), in the hope of reducing the frequency, severity and transmission of cough. Opiates, although commonly prescribed, are not generally recommended for viral cough due to their poor efficacy and significant adverse effect profile.

The multiple mechanisms described above provide a confusing and inter-related 'soup' of potential therapeutic targets, dissecting which, are the key players involved in this common affliction that will be challenging. We suggest that modulation of the afferent neuronal hypersensitivity will provide the most fruitful target in what is essentially a benign and self-limiting disease. Other strategies, such as systemic immune modulation, run the risk of generating unforeseen off-target effects. The rewards for understanding the mechanism of viral-induced cough will have enormous impact on human morbidity.

### Medications to reduce emergence coughing after general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112ud8Uh]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergence coughing can harm the patient following completion of surgery, but it is unclear which medication is most effective at reducing this event. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs to determine the medications' relative efficacies on decreasing moderate to severe emergence coughing after general anaesthesia. Medications studied were lidocaine (i.v., intracuff, topical, or tracheal application), dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, and fentanyl.

Methods

We searched eight different medical literature databases, conference abstracts, and article references. After screening, included citations were evaluated for bias and had their data extracted. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each treatment comparison were calculated. A surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis (SUCRA) determined the relative rank of each intervention to decrease moderate to severe emergence coughing. Subgroup analyses included severe coughing only, extubation times, type of maintenance anaesthetic, and dosages.

Results

The network meta-analysis included 70 studies and 5286 patients. All study medications had favourable odds in reducing moderate and severe peri-extubation coughing compared with either no medication or placebo. No single medication was favoured over another. Dexmedetomidine had the highest SUCRA rank, followed in order by remifentanil, fentanyl, and lidocaine via intracuff, tracheal/topical, and i.v. routes. Remifentanil was ranked highest for decreasing severe coughing only. Intracuff lidocaine had higher odds of prolonging extubation times compared with placebo, dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, and remifentanil.

Conclusion

All study medications were better than placebo or no medication in reducing moderate to severe emergence cough, with dexmedetomidine ranked the most effective.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111No7cK]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study selection

Inclusion criteria for eligible studies were as follows: (1) studies that included patients who were diagnosed with a chronic refractory cough or unexplained cough according to the cough guidelines proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) or European Respiratory Society (ERS); (2) patients who only received pharmacologic therapies and were followed up for efficacy and/or safety outcomes; (3) studies that reported the estimates of relative risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD); (4) study design was a comparative RCTs (vs. placebo or common therapy).

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) refractory chronic cough resulting from potential lung disease such as bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, etc.; (2) the medication directly targeted at an underlying etiology of chronic coughs, such as gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis or upper airway cough syndrome; (3) case reports, letters, comments, conference abstracts and review articles; (4) the full text was not available; (5) articles published in languages other than English.

The search results were screened based on two independent authors' relevant titles and abstracts. All discordant results were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer.

Data abstraction

The following data were extracted from eligible studies and recorded in a standardised pro forma sheet: names of the author, year of publication, region, and centre, type of literature, sample size, gender and age of the participants, race and BMI of the participants, types of intervention and cough duration (years). To be precise, we separately extracted subjective outcome data and objective outcome data, where the main subjective outcome data included the Lester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the main objective outcome data such as cough frequency, included awake, night-time and 24 h. To establish safety, we extracted the number of adverse events in the treatment and placebo groups; specific types of AEs were classified and counted. AEs were assessed by clinical evaluations and patients were recorded in the comment cards. After extracting the data, we found two trials with the same first author and year of publication, so we used A and B to distinguish between different studies. Two of these trials consisted of two studies each, which we reported as four independent studies that were distinguished by S1 and S2.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1166YyKV]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

The evidence was qualitatively synthesised, and random effects model-based meta-analysiswere conducted to combine the findings of trials with comparable interventions and outcome measures. We contacted the authors for studies that collected outcomes of interest but did not completely report them and requested additional data. For data where only the median but not the mean was provided, we used the conversion of continuous variables to obtain the mean value. The efficacy outcomes were continuous data, and we analysed them as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in a random-effects model using the inverse-variance method. We assessed statistical heterogeneity among the pooled studies using the I 2 statistic; the moderate heterogeneity was defined as I 2 > 50%, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The safety outcomes were dichotomous data, and we pooled them as relative risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI in a random-effect model using the DerSimonian and Laird method. Moreover, meta-regression was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Besides, a Bayesian multiple treatment network meta-analysiswith random-effects and uninformative priors was performed. Both placebo- and active-controlled trials were taken into consideration, and the effectiveness of different medications was compared using the Bayesian models. To evaluate and rank the efficacy of medications, the rank probabilities that a medication being the best, second-best, or worst for an outcome were calculated using the Surface under the Cumulative Ranking Curves (SUCRA). The SUCRA value would be '0' when a medication's efficacy is certain to be the worst and '1' when it is certain to be the best. Finally, all statistical analyses were conducted with RevMan version 5.3, STATA version 15 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX), R (version 4.2.1), and JAGS (version 4.3.0).

Role of the funding source

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^114Xr2fx]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Two objective methods of assessing cough have been developed. First, in the 1950s, cough challenge was introduced and has been perfected as a highly accurate tool for assessing the cough reflex. The participant inhales an increasing concentration of a protussive substance such as citric acid or capsaicin — the pungent extract of red peppers. The effect of drug on their cough reflex sensitivity is then compared with that of placebo. This methodology is excellent at assessing the characteristics of the study drug, such as its time course, and is frequently used in the development of novel therapies; indeed, it is recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of the submission portfolio. However, it does not always correlate with subjective measures. For example, morphine has been demonstrated to have a highly effective activity in suppressing cough in some patients, but does not seem to alter cough reflex sensitivity.

The third is a recently developed modality of assessing cough using cough counting. It has required a number of strides in technical development, particularly in computing power, to establish a reliable methodology using cough counters. Cough counting is now recognised as the 'gold standard' for assessing antitussive efficacy by the FDA. Unfortunately, since it is a recently developed technique, very few of the current OTC antitussive medications have been studied using cough counting. Indeed, only a single agent, dextromethorphan, has been demonstrated to be efficacious in this arena.

It is best to consider the various methodologies for assessing cough as the three overlapping circles of Venn diagram (figure 1). Of the three, subjective measures have proven to be the least reliable and with a few notable exceptions have not been rigorously evaluated. We consider therefore that claims made of antitussive activity solely using subjective criteria provide insufficient evidence of efficacy, a view currently supported by the FDA.

Therefore, in an attempt to promote rational prescribing, we have reviewed the evidence for frequently used treatments in acute cough, particularly from a European perspective. We examined three aspects of drug efficacy on acute cough: the effect on the cough reflex using cough challenge, and both objective (cough recording) and subjective (ie, symptom scores, specific quality of life tools) effects on clinical outcomes.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^1165sC9Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The worldwide incidence of whooping cough (pertussis) has been estimated at 48.5 million cases and nearly 295,000 deaths per year. In low-income countries, the case-fatality rate among infants may be as high as 4%. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta 2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults.

Search Methods

We updated searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 2, 2012), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE Issue 2, 2012) accessed from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), AMED (1985 to January 2012), CINAHL (1980 to January 2012) and LILACS (January 2012). We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial for this review in 2009. Two review authors (SB, KW) independently reviewed additional studies identified by the updated search in 2012. The primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay.

Main Results

Ten trials were included of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135) from high-income countries. Study quality was generally poor. Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Only six trials including a total of 196 participants reported data in sufficient detail for analysis. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference (MD) of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 4.7 to 8.5. One study on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02) but no change in hospital stay (MD -0.7 days; 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (MD -3.5 days; 95% CI -15.3 to 8.4) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per 24 hours (MD -0.2; 95% CI -4.1 to 3.7). Only one trial comparing pertussis immunoglobulin versus placebo reported data on adverse events: 4.3% in the treatment group (rash) versus 5.3% in the placebo group (loose stools, pain and swelling at injection site).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for the cough in whooping cough.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for subacute and chronic cough in adults [^113WHqoM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent cough is a common clinical problem. Despite thorough investigation and empirical management, a considerable proportion of those people with subacute and chronic cough have unexplained cough, for which treatment options are limited. While current guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the research evidence for this intervention is conflicting.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ICS for subacute and chronic cough in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov in December 2012 and conducted handsearches.

Selection Criteria

Two authors independently assessed all potentially relevant trials. All published and unpublished randomised comparisons of ICS versus placebo in adults with subacute or chronic cough were included. Participants with known chronic respiratory disease and asthma were excluded. Studies of cough-variant asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data pertaining to pre-defined outcomes. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical cure or significant improvement (over 70% reduction in cough severity measure) at follow up (clinical success). The secondary outcomes included proportion of participants with clinical cure or over 50% reduction in cough severity measure at follow up, mean change in cough severity measures, complications of cough, biomarkers of inflammation and adverse effects. We requested additional data from study authors.

Main Results

Eight primary studies, including 570 participants, were included. The overall methodological quality of studies was good. Significant clinical heterogeneity resulting from differences in participants and interventions, as well as variation in outcome measures, limited the validity of comparisons between studies for most outcomes. Data for the primary outcome of clinical cure or significant (> 70%) improvement were available for only three studies, which were too heterogeneous to pool. Similarly, heterogeneity in study characteristics limited the validity of meta-analysis for the secondary outcomes of proportion of participants with clinical cure or over 50% reduction in cough severity measure and clinical cure. One parallel group trial of predominantly chronic cough with 'cough-variant asthma' identified a significant treatment effect and contributed to the majority of statistical heterogeneity for these outcomes. While ICS treatment resulted in a mean decrease in cough score of 0.34 standard deviations (SMD -0.34; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.13; 346 participants), the quality of evidence was low. Heterogeneity also prevented meta-analysis for the outcome of mean change in visual analogue scale score. Meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of pulmonary function, complications of cough or biomarkers of inflammation due to insufficient data. There was moderate quality evidence that treatment with ICS did not significantly increase the odds of experiencing an adverse event (OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.92 to 3.04).

Authors' Conclusions

The studies were highly heterogeneous and results were inconsistent. Heterogeneity in study design needs to be addressed in future research in order to test the efficacy of this intervention. International cough guidelines recommend that a trial of ICS should only be considered in patients after thorough evaluation including chest X-ray and consideration of spirometry and other appropriate investigations.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^111rREmW]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) causes significant impairment in quality of life, and effective treatment strategies are needed. We conducted a systematic review on the management of chronic cough due to CB to update the recommendations and suggestions of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on this topic.

Methods

This systematic review asked three questions: (1) What are the clinical features of the history that suggest a patient's cough-phlegm syndrome is due to CB? (2) Can treatment of stable CB improve or eliminate chronic cough? (3) Can therapy that targets chronic cough due to CB prevent or reduce the occurrence of acute CB exacerbations? Studies of adult patients with CB were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on by using the CHEST organization methodology.

Results

The search strategy used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify studies of chronic cough due to CB.

Conclusions

The evidence supporting the management of chronic cough due to CB is limited overall and of low quality. This article provides guidance on treatment by presenting suggestions based on the best currently available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^1153ojYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Around 16 million cases of whooping cough (pertussis) occur worldwide each year, mostly in low-income countries. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE 2014, Issue 2), accessed from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 to 30 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 30 January 2014), AMED (1985 to 30 January 2014), CINAHL (1980 to 30 January 2014) and LILACS (30 January 2014). We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial for this review in 2009. Two review authors (SB, KW) independently reviewed additional studies identified by the updated searches in 2012 and 2014. The primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay.

Main Results

We included 12 trials of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135), mainly from high-income countries, including a total of 578 participants. Ten trials recruited children (N = 448 participants). Two trials recruited adolescents and adults (N = 130 participants). We considered only three trials to be of high methodological quality (one trial each of diphenhydramine, pertussis immunoglobulin and montelukast). Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Only six trials, including a total of 196 participants, reported data in sufficient detail for analysis. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference (MD) of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.7 to 8.5 (N = 49 participants from one trial). One trial on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02, N = 47 participants) but no change in hospital stay (MD -0.7 days; 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4, N = 46 participants). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (MD -3.5 days; 95% CI -15.3 to 8.4, N = 11 participants from one trial) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per day (MD -0.2; 95% CI -4.1 to 3.7, N = 42 participants from two trials). Only one trial comparing pertussis immunoglobulin versus placebo (N = 47 participants) reported data on adverse events: 4.3% in the treatment group (rash) versus 5.3% in the placebo group (loose stools, pain and swelling at injection site).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for the cough in whooping cough. More high-quality trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of potential antitussive treatments in patients with whooping cough.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^113GyiAM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Whooping cough is an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. There are 20 to 40 million cases of whooping cough annually world-wide, 90% of which occur in developing countries, resulting in an estimated 200 to 300 000 fatalities each year. Much of the morbidity is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Corticosteroids, salbutamol (beta 2 - adrenergic stimulant), and pertussis-specific immunoglobulin have been proposed as standard treatment for the cough. Antihistamines have also been administered. No systematic review of the effectiveness of any of these interventions or others has been performed.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions used to reduce the severity of the coughing paroxysms in whooping cough in children and adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 2, 2003); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2003); EMBASE (1990 to June 2003) and LILACS (1982 to November 2001). We also scanned reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials and relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of any intervention aimed at suppressing the cough in whooping cough; excluding antibiotics and vaccines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. Our primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis, development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Nine studies satisfied the inclusion criteria but four had insufficient data for meta - analysis of pre-specified outcomes. Studies were small and poorly reported. The largest study had a sample size of 49 and the smallest study 18. All studies were performed in industrialised settings. Eligible studies assessed diphenhyramine, pertussis immunoglobulin, dexamethasone and salbutamol. No statistically significant benefit was found for any of the interventions. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing spells (mean increase of coughing spells per 24 hours 1.9 with 95%CI - 4.7 to 8.5) and pertussis immunoglobulin no change in hospital stay (0.7 days 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4), and a mean reduction of 3.1 whoops per 24 hours [95% CI -6.2; 0.02]. Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in hospital stay (-3.5 days 95% CI - 15.3 to 8.4) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per 24 hours [-0.22 95% CI - 4.13 to 3.69].

Reviewer's Conclusions

Insufficient evidence exists to draw conclusions about the effects of any intervention for the cough in whooping cough.

### Symptomatic treatment of cough among adult patients with lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113hfbuL]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult lung cancer cough — N-of-1 randomized controlled trial considerations — When complications of coughing are debilitating and not responsive to any medications, single case experiments, also referred to as N-of-1 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), should be considered because N-of-1 RCTs are the most rigorous design for establishing efficacy of treatment in individual patients. The key elements in performing such trials are (1) obtaining informed consent, (2) randomizing two treatments determined by random allocation preferably with crossover, (3) double blinding, and (4) measuring a cough outcome important to the patient. Because ethical issues differ from standard RCTs, institutional review board approval and informed written consent may not be necessary; however, consultation with the institutional review board and reading more about how to set up an N-of-1 RCT program are advised prior to starting such a program. Practical considerations include that the costs of preparing the placebo should be considered and that if placebo-controlled N-of-1 RCTs are not practical, an unblended N-of-1 trial, although less scientifically rigorous and robust, may be an alternative approach.

### Methylxanthines for prolonged non-specific cough in children [^116GUJPG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including a variety of asthma medications. Methylxanthines, the main medication used for paediatric asthma for many decades in Western countries, is still widely used in non-Western countries. Also, methylxanthines have other pharmacological properties and their bronchodilator effect is only modest.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of methylxanthines in treating children with non-specific cough.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register Collaboration and Cochrane Airways Group, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in Jan 2005.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing methylxanthines with a placebo medication in treating children with non-specific cough.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified and thus no data were available for analysis. Four small non-randomised controlled trials were reported.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials that examined the efficacy of methylxanthines in the management of prolonged non-specific cough in children were found. In the non randomised trials above, a significant effect was seen within 2–14 days of therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently an absence of reliable evidence to support the routine use of methylxanthines for symptomatic control of non-specific cough in children. If methylxanthines were to be trialled in children with prolonged non-specific cough, cohort data (thus limited) suggest a clinical response (subjective cough severity) would be seen within 2–5 days (and certainly within 14 days) of therapy. However methylxanthine use has to be balanced against the well known risk of toxicity and its low therapeutic range in children. Further research examining the efficacy of this intervention is needed.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117E6Atf]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough in children — conclusions and management approach: Child-specific cough guidelines should be used for children aged ≤ 14 years and these differ from adults. All children with chronic cough should have a thorough clinical review to identify pointers suggestive of an underlying respiratory and/or systemic illness. Cough in children should be treated based on etiology and there is no evidence for using medications for symptomatic relief of cough. If medications are used, children must be followed up and medications ceased if there is no effect on the cough within an expected timeframe. Irrespective of diagnosis, environmental influences should be discussed and managed accordingly. Cough negatively impacts the QoL of both the child and parents; education regarding when to look into and explore parental expectations and fears are often valuable in the management of cough in children.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117446YZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statementand was registered on PROSPERO before the completion of the initial search (Registration No: CRD42022345940). The ethical approval was waived for this study type.

Search strategy

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid databases were systematically searched for RCTs published from January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2023. The search strategy used the following terms: (("refractory chronic cough") OR ("unexplained chronic cough")) AND (("therapy") OR ("medication∗")); (("chronic cough") OR ("idiopathic chronic cough")) AND (("treatment") OR ("medication∗")). The word "chronic cough" was interchanged with "unexplained cough", "neurogenic cough", "chronic refractory cough" and "refractory chronic cough" to repeat the same search. The name of molecular pathways including P2X3, TRPV1, TRPV4, GABA, NK-1, etc. would replace the word "medication" or "therapy" to repeat the same search. In addition, other potentially relevant articles were retrieved by manual search. Complete search strategies are listed in the e-Appendix 1.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^115TekKf]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Unmet needs in pediatric cough

The greatest unmet needs in pediatric cough, as entered into an open-ended text box by 14 experts, are presented in Table 1. Themes included the need for effective and safe new treatments, better understanding of causes and phenotypes of cough, and education on the prevention of respiratory infection.

Table 1
Unmet needs and data gaps in pediatric cough according to international experts

Questions were open-ended, and answers were grouped into 'Treatment', 'Etiology and progression', and 'Other' during analysis

Finally, participants were asked the open-ended question, "Which data gaps in pediatric cough research would you like to see addressed in a clinical study?" (Table 1). Several participants suggested efficacy and safety studies to establish the benefits of existing cough treatments in pediatric patients (e.g. OTC drugs, herbal therapies). Other participants suggested efficacy and safety studies in subpopulations of pediatric cough (e.g. aged < 2 years, viral cough, habit cough, viral bronchitis). In addition, several participants suggested prevalence studies for particular types of pediatric cough (e.g. chronic, wet/dry, pertussis).

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^1127KDry]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Across the literature review and expert survey, various unmet needs and data gaps were identified in the management of pediatric cough. The most frequently reported need was for effective and safe treatments for acute cough – both the development of new treatments, and obtaining strong RCT evidence for existing treatments. The safety of current treatments at different doses is a particular concern in this vulnerable patient population. There is also a need for better understanding of the causes, phenotypes, and prevalence of pediatric cough, and how this relates to diagnosis and treatment, remembering that cough itself is not a disease, and can be viewed from a variety of perspectives including as a defensive reflex and a symptom.

Several challenges are associated with conducting clinical trials in pediatric cough. Acute cough associated with URTI is typically transient and self-limiting, meaning that a large trial or a large effect size is necessary to demonstrate a clinically relevant effect. There is a seemingly large response to placebo in clinical trials of acute cough therapies (up to 85%) – attributed to natural recovery, the physiological stimulation of saliva and mucus, as well as psychological effects (the true placebo effect) – meaning that it is difficult to demonstrate the superiority of active treatment versus placebo. There is a need for validated, automated, real-time cough counting technology, to allow the objective assessment of clinical response. In addition, pediatric patient-reported outcomes for cough, such as cough-specific quality of life, need to be developed and validated.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^111GyBva]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Research and implementation needs — validated cough outcome tools and electronic guideline version: Because of the relative paucity of studies using validated cough outcome tools, prospective before and after intervention studies need to be performed using such tools to document improvement in chronic cough with treatment; to determine the reliability and validity and efficacy of the 2017 CHEST cough management algorithms, prospective randomized clinical trials, with usual care control groups, will need to be undertaken with validated cough outcome tools; for ease of use and to potentially increase adherence, an electronic version of the acute, subacute, and chronic guidelines will need to be developed, which will also have the potential to facilitate use, dissemination, and implementation, and an electronic version may offer an opportunity for improvement.

ACCP cough guideline grading and evidence system — only recommendations can be graded and consensus-based statements are designated CB (consensus-based). The CHEST Grading System has two elements: the balance of benefits to harms and the quality of the body of relevant evidence. Stronger recommendations (level 1) are those with benefits clearly outweighing harms, and a strong negative recommendation (ie, do not do) is level 1; such statements are worded "we recommend" or "we recommend against". In weaker recommendations, worded "we suggest", it is not as clear that benefits outweigh harms and level 2 signals the need for more studies. The other element is the quality assessment of the total body of supporting evidence (A, B, or C), with A-level grades the highest but least common. With today's quality assessments, most recommendations receive a C-level grade, yet even lower grade evidence can still be strong recommendations (grade 1). Cough panelists determined the balance of benefits and harms and methodologists weighed in on level of evidence, and performance measures should not be derived from consensus-based suggestions and caution should be taken with recommendations of weak grades due to lower confidence in the magnitude of benefits and harms.

Grading recommendations — The recommendation grading includes a strength dimension and in practice "a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and applies only to some patients". The strength of recommendation here is "based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations". Intervention fidelity is emphasized and is defined "as the extent to which an intervention was delivered as conceived and planned-to arrive at valid conclusions concerning its effectiveness in achieving target outcomes".

### Benefit-risk profile of P2X3 receptor antagonists for treatment of chronic cough: dose-response model-based network meta-analysis [^113yjF73]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Refractory or unexplained chronic cough disrupts quality of life and burdens health care systems around the world. The P2X3 receptor antagonist gefapixant is approved in many countries for its antitussive effects, but taste disturbances are a common adverse effect. Four newer, more selective P2X3 receptor antagonists have been developed to address this problem.

Research Question

How does the benefit-risk profile vary across the five available P2X3 receptor antagonists?

Study Design and Methods

A systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of P2X3 receptor antagonists, including gefapixant, sivopixant, eliapixant, camlipixant, and filapixant. Primary outcomes were a reduction rate in 24-hour cough frequency and incidence of taste disturbance. Dose-response curves and median effective dose (ED 50) were calculated. Effect size at ED 50 was ranked according to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. The confidence was evaluated by Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis.

Results

Sixteen randomized controlled trials involving 4,904 participants were analyzed. The gefapixant regimen demonstrated an ED 50 of 90.7 mg/d for cough frequency reduction. Gefapixant showed the highest antitussive effectiveness at ED 50 (reduction rate in 24-hour cough frequency: median, 28.1%; 95% credible interval [CrI], 21.0%-35.6%; ranked 1 of 5; moderate certainty) but the highest prevalence of taste disturbance (absolute risk difference per 100 patients: median, 38; 95% CrI, 27–51; ranked 5 of 5; high certainty) and the highest prevalence of discontinuation. Camlipixant had a well-balanced profile (reduction rate in 24-hour cough frequency: median, 14.7%; 95% CrI, 5.4%-26.0%; ranked 3 of 5; low certainty; and taste disturbance; absolute risk difference per 100 patients; median, 2; 95% CrI, 1–6; ranked 2 of 5; low certainty). Placebo had a mean of 33.1% reduction in 24-hour cough frequency.

Interpretation

When used at safe doses, gefapixant had a favorable risk-benefit profile compared with the other four agents. Camlipixant showed initial promise, which may be further investigated by phase III trials currently underway.

Recommendation terminology and development — the evidence reviews, meta-analyses, and evidence profiles provided the foundation for the graded recommendations, and the term "recommendation" only applies when the body of evidence permits an evidence-based guideline methodology, whereas all other guidance statements are called suggestions, are consensus-based, and not graded. Because in some areas the available literature did not meet the predetermined threshold for an evidence-based guideline; any existing evidence, as well as the experiences of the carefully constructed panel, were permitted to inform the drafted suggestions, and following the systematic reviews of the structured PICO questions, nonconflicted content experts drafted the recommendations and suggestions.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^111Fm5tW]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine approved in some countries as an OTC antitussive, including the United States and the UK. In Germany, diphenhydramine 50 mg is approved as a hypnotic or antiemetic only. First-generation antitussives in combination with oral decongestants are recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence Based Guidelines for the treatment of cough in common cold and in the so-called upper airway cough syndrome. However, despite the title of those guidelines, this recommendation is based on expert opinion. In cough challenge studies in healthy participantsand patients with acute viral respiratory infection (diphenhydramine combination syrup with decongestant) in adults efficacy could have been established. However, no symptom or objective cough monitoring-based studies are available for acute cough. There is a clear-cut discrepancy between evidence of efficacy and broad clinical use of diphenhydramine/decongestant combinations for acute cough — despite an important sedative effect (dizziness) — especially in the United States. Table 1 evaluates how European antitussives match up to the modern metrics in cough research.

Efficacy outcome: a meta-analysis

The major results of the efficacy outcome were shown in Table 3. For P2X3 antagonist, the most commonly used indicator of efficacy outcome was cough severity VAS (n = 8, WMD: −11.08, 95% CI: −19.18 to −3.19, P = 0.006), followed by LCQ (n = 7, WMD: 1.64, 95% CI: 0.53–2.63, P < 0.001), CSD total score (n = 6, WMD: −1.63, 95% CI: −3.10 to −0.15, P = 0.031), 24 h cough frequency (n = 5, WMD: −11.04, 95% CI: −21.31 to −0.78, P = 0.035), Awake/night-time cough frequency (n = 4, WMD: −15.48, 95% CI: −28.36 to −2.59, P = 0.019), and urge to cough VAS (n = 3, WMD: −13.16, 95% CI: −21.94 to −4.38, P = 0.003). All of the overall effect estimates revealed significant differences from both efficacy outcome indicators, except for night-time cough frequency (WMD: −1.78, 95% CI: −5.81 to 2.25, P = 0.386). The subgroup analysis for patients with gefapixant showed similar results to the primary analysis. The details of the results were reported in e-Table S7 of Supplement.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114i2CT6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Summary of therapies for non-specific cough — this controlled-trial table reports time to response, level of evidence, and key considerations by therapy. Anti-histamines for acute cough list 1 wk with a systematic review (with OTC medications) and adverse events (especially with H1 antagonists). For chronic cough with anti-histamines, time to response is 2 wk with a systematic review, noted as non-beneficial, although a single small study showed benefit by 2 wk in children with pollen allergy with cetirizine. Anti-microbials for chronic wet/productive cough report 2 wk from systematic reviews and meta-analysis, with some requiring 4 wks. Inhaled corticosteroids show 2–4 wks supported by RCTs and a systematic review, with small benefit if any and adverse event. Theophylline indicates 1–2 wk based on observational studies and a systematic review, with no RCTs and adverse events. GERD therapy includes motility agents with time to response not relevant and a single controlled trial showing no benefit and adverse events; acid suppression marked not relevant with systematic reviews and adverse events; and food thickening or anti-reflux formula showing 1 wk with a systematic review and RCTs but inconclusive data (one increase in cough and a second reduction). Nasal therapy with nasal steroids shows 1–2 wk with an RCT and mainly adults and older children (> 12 y), beneficial when combined with antibiotics for sinusitis. Over-the-counter acute cough therapies are marked not relevant with a systematic review stating honey maybe beneficial while other OTC medications were non-beneficial. Footnotes define OTC as over-the-counter and RCT as randomized controlled trial and clarify that time to response is the expected reduction in cough severity if treatment is effective, as reported by trialists.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112efoCC]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study has several limitations. First, the absence of head-to-head (direct) comparison studies is the reason for the current network meta-analysis. Although the network meta-analysis is a useful tool for comparative effectiveness research, the potential bias due to the complexity and the assumption of transitivity needs to be considered during the process and the interpretation. The present study using random effects meta-analysis summarised the comparisons between medication and placebo, and network meta-analysis integrated the indirect evidence. Besides, sensitive analysis and meta-regression were also used to improve the quality of the results. Second, this study inevitably received a placebo effect which may complicate the interpretation of the results. Despite these, the efficacy of many medications remains significant (i.e.g.efapixant). Third, the data mainly come from US and Europe, which limits the worldwide generalizability. This may be due to the potential differences in the demographics, etiological composition, and management of people with chronic cough in the US and Europe compared with other regions. Finally, partial pooled results with heterogeneity may need to be interpreted with caution due to inevitable differences in interventions between trials (e.g. design, dose and duration). Though, this network meta-analysis of RCTs was performed in strict accordance with PRISMA and presents the best available evidence. It may provide reliable qualitative and quantitative data for the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy in RCC.

In this network meta-analysis, P2X3 antagonist showing advantages in terms of efficacy is currently the most promising medication for treatment of RCC or UCC. GABA modulator also showed potential efficacy but with AEs of the central system. Nevertheless, the role of TRP modulator needed to be revisited. Further research is needed to determine the potential beneficiary population for optimizing the pharmacological management of chronic cough.

### Efficacy and tolerability of gefapixant for treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^115ZkJWG]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Gefapixant represents an emerging therapy for patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of gefapixant for the treatment of adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from November 2014 to July 2023.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened for parallel and crossover randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared, in patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough, either gefapixant with placebo, or 2 or more doses of gefapixant with or without placebo.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted data. A frequentist random-effects dose-response meta-analysis or pairwise meta-analysis was used for each outcome. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in whether patients would perceive the effects as important (greater than the minimal important difference [MID]) or small (less than the MID).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cough frequency (measured using the VitaloJAK cough monitor; MID, 20%), cough severity (measured using the 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]; higher score is worse; MID, 30 mm), cough-specific quality of life (measured using the Leicester Cough Questionnaire [LCQ]; score range, 3 [maximal impairment] to 21 [no impairment]; MID, 1.3 points), treatment-related adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and taste-related adverse events.

Results

Nine RCTs including 2980 patients were included in the primary analysis. Compared with placebo, gefapixant (45 mg twice daily) had small effects on awake cough frequency (17.6% reduction [95% CI, 10.6%-24.0%], moderate certainty), cough severity on the 100-mm VAS (mean difference, -6.2 mm [95% CI, -4.1 to -8.4]; high certainty), and cough-specific quality of life on the LCQ (mean difference, 1.0 points [95% CI, 0.7–1.4]; moderate certainty). Compared with placebo, gefapixant (45 mg twice daily) probably caused an important increase in treatment-related adverse events (32 more per 100 patients [95% CI, 13–64 more], moderate certainty) and taste-related adverse events (32 more per 100 patients [95% CI, 22–46 more], high certainty). High-certainty evidence suggests that gefapixant (15 mg twice daily) had small effects on taste-related adverse events (6 more per 100 patients [95% CI, 5–8 more]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with placebo, gefapixant (45 mg orally twice daily) led to modest improvements in cough frequency, cough severity, and cough-specific quality of life but increased taste-related adverse events.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112GHQs5]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and network meta-analysis comprehensively analysed the pooled efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for RCC, and ranked their efficacy with multiple comparisons. Our study found that P2X3 antagonist (mainly gefapixant) probably provided the optimal improvement effect on RCC, although it was associated with an increased risk of AEs. Moreover, GABA modulator, PA-101, and macrolide also had a certain efficacy, but similar improvement was not observed in TRP modulator. To our knowledge, this study is the first network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy among various medications currently available. All included studies were RCTs, with most results being high quality according to GRADE system, suggesting the reliability of our findings. The studies included in this review were RCTs and most of the these were of high quality in GRADE. And the results were considerable reliable. Overall, this study demonstrates precise estimates of the efficacy and safety for current pharmacological treatments, and may provide evidence supporting the selection and application of therapeutic options for RCC.

Results

Literature selection and study characteristics

After reviewing 2249 records from all databases, 19 RCTs with 3326 patients met eligibility criteria and were finally included in this meta-analysis. The PRISMA flow chart is shown in Fig. 1. The included RCTs were published between 2010 and 2023 and were mainly conducted in Europe and the United States. The proportion of male participants ranged from 11.8% to 37.3%. The mean age of participants was 59.4 (95% CI: 57.9–60.9), with a mean cough duration of 10.6 years. All the included studies were placebo-controlled trials. A total of 13 medications were studied in these RCTs, representing the following classes of therapies: P2X3 antagonist, GABA modulator, TRP modulator, NK-1 antagonist, opioid analgesic, macrolides, and sodium cromoglicate. Gefapixant was the most frequently studied P2X3antagonist, followed by eliapixant and sivopixant. Detailed characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1. Network meta-analysis was conducted if studies had the comparable interventions and comparators, and pooling the results was appropriate. The duration of RCC, inclusion criteria, design, and device for cough monitor in included studies were summarised in Table 2.

Risk of bias assessment

Most studies were graded as having a low risk of bias, while only two were identified as having a high risk of bias. Some concerns about the risk of bias were noted for multiple studies in the following domains: random sequence generation (n = 1), allocation concealment (n = 1), blinding of participants and personal (n = 3), blinding of outcome assessment (n = 1), and incomplete outcome data (n = 1). The risk of bias graph is shown in Fig. 2.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112HKPwG]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications and pediatric acute/chronic cough: Manufacturers re-labeled these OTC products "do not use in children under 4 years of age", and in 2018 FDA labeling for prescription opioid cough and cold medicines was changed to limit their use to adults ≥ 18 years. OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in symptomatic control of acute cough in children and preparations containing anti-histamine and dextromethorphan were associated with adverse events, including reported death from toxicity in young children. CHEST advises that OTC use for chronic cough in children is the same as for acute cough due to the common cold. Consensus statements: 38) For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner; 39) For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan; 40) For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress.

### Efficacy and safety of gefapixant, a P2Xreceptor antagonist, in refractory chronic cough and unexplained chronic cough (COUGH-1 and COUGH-2): results from two double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials [^112UE5cF]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Gefapixant is an oral P2X 3 receptor antagonist that has previously shown efficacy and safety in refractory chronic cough and unexplained chronic cough. We therefore aim to confirm the efficacy and safety of gefapixant in participants with refractory chronic cough and unexplained chronic cough.

Methods

COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were both double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials. COUGH-1 was done in 156 sites in 17 countries and COUGH-2 in 175 sites in 20 countries. We enrolled participants who were 18 years or older with a diagnosis of refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough of 1 year duration or more. Participants were also required to have a cough severity visual analogue scale score of 40 mm or more at screening and baseline. Eligible participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1), using a computer-generated allocation schedule, to one of three treatment groups: placebo, gefapixant 15 mg twice per day, or gefapixant 45 mg twice per day. All study treatments were given orally. Participants were treated over a 12-week main study period in COUGH-1 and a 24-week main study period in COUGH-2; followed by extension periods for a total of up to 52 weeks of treatment in both trials. The primary outcome was placebo-adjusted mean change in 24-h cough frequency at 12 weeks in COUGH-1 and 24 weeks in COUGH-2. Both studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03449134 (COUGH-1) and NCT03449147 (COUGH-2).

Findings

From March 14, 2018, (first participant screened) to July 26, 2019, (last participant screened) 732 patients were recruited in COUGH-1 and 1317 in COUGH-2. COUGH-1 randomly assigned and treated 730 participants (243 [33×3%] with placebo, 244 [33×4%] with gefapixant 15 mg twice per day, and 243 [33×3%] with gefapixant 45 mg twice per day); COUGH-2 randomly assigned and treated 1314 participants (435 [33×1%] with placebo, 440 [33×5%] with gefapixant 15 mg twice per day, and 439 [33×4%] with gefapixant 45 mg twice per day). Participants were mostly female (542 [74×2%] of 730 in COUGH-1 and 984 [74×9%] of 1314 in COUGH-2). The mean age was 59×0 years (SD 12×6) in COUGH-1 and 58×1 years (12×1) in COUGH-2, and the mean cough duration was 11·6 years (SD 9·5) in COUGH-1 and 11·2 years (9·8) in COUGH-2. Gefapixant 45 mg twice per day showed significant reductions in 24-h cough frequency compared with placebo at week 12 in COUGH-1 (18·5% [95% CI 32·9–0·9]; p = 0·041) and at week 24 in COUGH-2 (14·6% [26·1–1·4]; p = 0·031). Gefapixant 15 mg twice per day did not show a significant reduction in cough frequency versus placebo in both studies. The most common adverse events were related to taste disturbance: ageusia (36 [4·9%] of 730 in COUGH-1 and 86 [6·5%] of 1314 in COUGH-2), dysgeusia (118 [16·2%] in COUGH-1 and 277 [21·1%] in COUGH-2), hypergeusia (3 [0·4%] in COUGH-1 and 6 [0×5%] in COUGH-2), hypogeusia (19 [2·6%] in COUGH-1 and 80 [6·1%] in COUGH-2), and taste disorder (28 [3·8%] in COUGH-1 and 46 [3·5%] in COUGH-2).

Interpretation

Gefapixant 45 mg twice per day is the first treatment to show efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in phase 3 clinical trials for refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115tLJ4M]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Refractory chronic cough (RCC) has a significant impact on patient's health-related quality of life and represents a challenge in clinical management. However, the optimal treatment for RCC remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of the current pharmacological therapeutic options for RCC.

Methods

A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid databases from January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2023. All randomised control trials (RCTs) reporting outcomes of efficacy or/and safety were included in the Bayesian network meta-analysis. Here, we compared the effects on Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and objective cough frequency of patients with RCC. Besides, we also compared the incidence of adverse events (AEs) for analysis of safety. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022345940.

Findings

19 eligible RCTs included 3326 patients and 7 medication categories: P2X3 antagonist, GABA modulator, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) modulator, NK-1 agonist, opioid analgesic, macrolide, and sodium cromoglicate. Compared with placebo, mean difference (MD) of LCQ and 24 h cough frequency for P2X3 antagonist relief were 1.637 (95% CI: 0.887–2.387) and -11.042 (P = 0.035). Compared with placebo, effect sizes (MD for LCQ and cough severity VAS) for GABA modulator were 1.347 (P = 0.003) and -7.843 (P = 0.003). In the network meta-analysis, gefapixant is the most effective treatment for patients with RCC (The Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curves (SUCRA) is 0.711 in LCQ, 0.983 in 24 h cough frequency, and 0.786 in cough severity VAS). Lesogaberan had better efficacy than placebo (SUCRA: 0.632 vs. 0.472) in 24 h cough frequency. Eliapixant and lesogaberan had better efficacy than placebo in cough severity VAS. However, TRP modulator had worse efficacy than placebo. In the meta-analysis of AEs, the present study found P2X3 antagonist had a significant correlation to AEs (RR: 1.129, 95% CI: 1.012–1.259), especially taste-related AEs (RR: 6.216, P < 0.05).

Interpretation

In this network meta-analysis, P2X3 antagonist showing advantages in terms of efficacy is currently the most promising medication for treatment of RCC. GABA modulator also showed potential efficacy for RCC but with AEs of the central system. Nevertheless, the role of TRP modulator needed to be revisited. Further research is needed to determine the potential beneficiary population for optimizing the pharmacological management of chronic cough.

### Etiology and treatment of cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^113CSEFG]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease of dysregulated wound healing leading to unremitting scarring and loss of lung function. The predominant symptoms are dyspnea on exertion and a persistent dry cough. For patients with IPF, cough is more than just bothersome; it has a significant negative impact on quality of life and is a marker of disease severity and progression. The etiology of cough in IPF is unclear but may be due to architectural distortion of the lungs, increased sensitivity of the cough reflex, airway inflammation, or changes in mucus production and clearance. There also may be an overlap between IPF cough and cough due to other common etiologies such as asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper airway cough syndrome, and medications. There are no approved therapies to specifically treat IPF cough, and recently approved medications for IPF have not been evaluated in cough. Few clinical trials have focused on treatments for IPF cough. To date, there is only one randomized, placebo control therapeutic study for IPF cough with thalidomide, which significantly reduced IPF cough and improved quality of life. Two additional cohort studies report that interferon-α and prednisolone also decrease IPF cough. However, no medication is approved to treat IPF cough. Currently, the mainstay of therapy for IPF cough is standard cough suppressants, which have limited efficacy and often intolerable side effects. Future studies are needed to determine an effective therapy to alleviate this particularly debilitating symptom and improve overall quality of life for patients suffering with IPF.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^1178JuvT]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel — acute cough due to the common cold — issues ungraded consensus-based suggestions as follows: For adult and pediatric patients, "we suggest against the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients, "we suggest against the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In pediatric patients (aged 1–18 years), "we suggest honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), with the remark that "Infants < 1 year of age should not be administered honey, and children < 2 years of age should not be administered dextromethorphan for cough symptoms". In pediatric patients (aged < 18 years), "we suggest avoiding use of codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

Table 3
The results of meta-analysis for cough score change (WMD).

Three studies reported on the efficacy outcome of a TRP modulator. Compared with the placebo group, cough severity (Urge to cough VAS: WMD: 0.16, 95% CI: −3.58 to 3.90, P = 0.933) and cough-specific quality of life (LCQ: WMD: −0.29, 95% CI: −2.35 to 1.78, P = 0.787) did not improve after treatment with the medication. The overall pooled results of day-time cough frequency (WMD: 5.24, 95% CI: 3.41–7.08, P < 0.001), 24 h cough frequency (WMD: 2.60, 95% CI: 0.39–4.80, P = 0.021), and cough severity VAS (WMD: 5.34, 95% CI: 3.45–7.23, P < 0.001) suggested were worse in the treatment group than the placebo group.

A total of 2 studies reported on the efficacy of GABA modulator. The overall pooled results of LCQ and cough severity VAS significantly favoured the medication group over the placebo group (LCQ: WMD: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.47–2.23, P = 0.003; Cough severity VAS: WMD: −7.84, 95% CI: −13.02 to −2.66, P = 0.003). However, there were no significant differences in 24 h cough frequency between a placebo and a GABA modulator (WMD: −12.93, 95% CI: −33.86 to 8.00, P = 0.226).

The overall effect estimates of the LCQ score showed a significant variance between the two groups favouring the macrolide group (WMD: 1.59, 95% CI: 0.25–2.93, P = 0.02). Although the rest of the studies lacked the data needed for meta-analysis, both showed potential ability in cough remission.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114u6GEq]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Refractory chronic cough (RCC) has a significant impact on patient's health-related quality of life and represents a challenge in clinical management. However, the optimal treatment for RCC remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of the current pharmacological therapeutic options for RCC.

Methods

A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid databases from January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2023. All randomised control trials (RCTs) reporting outcomes of efficacy or/and safety were included in the Bayesian network meta-analysis. Here, we compared the effects on Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and objective cough frequency of patients with RCC. Besides, we also compared the incidence of adverse events (AEs) for analysis of safety. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022345940.

Findings

19 eligible RCTs included 3326 patients and 7 medication categories: P2X3 antagonist, GABA modulator, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) modulator, NK-1 agonist, opioid analgesic, macrolide, and sodium cromoglicate. Compared with placebo, mean difference (MD) of LCQ and 24 h cough frequency for P2X3 antagonist relief were 1.637 (95% CI: 0.887–2.387) and −11.042 (P = 0.035). Compared with placebo, effect sizes (MD for LCQ and cough severity VAS) for GABA modulator were 1.347 (P = 0.003) and −7.843 (P = 0.003). In the network meta-analysis, gefapixant is the most effective treatment for patients with RCC (The Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curves (SUCRA) is 0.711 in LCQ, 0.983 in 24 h cough frequency, and 0.786 in cough severity VAS). Lesogaberan had better efficacy than placebo (SUCRA: 0.632 vs. 0.472) in 24 h cough frequency. Eliapixant and lesogaberan had better efficacy than placebo in cough severity VAS. However, TRP modulator had worse efficacy than placebo. In the meta-analysis of AEs, the present study found P2X3 antagonist had a significant correlation to AEs (RR: 1.129, 95% CI: 1.012–1.259), especially taste-related AEs (RR: 6.216, P < 0.05).

Interpretation

In this network meta-analysis, P2X3 antagonist showing advantages in terms of efficacy is currently the most promising medication for treatment of RCC. GABA modulator also showed potential efficacy for RCC but with AEs of the central system. Nevertheless, the role of TRP modulator needed to be revisited. Further research is needed to determine the potential beneficiary population for optimizing the pharmacological management of chronic cough.

### Interventions for cough in cancer [^115w2pZ1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a common symptom in patients with malignancies, especially in patients with lung cancer. Cough is not well controlled in clinical practice and clinicians have few management options to treat it.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of interventions, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, (other than chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy) in the management of cough in malignant disease (especially in lung cancer).

Search Strategy

Databases searched included: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) (The Cochrane Library issue 4, 2009); MEDLINE (1966 to May 2010); EMBASE (1980 to May 2010); CINAHL (1980 to May 2010); PSYCHINFO (1980 to May 2010); AMED (1985 to May 2010); SIGLE (1980 to May 2010); British Nursing Index (1985 to May 2010); CancerLit (1975 to May 2010). We searched for cough suppressants, antitussives and other drugs with antitussive activity as well as non-pharmacological interventions (see Appendices 1–4 for search terms).

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical trials (quasi-experimental trials, and trials where there is a comparison group but no mention of randomisation) in participants with primary or metastatic lung cancer or other cancers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts of all studies, and extracted data from all selected studies before reaching consensus. A third review author arbitrated with any disagreement. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the heterogeneity of studies.

Main Results

Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria and examined either brachytherapy, laser or photodynamic therapy (eight studies) or a variety of pharmacological therapies (nine studies). Overall, there was absence of credible evidence and the majority of studies were of low methodological quality and high risk of bias. Brachytherapy seemed to improve cough in a variety of doses in selected participants, suggesting that possibly the lowest effective dose should be used to minimise side effects. Photodynamic therapy was examined in one study, and while improvements in cough were observed, its role over other therapies for cough is unclear. Some indication of effect was observed with morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, levodropropizine, sodium cromoglycate and butamirate citrate linctus (cough syrup), although all studies had significant risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

No practice recommendations could be drawn from this review. There is an urgent need to increase the number and quality of studies evaluating the effects of interventions in the management of cough in cancer.

### Over-the-counter medications for acute cough symptoms… [^113oQJpc]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are over-the-counter cough medications safe and effective in reducing acute cough symptoms in children and adults. Evidence-Based Answer It is uncertain whether OTC cough medications are effective in reducing cough symptoms in adults; in children, no trials show a statistically significant benefit in the treatment compared with the placebo groups. Overall, the quality of evidence is poor; adult studies show conflicting results from heterogeneous studies. Evidence from trials about adverse effects is limited; however, national databases have reported ingestion-related harms in children. Two out of three adult studies of dextromethorphan, including one meta-analysis of five studies, found a statistically significant benefit: a 30-mg single dose was more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms, as measured by cough counts, frequency, effort, and intensity.

Based on the findings of two adult trials of codeine and three trials of antihistamines, neither medication is more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms. Two adult trials comparing antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo showed conflicting results, with only the smaller of the two studies showing a statistically significant reduction in mean cough severity rating. Two adult trials compared guaifenesin with placebo with mixed results: in the larger study, a greater percentage of patients in the guaifenesin group than in the placebo group reported reduction of cough frequency and intensity at 72 hours.

The second study found no statistically significant reduction in cough frequency and intensity in the treatment group, but did show more participants reporting a reduction in sputum thickness in the treatment group compared with placebo. 3 The American College of Chest Physicians 2006 practice guideline on the evaluation and treatment of cough recommends treating adults who have acute cough caused by the common cold with a first-generation antihistamine-decongestant combination, such as dex-brompheniramine and sustained-release pseudoephed-rine. It also endorses the use of naproxen in this circumstance. 4.

### Effectiveness of guaifenesin in the treatment of cough… [^115iV1df]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Guaifenesin is the only expectorant that has been considered effective by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Despite its broad use in the treatment of cough, multiple studies have found inconsistent results supporting the effectiveness of guaifenesin as an expectorant or cough suppressant. Little information is available concerning the impact of guaifenesin on the sensitivity of the cough reflex. Dicpinigaitis and Gayle conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the efficacy of a single dose of guaifenesin on cough reflex sensitivity. Each participant received a single 400-mg dose of guaifenesin or placebo one to two hours before undergoing a capsaicin challenge to induce cough. The capsaicin challenge was performed with incremental increases in concentration until it induced five or more coughs within 15 seconds of inhalation. Spirometry data were collected before the challenge.

The main outcome was the concentration of capsaicin required to induce five or more coughs. The results included comparing the effects of guaifenesin and placebo among the patients with URI and the healthy participants. The URI and healthy groups each contained 14 persons. All participants were induced to cough during the capsaicin challenge test. The spirometry results did not differ between persons who received guaifenesin and persons who received placebo. Among patients with URI, those who received guaifenesin required significantly higher concentrations of capsaicin to induce cough compared with the placebo group. In seven of the 14 participants who received guaifenesin, the concentration needed to induce cough was double that of the placebo group. Among the healthy persons, no differences occurred between the placebo and guaifenesin groups with regard to the concentration of capsaicin that induced five or more coughs.

The authors conclude that guaifenesin inhibits the cough reflex in patients with URI. This action occurs because the cough receptors are transiently hypersensitive secondary to the URI. They add that this effect was not present in healthy persons. Studies have shown that this medication is an effective expectorant. The study by Dicpinigaitis and Gayle adds to this body of literature by demonstrating that guaifenesin also suppresses cough in patients with URI symptoms. This study provides physicians with a proven medication that can control the symptoms of URIs and provide supportive care for patients with URIs. — k. e. m.

### Guidelines for treating adults with acute cough… [^116fEyFX]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Simasek and Blandino review the literature on the treatment of the common cold in this issue of American Family Physician. 1 The authors conclude that the ability to make confident and specific treatment recommendations is limited because of flaws in the evidence. The American College of Chest Physicians recently published evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute cough, subacute cough, and chronic cough in adults and chronic cough in children |When cough is caused by the common cold, older anti-histamine/decongestant medications and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen are likely to be helpful; newer nonsedating antihistamines and over-the-counter combination cough medications are not likely to be helpful; antibiotics are not indicated |.

By using the most rigorous and current methods to develop its evidence-based clinical practice guideline for acute cough, the ACCP guideline committee made diagnostic and treatment recommendations based on two components: the quality of the evidence, which was rated according to study design and strength of the modalities used; and the net benefit of the recommendation based on the estimated benefit to the specific patient population. 4 Using this process, the committee's recommendations are stronger than Simasek and Blandino's, 1 who based their recommendations on Cochrane reviews. The committee strongly recommends that patients with acute cough from the common cold receive a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant or the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen unless there is a contraindication. 15 They also strongly recommend that newer-generation, nonsedating antihistamines should not be used because they are ineffective. 15 The committee does not recommend over-the-counter combination cold medications, except for those that contain older antihistamine/decongestant ingredients, until they are proved effective in randomized controlled trials. 16 A meta-analysis has called into question whether the presumed increased sedation effect of first-generation antihistamines compared with newer nonsedating antihistamines is substantiated by objective data and if it is clinically relevant. 17.

### Benefits of nonprescription cough medicines are unclear… [^115FwhuY]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Use of nonprescription medications for cough is common. In Great Britain, nearly $140 million is spent annually on these remedies, increasing by about 3 percent per year. Because patients frequently ask their physicians about nonprescription cough medications, Schroeder and Fahey reviewed the evidence for their effectiveness. From the 328 citations identified, 15 trials involving 2, 166 patients met the criteria for analysis. The largest number of trials of a single medication was five. The trials were of generally poor methodologic quality, and the results could not be pooled because of the multiple differences among the trials. In the five trials of antitussives, codeine was found to be equivalent to placebo in two studies. One study of dextromethorphan reported a significant reduction in cough frequency, while another trial found no difference compared with placebo.

The single trial of moguisteine showed a significant reduction in cough scores for two to three days after treatment began, but this effect was not sustained, and 22 percent of patients reported gastrointestinal side effects. One trial of the expectorant guaifenesin reported a significant benefit over placebo, but a second trial found no differences between the treated and placebo groups. Similarly, one trial of antihistamine-decongestant combinations reported significant benefit at three to five days, whereas a second trial found no improvement over placebo. Two trials of the antihistamine terfenadine showed that it was no more effective than placebo, but there was a low incidence of side effects. The single trial of mucolytics reported a significant reduction in cough frequency but offered no information on side effects. The authors conclude that the evidence for use of nonprescription cough medications is limited.

In nine of 15 trials, these medications were no better than placebo, and many were associated with side effects. When positive results were obtained, the clinical benefit was small and of questionable significance. The authors call for further studies in this area, stressing the importance of quality in study design and conduct. In the meantime, they do not recommend the use of nonprescription medications for treatment of acute cough of presumed viral origin.
