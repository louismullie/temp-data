## Question

Is it appropriate to start antibiotics for a leukocyte esterase moderate, negative nitrites with 100 thousand klebsiella pnemonia growing in urine culture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotics should be started for a urine culture showing 100,000 CFU/mL of Klebsiella pneumoniae when the urinalysis shows moderate leukocyte esterase and negative nitrites. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this culture result meets diagnostic thresholds for significant bacteriuria. Then, I should verify how to interpret the urinalysis in light of organism-specific limitations, especially for Klebsiella and nitrite production. Next, I will assess the clinical context and pretest probability. After that, I need to distinguish asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic UTI and apply guideline-based treatment criteria. Finally, I will consider special populations, specimen quality, and outline a stewardship-aligned decision pathway with clear recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the culture significance. A single uropathogen at 100,000 CFU/mL meets standard thresholds for significant bacteriuria in symptomatic patients, and Klebsiella pneumoniae is a recognized uropathogen, so the culture is clinically meaningful if the patient has compatible symptoms or risk factors [^4d0bc8ed] [^b741b1c9].

> Wait, let me verify the urinalysis interpretation before jumping to treatment. Moderate leukocyte esterase indicates pyuria, which supports a host inflammatory response, but negative nitrites are not reassuring here because Klebsiella and some other uropathogens are variable nitrite producers; nitrite negativity does not exclude infection in this context, so I should not anchor on nitrites to rule out UTI when Klebsiella is isolated [^05a83aae] [^a044c86c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the clinical context and pretest probability. In a symptomatic patient with dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, flank pain, fever, or new incontinence, the combination of significant bacteriuria and pyuria establishes a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI and warrants antibiotic therapy; in an asymptomatic patient, this may represent asymptomatic bacteriuria, which should not be treated except in specific scenarios [^7ba03373] [^b741b1c9].

> I should confirm special populations and exceptions. In pregnancy, any significant bacteriuria should be treated regardless of symptoms due to risks of pyelonephritis and preterm birth, so antibiotics are indicated here. In children, significant bacteriuria with pyuria supports UTI and warrants treatment. In older adults with functional or cognitive impairment, bacteriuria with delirium or falls warrants careful evaluation for other causes before treating ASB, and routine treatment of ASB is discouraged. Before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma, screen and treat ASB briefly to reduce infectious complications [^53a7b811] [^8cf18104] [^f36c2ed5] [^fde217b5] [^528cef34].

> Let me consider specimen quality and contamination. If the culture was from a clean-catch or bagged specimen, I should double-check for epithelial cells or mixed flora suggesting contamination; a repeat catheterized specimen is prudent when results are discordant with symptoms or when management hinges on accuracy, especially in children and when colony counts are borderline [^99949f99] [^86fc09b2].

> Next, I should review stewardship principles. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria drives unnecessary antibiotic exposure, C. difficile, and resistance without improving outcomes, so I need to ensure symptoms are present or that a clear indication exists before prescribing; if symptoms are equivocal, a short delay to clarify the diagnosis or obtain a better specimen is reasonable [^fde217b5] [^b741b1c9].

> Putting this together, my decision hinges on symptoms and risk. If the patient has compatible urinary symptoms or is pregnant, I should treat the Klebsiella UTI; if the patient is asymptomatic and not in a special situation that mandates treatment, I should not treat and avoid unnecessary antibiotics; if symptoms are unclear, I should reassess, consider repeating a catheterized urinalysis and culture, and apply clinical judgment before committing to therapy [^7ba03373] [^b741b1c9] [^99949f99].

> Final recommendation: Yes, antibiotics are appropriate if the patient has symptoms consistent with UTI or is in a group where treatment of bacteriuria is indicated, given 100,000 CFU/mL of Klebsiella and moderate leukocyte esterase. No, antibiotics are not appropriate if the patient is asymptomatic and not pregnant, not undergoing a urologic procedure, or not a young child with fever and pyuria, in which case this represents asymptomatic bacteriuria and should not be treated [^7ba03373] [^b741b1c9] [^53a7b811].

---

Treat if the patient has **symptoms of UTI** (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or fever) [^7ba03373] because moderate leukocyte esterase with 100,000 CFU/mL Klebsiella pneumoniae is clinically significant [^99949f99]. If the patient is **asymptomatic**, do not treat, as this likely represents asymptomatic bacteriuria [^b741b1c9], which should not be treated except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^528cef34]. Always obtain a urine culture before starting antibiotics when feasible [^7ba03373], and tailor therapy to sensitivities once available [^7467f4a9].

---

## Interpretation of urinalysis and culture results

- **Leukocyte esterase moderate**: Indicates pyuria, suggesting inflammation or infection, but is nonspecific and can be positive in contamination or other inflammatory conditions [^0385bc4c].

- **Negative nitrites**: Not uncommon with Klebsiella pneumoniae, as some strains do not reduce nitrate to nitrite efficiently, especially with short bladder incubation times [^05a83aae].

- **100,000 CFU/mL Klebsiella pneumoniae**: Meets the threshold for significant bacteriuria and is considered clinically significant if the patient has symptoms or risk factors for UTI [^99949f99].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), **significant bacteriuria** is defined as ≥ 100,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen in a symptomatic patient [^99949f99]. Treatment is indicated when the patient has **compatible symptoms** (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or fever) [^7ba03373]. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated except in specific scenarios such as pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^b741b1c9] [^528cef34].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic patient (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or fever) | Treat with antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity results [^7467f4a9] |
| Asymptomatic patient without risk factors | Do not treat; this is asymptomatic bacteriuria [^b741b1c9] |
| Pregnant patient (symptomatic or asymptomatic) | Treat regardless of symptoms due to risks of pyelonephritis and preterm labor [^53a7b811] |
| Patient undergoing urologic procedure | Treat to prevent infectious complications [^528cef34] |

---

## Empiric antibiotic recommendations

If treatment is indicated, **empiric antibiotic choices** should consider local resistance patterns and the organism's typical susceptibilities:

- **First-line options**: Nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or fosfomycin (for uncomplicated cystitis) [^9b1ec760].

- **Second-line options**: Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) or beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin) if first-line agents are contraindicated or resistance is suspected [^cbea9908].

- **Klebsiella pneumoniae considerations**: Typically susceptible to nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones, but local resistance patterns should guide therapy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Treat if the patient has **symptoms of UTI**, as moderate leukocyte esterase with 100,000 CFU/mL Klebsiella pneumoniae is clinically significant [^99949f99]. If the patient is **asymptomatic**, do not treat, as this likely represents asymptomatic bacteriuria [^b741b1c9]. Always obtain a urine culture before initiating antibiotics when feasible, and tailor therapy to culture and sensitivity results [^7467f4a9].

### Diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis in adults [^cbea9908]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

There are approximately 250,000 cases of acute pyelonephritis each year, resulting in more than 100,000 hospitalizations. The most common etiologic cause is infection with Escherichia coli. The combination of the leukocyte esterase test and the nitrite test (with either test proving positive) has a sensitivity of 75 to 84 percent and a specificity of 82 to 98 percent for urinary tract infection. Urine cultures are positive in 90 percent of patients with acute pyelonephritis, and cultures should be obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated. The use of blood cultures should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, those who are immunocompromised, and those who are suspected of having hematogenous infections. Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy with a fluoroquinolone is successful in most patients with mild uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Other effective alternatives include extended-spectrum penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Indications for inpatient treatment include complicated infections, sepsis, persistent vomiting, failed outpatient treatment, or extremes of age. In hospitalized patients, intravenous treatment is recommended with a fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside with or without ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. The standard duration of therapy is seven to 14 days. Urine culture should be repeated one to two weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy. Treatment failure may be caused by resistant organisms, underlying anatomic/functional abnormalities, or immunosuppressed states. Lack of response should prompt repeat blood and urine cultures and, possibly, imaging studies. A change in antibiotics or surgical intervention may be required.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic approach in febrile infants — If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the infant is not in a low-risk group, there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for culture and urinalysis, or obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and perform a urinalysis; if the urinalysis suggests a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results or nitrite test or microscopic analysis results positive for leukocytes or bacteria), then a urine specimen should be obtained through catheterization or SPA and cultured; if urinalysis of fresh (< 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite test results, then it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that negative urinalysis results do not rule out a UTI with certainty.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, evaluation, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to assess the likelihood of UTI in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever if immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required, to guide further decisions:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Low risk|- Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only without testing|

### Urinary tract infection in children [^b04c4cae]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 7 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys will have a symptomatic, culture-confirmed urinary tract infection by six years of age. Urinary tract infection may be suspected because of urinary symptoms in older children or because of fever, nonspecific symptoms, or failure to thrive in infants. Urine dipstick analysis is useful for ruling out urinary tract infections in cases with low clinical suspicion. However, urine culture is necessary for diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children if there is high clinical suspicion, cloudy urine, or if urine dipstick testing shows positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite activity. Despite current recommendations, routine imaging studies (e.g., renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, renal scans) do not appear to improve clinical outcomes in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in randomized trials. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established, but one-day therapies have been shown to be inferior to longer treatment courses.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 2 (assessment and initial testing pathway): If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation).

When illness severity and UTI risk are extremely low, the patient may be observed without assessing the urine, and this 2-step process (Option 2) has been shown feasible and beneficial in a pediatric emergency department, with the catheterization rate decreasing from 63% to fewer than 30% without increasing length of stay or missing UTIs.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^4d0bc8ed]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

### Relationship between urinalysis findings and responsible pathogens in children with urinary tract infections [^a044c86c]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyuria, presence of bacteria, leukocyte esterase, and nitrite positivity in urinalysis should be considered together, and simultaneous urine culture test should be performed in the diagnostic evaluation of urinary tract infection (UTI). The absence of pyuria in urinalysis cannot exclude UTI in patients with suggestive clinical findings.

Objective

It was aimed to assess relationship between urinalysis tests and uropathogen and to evaluate antibiotic resistance in children.

Methods

The study included patients (aged 0–18 years) with significant uropathogen growth in urine culture tests. The patients' data regarding age, gender, results of urine microscopy, urine culture, and antibiogram were recorded retrospectively.

Results

Overall, 705 patients (562 girls, 143 boys) with significant growth in urine culture test were included. Median age was 72 months among girls and 12 months among boys. Most common uropathogens were Escherichia coli (79.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.2%). E. coli was more commonly among girls (87%) and Klebsiella spp. among boys (53.3%). Pyuria was positive in urinalysis in 75% of patients. Pyuria presence was more common in patients with E.coli or Proteus spp. (80.6% and 71.4%, respectively) than those with Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. (52.0% and 53.3%, respectively). In culture antibiogram tests, ampicillin resistance was 100% in Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter spp. and 72% in E. coli strains. No ceftriaxone resistance was observed in K. oxytoca, Citrobacter spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.

Discussion

Most UTIs were seen in older girls. Pyuria might be lacking in UTIs associated to Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus spp., and absence of pyuria may not exclude UTI in patients with compatible clinical findings. Ceftriaxone is still an option in empirical treatment; unnecessary use of third-generation cephalosporins should be avoided, particularly in infections other than UTI.

Conlusions

It was found that E. coli more commonly caused leukocyturia, leukocyte esterase positivity, and pyuria; that pyuria might be lacking in UTIs associated to Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus spp. and that pyuria was more prevalent among girls. It is though that urine culture tests should be performed in children with suspected UTI even in the absence of pyuria because lack of pyuria may lead delay in diagnosis and treatment as well as renal scar formation.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^35feceda]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinalysis parameter combinations

When WBCs, which had the highest AUC (0.722 [95% CI 0.718–0.725]) among urinalysis parameters, were combined with bacterial counts of "few" or more, the AUC was slightly lower (0.711[95% CI 0.706–0.714)). Combinations of WBCs with other microscopic parameters resulted in even lower AUCs (Table 3). Among the macroscopic parameter combinations, leukocyte esterase combined with nitrite (whether positive or negative) had an AUC of 0.695, which was identical to that of leukocyte esterase alone (AUC = 0.700 [95% CI 0.690–0.701], p = 0.08) but higher than nitrites alone (AUC = 0.627 [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), p = 0.001) (Table 3).

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^111605bf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The growing incidence of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria poses a significant public health threat, driven heavily by inappropriate antibiotic use. Diagnostic stewardship, including tools like reflex urine culture, can help reduce unnecessary testing and subsequent unwarranted antibiotic treatments, though optimal thresholds are not well-defined. In our analysis of urinary parameters, urine microscopy WBC count demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the presence of uropathogens.

Our study findings show that no single urinalysis parameter achieves both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting uropathogens from urine culture. However, WBC count on the microscopic portion of the urinalysis showed the best test performance with an AUC of 0.72, indicating acceptable or fair discriminative power.

Our results align with an analysis of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center healthcare system data, which assessed urinalysis parameters for diagnostic accuracy of "significant bacteriuria", a proxy definition for UTI. They found that WBC had the best diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.79), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.78) and bacteria (AUC = 0.77). Interestingly, our AUC values were lower. Differences may stem from test ordering practice variation, with some systems performing urinalysis with urine cultures more or less discriminately, including ordering tests for patients without UTI symptoms. The bias introduced by selecting patients based on clinician-initiated urinalysis ordering, rather than on symptoms, has been shown to underestimate diagnostic accuracy and may have contributed to inter-study variability in AUC results. Another key difference is our mean population age was lower (48 versus 57 years), attributed to our inclusion of children, whereas the other study included only adults. Increased age is associated with a higher prevalence of pyuria and colonization in women, – which might contribute to test performance differences. Finally, uropathogen definition differences may explain discrepant AUC values. The previous study's outcome was > 10,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL, whereas our definition was organisms likely to prompt clinical action.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age… [^df236591]. publications.aap.org (2016). Low credibility.

Action Statement 1 If a clinician decides that a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever requires antimicrobial therapy to be administered because of ill appearance or another pressing reason, the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration, because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag.

If the urinalysis results suggest a UTI, then a urine specimen should be obtained through catheterization or SPA and cultured; if urinalysis of fresh urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, then it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty. Significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm 3 on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick. Action Statement 4 Action Statement 4a. When initiating treatment, the clinician should base the choice of route of administration on practical considerations: initiating treatment orally or parenterally is equally efficacious.

The clinician should base the choice of agent on local antimicrobial sensitivity patterns and should adjust the choice according to sensitivity testing of the isolated uropathogen. Action Statement 4b. The clinician should choose 7 to 14 days as the duration of antimicrobial therapy. Comment Basing the choice of an initial antimicrobial agent on local sensitivity patterns can be difficult because applicable information may not be available. Whether the child has received antimicrobial therapy in the recent past should be considered. This exposure constitutes a risk factor for resistance to the recently prescribed antimicrobial. Further delineation of treatment duration has not been forthcoming, but a randomized controlled trial is currently under way comparing the effectiveness of 5 days versus 10 days of treatment.

11 Note: The dose of ceftriaxone in Table 2 should be 50 mg/kg, every 24 h.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^dfb8de71]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Acute cystitis diagnosis in pregnant individuals — clinicians should evaluate patients with symptoms of acute cystitis with a urine culture; urinary tract infection should be suspected based on the presence of symptoms, may be supported by a positive urinalysis result, and is confirmed by urine culture showing 100,000 CFU/mL or more. Pyuria, defined as more than 5 white blood cells/high-power field or presence of leukocyte esterase, has up to 97% sensitivity for UTI; nitrites are the most specific finding (94–98%), and if neither nitrites nor leukocyte esterase are present, UTI is unlikely (negative predictive value 78–98%).

Urinary tract infection rapid tests — meta-analysis performance in children is summarized as follows: A Class II meta-analysis of 95 studies in 95,703 children aged 18 years or younger reported nitrite-only sensitivity 49% (95% CI 41% to 57%) and specificity 98% (95% CI 96% to 99%); leukocyte esterase or nitrite sensitivity 88% (95% CI 82% to 91%) and specificity 79% (95% CI 69% to 87%); urine WBC counts (> 10/μL) sensitivity 74% (95% CI 67% to 80%) and specificity 86% (95% CI 82% to 90%); unstained bacteria sensitivity 85% (95% CI 75% to 94%) and specificity 92% (95% CI 84% to 96%); and Gram's-stained bacteria sensitivity 91% (95% CI 80% to 96%) and specificity 96% (95% CI 92% to 98%). These rapid diagnostic tests were negative in about 10% of children with urinary tract infections and "cannot replace urine culture".

Clinical diagnosis of UTI is unreliable, so many children with fever or symptoms of UTI need a urine sample to exclude or make the diagnosis. Urine samples should be collected before starting antibiotics, but therapy should not be delayed in the septic child.

Children with localising signs or suspected UTI need a urine sample to confirm the diagnosis.

Children with fever without focus, particularly neonates and infants, need a urine sample to evaluate potential UTI. Outside early infancy and if the child is not unwell, it may be reasonable to wait 24 hours for collection to see if an alternative focus emerges.

Children with an alternative focus of illness generally do not need a urine sample. Exceptions are septic infants, children with predisposing conditions (eg, renal anomalies), children at risk of complications (eg, single kidney) and febrile illness not following the expected clinical course.

Screening – dipstick and microscopy

Urine dipsticks are a quick, inexpensive bedside screening tool. Chemical reagent strips change colour in the presence of leucocyte esterase (an enzyme present in leucocytes) and nitrites, which may arise from UTI. Leucocytes generally appear in the urine in response to UTI. However, sterile pyuria can occur with other infections. Enterococcus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas species are also less likely to produce pyuria than E.coli in children with symptomatic UTI. Most uropathogens convert dietary nitrates into urinary nitrites. However, not all do, including Enterococcus and Klebsiella species. Dipsticks are also less reliable in young infants, where frequent voiding flushes substrates out of the bladder.

Neither leucocytes or nitrites are fully sensitive or specific for UTI, but they are a useful screening test, particularly when used in combination. If UTI is thought unlikely, dipsticks have a good negative predictive value to exclude the diagnosis. In the presence of suggestive symptoms and either leucocytes or nitrites, empirical antibiotics while awaiting culture is indicated.

Urine microscopy also identifies leucocytes and bacteria, augmenting dipstick screening.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^d0fc31ab]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^9f8bfdea]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Randomised controlled trial

General practitioners or practice nurses recruited patients with suspected urinary tract infection, either first time or recurrent, on presentation. The study included 309 non-pregnant adult women aged 18–70. The practitioner collected baseline symptoms, clinical information, and demographic details. Patients completed a symptom diary for 14 days. Patients were randomised to one of five management groups: empirical antibiotic treatment; empirical delayed antibiotics; antibiotic targeted by symptom score; antibiotic according to dipstick algorithm (nitrites or leucocytes and a trace of blood); or midstream urine analysis with symptomatic treatment until culture and sensitivity results were available and then antibiotics targeted accordingly. Full details of this trial are given elsewhere.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^12109d25]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Evidence base and diagnostic performance for urinalysis components: Searches included January 2003 through recent search dates of February 6, 2015 and March 13, 2015, identifying four hundred ninety-two articles; one hundred nine were selected for further review, with 10 studies included for this critical question, consisting of 2 Class II and 8 Class III studies including infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years. In a subset of the Pediatric Research in Office Settings febrile infant study of 38,066 infants aged 0 to 3 months with a fever (≥ 38°C [100.4°F]), urinary tract infection was defined as pure growth of a single pathogen with ≥ 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for bag samples and ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL for catheterization samples; of the 1,482 infants who had urinalysis and urine cultures, 1,384 specimens were bag or catheterization, and for all specimens nitrites had better specificity (99% nitrites versus 91% leukocyte esterase).

### Accuracy of leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests for diagnosing bacteriuria in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b947645f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine dipsticks are commonly used for the diagnosis of bacteriuria and/or urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Objectives

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of positive leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite results from dipsticks (index test) for diagnosing bacteriuria in older individuals, using urine culture as the reference standard.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (Pubmed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from the inception date up to April 2025. We also searched the reference lists of all the studies identified.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Both prospective observational cohort and case-control diagnostic studies were included. No language restriction was applied.

Participants

Individuals aged 60 or more with or without symptoms of UTI in the community, nursing homes or hospitalised.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool for assessing risk of bias.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

A random-effect meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of leukocyte esterase and/or nitrites for the detection of bacteriuria. PROSPERO identifier: CRD42024561882.

Results

Of 1,933 articles screened, 16 met inclusion criteria and had moderate risk of bias. Ten studies were hospital-based; six were in nursing homes. Pooled urine dipstick sensitivity and specificity for bacteriuria were 90% (95% CI, 84–94%), and 56% (43–68%), respectively (diagnostic odds ratio [DOR] 11.4; 10.4–12.7). In symptomatic older adults, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting UTI were 92% (76–97%) and 39% (19–62%), respectively, with a DOR of 7.3 (5.2–10.3).

Discussion

A positive dipstick result is inconclusive and does not confirm bacteriuria or UTI in symptomatic older adults. Due to high asymptomatic bacteriuria prevalence in older individuals, bacteriuria alone lacks diagnostic value. These findings support discontinuing dipstick testing for UTI diagnosis in this population.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^0385bc4c]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urine dipstick tests (nitrite and leukocyte esterase) — Dipstick assays detect leukocyte esterase (LE) and urinary nitrite, and bacterial conversion of dietary nitrates to nitrites requires approximately 4 hours in the bladder; because infants void frequently, a nitrite test is not sensitive and negative results have little value in ruling out urinary tract infection (UTI), although a positive nitrite is highly specific. In clinically suspected UTI, LE sensitivity is 94%, with overall reported sensitivity 83% and specificity average 72% (range: 64%–92%); positive LE results should be interpreted with caution because false-positive results are common and pyuria is nonspecific.

### Treatment for positive urine cultures in hospitalized adults: a survey of prevalence and risk factors in 3 medical centers [^8c2068c9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is prevalent but often contrary to published guidelines.

Objective

To evaluate risk factors for treatment of ASB.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting

A tertiary academic hospital, county hospital, and community hospital.

Patients

Hospitalized adults with bacteriuria.

Methods

Patients without documented symptoms of urinary tract infection per Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria were classified as ASB. We examined ASB treatment risk factors as well as broad-spectrum antibiotic usage and quantified diagnostic concordance between IDSA and National Healthcare Safety Network criteria.

Results

Among 300 patients with bacteriuria, ASB was present in 71% by IDSA criteria. By National Healthcare Safety Network criteria, 71% of patients had ASB; within-patient diagnostic concordance with IDSA was moderate (kappa, 0.52). After excluding those given antibiotics for nonurinary indications, antibiotics were given to 38% (62/164) with ASB. Factors significantly associated with ASB treatment were elevated urine white cell count (65 vs 24 white blood cells per high-powered field, P < .01), hospital identity (hospital C vs A, odds ratio, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.14–0.80], P = 0.01), presence of leukocyte esterase (5.48 [2.35–12.79], P < .01), presence of nitrites (2.45 [1.11–5.41], P = 0.03), and Escherichia coli on culture (2.4 [1.2–4.7], P = 0.01). Of patients treated for ASB, broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in 84%.

Conclusions

ASB treatment was prevalent across settings and contributed to broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Associating abnormal urinalysis results with the need for antibiotic treatment regardless of symptoms may drive unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^209ebfdf]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — diagnostic thresholds and pyuria: For urine obtained by catheterization, 50 000 cfu/ml was proposed as the appropriate threshold; lower colony counts are sufficient if obtained by SPA, and most (80%) cases of UTI documented with urine obtained by SPA have 10⁵ cfu/ mL or more. Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm3 on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^df2ee782]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Urinary tract infections are commonly overdiagnosed. To minimize overdiagnosis, some laboratories utilize reflex algorithms that use urinalyses as preliminary screening before potentially proceeding to urine culture. However, the optimal urinalysis cutoffs for this diagnostic stewardship intervention remain poorly defined.

Methods:

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis from 2/1/21–1/31/23 in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services healthcare system. We examined patient encounters in which urinalysis was ordered synchronously with urine culture. We categorized urine culture isolates as uropathogens or non-uropathogens. We calculated receiver operating characteristic curves of urinalysis parameters' ability, singularly or in combination, to identify uropathogens.

Results:

Among 80,949 paired urinalysis and urine cultures (17,488 inpatient, 20,716 emergency department, 42,745 outpatient), cultures yielded 35% (n = 28,993) uropathogens, 4% (n = 2960) non-uropathogens, 37% (n = 29,951) contaminants, and 24% (n = 19,045) no growth. Among urinalysis parameters, white blood cells (WBCs) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.722, [95% CI 0.718–0.725]), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.700, [95% CI 0.690–0.701]), bacteria (AUC = 0.673, [95% CI 0.670–0.677]), nitrite (AUC = 0.627, [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), and squamous epithelial cells (AUC = 0.530, [95% CI 0.526–0.534]). WBC AUC values were consistent across healthcare settings (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient). The urinalysis parameter combination with the highest AUC, WBC plus bacteria, performed worse than WBCs alone (AUC = 0.711 vs. AUC = 0.722, p = 0.001).

Conclusion:

WBC on microscopic urinalysis demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting uropathogens in urine cultures. Stewardship programs should consider prioritizing urinalysis WBC count as the screening tool to optimize urine culture utilization.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^72221365]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading reason why patients seek treatment in primary care. One in three women will be treated with antibiotics for UTI by the age of 24 and 40% to 50% of women will experience one or more UTIs in their lifetime, with 10–15% experiencing recurrent infections. A UTI is commonly identified among young adolescents attending sexual health centres and accounts for 17% of treatment cases. In the adult population of 65 years and older, a UTI is the second most common cause of infectious disease related to hospitalisations in the USA. A UTI is a debilitating condition causing the onset of painful urination (dysuria), increased urinary frequency, the inability to start urinating (hesitancy) and the sensation of a sudden need to urinate (urgency), all of which are classified as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Many clinical guidelines advocate urinary dipstick testing for leucocyte esterase and nitrite as a means of detecting UTI, but evidence suggests that their utility might be limited. Dipstick analyses are surrogate tests, referenced not to microscopic pyuria but to a gold standard urine culture threshold for UTI, which guidelines accept as being between 10 3 cfu mL −1 and 10 6 cfu mL −1 of the pure growth of a single urinary pathogen. This test has attracted criticism too. Furthermore, the literature shows that the methods of sample collection for urine culture have never been validated in appropriate clinical trials. Justification for the use of such methods is based on plausible assumptions without supporting evidence. It is now recognised that routine urinalyses, including dipstick and culture, are insensitive, thus missing genuine infection in many symptomatic patients.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^a36cc64a]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results by healthcare settings

The AUC for urinalysis WBC as a predictor for uropathogen prediction was consistent across settings, (P > 0.05 for all comparisons, Supplemental Table): 0.720 [95% CI 0.715–0.725] in the outpatient setting, 0.727 [95% CI 0.714–0.730] in the emergency department, and 0.722 [95% CI 0.714–0.730] in the inpatient setting (Table 3). Additional results of other urinalysis parameters are summarized in Table 3.

The diagnostic accuracy of combined macroscopic urinalysis parameters stratified by healthcare setting is presented in Table 3. The AUC of combining a positive leukocyte esterase result with nitrite test of any result as a predictor of detecting a uropathogen was 0.681 [95% CI 0.676–0.690] in the outpatient setting, 0.701 [95% CI 0.694–0.708] in the emergency department, and 0.719 [95% CI 0.711–0.727] in the inpatient setting. These AUC values were lower than the values obtained from combining WBC results with any bacteria result, which were 0.720 [95% CI 0.715–0.725], 0.727 [95% CI 0.719–0.733], and 0.722 [95% CI 0.714–0.729] for the outpatient setting (p < 0.001), emergency department (p < 0.001), and inpatient setting (p = 0.60), respectively.

Results by age group

Stratifying our pediatric population into different age categories showed that WBCs as a predictor of detecting a uropathogen had the highest AUC expect the very young (3 months–2 years), in which leukocyte esterase performed best (AUC = 0.739 [95% CI 0.693–0.786], Supplemental Table). Full age stratified results are similar to the overall population and outlined in Supplemental Tablesand.

### Improving urinary tract infection diagnostics in oncology: reliability of reflex urine culture in immunosuppressed neutropenic and non-neutropenic cancer patients [^7fac21e8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are prone to overdiagnosis, and reflex urine culture protocols offer a valuable opportunity for diagnostic stewardship in this arena. However, there is no recommended standard testing approach. Patients with cancer are often excluded from reflex urine culture protocols, especially if they are severely immunosuppressed or neutropenic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of urine screening studies, including dipstick urinalysis for nitrite and leukocyte esterase and urine microscopy for white blood cell count, to detect significant pathogen growth.

Methods

A retrospective study of 58 098 urine cultures with a paired dipstick urinalysis with or without urine microscopy was performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, evaluating data from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. A dipstick urinalysis was considered negative only if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were undetected.

Results

A negative dipstick urinalysis had a negative predictive value of 98% for clinically significant bacteriuria in voided urine and 95% for catheterized urine. Notably, a negative urine dipstick test screen maintained a high negative predictive value among patients with neutropenia and in those with antibiotic exposure before testing. Finally, the presence of pyuria ≥ 10 white blood cells per high-power field on urine microscopy offered negligible incremental diagnostic benefit in samples with a negative dipstick urinalysis.

Conclusions

Reflex urine culture protocols contingent upon a screening dipstick urinalysis are a safe and effective platform for diagnostic stewardship in patients with cancer including those with neutropenia.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^86fc09b2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients — bag versus catheter urine and white blood cell thresholds are reported as follows: Leukocyte esterase had higher sensitivity (84% leukocyte esterase versus 39% nitrites), and leukocyte esterase specificity was lower in bag urine (84%) than catheterization urine (94%). Urine white blood cells per high-power field (WBC/hpf) showed graded likelihood ratios (LRs): LR = 19 for WBC count greater than 20/hpf, LR = 18.2 for 11 to 20 WBCs/hpf, LR = 2.8 for 6 to 10 WBCs/hpf, LR = 1 for 3 to 5 WBCs/hpf, and LR = 0.3 for 0 to 2 WBCs/hpf. Relative risk of an ambiguous culture was higher for bag specimens at 2.7 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.5), with absolute risks 7.4% in bag urine versus 2.7% with catheterization; 21 cultures (95% CI 13 to 53) by catheterization would be required to avoid 1 ambiguous bag culture. With a 5% prevalence and bagged urine specificity of 70%, the positive predictive value of a bag culture is 15% and 85% of positives would be false; a positive bagged urinalysis result should prompt a urine culture obtained by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^c3e937dd]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies as containing relevant and suitable information and 23 of these, which used a cut-off of 108 colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis. The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies, showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

RESULTS

Search Results and Study Details

A total of 1391 citations were retrieved by our search, including 15 duplicates removed prior to screening. Of these, 65 full-text studies were eligible for inclusion following title and abstract review and 5 randomized clinical trials were included (Fig. 1). Interrater agreement for study inclusion was excellent at 0.97. Four studies were conducted in Europe, and one was conducted in Pakistan.

Fig. 1
Flow diagram of study selection.

Characteristics of Included Patients

Four studies, included adult women over the age of 18 while one studyincluded women over the age of 15. Upper age limits ranged from 50 to 70 years, with one studyhaving no upper age limit (Table 1). UTIs were generally defined as a constellation of typical symptoms (i.e. dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic/lower abdominal pain). One studyincluded individuals with self-diagnosed symptomatic cystitis if they had urine dipstick results positive for nitrites, leukocyte esterase, or both. Four studies, excluded patients with upper UTI signs (i.e. fever and back pain), pregnancy, diabetes, prior urological interventions, immunosuppressive states, urinary catheterization, recent UTI, current antibiotic or NSAID use, or contraindications to study drugs. Four studies, included baseline urine culture results at the time of inclusion, though culture results were not used as eligibility criteria (Table 1). The share of patients with positive urine cultures at the time of inclusion ranged from 67 to 86% in the NSAID groups and 64 to 80% in the antibiotic groups (Table 1).

### Towards individualised treatment of urinary tract infections [^84b6d971]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Nitrite measurement is related to bacterial activity and is therefore a bacteria-specific biomarker. Maximum reported nitrite levels in UTI patients are 548 µM, and 7.8 µM in non-UTI patients. Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, which is responsible for most UTIs, use dietary nitrate as a secondary electron acceptor in oxygen-depleted urine and convert it to nitrite. Limitations for nitrites use as an indicator of UTI include that nitrate to nitrite conversion can take up to 30 h to reach saturation, and not all bacteria that cause UTIs, such as Enterococcus species and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, exhibit nitrate-reducing activity. Nitrite production over time in in-vitro broth culture of Escherichia coli and other bacteria has been explored, but has not been assessed in patient samples.

Leucocyte esterase is an enzyme produced by neutrophils recruited during infection and is used as an indicator of urinary tract inflammation. Leucocyte esterase can potentially indicate host response during UTI. The diagnostic value of nitrite and leucocyte varies between studies, which is believed to be due to different patient populations with varying pretest probabilities of a UTI. Precise, sequential leucocyte esterase levels during antibiotic therapy in UTI can be used to predict antimicrobial outcome, and should be explored in combination with bacteria-specific biomarkers such as nitrite. LE levels in UTI patients are reported up to 500 U/L.

Xanthine Oxidase (XO) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) have recently attracted attention as biomarkers exhibiting promising diagnostic properties for UTI. XO is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and uric acid. The origin of elevated XO during UTI is unclear but is likely a host-specific inflammation marker with mean levels of 10,820 U/L in UTI patients compared to 105 U/L in the urine of patients without UTI. MPO is a host-specific biomarker with mean level of 1026 U/L observed in UTI samples compared to 414 U/L in non-UTI samples.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^33829b7b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### Preoperative positive urine nitrite and albumin-globulin ratio are independent risk factors for predicting postoperative fever after retrograde intrarenal surgery based on a retrospective cohort [^de53639d]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

URS including RIRS has become the most performed surgery in ureteral and kidney stone disease therapy. Though the postoperative infectious complications rate is rare, they are potentially serious especially the occurrence of urosepsis. However, despite the risk factors reported by several studies, the question of predicting POF was not fully answered. At present, a single dose of antimicrobial prophylaxis 1 hour before surgery is recommended by AUA best practice statement. However, the extended prophylaxis and adjusted postoperative use of antibiotics can be recommended for those individuals who are at high risk of POF. Thus, we tried to demonstrate independent risk factors for the POF and developed a nomogram. The probability derived from the nomogram could help identify high-risk patients.

The most significant predictor from our study was preoperative positive urine nitrite. Besides, to our knowledge, this was the first study reporting that preoperative positive urine nitrite was an independent risk factor for POF after URS, RIRS or PCNL. Nitrite is not normally present in urine unless uropathogens metabolite urinary nitrate. It can be detected if there are recordable and stable concentrations produced by bacteria incubated in the urine. A meta-analysis showed that positive nitrite can indicate urinary tract infection (UTI) with a probability of 99% in children of any age. Similar high sensitivity was also reported in the studies enrolling elderly patients. More importantly, canceling urine cultures in negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite patients could reduce urine cultures by 40% and decreased inappropriate antibiotic use without compromise safety. Also, in the elder hospitalized patients, the diagnosis of a UTI through the presence of bacteriuria in urine culture should be treated with caution because the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is so high (15–35% in men and 25 to 50% in women). Therefore, urine nitrite might play a pivotal role in UTI. Unlike urinary culture, urine routine test containing nitrite index is standard practice before RIRS in our center and can obtain results quickly. Demonstrating this risk factor (preoperative positive urine nitrite) can help to decide whether to use antibiotics before the outcome of urine culture. Besides, it can also help to understand if it is necessary to undertake urine culture among patients with preoperative negative urine nitrite. Of course, this requires prospective randomized control trials (RCTs) to further explored.

### Guidance statement for the management of febrile neutropenia in pediatric patients receiving cancer-directed therapy in central America and the caribbean [^6c144116]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The panel RECOMMENDS obtaining peripheral blood cultures in addition to blood cultures from central lines at the time of the episode of pediatric febrile neutropenia (Quality of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong).

Nine studies (10,958 cultures), none of which were performed in an LMIC, addressed this issue. - The pooled proportion of additional positive patients identified on peripheral blood cultures was 14% (95% CI, 11% to 18%). The heterogeneity among the included studies was high (I 2, 65%; Data Supplement). Although some studies reported the number of patients testing positive with both peripheral and central line cultures, only 2 focused on concordance or the occurrence of false negatives, which is required for completeness of evidence.

Panel deliberations.

Obtaining both central and peripheral blood cultures may differentiate infection from contamination and primary bacteremia from catheter-related bloodstream infection through differential time to positivity between automated blood cultures. These distinctions affect treatment decisions, including antibiotic administration and catheter removal. The panel cannot recommend obtaining cultures from all lumens of all catheters based on available evidence because the studies reviewed did not specify the number of cultured lumens. Additionally, this practice may be prohibitively expensive in resource-limited settings.

2. The panel RECOMMENDS routinely obtaining urinalysis and urine cultures for pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia (Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).

Eight studies addressed this issue,: 2 performed in 84 pediatric oncology patients with febrile neutropenia (112 specimens) and 6 performed in 2,506 pediatric patients (2,705 specimens). Only 1 study was performed in an LMIC. The study that included asymptomatic patients with cancer reported the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of urinalysis as 40%, 94%, and 94%, respectively, and the corresponding values for urine culture as undefined, 100%, and 91%, respectively. The 6 studies in pediatric patients focused on the diagnostic performance of leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite for diagnosing urinary tract infections (Data Supplement).

### Role of dipstick testing in the evaluation of urinary tract infection in nursing home residents [^7227ea05]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Among 101 nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), we determined the negative predictive value of dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase and nitrite to be 100% (95% confidence interval, 74%-100%), compared with laboratory evidence of UTI (greater than 10 white blood cells/mm(3) on urinalysis and greater than 100,000 colony forming units/mL on urine culture). Nursing home dipstick testing effectively excluded the possibility of UTI.

### Antibiotic prescription practice for pediatric urinary tract infection in a tertiary center [^57142e64]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Prescribing antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is common practice and may lead to unnecessary antibiotic exposure. We aimed to review UTI diagnosis and management in the emergency department and to identify targets for antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

Single-center, retrospective cohort study of children aged 12 weeks to younger than 18 years discharged from the emergency department with a diagnosis of UTI between October and December 2016. Children with genitourinary malformations were excluded. Clinical information, urine collection method, laboratory findings, and urine culture results were gathered. The sensitivity and specificity of nitrite and leukocyte esterase for UTI diagnosis were calculated. The relationship between urinalysis characteristics and confirmed UTI was examined using logistic regression.

Results

A total of 183 children with a median (interquartile range) age of 4.2 (1.1–7.5) years were included; 82.5% were female. Almost all children were discharged home on antibiotics (n = 180, 98%) for a median (interquartile range) duration of 7 (7–10) days. A total of 85 patients (46.4%) received antibiotics despite negative urine cultures leading to 525 unnecessary antibiotic days. The presence of nitrites was the strongest predictor of UTI (odds ratio = 20.22, P < 0.001) and was highly specific.

Conclusions

Current practice in managing suspected pediatric UTIs in our ED resulted in significant and unnecessary antibiotic exposure. We identified targets to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure including improving the diagnostic accuracy of UTIs, a process to discontinue antibiotics for negative cultures and standardizing antimicrobial duration.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalized patients [^ac4093ef]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) with antibiotics is a common factor in inappropriate antibiotic use, but risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of ASB in hospitalized patients are not well defined.

Objective

To evaluate factors associated with treatment of ASB among hospitalized patients and the possible association between treatment and clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, through February 1, 2018, at 46 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. A total of 2733 hospitalized medical patients with ASB, defined as a positive urine culture without any documented signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection, were included in the analysis.

Exposures

One or more antibiotic dose for treatment of ASB.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimators of antibiotic treatment of ASB. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, 30-day emergency department visit, discharge to post-acute care settings, Clostridioides difficile infection (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) at 30 days, and duration of hospitalization after urine testing.

Results

Of 2733 patients with ASB, 2138 were women (78.2%); median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 66–86 years). A total of 2259 patients (82.7%) were treated with antibiotics for a median of 7 days (IQR, 4–9 days). Factors associated with ASB treatment included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.02–1.18), dementia (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15–2.13), acutely altered mental status (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.23–3.04), urinary incontinence (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.36–2.41), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10 000/μL) (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.21–2.00), positive urinalysis (presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrite, or > 5 white blood cells per high-power field) (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.05–3.93), and urine culture with a bacterial colony count greater than 100 000 colony-forming units per high-power field (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.83–2.91). Treatment of ASB was associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing (4 vs 3 days; relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.28–1.47). No other differences in secondary outcomes were identified after propensity weighting.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hospitalized patients with ASB commonly receive inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic treatment did not appear to be associated with improved outcomes; rather, treatment may be associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing. To possibly reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, stewardship efforts should focus on improving urine testing practices and management strategies for elderly patients with altered mental status.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 155: urinary incontinence in women [^e769d3f6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinalysis — urinary incontinence in women: Urinary tract infections should be identified using urinalysis and treated before initiating further investigation or therapeutic intervention for urinary incontinence, and a clean midstream or catheterized urine sample should be obtained for dipstick urinalysis. If suspicious for infection (ie, nitrites, leukocytes, or both are present), a urine culture should be sent and appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy initiated for treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. If microscopic hematuria is present, further upper and lower urinary tract evaluation with cystoscopy and computed tomography is recommended. The American Urological Association defines microscopic hematuria as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on "microscopic examination of urinary sediment and not on a dipstick reading" and "in the absence of an obvious benign cause".

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^bf163e6e]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Symptom control

The upper confidence intervals for the main outcome (frequency symptoms) suggest that alternative strategies are unlikely to result in poor symptom control (around 18% worsening for the midstream urine or delayed groups, and 2% in dipstick and symptom score groups). There was some evidence that if women waited more than 48 hour they reconsulted less but had poorer control of symptoms, particularly for the midstream urine group. The finding of worse symptoms in such patients is in agreement with evidence of the effect of antibiotics from observational studies and trials. Why the delayed group who waited a similar time did not have increased symptoms, however, is unclear. This might be a chance finding, but it might be because women in the midstream urine group find passively waiting for a laboratory result to be more distressing than being given the freedom to choose when to stop the delay according to their symptoms (the empirical delayed group). A previous study treated women negative for nitrite and leucocyte esterase with antibiotics and found symptomatic benefit, but as about a third of women who have negative results for all important dipstick tests (that is, not only nitrite and leucocyte but also blood) still have urinary tract infection based on rigorous laboratory confirmation, the finding of a benefit in women with negative dipstick resultsmight be expected. The poor negative predictive value of dipsticks suggests that the offer of some kind of antibiotic safety net — such as delayed prescribing — to women with negative dipstick results is reasonable.

Antibiotic use

A modest reduction in antibiotic use (20–25%) was achieved in all groups except the symptom score group. While these reductions are probably useful for public health, and the effect might plausibly increase with time as patient expectations change, the magnitude of the effect is in contrast to delayed antibiotic prescription among patients with respiratory infections. This is perhaps not surprising given that few respiratory infections are bacterial whereas most suspected urinary tract infections are (66% of the midstream urine group had confirmed infection, similar to the previous study). There was some evidence that delayed prescribing might reduce reconsultation as we hypothesised, but this was not significant, probably because of the relatively low power of this analysis.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^8fcd3c53]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Febrile infants and young children in emergency departments — dipstick and urinalysis accuracy are reported from multiple Class III studies. In a retrospective review of 375 pediatric ED patients aged 0 to 10 years, urinary tract infection prevalence was 10.7%, urine dipstick sensitivity 92.5% (95% CI 84.3% to 100%) and specificity 39.4% (95% CI 34.2% to 44.6%). In the 0- to 2-year group (160 patients), prevalence was 15%, sensitivity 87.5% (95% CI 74.3% to 100%), and specificity 39.7% (95% CI 31.5% to 47.9%); in the 2- to 10-year group, prevalence was 7.0%, sensitivity 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%), and specificity 39.2% (95% CI 32.4% to 46%). In another study of febrile patients younger than 2 years (mean age 9.3 months) at a United Kingdom pediatric ED, a test positive for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and blood was 97.12% specific (95% CI 94.17% to 98.96%) with a positive LR of 15.13 (95% CI 6.99 to 32.76), and a test negative for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, blood, and protein had a sensitivity of 97.44% (95% CI 91.12% to 99.29%) with a negative LR of 0.10 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39). A multicenter febrile infant study from Spain (N = 649; ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL sterile collection; < 90 days; ≥ 38°C) reported leukocyte esterase mean sensitivity 82.1%, mean specificity 92.4%, mean negative predictive value 97.8% for female patients (N = 176) and 94.1% for male patients (N = 473), and mean positive predictive value 58% for female patients and 79.4% for male patients. Another pediatric ED Class III study of febrile patients younger than 5 years (half the patients were ≤ 12 months) with a urinary tract infection prevalence of 17.6% found, for all patients, sensitivities and negative predictive values respectively: nitrite 20% and 85%, hemoglobin 44% and 88%, leukocyte esterase 48% and 90%, 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 48% and 90%, centrifuge Gram's stain 60% and 92%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%; for infants aged 12 months or younger versus older than 12 months, respective sensitivities were nitrite 7% and 23%, hemoglobin 33% and 53%, leukocyte esterase 42% and 53%; 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 42% and 53%, centrifuge Gram's stain 42% and 76%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%.

Definitions

Fever without source: temperature > 38°C for less than 7 days without any signs or symptoms identifying source of infection.
Early presentation: presentation of febrile children to the emergency department within 48 hours of fever onset.
SBI: presence of bacteraemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.
Bacteraemia: growth of a single bacterial pathogen in blood, excluding growth of bacteria considered a priori as contaminants, for example, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus).
UTI: growth of single urine pathogen with at least 50 000 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL from catheterised urine specimen; or 10 000–50 000 CFUs/mL from a catheterised specimen with positive urinalysis (positive for leucocyte esterase, nitrite or pyuria at > 5 white blood cells; or at least 100 000 CFUs/mL from urine collected via voided specimens).
Pneumonia: lobar consolidation diagnosed on chest radiography confirmed by a paediatric radiologist.
Bacterial meningitis: cerebrospinal fluid leucocytes > 5 cell/µL and positive bacterial culture.
Osteomyelitis: positive bone scintigraphy.
Septic arthritis: positive bacterial culture of synovial fluid.

Risk of bias in individual studies

The validity of each study will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) assessment tool, which provides a structured and standardised way of evaluating the risk of bias and applicability of diagnostic test accuracy research across four domains including patient selection, index test, reference standard and flow and timing. Any disagreements between two researchers will be resolved by a third reviewer or by consensus.

Endourologic procedures and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — For endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma, we recommend screening for and treating ASB prior to surgery (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest obtaining a urine culture prior to the procedure and prescribing targeted antimicrobial therapy rather than empiric therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest a short course (1 or 2 doses) rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

Diagnostic stewardship — urine cultures — Avoid testing in nonspecific clinical syndromes (eg, leukocytosis, isolated fever, fatigue, and fall), do not order based on odor or smell, and educate on prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lack of treatment benefit. For collection, do not collect from catheter bag and only culture urine if pyuria present on urinalysis. For reporting, use selective and cascade reporting to help tailor antibiotic choices and add comments to nudge toward only using antibiotics with true symptoms of UTI.

### Biomarkers for diagnosing serious bacterial infections in older outpatients: a systematic review [^a18cb5ce]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing guidelines

SIGN guidelines for UTI in older adults advise against the use of the urine dipstick as a diagnostic test due to lack of high quality evidence. This advice is echoed by Public Health England guidance, because positive urine dipsticks are often be caused by asymptomatic bacteriuria. The results of our review contradict these recommendations, and suggest that a positive urine dipstick for nitrites and leucocytes is helpful in diagnosing UTI in symptomatic older adults. Further studies in this area are required to corroborate or refute these findings.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^ed5a14d1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm 3 on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

### Should the absence of urinary nitrite influence empiric antibiotics for urinary tract infection in young children? [^7f17592d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Screening for urinary tract infection (UTI) includes urinary nitrite testing by dipstick urinalysis. Gram-negative enteric organisms produce urinary nitrite and represent the most common uropathogens. Enterococcus, a less common uropathogen, does not produce nitrite and has a unique antibiotic resistance pattern. Whether to adjust empiric antibiotics in the absence of urinary nitrite has not been established. Our primary objective was to determine prevalence of enterococcal UTI among young children with a nitrite negative urinalysis.

Methods

A retrospective study of children aged less than 2 years evaluated in the emergency department for possible UTI and had a paired urinalysis and urine culture was performed. Urinary tract infection was defined by catheterized culture yielding greater than or equal to 50,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single uropathogen. Prevalence of uropathogens among nitrite negative samples was studied.

Results

A total of 7599 children were studied. Median (interquartile range) age was 5.6 (2.3–11.2) months, and 57% were female. Prevalence of UTI was 8.1%. Enterococcus was the uropathogen in 2.1% of UTIs, and all cases had negative dipstick nitrite. Among nitrite negative UTIs, 95.6% of uropathogens were gram-negative and only 3.2% (confidence interval, 1.8%-5.3%) were enterococcus. None of the 200 UTIs with positive nitrite yielded enterococcus (upper confidence interval, 1.4%). Among children with positive leukocyte esterase and negative nitrite, only 0.7% of cases had enterococcal UTI.

Conclusions

Only 3% of nitrite negative UTIs were caused by enterococcus. Given the low prevalence of enterococcal UTI, the absence of dipstick nitrite should not affect routine empiric antibiotic choice for presumptive UTI in young children.

### A negative urinalysis rules out catheter-associated urinary tract infection in trauma patients in the intensive care unit [^0017dcd8]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in trauma patients is associated with increased mortality. Whether the urinalysis (UA) is an adequate test for a urinary source of fever in the ICU trauma patient has not been demonstrated. We hypothesized that the UA is a valuable screen for UTI in the febrile, critically ill trauma patient.

Study Design

All trauma ICU patients in our surgical ICU who had a fever (temperature > 38.0°C), urinary catheter, UA, and a urine culture between January 1, 2011 and December 13, 2011 were reviewed. A positive UA was defined as positive leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite, WBC > 10/high power field, or presence of bacteria. A positive urine culture was defined as growth of ≥ 10⁵ colony forming units (cfu) of an organism irrespective of the UA result or ≥ 10³ cfu in the setting of a positive UA. A UTI was defined as positive urine culture without an alternative cause of the fever.

Results

There were 232 UAs from 112 patients that met criteria. The majority (75%) of patients were men; the mean age was 40 (± 16) years. Of the 232 UAs, 90 (38.7%) were positive. There were 14 UTIs. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the UA for UTI were 100%, 65.1%, 15.5%, and 100%, respectively.

Conclusions

A negative UA reliably excludes a catheter-associated UTI in the febrile, trauma ICU patient with a 100% negative predictive value, and it can rapidly direct the clinician toward more likely sources of fever and reduce unnecessary urine cultures.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Further research is needed to establish clear criteria for urine testing in febrile patients. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Effective management of UTI hinges on appropriate diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship, aiming to prevent the misuse of antibiotics for ASB. Symptom-based testing is key to ensure appropriate urine culture testing and proper diagnosis of UTI. 52, 53 A 2017 systematic review54 showed 45% of included patients experienced inappropriate initiation of antimicrobial treatment for ASB; various interventions, such as education on diagnostic protocols, provided a significant absolute risk reduction of 33%. Avoiding overtesting and resulting overtreatment of ASB is essential to preserving antimicrobial effectiveness. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with UTIs.

Empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients should contain antimicrobials that have historically demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs, achieve adequate urinary concentrations, and provide reliable activity against the most common pathogens based on local resistance rates. Presence of risk factors for antimicrobial resistance along with clinical severity also play an important role in the selection of empirical choices. 76, 77, 182 For patients with uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin is a reasonable drug of choice, based on robust evidence of efficacy and its ability to spare use of more systemically active agents for treating other infections. 78 For patients with pyelonephritis, TMP/SMX or a first-generation cephalosporin represent reasonable first-line agents but should be dependent upon local resistance rates.

Based on the totality of the evidence available, we can provide clear recommendations on the optimal durations of treatment for cystitis for the antimicrobial classes listed below: Nitrofurantoin: 5 days108-110 TMP/SMX: 3 days109, 111, 112. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation. Multiple RCTs comprised patients with gram negative bacteremia from predominantly urinary sources demonstrate noninferiority of 7 days compared with 14 total days of treatment for a variety of patient-oriented outcomes, such as clinical cure, clinical failure, relapse, and all-cause mortality. 145–148 Thus, we can provide a clear recommendation for 7 days of treatment for gram negative bacteremia from a urinary source when source control has been addressed. Whether shorter duration.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — urologic procedure recommendations state that in patients who will undergo endoscopic urologic procedures, we suggest that a urine culture be obtained prior to the procedure and targeted antimicrobial therapy prescribed, rather than empiric therapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and in patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest short course (1 or 2 doses), rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), with the remark that antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^607e3612]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths of this study include identification of patients with recurrent UTI through detailed chart review, and stringent definitions of antibiotic outcomes. Limitations include a relatively small sample size. Even though patients in the high SVI group had worse access to care as indicated by highest rate of ever obtaining care in the ED/urgent care, SDOH was not associated with unnecessary antibiotics likely because of the small number of patients in the high SVI group. Additionally, current definitions of recurrent UTI based on culture results or antibiotic prescriptions exclude patients who do not have access to care. We also did not review pharmacist antibiotic prescriptions or measure the dose and type of antibiotics to determine if they were concordant with clinical guidelines. This study was subject to the limitations of the standard urine culture, which may fail to detect bacteria that could cause a symptomatic UTI, thus leading to a false negative result. While we used standard thresholds of a positive urine culture of > 100,000 cfu/ml, this may have reduced the sensitivity of the test and thus may also contribute to a false negative in a patient who is symptomatic. Additionally, while pyuria is a clinically useful benchmark of infection, we acknowledge that microscopy results may have inappropriately reported a negative result due to rapid leukocyte decay in setting of delays from collection to analysis that occur in a real-world setting. Finally, we acknowledge the limitations of the term "asymptomatic bacteriuria" given that emerging studies on urinary microbiome show that bacteriuria should be expected rather than indicative of a disease state. However, this term does have clinical utility given its use in current guidelines as the observed phenomenon of a urine culture that may grow a bacteria of pathogenic potential in the absence of urinary symptoms.

In conclusion, the rate of unnecessary antibiotics is high in older female patients with recurrent UTI. This study provides insight into a variety of clinician and patient-related factors, including inadequate symptom documentation and inappropriate urine testing that contribute to this high rate. Clinical decision support tools and patient education and counseling that address these gaps could promote diagnostic and antibiotic stewardship.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^1bcc970e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Summary

UTI is a common bacterial infection of childhood. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable, and a urine sample is required for diagnosis, but collection is not straightforward in precontinent children. Dipstick leucocyte and nitrite screening can inform initial management while awaiting culture confirmation. Prompt management aims to prevent short-term morbidity such as urosepsis and long-term morbidity such as renal scarring. Recent evidence supports less aggressive imaging following uncomplicated UTI. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing challenge. International guidelines have conflicting recommendations regarding sample collection methods, antibiotic duration and imaging indications. Targeted research is required to inform knowledge gaps and inform cost-effective care for paediatric UTI.

### Machine learning prediction of urine cultures in primary care [^d08b202b]. Annals of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Context: Antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is appropriate only when an infection is present. Urine culture is definitive but takes > 1 day to result. A machine learning urine culture predictor was recently devised for Emergency Department (ED) patients but requires use of urine microscopy ("NeedMicro" predictor), which is not routinely available in primary care (PC). Objective: To adapt this predictor to use only features available in primary care and determine if predictive accuracy generalizes to the primary care setting. We call this the "NoMicro" predictor. Study Design and Analysis: Multicenter, retrospective, observational, cross-sectional analysis. Machine learning predictors were trained using extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural networks, and random forests. Models were trained on the ED dataset and were evaluated on both the ED dataset (internal validation) and the PC dataset (external validation). Setting: United States (US) academic medical centers emergency department and family medicine clinic. Population Studied: 80387 (ED, previously described) and 472 (PC, newly curated) US adults. Instrument: Physicians performed retrospective chart review. The primary outcome extracted was pathogenic urine culture growing ≥ 100,000 colony forming units. Predictor variables included age; gender; dipstick urinalysis nitrites, leukocytes, clarity, glucose, protein, and blood; dysuria; abdominal pain; and history of UTI. Outcome Measures: Predictor overall discriminative performance (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, ROC-AUC), performance statistics (e.g., sensitivity, negative predictive value, etc.), and calibration. Results: The "NoMicro" model performs similarly to the "NeedMicro" model in internal validation on the ED dataset: NoMicro ROC-AUC 0.862 (95% CI: 0.856–0.869) vs. NeedMicro 0.877 (95% CI: 0.871–0.884). External validation on the primary care dataset also yielded high performance (NoMicro ROC-AUC 0.850 [95% CI: 0.808–0.889]), despite being trained on Emergency Department data. Simulation of a hypothetical, retrospective clinical trial suggests the NoMicro model could be used to avoid antibiotic overuse by safely withhold antibiotics in low-risk patients. Conclusions: The hypothesis that the NoMicro predictor generalizes to both PC and ED contexts is supported. Prospective trials to determine the real-world impact of using the NoMicro model to reduce antibiotic overuse are appropriate.

### Lack of clinical utility of urine Gram stain for suspected urinary tract infection in pediatric patients [^92622c3a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections in children. Urine culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis, but the utility of urine Gram stain relative to urinalysis (UA) is unclear. We reviewed 312 pediatric patients with suspected UTI who had urine culture, UA, and urine Gram stain performed from a single urine specimen. UA was considered positive if ≥ 10 leukocytes per oil immersion field were seen or if either nitrates or leukocyte esterase testing was positive. Urine Gram stain was considered positive if any organisms were seen. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated using urine culture as the gold standard. Thirty-seven (12%) patients had a culture-proven UTI. Compared to urine Gram stain, UA had equal sensitivity (97.3% versus 97.5%) and higher specificity (85% versus 74%). Empirical therapy was prescribed before the Gram stain result was known in 40 (49%) patients and after in 42 (51%) patients. The antibiotics chosen did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.81), nor did they differ for patients with Gram-negative rods on urine Gram stain compared to those with Gram-positive cocci (P = 0.67). From these data, we conclude that UA has excellent negative predictive value that is not enhanced by urine Gram stain and that antibiotic selection did not vary based on the urine Gram stain result. In conclusion, the clinical utility of urine Gram stain does not warrant the time or cost it requires.

### Can a simple urinalysis predict the causative agent and the antibiotic sensitivities? [^186e44b3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was (1) to determine the reliability of urinalysis (UA) for predicting urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile children, (2) to determine whether UA findings can predict Escherichia coli versus non-E. coli urinary tract infection, and (3) to determine if empiric antibiotics should be selected based on E. coli versus non-E. coli infection predictions.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of children from 2 months to 2 years of age who presented to the emergency department with fever (rectal temperature > 100.4°F) and had a positive urine culture. This study was conducted between January 2004 and December 2007. Negative UA was defined as urine white blood cell count less than 5 per high-power field, negative leukocyte esterase, and negative nitrites. Urine cultures were classified into E. coli and non-E. coli groups. These groups were compared for sex, race, and UA findings. Multivariate forward logistic regression, using the Wald test, was performed to calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) of each variable (eg, sex, race, UA parameters) in predicting UTI. In addition, antibiotic sensitivities between both groups were compared.

Results

Of 749 medical records reviewed, 608 were included; negative UA(-) was present in 183 cases, and positive UA(+) was observed in 425 cases. Furthermore, 424 cases were caused by E. coli, and 184 were due to non-E. coli organisms. Among 425 UA(+) cases, E. coli was identified in 349 (82.1%), whereas non-E. coli organisms were present in 76 (17.9%); in contrast, in 183 UA(-) cases, 108 (59%) were due to non-E. coli organisms versus 75 (41%), which were caused by E. coli. Urinalysis results were shown to be associated with organism group (P < 0.001). Positive leukocytes esterase had an LR of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–4.2), positive nitrites had an LR of 2.8 (95% CI, 1.4–5.5), and urine white blood cell count had an LR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.4) in predicting E. coli versus non-E. coli infections. Antibiotic sensitivity compared between UA groups demonstrated equivalent superiority of cefazolin (94.7% sensitive in UA(+) vs 84.0% in UA(-) group; P < 0.0001), cefuroxime (98.2% vs 91.7%; P < 0.001), and nitrofurantoin (96.1% vs 82.2%; P < 0.0001) in the UA(+) group. In contrast, the UA(-) group showed significant sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (82.2% vs 71.3% in UA(+); P = 0.008).

Conclusions

Urinalysis is not an accurate predictor of UTI. A positive urine culture in the presence of negative UA most likely grew non-E. coli organisms, whereas most UA(+) results were associated with E. coli. This study also highlighted local patterns of antibiotic resistance between E. coli and non-E. coli groups. Negative UA results in the presence of strong suspicion of a UTI suggest a non-E. coli organism, which may be best treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Conversely, UA(+) results suggest E. coli, which calls for treatment with cefazolin or cefuroxime.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^99949f99]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis — quantitative urine culture thresholds and test utilization specify that the standardized threshold in symptomatic patients is > 100 000 CFU/mL for organisms identified as common pathogens, though many sites now use either 10 000 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL based on the method of collection or patient population as a baseline for culture workup and clinical significance. Laboratories typically provide antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for potential pathogens recovered in significant gram numbers as part of standard laboratory protocol. The Gram stain is not routinely utilized for the diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but it may have limited utility in patients with febrile urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis, prostatitis, urosepsis) where high numbers of gram-negative bacilli may be present in urine screen. Because urine may be readily contaminated with urogenital microbiota, proper specimen collection is essential for urine culture and should be performed using a process that minimizes contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota.

### Increased resistance of gram-negative urinary pathogens after kidney transplantation [^34e097b9]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Local UTI treatment strategy

Enterococcus spp. is frequently detected during the first 12 weeks after kidney transplantation. Therefore empirical UTI treatment differs based on the time of occurrence after transplantation. Patients suffering from UTI symptoms during the first 2 months after transplantation received oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days. After the third month of transplantation, therapy was initiated with oral cefuroxime for 7 days. The antibiotic treatment was adjusted to the microbiological findings. Patients with urosepsis were initially treated with piperacillin/tazobactam and therapy was then adjusted according to the microbiological findings. The local guideline includes treatment of ASB according to results of the urinary culture test results.

Definitions

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) was defined as pathogen detection > 100.000 CFU/ml with presence of leukocytes (> 100/μl) in urine in patients without UTI symptoms. The diagnosis of UTI required the presence of symptoms like dysuria and pollakisuria combined with leucocyturia and/or positive nitrite test.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was performed with Graph Pad Prism V6.0. Chi-square test and fisher exact test were used between groups comparison.

### Utility of dipstick urinalysis in peri-and postmenopausal women with irritative bladder symptoms [^f156a917]. International Urogynecology Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Previous studies of dipstick urinalysis (UA) in asymptomatic peri- and postmenopausal women demonstrate poor sensitivity to detect a urinary tract infection (UTI). We hypothesized that sensitivity of this test would be improved in symptomatic peri- and postmenopausal women.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of 76 women seeking urogynecology care for irritative bladder symptoms. Subjects with a positive clean-catch (CC) dipstick UA for leukocyte esterase (LE) or nitrites (NIT) were offered enrollment. Dipstick UA was performed on CC and catheterized specimens, followed by microbiologic culture. Test characteristics were calculated for CC and catheterized UA. CC culture was compared with catheterized culture (gold standard) using Spearman's correlation coefficient.

Results

Data was available for analysis in 75/76 (98.7%) enrolled subjects. Mean age was 68 ± 11 years. Most subjects were postmenopausal (98.7%) and Caucasian (97.3%). Dipstick sensitivity ranged from 48% to 87% and 35% to 57% in CC and catheterized specimens, respectively. Dipstick UA from a CC specimen positive for NIT had the highest sensitivity (60.9), specificity (100), negative predictive value (85.2), and positive predictive value (100) in this population. Dipstick UA from CC and catheterized specimens had similar sensitivity for detecting UTIs. When culture results of 10³ colony-forming units were considered positive, CC and catheterized specimens were moderately correlated (ρ = 0.470).

Conclusions

Dipstick UA in this study had improved sensitivity compared with previously published results in both CC and catheterized samples. Initiation of empiric antibiotic treatment in women with irritative bladder symptoms and NIT-positive CC dipstick UA prior to obtaining urine culture results is a reasonable option.

### Comparison of test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points [^ec845444]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare the test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points in women presenting to emergency departments and an intermediate care center with symptoms of urinary tract infection.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study of adult women presenting to 1 of 2 community hospital EDs or an intermediate care center with dysuria, urgency, or urinary frequency on history, or suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness on examination. Patients who had taken antibiotics in the past 72 hours, had indwelling Foley catheters, symptomatic vaginal discharge, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, or were unable to provide a reliable history were excluded. The patient's clean-catch or catheterized urine specimen was tested immediately by a nurse using a Multistix 9 SG reagent strip. A second aliquot was sent within 1 hour of collection to the hospital laboratory, where a semiautomated microscopic urinalysis and a urine culture were performed. A positive urine culture was defined as more than 100,000 colonies of 1 or 2 uropathogenic bacteria per mL of urine at 48 hours. Dipstick and urinalysis data were compared with urine culture results. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated at various definitions of a positive test, or "test cutoff points", for combinations of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and blood on dipstick and for RBCs and WBCs on urinalyses. The probability of an erroneous decision to withhold treatment on the basis of a negative test result was defined as "undertreatment", or 1 minus the negative predictive value. "Overtreatment" was defined as 1 minus the positive predictive value.

Results

Three hundred forty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Twelve patients were withdrawn because of missing laboratory results. Forty-six percent (152/331) of patients had positive urine cultures. If urine dipstick results are defined as positive when leukocyte esterase or nitrite is positive or blood is more than trace, the overtreatment rate is 47% (156/331) and the undertreatment rate is 13% (43/331). If urinalysis results are defined as positive when WBCs are more than 3 per high-power field or RBCs are more than 5 per high-power field, the overtreatment rate is 44% (146/331) and the undertreatment rate is 11% (36/331). Matched pairs of test characteristics were identified when the analysis was repeated using more than 10,000 colonies per mL as a positive culture.

Conclusion

In this patient population, similar overtreatment and undertreatment rates were identified for various test cutoff points for urine dipstick tests and urinalysis. Although a urine dipstick may be equivalent to a urinalysis for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection, the limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of both tests should be incorporated into medical decisionmaking.

### Spinal epidural abscess post-ureteroscopy: a case report [^69d7fd4e]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The patient re-presented to the emergency room 2 days after discharge with right flank pain. Urinalysis was leukocyte esterase positive and nitrite negative with > 100 RBCs/hpf, 11–25 leukocytes/hpf, and few bacteria. Reflex culture grew 60,000–100,000 CFU/ml of E. coli; however, she left before receiving treatment. She then presented on POD 9 with nausea and severe, intermittent, right-sided flank pain. Urinalysis was again suspicious for infection and reflex culture grew 10,000–50,000 CFU/ml of E. coli. Imaging included an abdominal x-ray that confirmed appropriate stent positioning and a CT abdomen pelvis which demonstrated absent hydronephrosis with small non-obstructing calculi in the left collecting system. She then presented to urology clinic for ureteral stent removal 3 weeks post-surgery. Urine dip at time of removal was not concerning for infection and she was given a dose of nitrofurantoin prior to cystoscopic stent removal. Over the next few weeks, the patient visited an outside ED and was admitted to an outside hospital for 5 days for left flank and back pain. At this time, she reportedly had no evidence of infection. CT Urogram revealed multiple nonobstructing stones in the left renal pelvis and a single nonobstructing stone in the distal left ureter. Patient stay was lengthened due to an incidental vascular finding on the CT Urogram but was discharged after passing several stones and achieving adequate pain control.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^8cf18104]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Acute cystitis in pregnancy — clinicians should treat acute cystitis in pregnant individuals with a 5–7-day course of a targeted antibiotic, and if empiric therapy is started before culture and sensitivity results are available, amoxicillin or ampicillin regimens should be avoided due to high rates of resistance in E coli to these antibiotics in most areas. Antibiotic treatment may be initiated for symptomatic relief in the presence of a positive urinalysis result, and in situations in which urine specimens cannot feasibly be collected, empiric treatment may be considered in the presence of new-onset dysuria and frequency. Ideally, a urine culture should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and allow tailoring of antibiotic therapy by sensitivities; the threshold colony count to confirm UTI is 100,000 (10⁵) CFU/mL, though in the presence of symptoms some authors suggest that treatment for colony counts as low as 100 (10²) of a single organism may be appropriate. Choice of antibiotic treatment is dependent not only on culture results but also susceptibility and safety profiles and includes nitrofurantoin, β-lactams, sulfonamides, and fosfomycin.

### An implementation guide to reducing overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^b741b1c9]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on asymptomatic bacteriuria:

- **Definition**: ASB is defined as the presence of bacteria in an uncontamined urine sample at a microbial load of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL, without any associated signs or symptoms of UTI.
- **Pathophysiology**: ASB is most frequently caused by E. coli, followed by P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus species, S. aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of ASB is 1–2% in healthy men, 1–9% in healthy women, 2–15% in pregnant women, 1–30% in diabetic adults, 2–50% in community-dwelling adults, 14–75% in institutionalized adults, and 9–100% in patients with indwelling catheters.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ASB include female sex, advancing age, the use of indwelling catheters, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, glucosuria, a history of UTIs, prostatic obstruction, neurological disorders, inadequate peri-anal hygiene, insufficient fluid intake, and overactive bladder syndrome.
- **Disease course**: In patients with ASB, symptoms of UTI are absent for a variety of reasons, including attenuated host immune response, as well as reduced microbial virulence, growth rates, and cell densities.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Treatment of ASB should be avoided in low-risk populations given the absence of demonstrated benefit, potential for adverse drug reactions, and risk of promoting antibiotic-resistance. Select patients who may derive benefit from treatment include pregnant women and patients undergoing certain invasive procedures.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^cceb5891]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### Urinary tract infections in older women: a clinical review [^7ba03373]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older women are commonly encountered in outpatient practice.

Objective

To review management of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI and review prevention of recurrent UTIs in older community-dwelling women.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) for English-language human studies conducted among adults aged 65 years and older and published in peer-reviewed journals from 1946 to November 20, 2013.

Results

The clinical spectrum of UTIs ranges from asymptomatic bacteriuria, to symptomatic and recurrent UTIs, to sepsis associated with UTI requiring hospitalization. Recent evidence helps differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is transient in older women, often resolves without any treatment, and is not associated with morbidity or mortality. The diagnosis of symptomatic UTI is made when a patient has both clinical features and laboratory evidence of a urinary infection. Absent other causes, patients presenting with any 2 of the following meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for symptomatic UTI: fever, worsened urinary urgency or frequency, acute dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness. A positive urine culture (≥ 105 CFU/mL) with no more than 2 uropathogens and pyuria confirms the diagnosis of UTI. Risk factors for recurrent symptomatic UTI include diabetes, functional disability, recent sexual intercourse, prior history of urogynecologic surgery, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence. Testing for UTI is easily performed in the clinic using dipstick tests. When there is a low pretest probability of UTI, a negative dipstick result for leukocyte esterase and nitrites excludes infection. Antibiotics are selected by identifying the uropathogen, knowing local resistance rates, and considering adverse effect profiles. Chronic suppressive antibiotics for 6 to 12 months and vaginal estrogen therapy effectively reduce symptomatic UTI episodes and should be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Establishing a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI in older women requires careful clinical evaluation with possible laboratory assessment using urinalysis and urine culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be differentiated from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older women should not be treated.

### Impact of laboratory-reported urine culture colony counts on the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection for hospitalized patients [^c9bb364d]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Reducing health care-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a National Patient Safety Goal. The purpose of this investigation was to establish a colony count threshold to predict clinically significant UTIs that develop in hospitalized patients. A total of 185 cases were reviewed sequentially by 2 physicians. The information extracted included subjective complaints, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, clinical signs and symptoms, WBC count, urinalysis, and urine culture results. The first reviewer recorded whether the patient was diagnosed and treated for a UTI by the clinician. The second reviewer determined if the patient met National Healthcare Safety Network guidelines for nosocomial UTI. Compared with patients with colony counts less than 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), patients with colony counts 100,000 CFU/mL or more were 73.86 times more likely to have a clinically significant UTI (odds ratio, 73.86; 95% confidence interval, 24.23 ∼ 225.15; P < .0001; c-statistic, 0.859). Reporting positive results only for patients with 100,000 CFU/mL or more would have reduced the number of positive cultures by 38%. These data suggest that reporting colony counts less than 100,000 CFU/mL encourages treatment of non-clinically significant UTIs in hospitalized patients, causing inappropriate antibiotic use.

### Urinary tract infection in outpatient febrile infants younger than 30 days of age: a 10-year evaluation [^c351a8e0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the prevalence of outpatient-diagnosed urinary tract infection (UTI) in consecutive febrile neonates ≤ 30 days of age and correlate demographic, laboratory and radiographic imaging results with infectious etiology.

Methods

Review of medical records of consecutive febrile infants ≤ 30 days of age presenting to an urban pediatric emergency department during a 10-year period, whose policy is to perform a sepsis evaluation (urine culture obtained by bladder catheterization) and hospitalize for parenteral antibiotic therapy pending culture results.

Results

Of 670 febrile neonates ≤ 30 days of age evaluated for sepsis, urine culture was obtained in 651 cases (97%). Of 100 patients with UTI (15.4%), 73% were male; the most common uropathogens were Escherichia coli (71%), Enterococcus (10%) and Klebsiella sp. (10%). In all, 39% had a maximum documented fever ≥ 102 °F, and 40% had CBC total white blood cells count ≥ 15,000/mm(3). Urine dipstick test was positive for leukocyte esterase or nitrite in 79%. Renal ultrasound performed in 95 patients (95%) showed anatomic abnormalities in 47%; 5/26 (24%) with hydronephrosis had vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystourethrogram. Four patients had urosepsis; none had bacterial meningitis and no patients died.

Conclusions

UTI affects approximately 1 in 6 febrile neonates ≤ 30 days of age. Males are affected 2.5-times greater than females. E. coli continues to be the predominant uropathogen. Clinical parameters like height of fever, CBC total white blood cell count and urine dipstick test lack sensitivity in identifying UTI risk in the outpatient setting. Only 4 infants had urosepsis (4%). Nearly half of neonates with UTI have a radiographically identified anatomic abnormality. All febrile young infants should receive performance of a urine culture; those with UTI require imaging.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^d79f0302]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care.

Participants

309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention

Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main Outcome Measures

Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results

Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^17a14cde]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We combined the nitrite and leukocyte esterase dipstick test results because studies showed that the urine dipstick test seems most useful in all populations, including older adults, to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte esterase are negative.

In the absence of formal cut-off values for CRP, we used the most common cut-offs, i.e. < 5 mg/L (normal range) and ≥ 5 mg/L (elevated values). In real life practice, general practitioners are most likely to apply these cut-offs that are also stated in the manufacturer's instructions. NH staff could report the CRP test result to the resident's general practitioner, but we do not know whether this was always done and if this influenced UTI management.

One study found that a serum CRP cut-off value of 60 mg/L was the best predictor for early detection of bacterial infections, including UTIs, in an older hospitalised population. The mean CRP value in their non-infection control group was however 21.3 mg/L, suggesting that ageing and frailty can increase serum inflammation protein levels. In our study, we did not explore CRP levels in residents without UTI suspicions.

We identified one similar study that explored the sensitivity of POCT CRP and procalcitonin to diagnose UTIs in Dutch NH residents. They used the same POCT device, but applied a more stringent definition of a confirmed ('true') UTI, namely a positive urine leucocyte esterase test and symptom resolution in the course of adequate antibiotic treatment (i.e. proven susceptibility of isolated uropathogens to the administered antibiotic) in addition to the presence of at least two urinary or non-specific symptoms. They registered 266 episodes of suspected UTIs (out of the targeted 440 episodes), and 19.8% of these met their definition of a 'true' UTI, a percentage slightly higher than ours (11.7%). With an empirically estimated cut-off of 6.5 mg/L, their sensitivity (57.2%, 95% CI: 48.9–65.4%) and specificity (54.4%, 95% CI: 51.8–57.0%) of POCT CRP were similar to ours (60.0% and 50.9%, respectively). Signs/symptoms triggering UTI suspicion were not reported.

### Dropping the urine culture: sustained CAUTI reduction using a UTI order panel [^be5aa4c3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intervention

In the pre-panel period, urinalysis with reflex microscopy (microscopy performed if leukocyte esterase or nitrites were detected) and a separate UC order were available without restriction or clinical decision support (CDS). UC could be ordered without other urine studies. No reflex UC were performed during this period. In late 2014 and early 2015, a multifaceted CAUTI prevention effort was implemented including required nursing competencies for catheter insertion and maintenance, required indication documentation at catheter insertion, in-depth review of all CAUTI with unit feedback, education on appropriate catheter use and timing of removal, and nurse-driven protocols for catheter maintenance and removal (see Supplemental Material for additional activities). As part of this initiative in April 2015, we removed the ability to order inpatient UC replacing this order with a UTI order panel within our electronic health record (Figure 1). Changes were restricted to the inpatient setting (Emergency Department (ED) and outpatient excluded). An inpatient UC was available only via the UTI panel, and responses were not clinically validated. The panel included an order for urinalysis with reflex microscopy followed by possible UC if specified criteria were met. It required documentation of UTI symptoms and criteria justifying potential UC performance in the absence of symptoms or pyuria. Documentation of the presence of certain conditions resulted in a UC even if no symptoms or urine abnormalities were present (neutropenia, kidney/pancreas transplant, pregnancy, impending urologic surgery, age < 3 years, and other with required documentation of the specified condition). When one of these criteria was documented, a UC was always performed regardless of urinalysis findings. Patients who did not have these criteria documented were evaluated for symptom documentation, including typical and atypical symptoms (Figure 2). If no symptoms were documented, a UC was not performed. If any symptom was documented, urinalysis data were evaluated including the number of squamous cells and pyuria. UC performance was based on the following criteria: ≥ 100 squamous cells/lpf, any number of WBC = no UC as likely contaminated (message to clinicians recommending new specimen); < 100 squamous cells/lpf and ≤ 10 WBC/hpf = no UC as UTI ruled out by lack of pyuria; and < 100 squamous cells/lpf and > 10 WBC/hpf = UC performed (Figure 2). When a UC was not performed, clinicians could request an override by paging an ID physician to discuss the indication for the culture.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^42b7577a]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Performance of urine dipstick

We collected the results of a total of 417 urine dipsticks (91.4%) performed in the emergency department, including 66 for the UTI group (95.6%) and 351 for the control group (90.7%). Urine dipsticks were considered negative if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were negative (AUC = 0.7405 [0.706–0.775]) and positive otherwise (Table S5). Sensitivity of urine dipstick for UTI (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) was lower than the sensitivity of UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (98.48% [91.90–99.79]) (p < 0.01) but similar to the sensitivity of the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) (p < 0.99). However, specificity was higher for both the UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (67.81% [62.75–72.48]) and the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (70.66% [65.69–75.17]) compared to the specificity of the urine dipstick (57.83% [52.61–62.89]) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The LR- was < 0.1 for all test methods. Urine dipstick in patients with at least one major symptom had a sensitivity of 91.43% [77.62–97.04], a specificity of 73.08% [53.92–86.30], a LR- of 0.117 [0.059–0.234] and a LR + of 3.396 [2.55–4.42].

### Antimicrobial resistance in urinary pathogens among Swedish nursing home residents remains low: a cross-sectional study comparing antimicrobial resistance from 2003 to 2012 [^d69e295a]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Study protocol

In addition to collecting the urine sample, the attending nurse made an entry in the study protocol, once for each included resident, whether having ongoing or previous antibiotic treatment within the last month or diabetes mellitus. In 2012, the attending nurse also registered overnight admissions to hospital, any antibiotic treatment during the last six months, and an eventual diagnosis of dementia.

Laboratory tests

The personnel at the nursing homes were instructed to collect a mid-stream morning sample, or a voided urine specimen with so long a bladder incubation time as possible. Dipstick urinalysis was carried out at the nursing home. The microbiology laboratory was provided information on the outcome of the dipstick urinalysis as well as information on any UTI symptoms from the attending nurse. The urine specimens were cultured at the microbiology laboratory in Borås according to clinical routine procedure. The urine samples were chilled before transport and usually arrived at the laboratory within 24 hours.

The laboratory fractionated 10 μl urine on a cystine-lactose-electrolyte deficient agar (CLED) and a Columbia blood agar. Plates were incubated overnight (minimum 15 h) at 35–37°C. CLED plates were incubated in air and Columbia plates were incubated in 5% CO 2. The latter was further incubated for 24 hours if no growth occurred after the first incubation. Growth of bacteria was considered significant if the number of colony-forming units (CFU)/mL was ≥ 10 5. However, at signs of possible UTI such as a positive nitrite dipstick, leukocyte esterase dipstick > 1, fever, frequency, urgency or dysuria, the cut-off point was ≥ 10 3 for patients with a growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and male patients with Klebsiella species (spp) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis). For symptomatic women harbouring the two latter species the cut-off level was set at ≥ 10 4. At these lower cut-off points and with no symptoms or signs of possible UTI, the urine cultures were classified as sparse growth. For the purpose of this study, both significant and sparse growth were defined as a positive urine culture. In case of several detected species, E. coli was selected in favour of secondary pathogens such as Klebsiella spp. and in case of several E. coli, the most prevalent isolate was selected. Growth of mixed flora was classified as a negative urine culture.

### Lomefloxacin hydrochloride (Maxaquin) [^794bf649]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment

Maxaquin (lomefloxacin HCl) film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below: (See Dosage and Administration for specific dosing recommendations.)

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT

Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis.

NOTE: MAXAQUIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR THE EMPIRIC TREATMENT OF ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT S PNEUMONIAE IS A CAUSATIVE PATHOGEN. S PNEUMONIAE EXHIBITS IN VITRO RESISTANCE TO LOMEFLOXACIN, AND THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF LOMEFLOXACIN IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS CAUSED BY S PNEUMONIAE HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. IF LOMEFLOXACIN IS TO BE PRESCRIBED FOR GRAM–STAIN–GUIDED EMPIRIC THERAPY OF ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS, IT SHOULD BE USED ONLY IF SPUTUM GRAM STAIN DEMONSTRATES AN ADEQUATE QUALITY OF SPECIMEN (> 25 PMNs/LPF) AND THERE IS BOTH A PREDOMINANCE OF GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS AND NOT A PREDOMINANCE OF GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS.

URINARY TRACT

Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and CLINICAL STUDIES — UNCOMPLICATED CYSTITIS .)

Complicated Urinary Tract Infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter diversus, or Enterobacter cloacae.

NOTE: In clinical trials with patients experiencing complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to P aeruginosa, 12 of 16 patients had the microorganism eradicated from the urine after therapy with lomefloxacin. None of the patients had concomitant bacteremia. Serum levels of lomefloxacin do not reliably exceed the MIC of Pseudomonas isolates. THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF LOMEFLOXACIN IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH PSEUDOMONAS BACTEREMIA HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before antimicrobial treatment in order to isolate and identify microorganisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to lomefloxacin. In patients with UTIs, therapy with Maxaquin film-coated tablets may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once these results become available, appropriate therapy should be continued. In patients with an acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, therapy should not be started empirically with lomefloxacin when there is a probability the causative pathogen is S pneumoniae.

Beta-lactamase production should have no effect on lomefloxacin activity.

### Utility of a routine urinalysis in children who require clean intermittent catheterization [^957e452e]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Children who require clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) frequently have positive urine cultures. However, diagnosing a urinary tract infection (UTI) can be difficult, as there are no standardized criteria. Routine urinalysis (UA) has good predictive accuracy for UTI in the general pediatric population, but data are limited on the utility of routine UA in the population of children who require CIC.

Objective

To determine the utility of UA parameters (e.g. leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and pyuria) to predict UTI in children who require CIC, and identify a composite UA that has maximal predictive accuracy for UTI.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of 133 children who required CIC, and had a UA and urine culture sent as part of standard of care. Patients in the no-UTI group all had UA and urine cultures sent as part of routine urodynamics, and were asymptomatic. Patients included in the UTI group had growth of ≥ 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of a known uropathogen on urine culture, in addition to two or more of the following symptoms: fever, abdominal pain, back pain, foul-smelling urine, new or worse incontinence, and pain with catheterization. Categorical data were compared using Chi-squared test, and continuous data were compared with Student's t-test. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for individual UA parameters, as well as the composite UA. Logistic regression was performed on potential composite UA models to identify the model that best fit the data.

Results

There was a higher proportion of patients in the no-UTI group with negative leukocyte esterase compared with the UTI group. There was a higher proportion of patients with UTI who had large leukocyte esterase and positive nitrites compared with the no-UTI group (Summary Figure). There was no between-group difference in urinary white blood cells. Positive nitrites were the most specific (84.4%) for UTI. None of the parameters had a high positive predictive value, while all had high negative predictive values. The composite model with the best Akaike information criterion was > 10 urinary white blood cells and either moderate or large leukocyte esterase, which had a positive predictive value of 33.3 and a negative predictive value of 90.4.

Conclusion

Routine UA had limited sensitivity, but moderate specificity, in predicting UTI in children who required CIC. The composite UA and moderate or large leukocyte esterase both had good negative predictive values for the outcome of UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^2aa98caf]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis — urine culture thresholds and organism relevance: In infants and children, an appropriate threshold to consider bacteriuria significant is at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single urinary pathogen, and reducing the threshold from 100 000 CFUs per mL to 50 000 CFUs per mL may increase sensitivity but decrease specificity; laboratories that report categorical results (0 to 1000, 1000 to 10 000, 10 000 to 100 000, and more than 100 000 CFUs per mL) require contextual interpretation for results in the 10 000 to 100 000 CFUs per mL range, and organisms such as Lactobacillus spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium spp are not considered clinically relevant urine isolates for otherwise healthy, 2- to 24-month-old children; infants with positive culture alone are recognized as having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than a true UTI when pyuria is absent.

### Spinal epidural abscess post-ureteroscopy: a case report [^57111ac4]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The second case involves a 47-year-old female with a past medical history of obesity, hyperlipidemia, recurrent UTIs with multidrug resistant E. coli, and nephrolithiasis presented to the emergency department (ED) with urinary urgency and hematuria. Urinalysis was notable for large leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite, no bacteria, 11–25 RBC/hpf, and > 100 leukocytes/hpf. Reflex culture grew 60,000–100,000 CFU/mL of E. coli. She was treated for a presumed UTI and was compliant with her antibiotics but returned to the emergency room 3 days later for severe right flank pain, persistent urinary urgency, and hematuria. CT scan demonstrated multiple obstructing left kidney stones (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
CT upper abdomen and pelvis on initial presentation. Imaging demonstrated mild to moderate hydronephrosis with four 2–3 mm stones in the mid to distal left ureter as well as additional non-obstructing renal stones

Her urinalysis again demonstrated microscopic hematuria and pyuria with few bacteria with no growth on reflex culture. The next day, urology was consulted, and the patient underwent an uncomplicated left URS and LL and ureteral stent placement under general anesthesia with gentamicin for surgical prophylaxis. The surgeon used an 11/13 French ureteral access sheath and flexible ureteroscope to visualize the stone within the left renal pelvis. The stone was well fragmented using a holmium laser and larger stones were removed with a basket. The procedure lasted approximately 54 min and was well tolerated. There were no intra-operative or immediate post-operative complications. She also did not have spinal anesthetic as part of her surgery. She was discharged on the day of surgery with one week of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim double strength and prn hydrocodone-acetaminophen for pain.

### The inadequacy of urinary dipstick and microscopy as surrogate markers of urinary tract infection in urological outpatients with lower urinary tract symptoms without acute frequency and dysuria [^1c35ae21]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diagnosing urinary infection in patients with chronic lower urinary tract symptoms without dysuria is a critical step. In this study we scrutinize the sensitivity and specificity of dipstick urinalysis and microscopic pyuria (10 or more white blood cells per microl) to identify infection in such patients.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective, blinded, observational cohort study of urological outpatients with painless lower urinary tract symptoms. Midstream and catheter urine samples were analyzed. A total of 508 midstream urine samples were used to compare leukocyte esterase, nitrite dipstick and urine microscopy with cultures seeking 10⁵ cfu/ml. Similarly 470 catheter urine samples were used to compare the same surrogates with 10⁵ cfu/ml and with an enhanced culture method seeking 10² cfu/ml. A comparison of leukocyte esterase against microscopic pyuria was made using the 508 midstream and 470 catheter specimens of urine. Midstream urine specimens were provided by 42 normal volunteers for comparison.

Results

For a midstream urine culture at 10(5) cfu/ml leukocyte esterase was 56% sensitive, nitrite was 10% sensitive and microscopic pyuria was 56% sensitive. Specificities were 66%, 99% and 72%, respectively. For a catheter specimen of urine culture at 10(5) cfu/ml leukocyte esterase was 59% sensitive, nitrite was 20% sensitive and microscopic pyuria was 66% sensitive. Specificities were 84%, 97% and 73%, respectively. The enhanced culture of catheter specimen of urine at 10(2) cfu/ml was positive in 29% of patients vs 15% at 10(5) cfu/ml.

Conclusions

Despite official guidelines and widespread use these tests cannot be considered appropriate for diagnosing urinary tract infection in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, and should be abandoned in this context.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

### Antibiotic overconsumption in pregnant women with urinary tract symptoms in Uganda [^cef1c24d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in women. During pregnancy physiological changes, like frequency, mimic UTI symptoms, and therefore bacteriological cultures are needed to confirm the diagnosis. However, in developing countries antibiotic therapy is commonly initiated without culture confirmation.

Methods

We investigated the prevalence of bacteriuria among pregnant women with and without UTI symptoms in Uganda. In total 2 562 urine samples were evaluated with nitrite and leukocyte esterase tests, using urine culture and/or dipslide with species identification as reference.

Results

The prevalence of culture-proven UTI among pregnant women with UTI symptoms was 4%. Since treatment is initiated based only on the presence of symptoms, 96% were erroneously given antibiotics. Further, there is a high prevalence of resistance to commonly used antibiotics, with 18% ESBL and 36% multidrug resistant Escherichia coli strains. Nitrite, leukocyte esterase tests, and urine microscopy alone were of poor diagnostic value. Using dipslide, gynecologists and nurses, not trained in microbiology, were mostly able to identify E. coli and negative cultures. Mixed Gram-negative flora, suggesting fecal contamination was, however, in the majority of cases interpreted as a single pathogenic bacterium and would have resulted in antibiotic treatment.

Conclusions

To prevent excessive use of antibiotics, dipslide possibly supported by a combination of nitrite and leukocyte esterase tests can be used. Trained frontline health care professionals correctly diagnosed E. coli UTI and negative urine cultures, which would help preventing antibiotic misuse. In addition, regular screening for antibiotic resistance would improve correct treatment.

### History and physical examination plus laboratory testing for the diagnosis of adult female urinary tract infection [^ecb7a8a4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians often encounter females presenting with symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for female UTIs in emergency departments (EDs) have not been quantitatively described.

Objectives

This was a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P) and urinalysis in diagnosing uncomplicated female UTI in the ED.

Methods

The medical literature was searched from January 1965 through October 2012 in PUBMED and EMBASE using the following criteria: Patients were females greater than 18 years of age in the ED suspected of having UTIs. Interventions were H&P and urinalysis used to diagnose a UTI. The comparator was UTI confirmed by a positive urine culture. The outcome was operating characteristics of the interventions in diagnosing a UTI. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc.

Results

Four studies (pooled n = 948) were included with UTI prevalence ranging from 40% to 60%. H&P variables all had positive LRs (+LR, range = 0.8 to 2.2) and negative LRs (-LR, range = 0.7 to 1.0) that are insufficient to significantly alter pretest probability of UTI. Only a positive nitrite reaction (+LR = 7.5 to 24.5) was useful to rule in a UTI. To rule out UTI, only a negative leukocyte esterase (LE; -LR = 0.2) or blood reaction on urine dipstick (-LR = 0.2) were significantly accurate. Increasing pyuria directly correlated with +LR, and moderate pyuria (urine white blood cells [uWBC] > 50 colony-forming units [CFUs]/ml) and moderate bacteruria were good predictors of UTI (+LR = 6.4 and 15.0, respectively).

Conclusions

No single H&P finding can accurately rule in or rule out UTI in symptomatic women. Urinalysis with a positive nitrite or moderate pyuria and/or bacteruria are accurate predictors of a UTI. If the pretest probability of UTI is sufficiently low, a negative urinalysis can accurately rule out the diagnosis.

### Predictors of empiric antibiotic use in the emergency department in children without urinary tract infections [^0e1f421d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common diagnosis within the pediatric emergency department (ED). Because of the necessary delay in obtaining urine culture results, clinicians must decide whether to prescribe antibiotics for a suspected UTI before urine culture results. The primary objective of this study was to identify the proportion of children given empiric antibiotics who subsequently did not meet consensus definition of an UTI. The secondary objective was to identify factors associated with return visits to the ED after an index visit for UTI. We also attempted to identify predictors of prescription of empiric antibiotics for children who did not have a UTI.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of all patients between the ages of 2 months and 18 years diagnosed with a UTI between July 2016 and June 2017 in the ED of a single urban quaternary care center. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: use of bag for urine collection, subsequent admission to the hospital, receipt of antibiotics within the previous 3 days, use of antibiotics for an indication other than a UTI, and urine culture obtained at an outside facility.

Results

Of 404 included patients, 389 (96.2%) were discharged on antibiotics and 243 (62.4%) did not have a UTI. On the multivariate analysis, age ≧ 36 months was associated with increased odds of receiving antibiotics and not having a UTI while both ≥ 1+ leukocyte esterase and ≥ 1+ nitrites on urinalysis were associated with decreased odds of receiving antibiotics and not meeting UTI criteria. Sixty-two patients revisited the ED within 30 days of the initial visit, 24 (38.7%) of which met criteria for UTI during the index visit. Prescription of antibiotics at the time of the index visit was associated with decreased odds of reutilization, whereas an extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing organism cultured from urine at the index visit was associated with increased odds of reutilization.

Conclusions

A high number of patients discharged on empiric antibiotics did not meet criteria for a UTI. We did not identify clinically useful factors that predicted prescription of empiric antibiotics for children who do not have a UTI. We believe that unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions could be substantially decreased by decreasing empiric use of antibiotics coupled with reliable follow-up for positive urine cultures.

### Application of the PECARN prediction rule for febrile infants up to 90 days of age: a multi-center study [^339431a9]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was done on febrile infants presenting to the ED at 3 tertiary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021. Two of the hospitals were in the city of Riyadh (King Abdullah Specialized Children's Hospital and Prince Sultan Military Medical City) while one was in the city of Jeddah (King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah). The number of pediatric ED visits per year in each hospital is approximately 100,000, 25,000, and 15,000 respectively. Patients were included if they were 0–90 days of age, had documented fever (temperature ≥ 38.0 °C) recorded in the ED, in a prior health care setting or at home within the last 24 h, and had serum PCT performed. Patients were excluded if they were premature (gestational age < 37 weeks), had a NICU admission for more than 5 days, had received antibiotics in the preceding 48 h, had indwelling devices or soft tissue infections, or had pre-existing conditions (like major chromosomal anomalies, congenital heart disease on anti-failure medication, or immunodeficiency). Regarding appearance ("well" versus "ill"), patients were categorized based on the clinical exam as "ill" if any of the following was noted in documentation ("ill-appearing", "toxic", "limp", "unresponsive", "gray", "cyanotic", "apnea", "weak cry", "poorly perfused", "grunting", "listless", "lethargic", or "irritable".). Patients with the following SBIs were included: UTI, bacteremia or bacterial meningitis. A UTI was defined as the growth of a single uropathogen (≥ 1,000 cfu/mL for cultures obtained by suprapubic aspiration or ≥ 50,000 cfu/mL for cultures obtained by catheterization). If colony counts were between 10,000 and 50,000 cfu/mL, they were considered significant if there was an abnormal urine dipstick or urinalysis (defined by the presence of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, or > 5 white blood cells per high-power field [WBC/hpf]). Bacteremia and bacterial meningitis were defined by the growth of a single pathogenic bacteria in the blood culture or CSF culture (or CSF multiplex PCR panel), respectively. Pathogens considered contaminants included Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium spp. Bacillus spp. Propionibacterium acnes, and Viridans group streptococci. If a patient was found to have a contaminant they were not considered to have a SBI. Infants were considered to be at low risk of SBIs according to the PECARN prediction rule if all of the following were present: absolute neutrophil count ≤ 4.0 × 10 9 /L, PCT ≤ 0.5 ng/mL, and negative urinalysis or dipstick (negative leukocyte esterase, negative nitrate and WBC ≤ 5/hpf).

### The urine dipstick test useful to rule out infections. A meta-analysis of the accuracy [^fafec3be]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of dipstick tests as rapid detectors of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). The lack of an adequate explanation for the heterogeneity of the dipstick accuracy stimulates an ongoing debate. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to summarise the available evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test, taking into account various pre-defined potential sources of heterogeneity.

Methods

Literature from 1990 through 1999 was searched in Medline and Embase, and by reference tracking. Selected publications should be concerned with the diagnosis of bacteriuria or urinary tract infections, investigate the use of dipstick tests for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, and present empirical data. A checklist was used to assess methodological quality.

Results

70 publications were included. Accuracy of nitrites was high in pregnant women (Diagnostic Odds Ratio = 165) and elderly people (DOR = 108). Positive predictive values were ≥ 80% in elderly and in family medicine. Accuracy of leukocyte-esterase was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 276). Sensitivities were highest in family medicine (86%). Negative predictive values were high in both tests in all patient groups and settings, except for in family medicine. The combination of both test results showed an important increase in sensitivity. Accuracy was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 52), in children (DOR = 46), and if clinical information was present (DOR = 28). Sensitivity was highest in studies carried out in family medicine (90%). Predictive values of combinations of positive test results were low in all other situations.

Conclusions

Overall, this review demonstrates that the urine dipstick test alone seems to be useful in all populations to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte-esterase are negative. Sensitivities of the combination of both tests vary between 68 and 88% in different patient groups, but positive test results have to be confirmed. Although the combination of positive test results is very sensitive in family practice, the usefulness of the dipstick test alone to rule in infection remains doubtful, even with high pre-test probabilities.

### Procalcitonin reflects bacteremia and bacterial load in urosepsis syndrome: a prospective observational study [^b90135a0]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and setting

We conducted a prospective observational multicenter cohort study. Eight emergency departments (ED) of 7 hospitals and 35 affiliating primary health care centers, serving one single area of the Netherlands, participated. Consecutive patients who presented with a diagnosis of febrile UTI, were considered for enrollment in the study. Recruitment took place from January 2004 through November 2008 but each centre started at different time points. The study was approved by the local ethics committees and all included patients gave written informed consent.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were: age of 18 years or above, fever (defined as an tympanic temperature ≥ 38.0°C or a history of fever and chills within 24 hours before presentation), at least one symptom of UTI (dysuria, frequency, urgency, perineal pain, flank pain or costovertebral tenderness) and a positive nitrite dipstick test or leukocyturia as defined by a positive leukocyte esterase dipstick test or the presence of more than five leukocytes per high-power field in a centrifuged sediment. Exclusion criteria were current treatment for urolithiasis or hydronephrosis, pregnancy, hemo- or peritoneal dialysis, a history of kidney transplantation or known presence of polycystic kidney disease.

Infections and Inflammatory Markers

Infections were categorized into UTI, pneumonia, other respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatitis, soft tissue, central nervous system, blood, and other (eg, sinusitis, esophageal candidiasis). Suspected UTI was defined as symptomatic with positive dipstick for leukocyte esterase or nitrite, and received treatment, while confirmed UTI required symptoms and a positive culture and received appropriate therapy. Pneumonia was binarized as suspected (symptoms, clinical diagnosis, treated) or confirmed (chest radiograph). All remaining infections were confirmed with positive signs/symptoms and laboratory tests (eg, positive culture or antigen detection). The presence of a hospital discharge International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) diagnosis of sepsis was recorded.

Severity of infection inflammatory response was defined by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria(≥ 2 of the following: heart rate > 90/min; respiratory rate > 20/min; temperature < 36°C or > 38°C; or white cell count [WCC] < 4×10 9 /L or > 12×10 9 /L). Total days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) SIRS‐positive during the admission period was calculated. Routinely acquired inflammatory markers, including CRP, WCC, lymphocyte count, and neutrophil count, were recorded from admission, and any repeat sampling during admission was reviewed to identify peak values of CRP and WCC. Admission neutrophil count divided by the lymphocyte count yielded the NLR with normal reference range for adults of 0.78 to 3.53. Reference intervals employed were derived from the patient recruitment site (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals Natonal Health Service Foundation Trust).

### Adaptation and external validation of pathogenic urine culture prediction in primary care using machine learning [^95e83ffb]. Annals of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms are common in primary care, but antibiotics are appropriate only when an infection is present. Urine culture is the reference standard test for infection, but results take > 1 day. A machine learning predictor of urine cultures showed high accuracy for an emergency department (ED) population but required urine microscopy features that are not routinely available in primary care (the NeedMicro classifier).

Methods

We redesigned a classifier (NoMicro) that does not depend on urine microscopy and retrospectively validated it internally (ED data set) and externally (on a newly curated primary care [PC] data set) using a multicenter approach including 80,387 (ED) and 472 (PC) adults. We constructed machine learning models using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), artificial neural networks, and random forests (RFs). The primary outcome was pathogenic urine culture growing ≥ 100,000 colony forming units. Predictor variables included age; gender; dipstick urinalysis nitrites, leukocytes, clarity, glucose, protein, and blood; dysuria; abdominal pain; and history of UTI.

Results

Removal of microscopy features did not severely compromise performance under internal validation: NoMicro/XGBoost receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) 0.86 (95% CI, 0.86–0.87) vs NeedMicro 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87–0.88). Excellent performance in external (PC) validation was also observed: NoMicro/RF ROC-AUC 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81–0.89). Retrospective simulation suggested that NoMicro/RF can be used to safely withhold antibiotics for low-risk patients, thereby avoiding antibiotic overuse.

Conclusions

The NoMicro classifier appears appropriate for PC. Prospective trials to adjudicate the balance of benefits and harms of using the NoMicro classifier are appropriate.
