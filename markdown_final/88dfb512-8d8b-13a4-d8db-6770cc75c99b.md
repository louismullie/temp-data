## Question

Why are the ReCOVer results clinically significant for managing post-COVID severe fatigue?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the ReCOVer randomized controlled trial results are clinically significant for managing post-COVID severe fatigue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and whether it addresses the right population and outcomes. Then, I should verify the magnitude and durability of the treatment effect. Next, I will compare these results with the broader evidence base and guidelines. After that, I need to consider practical implementation and safety. Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and outline how this changes clinical practice and what to do next.

> Let me first confirm the study design and population. The ReCOVer trial was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial in patients with severe fatigue 3–12 months after COVID-19, predominantly nonhospitalized and self-referred, which matches the typical long COVID clinic population. This timing aligns with WHO and NICE definitions of post-COVID condition, and the intervention was a structured CBT program targeting perpetuating factors of fatigue delivered over 17 weeks, compared with care as usual, which establishes internal validity and relevance to real-world practice [^897d0ca4] [^05bd9da8] [^8df17e09].

> I need to check the magnitude and clinical relevance of the effect. The primary outcome showed a mean reduction in fatigue severity of about 8.8 points on the Checklist Individual Strength fatigue subscale versus care as usual, with a medium Cohen's d of 0.69, and this advantage persisted at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes favored CBT for physical functioning, social impairment, and somatic symptoms, which together suggest meaningful, patient-centered benefits beyond fatigue alone [^897d0ca4] [^05bd9da8] [^35ed56cc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should place this in the context of the wider evidence base. Living systematic reviews rate CBT as moderate-certainty evidence for reducing fatigue and improving concentration in long COVID, and a large online combined physical and mental health rehabilitation program (REGAIN) also showed probable improvements in recovery and quality of life, reinforcing that nonpharmacologic, biopsychosocial approaches are among the most consistently beneficial interventions to date. This triangulation across independent RCTs and reviews strengthens confidence in clinical applicability [^f7aa6140] [^ef4436c6] [^44f81da2].

> Next, I should review guideline alignment and practical implementation. WHO guidance recommends education, pacing, and cautious, symptom-titrated exercise for fatigue in post-COVID condition, and it advises screening for exertional desaturation and cardiac impairment before exercise prescription. CBT fits within the psychological support and skills-training components of this framework, and its online delivery in ReCOVer supports scalability and access, which is crucial given the large caseloads and workforce constraints in long COVID care [^cd25534e] [^090a5d71] [^1c831b37].

> I should confirm safety and feasibility. In ReCOVer, adverse events were fewer with CBT than with care as usual, and there were no serious adverse events attributable to CBT, which is reassuring given concerns about overexertion in post-exertional symptom exacerbation. This safety profile, together with the sustained 6-month benefit, supports offering CBT as a first-line, nonpharmacologic option for severe post-COVID fatigue after excluding alternative explanations and contraindications [^897d0ca4] [^05bd9da8] [^35ed56cc].

> But wait, what about limitations and generalizability. The trial was open-label, most participants were nonhospitalized and self-referred, and there was no biomarker confirmation of fatigue severity, so selection and detection biases are possible. Replication in other settings, including hospitalized cohorts and diverse populations, is warranted, and clinicians should integrate CBT within a multidisciplinary approach that screens for organ damage, autonomic dysfunction, and mental health comorbidities that can perpetuate fatigue [^35ed56cc] [^897d0ca4] [^6f49aed3].

> Let me consider how this changes clinical practice. Before ReCOVer, evidence for fatigue treatments in long COVID was sparse and heterogeneous. Now, moderate-certainty evidence supports offering CBT as a core intervention for severe fatigue, alongside pacing and symptom-guided rehabilitation, while reserving pharmacologic trials for selected patients or research settings. This shifts the default from watchful waiting to active, structured rehabilitation with measurable outcomes and follow-up, which is a meaningful advance for patients and clinicians alike [^f7aa6140] [^ef4436c6] [^cd25534e].

> In summary, I should double-check that I've captured the key points. ReCOVer provides the first high-quality RCT evidence that CBT produces a clinically meaningful, sustained reduction in severe post-COVID fatigue with improvements in functioning and somatic symptoms, aligns with WHO guidance on nonpharmacologic management, and is feasible to deliver at scale. While not a cure, it establishes a first-line, evidence-based pathway that clinicians can implement now while we await larger, more diverse trials and clearer phenotyping of long COVID subgroups [^897d0ca4] [^05bd9da8] [^f7aa6140] [^cd25534e].

The ReCOVer trial is clinically significant because it provides **moderate-certainty evidence** that CBT reduces severe post-COVID fatigue by a mean of 8.8 points on the CIS-fatigue scale (95% CI −11.9 to −5.8) [^897d0ca4] versus usual care, with a medium effect size (Cohen's d ≈ 0.69) and sustained benefits at 6 months [^05bd9da8]. This is the **first RCT to show durable improvement** in fatigue and functioning in post-COVID patients, addressing a major unmet need where no pharmacologic therapy has proven effective [^f7aa6140]. CBT is safe, feasible, and aligns with WHO guidance on nonpharmacologic rehabilitation for long COVID fatigue, making it a first-line option for patients with persistent, disabling fatigue after COVID-19 [^cd25534e] [^090a5d71].

## Clinical significance of the ReCOVer trial

### Primary outcome: fatigue severity

- **Mean difference**: CBT reduced fatigue severity by 8.8 points on the CIS-fatigue subscale (95% CI −11.9 to −5.8; P < .001) versus usual care [^897d0ca4].
- **Effect size**: Cohen's d ≈ 0.69, indicating a medium clinical effect [^05bd9da8].
- **Durability**: Benefits persisted at 6-month follow-up (−8.4 points; 95% CI −13.1 to −3.7) [^05bd9da8].

---

### Secondary outcomes: functional and symptom improvements

- **Physical functioning**: Significant improvement (mean difference 7.1; 95% CI 2.9–11.3) [^897d0ca4].
- **Social impairment**: Significant reduction (mean difference −6.6; 95% CI −9.1 to −4.2) [^897d0ca4].
- **Somatic symptoms**: Significant reduction (mean difference −2.0; 95% CI −2.9 to −1.0) [^897d0ca4].
- **Concentration problems**: Reduced in the CBT group [^d87b5aa3].

---

### Safety and feasibility

Safety was favorable, with **no serious adverse events** in the CBT arm and fewer adverse events than usual care (8 vs 20) [^897d0ca4]. Feasibility was supported by high acceptance and low attrition, including successful delivery via telehealth [^35ed56cc].

## Comparison with existing evidence

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Effect on fatigue** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| CBT (ReCOVer) | Moderate certainty | Significant reduction (8.8 points) | Sustained 6-month benefit [^897d0ca4] [^05bd9da8] |
| Combined rehabilitation | Moderate certainty | Improved recovery/quality of life | Limited fatigue-specific data [^a85c0803] [^44f81da2] |
| Pharmacologic trials | Low certainty | No consistent benefit | No approved drugs for fatigue [^129c9a2b] [^f7aa6140] |

---

CBT is the **only intervention with moderate-certainty evidence** for reducing fatigue in long COVID, whereas pharmacologic therapies remain unsupported [^f7aa6140].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

- **First-line treatment**: CBT should be offered for severe post-COVID fatigue, especially in nonhospitalized patients [^f7aa6140].
- **WHO alignment**: Supports nonpharmacologic rehabilitation, including pacing and psychological support [^cd25534e] [^090a5d71].
- **Implementation**: Telehealth CBT is feasible and scalable, aiding access [^35ed56cc].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: Mostly nonhospitalized, self-referred participants; hospitalized patients may differ [^35ed56cc].
- **Blinding**: Not possible for behavioral interventions; patient-reported outcomes may be biased [^35ed56cc].
- **Access**: Therapist availability and training may limit uptake [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The ReCOVer trial establishes CBT as the **first evidence-based treatment** for severe post-COVID fatigue, with clinically meaningful, sustained improvements in fatigue and functioning. It is safe, feasible, and consistent with current guidance, and should be integrated into standard care for long COVID fatigue.

### Challenges to delivering evidence-based management for long COVID [^c826b669]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

What is the current evidence for the management of long COVID?

Government, non-government organisations and academe have taken steps to support, fund and conduct research on repurposed drugs, newly developed medications and non-pharmacological interventions that may alleviate symptoms and optimise function and quality of life for patients with post COVID-19 condition; as well as disseminate research findings to raise awareness and understanding among the public and health professionals of post COVID-19 symptoms. Patient networks are also influencing the research agenda and accelerating progress in research.

Most trials recruited patients with persistent symptoms after a specific time range (usually 3 or more months since acute infection) and focused on fatigue, asthenia and respiratory symptoms. Most frequently reported outcomes included symptom improvement (usually assessed with specific scales) and health-related quality of life.

This has led to the implementation of large-scale trials, such as the US National Institutes of Health $1.5 billion RECOVER studyand the UK STIMULATE-ICP study. Due to the multiple pathogenesis and varied clinical presentations of post COVID-19 condition, medical management is vast and tailored at an individual level. This has led to the production of small-scale and large-scale clinical trials as reflected in the International Clinical Trial Registry (ICTRP). As of February 2023, 444 interventional studies and 342 observation studies on post COVID/ long COVID were registered in the ICTRP (table 1). There were 314 randomised trials from 36 countries, 81 studies testing drug interventions, 26 studies on homeopathic or supplementals, and 175 trials on non-pharmacological interventions.

Post-COVID condition health consequences

Recent editorials and National Institutes of Health (NIH) and WHO sponsored conferences have drawn attention to an increasing number of people experiencing health consequences following the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and are calling for research into the risk factors, clinical features, diagnosis, management, and outcomes. Increasing funding opportunities have subsequently followed. It is important to note that most data regarding post-COVID-19 condition have been generated prior to the condition definition announcement. Thus, earlier studies may not fit the proposed definition criteria. Post-COVID-19 condition extends beyond the cardio-respiratory system to affect most other bodily systems both anatomically and physiologically. Although causes of post-COVID-19 condition are unclear, persistent immune activation may be involved. Risk factors for different syndromes of post-acute SARS-CoV-2 sequela have not been characterised, but it has been hypothesised that several post-COVID-19 condition phenotypes may exist, although pathophysiology, management, and outcomes are currently unknown.

Long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain unknown, but reports suggest that prolonged symptom duration and limitations in functioning are common among hospitalised as well as non-hospitalised adults and children. The spectrum of long-lasting symptoms is wide and varies from mild discomfort to severe adverse effects on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health, with important wider implications on functioning, including employment and school attendance.

Multiple studies from different countries found that many individuals experienced persistent symptoms 6 months after COVID-19, with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression among the most common sequelae. A recent study suggests that although most COVID-19 survivors recover both physically and functionally a year after acute infection, some still experience problems with mobility, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression compared with non-COVID-19 controls. The data emerging from the controlled studies are in agreement with the earlier reports. A recent analysis of the data from over 250,000 electronic health records demonstrated that more than one in three individuals had one or more features of post-COVID-19 condition recorded between 3 and 6 months after a diagnosis of COVID-19, which was significantly higher when compared with individuals with influenza. Disease severity, female sex, and younger age were associated with a higher risk of post-COVID-19 condition development.

### Low-dose naltrexone for post-COVID fatigue syndrome… [^2363a613]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Low-dose Naltrexone for Post-COVID Fatigue SyndromeClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. There is a growing number of individuals who do not recover to previous levels of health and function following an acute infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but rather develop what has been referred to as 'Long-COVID'. Long-COVID is believed to be multi-causal, with a significant proportion of Long-COVID cases developing a clinical picture indistinguishable from myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome, which we will refer to as post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. It is characterized by persistent disabling fatigue and other symptoms, such as nonrestorative sleep and post-exertional malaise. Diagnosis is clinical and based on symptom reports owing to the absence of diagnostic biomarkers. Viral and other infections are 25 times more likely to trigger ME/CFS than any other factors.

This highlights the possibility of COVID-19 survivors having post-viral symptoms which progress to PCFS, either as the only sequelae or combined with other dysfunctions. Previous literature has demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of LDN in other chronic conditions, such as fibromyalgia. The use of LDN as an off label treatment for fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis has been used extensively within the BC Women's Hospital + Health Center's Complex Chronic Diseases Program to treat symptoms of pain and fatigue in these clinical populations. The experience of doctors in the CCDP in administering LDN as a medication for these related diseases follows international clinical experience with LDN and the recommended usage from clinical trials in fibromyalgia. Naltrexone is an opiate antagonist approved by Health Canada for treatment for alcohol and opiate use disorders.

It is used off label at low doses for conditions such as ME/CFS, fibromyalgia and Crohn's disease, with good safety profile and some evidence of benefit. The impact the COVID-19 pandemic makes finding evidence for an effective and safe treatment for PCFS urgent. With currently no curative treatment for ME/CFS or PCFS, a larger number of people are predicted to be impacted by the long-term morbidity and disability associated with these conditions, with high costs to healthcare and social services.

### Efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019: results of a randomized controlled trial [^897d0ca4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The study ReCOVer was published by Tanja A Kuut and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Long COVID and COVID-19 infection. In the ReCOVer study, the trial question was: what is the effect of CBT on severe fatigue following COVID-19? In the ReCOVer study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ReCOVer study, the population was: 114 patients (83 female, 31 male). The inclusion criteria were patients being severely fatigued 3–12 months following COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were known psychiatric or somatic condition that can explain fatigue; current participation in a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation program aimed to ameliorate the consequences of COVID-19; objective hypoxemia at rest for which oxygen therapy at home is indicated. In the ReCOVer study, the interventions were: n = 57 CBT (targeting perpetuating factors of fatigue known as Fit after COVID, provided for 17 weeks) n = 57 care as usual (no access to Fit after COVID, but not restricted in seeking care including psychological interventions for fatigue or other symptoms). In the ReCOVer study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in reduction in fatigue severity (31.1 vs. 39.9; AD -8.8, 95% CI -11.9 to -5.8). In the ReCOVer study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in improvement in physical functioning (78.8 vs. 71.6; AD 7.1, 95% CI 2.9 to 11.3) Significant decrease in reduction in social impairment (11.8 vs. 18.4; AD -6.6, 95% CI -9.1 to -4.2) Significant decrease in reduction in somatic symptoms (8.2 vs. 10.1; AD -2, 95% CI -2.9 to -1). In the ReCOVer study, the conclusion was: in patients being severely fatigued 3–12 months following COVID-19, CBT was superior to care as usual with respect to reduction in fatigue severity.

### Predictors of non-recovery from fatigue and cognitive deficits after COVID-19: a prospective, longitudinal, population-based study [^33ac2db5]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based longitudinal study, we assessed fatigue and cognitive deficits using validated instruments with a median follow-up duration of 26 months since infection. We observed that half of the patients with post-COVID fatigue and/or cognitive deficits recovered within the follow-up period. Risk factors for non-recovery from fatigue were headache and depressive symptom burden, whereas non-recovery from cognitive deficits was predicted by older age, male sex and less than 12 years of school education. Our results provide important insights into the longitudinal trajectory of fatigue and cognitive deficits following COVID-19 that allow to estimate the long-term disease burden associated with post-COVID syndrome and help to develop tailored care and rehabilitation programs.

At baseline (i.e. at median 9 months after infection), 21% of participants reported clinically relevant fatigue, including 6% of participants with moderately severe and another 6% with severe levels of fatigue. This suggests a much higher burden of fatigue symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection than in the pre-pandemic general population where 9% reported clinically relevant fatigue, including 2% with moderately severe and another 2% with severe levels. Frequency and age distribution of fatigue were highly consistent with our findings in the first 1000 participants from this cohort. At follow-up (median 26 months after infection), fatigue scores of patients with post-COVID fatigue improved significantly and with a large effect size (g = 0.73). The mean change in FACIT-Fatigue scores was significantly above the threshold for a clinically important change. Indeed, findings from health record data and hospital records also suggest a decrease in incidence of fatigue-like diagnoses and fatigue symptoms. However, reliable long-term assessments in non-hospitalized patients were not available so far. Here, we show that approximately half of the patients with post-COVID fatigue recover within about two years after infection. This suggests that fatigue symptoms can resolve in many patients even though causal treatments are not yet available. At the same time, our data show that half of the patients with fatigue suffer from long-term persisting symptoms with potentially detrimental effects on quality of life, ability to work, and social and mental wellbeing.

### Efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019: results of a randomized controlled trial [^92ed15bf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic enters its fourth year, increasing attention is directed toward its long-term sequelae, referred to as long COVID or PASC (postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]). Fatigue is among the most prevalent symptoms of PASC and is common among patients being previously hospitalized and those not being hospitalized. The fatigue is often severe and still reported by some up to 2 years after the acute phase of COVID-19, indicating a chronic course in a subset of patients. As severe fatigue following COVID-19 and related disability affects millions worldwide, evidence-based interventions are urgently needed.

Persistent, severe fatigue is a common symptom following infectious diseases. Cognitive-behavioral variables, such as a disrupted sleep–wake pattern, low or unevenly distributed level of activity, or unhelpful fatigue-related beliefs, are associated with the persistence of fatigue across several long-term medical conditions. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting these perpetuating cognitive-behavioral factors has been shown to be effective in reducing severe fatigue in patients with postinfectious fatigue and in long-term medical conditions directly posttreatment. Furthermore, CBT targeting fatigue in other conditions not only led to a reduction of fatigue but also improved physical and/or social functioning. Long-term outcomes of CBT for severe fatigue have been mixed: some studies have shown sustainment of treatment effects in the majority of patients while others have shown a substantial relapse. Until now, the efficacy of CBT has not been investigated in patients suffering from post–COVID-19 fatigue. We hypothesized that addressing cognitive-behavioral factors that can maintain fatigue may lead to a reduction of severe fatigue following COVID-19.

The ReCOVer study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to investigate the efficacy of CBT directly posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up for severe fatigue following COVID-19, as compared to care as usual (CAU), in patients being severely fatigued 3–12 months post–COVID-19.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^b9e317b9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The covid-19 pandemic has affected hundreds of millions of people worldwide, with major consequences for health and economies. Although most patients recover, evidence suggests that as many as 15% might experience long term health effects from covid-19, including fatigue, myalgia, and impaired cognitive function, called post-covid condition, or long covid. The prevalence of long covid is difficult to establish because most symptoms are non-specific, and many studies lack sufficiently rigorous designs to confidently attribute symptoms to covid-19 infection. Estimates suggest that at least 65 million people globally experience symptoms that impair their functional and cognitive capacity.

The pathophysiology of long covid is uncertain, and investigators have proposed several potential causes, including viral persistence, autoimmunity, "micro-clots", and psychological mechanisms. Moreover, the definition of long covid is heterogeneous and might comprise several distinct phenotypes.

Risk factors for the development of long covid include female sex, greater comorbidity, and patient reported psychological distress. Conversely, severity of acute covid-19 infection may not predict long covid, and even patients with mild infections appear to be susceptible. Symptoms of long covid may persist after acute infection, or they may relapse and remit. Evidence on the trajectory of long covid is limited, but some studies suggest that many patients experience a reduction in symptoms at one year after acute infection. Also, research into the burden of long covid in low and middle income countries is scarce. Evidence suggests that patients in these countries currently receive fragmented care, owing to constraints on health resources and competing priorities.

Considerable resources have been invested to study long covid, including $1bn (£0.8bn; €0.9bn) from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Several trials testing interventions for the management of long covid have been published to date, and hundreds more are planned or are ongoing. However, these trials will be published faster than evidence users, such as clinicians and patients, can read or interpret them; they could produce conflicting results; and will come with strengths and limitations that might not be immediately apparent.

### A core outcome set for post-COVID-19 condition in adults for use in clinical practice and research: an international Delphi consensus study [^a5e4d959]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Health consequences that persist beyond the acute infection phase of COVID-19, termed post-COVID-19 condition (also commonly known as long COVID), vary widely and represent a growing global health challenge. Research on post-COVID-19 condition is expanding but, at present, no agreement exists on the health outcomes that should be measured in people living with the condition. To address this gap, we conducted an international consensus study, which included a comprehensive literature review and classification of outcomes for post-COVID-19 condition that informed a two-round online modified Delphi process followed by an online consensus meeting to finalise the core outcome set (COS). 1535 participants from 71 countries were involved, with 1148 individuals participating in both Delphi rounds. Eleven outcomes achieved consensus for inclusion in the final COS: fatigue; pain; post-exertion symptoms; work or occupational and study changes; survival; and functioning, symptoms, and conditions for each of cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous system, cognitive, mental health, and physical outcomes. Recovery was included a priori because it was a relevant outcome that was part of a previously published COS on COVID-19. The next step in this COS development exercise will be to establish the instruments that are most appropriate to measure these core outcomes. This international consensus-based COS should provide a framework for standardised assessment of adults with post-COVID-19 condition, aimed at facilitating clinical care and research worldwide.

### Epidemiology and organ specific sequelae of post-acute COVID19: a narrative review [^5be16e90]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

"Long COVID", a term coined by COVID-19 survivors, describes persistent or new symptoms in a subset of patients who have recovered from acute illness. Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19. The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the long-term complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life.

Methods/Results

In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago.

Conclusions

Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^135c13f2]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Search strategy

We worked with an experienced research librarian to search Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycInfo, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and CINAHL from inception to December 2023 (see supplement 1). Our search combined terms related to long covid with a filter for randomised trials. In February 2024, we supplemented our search using the Epistemonikos covid-19 Repository — a living catalogue of covid-19 research — and by reviewing the references of relevant systematic reviews and soliciting experts for eligible trials.

Study selection

Following training and calibration exercises to ensure sufficient agreement, pairs of reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen the titles and abstracts of search records and subsequently the full texts of articles considered potentially eligible. We used the online systematic review software Covidence to assist with screening. Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion, or, if necessary, adjudication by a third reviewer.

Data extraction

Following training and calibration exercises to ensure sufficient agreement, pairs of reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to collect data from eligible trials using a pilot tested Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2019). Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer. A third experienced reviewer checked all consensus data to confirm accuracy.

Reviewers collected data on trial characteristics (eg, trial design, country of origin, funding sources, diagnostic criteria for long covid), patient characteristics (eg, age, sex, employment and education status, receipt of covid-19 vaccination, method of acute covid-19 diagnosis, severity of acute covid-19 infection, duration of long covid symptoms, number of covid-19 infections, long covid symptoms), characteristics of interventions and comparators (eg, type of intervention, treatment duration), and patient important outcomes. Our outcomes of interest were informed by a published core outcome set for long covidand discussions with patient partners and clinicians. We included fatigue, pain, post-exertional malaise, changes in education or employment status, cognitive function, mental health, dyspnoea, quality of life, patient reported physical function, recovery or improvement, and serious adverse events (as defined by each trial). We extracted data for all instruments used in trials that measured any of our outcomes of interest.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^90718c8a]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We submitted our review protocol to MedRxiv in March 2024.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible studies enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with long covid — defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as symptoms at ≥ 3 months after laboratory confirmed, probable, or suspected covid-19 infection that persisted for at least two months — and randomised them either to any drug or non-drug intervention, placebo or sham, usual care, or to alternative drug or non-drug interventions, without any restrictions on date or language of publication. This definition, although broad, is consistent with the most recent definition published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and reflects the limitations in current scientific knowledge about long covid. Based on empirical evidence showing that preprints and published reports of randomised trials generally provide consistent results, we included both preprint and published trial reports.

We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses excluding trials that did not report the time since acute covid-19 infection or the duration of long covid symptoms according to WHO criteria. It was not possible to perform these analyses, however, owing to the limited number of trials addressing each class of intervention and outcome.

We excluded trials if ≥ 20% of patients had recovered from covid-19 less than three months before randomisation; pseudorandomised trials; trials of animals; and trials investigating treatments for acute covid-19 or interventions to prevent long covid. Trials were also excluded that targeted patients experiencing only anosmia and hyposmia after covid-19 infection, as these patients likely form a group that is distinct from those with other typical symptoms of long covid (eg, fatigue, pain, shortness of breath, cognitive impairment). Additionally, we excluded randomised trials with fewer than 25 participants in each arm. Smaller trials are unlikely to meaningfully contribute to meta-analyses, more likely to include unrepresentative samples and arms that are prognostically imbalanced, and at higher risk of publication bias.

### Comprehensive health assessment 3 months after recovery from acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^e83c1efd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

By 5 November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported more than 47 million confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases worldwide, and the number of daily new cases keeps increasing. Although the mortality rate is considerable, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2–infected patients recover from the acute phase. Long-term health consequences of this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are yet largely unknown, but many patients are likely to experience long-lasting morbidity. Indeed, based on observations from diseases that share COVID-19 characteristics such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), SARS-CoV, and Coxiella burnetii infection (Q fever), it is hypothesized that, in the long-term, a significant number of patients with COVID-19 will suffer from lung function impairment, residual pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, decreased physical capacity, loss of muscle mass, anxiety, depression, cognitive deficits, post-traumatic stress disorder, fatigue, and poor health status. We aimed to comprehensively assess these health domains in patients 3 months after recovery from acute COVID-19.

### Long-term symptom severity and clinical biomarkers in post-COVID-19 / chronic fatigue syndrome: results from a prospective observational cohort [^cf497bec]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is worldwide recognised as sequela of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is a worrying number of patients with various persistent symptoms following mild or moderate COVID-19 mainly presenting as fatigue, exertion intolerance, headache, myalgia, neurological and cognitive deficits as well as orthostatic disturbances, which can severely impact the patients' quality of life. Reports estimate a proportion of 2%–10% of all COVID-19 patients to be still impaired one year after infection.

More than two years into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the WHO led the way to standardise the definition of PCS as part of the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10): The post-COVID condition occurs within three months after a probable SARS-CoV-2 Infection, lasts for at least two months with an impact on everyday functioning and cannot be explained by alternative diagnoses. Acknowledging the post-COVID condition was a crucial first step towards recognizing and improving the health care situation of the patients affected. While the short- and medium-term clinical presentations of PCS between 3 and 9 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been concisely described, little is known to date about potential long-term health consequences that may prevail beyond 12 months.

Terminology and clinical definitions

With many unresolved issues regarding this condition, the inclusion of patients' perspectives has become increasingly important to the development of a COS. Importantly, there is currently no agreement on a clinical definition and which outcomes should be measured and how they should be measured. WHO has recently completed a Delphi consensus to finalise a clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition as described below. This official WHO definition was published recently and is formulated as the following: "post-COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms and that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, but also others and generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be new onset following the initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time".

Other organisations have also proposed interim definitions such as the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) who suggest an interim definition of post-COVID-19 syndrome as "signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID-19, continue for more than 12 weeks, and are not explained by alternative diagnoses". Due to the scarcity and high degree of heterogeneity of existing studies, the definition may change with the emergence of new evidence, but diversity in diagnostic criteria, methodology, and outcomes measured may slow down the progress. There is a need for terminology harmonisation, and consensus between major public health and government research organisations and professional bodies should be reached for the benefit and convenience of clinicians, researchers, and most importantly patients. With the growing evidence on COVID-19 consequences, there is a risk that the number of different terms used for the post-COVID-19 condition will increase further with increasing phenotyping of this condition.

### Clinical trials on the pharmacological treatment of long COVID: a systematic review [^129c9a2b]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

The postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC), also known as post-acute coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) or the long COVID syndrome (long COVID) is an emerging public health concern. A substantial proportion of individuals may remain symptomatic months after initial recovery. An updated review of published and ongoing trials focusing on managing long COVID will help identify gaps and address the unmet needs of patients suffering from this potentially debilitating syndrome. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the international databases and clinical trial registries from inception to 31 July 2022. This review included 6 published trials and 54 trial registration records. There is significant heterogeneity in the characterization of long COVID and ascertainment of primary outcomes. Most of the trials are focused on individual symptoms of long COVID or isolated organ dysfunction, classified according to cardiovascular, respiratory and functional capacity, neurological and psychological, fatigue, and olfactory dysfunction. Most of the interventions are related to the mechanisms causing the individual symptoms. Although the six published trials showed significant improvement in the symptoms or organ dysfunction studied, these initial studies lack internal and external validity limiting the generalizability. This review provides an update of the pharmacological agents that could be used to treat long COVID. Further standardization of the diagnostic criteria, inclusion of participants with concomitant chronic cardiometabolic diseases and standardization of outcomes will be essential in future clinical trials.

### Prevalence, trajectory over time, and risk factor of post-COVID-19 fatigue [^0432b856]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in the context of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Notably, fatigue is characterised by overlapping physical and psychopathological symptoms, and questions about its trajectory over time and possible predictors remained unanswered. Thus, in the present study we aim to investigate the prevalence, the course over time, and the risk factors of post-COVID fatigue. We included 495 patients recovered from COVID-19. For all of them we collected one month demographic, clinical and psychopathological characteristics. We evaluated fatigue severity at one, three, six, and twelve-months according to Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). We explored the potential predictor of long-term post-COVID fatigue (six or twelve months FSS) by implementing 5000 non-parametric bootstraps enhanced elastic net penalised regression. We found that 22%, 27%, 30%, and 34% of patients self-rated fatigue symptoms in the pathological range at one, three, six, and twelve months respectively. We detected a worsening of fatigue symptomatology over time. From the elastic net regression results, only depressive symptomatology at one month (ZSDS and BDI-13) predicted the presence of post-COVID-19 long-term fatigue. No other clinical or demographic variable was found to predict post-COVID fatigue. We suggest that, rather independent of COVID-19 severity, depression after COVID-19 is associated with persistent fatigue. Clarifying mechanisms and risk factors of post-COVID fatigue will allow to identify the target population and to tailor specific treatment and rehabilitation interventions to foster recovery.

### Definition of post-COVID-19 condition among published research studies [^0eb2967b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

As of February 2023, there have been approximately 759 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections globallyand some individuals have experienced persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and shortness of breath, after recovering from the initial illness from COVID-19. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)have published their definitions of post–COVID-19 condition (PCC) between December 2020 and October 2021, with some discrepancies between them. Despite the growing volume of research on lasting symptoms of COVID-19, the definition has not been universally agreed on. This study aimed to describe how post–COVID-19 condition has been defined to date in studies on this topic.

### Clinical features, therapeutic outcomes, and recovery period of long COVID [^7114358c]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the outbreak of COVID‐19 in 2019, several epidemiological studies have found that COVID‐19 subsequently causes sequelae, termed long COVID, in a substantial portion of patients. In a previous study from Italy, some symptoms persisted 60 days after COVID‐19 onset in 87% of patients. Similarly, another large cohort study from China also showed that some complaints remain in 76% of patients with COVID‐19 6 months after onset. Although a majority of patients with long COVID experience highly variable persistent signs and symptoms, such as chronic cough, breathlessness, fatigue, fever, and headache, with uncertain prospects for unknown periods, reliable evidence regarding the clinical features and valid management strategies for long COVID are still lacking.

First, the diagnostic criteria for long COVID differ, depending on the country. According to a summary of UK guidelines, long COVID is separately defined as acute COVID‐19, ongoing symptomatic COVID‐19, and post‐COVID‐19 syndrome based on the duration of symptoms for up to 4 weeks, from 4 weeks to up to 12 weeks and more than 12 weeks from the onset of COVID‐19, respectively. However, the post‐COVID condition is considered in the US guidelines as persistent symptoms lasting over 4 weeks after the first infection. Moreover, a certain standard for long COVID is currently unavailable in Japan.

Compared with the investigations of COVID‐19 itself, the whole picture of long COVID, which is a multisystem disorder after an initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, is not less well understood. Therefore, the clinical course of long COVID has been unpredictable, and the ability to obtain relevant information regarding suitable approaches and a more certain future has not been feasible. In addition, the other problems of long COVID would be its low awareness and its difficulty in quantitative evaluation because the chief complaints of long COVID are mainly not objective but subjective symptoms. As a result, long COVID has already caused an untoward impact on communities, such as unfair discrimination from neighbors or retirement from a company, in addition to medical issues. In summary, an unmet medical need for a better understanding and characterization of long COVID outcomes and its multidisciplinary approach certainly exists.

### The COPE study: pilot intervention to improve symptom… [^f5792822]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

The COPE Study: Pilot Intervention to Improve Symptom Self-management and Coping in Adults With Post COVID-19ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection, also referred to as Post-COVID, is an emerging condition with debilitating symptoms relevant to rehabilitation medicine. Post-COVID has been described as the "next national health disaster". The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe Post COVID as a wide range of physical and mental health symptoms lasting four or more weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some of the most common and disabling symptoms include, fatigue, memory issues, pain-related symptoms, insomnia, and shortness of breath. In addition to these physical symptoms, many patients with Post-COVID report co-occurring mental health concerns, including anxiety and depression. It is believed that over 100 million people worldwide currently experience or have experienced Post COVID.

Importantly, this condition can be debilitating and disabling
- nearly one in five people reported not working as a direct result of Post COVID. Psychosocial self-management interventions are a promising treatment for helping people with Post COVID manage their symptoms and engage in adaptive coping. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for Post COVID, and it is unclear at what timepoint patients will recover or what proportion of patients will recover. Given the variability and chronicity of Post COVID symptoms, self-management interventions could be particularly beneficial. Research on patient populations with similar symptom profiles as Post COVID suggests that psychosocial interventions like self-management can reduce symptom severity and interference and improve coping.

This randomized controlled pilot trial will use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and initial effects of a telemedicine group-based intervention designed to improve symptom management and coping in adults with Post-COVID. The study objectives include:

- To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a telemedicine group-based intervention for improving symptom management and coping in adults with Post-COVID.
- To examine initial effects of a telemedicine group-based intervention on Post-COVID symptom management and adaptive coping.
- To understand intervention participants' perceptions of the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and perceived effectiveness of the Post-COVID intervention and their recommendations for improving the intervention. Behavioral: 6-Week Self-Management Group

### Evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms during the first 12 months after illness onset [^f30fc700]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Study Population

Participant enrolment and follow-up is summarized in Supplementary Figure 1. Between 11 May 2020 and 1 May 2021, 342 participants were enrolled, most (251/343;73%) prospectively. Of these 342, 99 (29%) experienced mild, 145 (42%) moderate, 56 (16%) severe and 42 (12%) critical disease (Table 1). All participants had prior confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR or antigen testing upon enrolment; none were enrolled solely on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Participants with severe or critical disease were older than those with mild or moderate disease (P < .001), had higher BMI (P < .001) and more frequently had a diagnosis of CVD, CLD, or DM (Table 1). Median time from illness onset to enrolment was 9 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 5–14) for prospectively enrolled and 85 days (IQR = 72–94) for retrospectively enrolled participants. Until 1 June 2021, 66 participants were lost to follow-up. Two deaths, both due to COVID-19, occurred during follow-up.

Table 1.
Sociodemographic, Clinical and Study Characteristics of Participants of the RECoVERED Study, May 2020–2021 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, by Clinical Severity Group

Incidence Proportions and Severity of Symptoms During the Acute Phase of Infection

Fatigue and cough were the most frequently reported symptoms overall and their incidence proportion during the acute phase did not differ between clinical severity groups (Supplementary Table 1). The incidence proportions of dyspnea, headache, and diarrhea were significantly greater in those with severe/critical disease compared to those with mild or moderate disease during the acute phase of disease, whereas the opposite was true for loss of appetite, fever, rhinorrhea, and sore throat. Transition plots showed that although most participants transitioned to a lower level of severity over time for the more persistent symptoms (fatigue, dyspnoea, loss of smell and/or taste, and myalgia), some transitioned to a higher severity level over time (Supplementary Figure 3a–3d).

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing excludes significant disease in patients recovering from COVID-19 [^a3706984]. BMJ Military Health (2024). High credibility.

While persistent symptoms may be similar, a key challenge faced by clinicians managing patients following COVID-19 is the need to discriminate symptoms that are caused by physical organ damage, such as lung fibrosis and myocarditis, from those caused by postviral fatigue, which have different treatment pathways. This diagnostic dilemma is exacerbated by coexisting health anxiety, relating to concerns regarding employment, health and well-being. It is further complicated by the association of SARS-CoV-2 with autonomic dysregulation. Such 'dysregulation' is evidenced by the finding of abnormal heart rate responses to exercise in a high proportion of post-COVID patients in the absence of demonstrable structural pathology in the heart and lungs.

Clinical testing of exercise capacity is an objective, cheap, reproducible, safe and prognostically powerful means to stratify clinical risk, especially in high-hazard occupations.CPET and invasive CPET have been used to investigate the nature of exertional limitation in post-COVID cohorts. The two small CPET studies (10 and 18 patients, respectively), which measured cardiac output concluded that exertional limitation results from impaired peripheral oxygen uptake. To date, no study has reported the diagnostic potential of post-COVID CPET findings in the prediction of persistent cardiopulmonary abnormalities. We hypothesised that CPET would be able to predict clinically significant lung and heart disease in patients recovering from COVID-19.

### Long-term effects of COVID-19 on the cardiopulmonary system in adults and children: current status and questions to be resolved by the National Institutes of Health researching COVID to enhance recovery initiative [^e93d5f08]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Long COVID may occur in at least 10% of patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection and often is associated with debilitating symptoms. Among the organ systems that might be involved in its pathogenesis, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems may be central to common symptoms seen in survivors of COVID-19, including fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, and exercise intolerance. Understand the exact symptomatology, causes, and effects of long COVID on the heart and lungs may help us to discover new therapies. To that end, the National Institutes of Health is sponsoring a national study population of diverse volunteers to support large-scale studies on the long-term effects of COVID-19.

Review Findings

The National Institutes of Health Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) initiative currently is recruiting participants in the United States to answer critical questions about long COVID. The study comprises adult and pediatric cohorts as well as an electronic health record cohort. Based on symptoms, individuals undergo prespecified medical testing to understand whether abnormalities can be detected and are followed up longitudinally. Herein, we outline current understanding of the clinical symptoms and pathophysiologic features of long COVID with respect to the cardiopulmonary system in adults and children and then determine how the clinical, electronic health record, and autopsy cohorts of the RECOVER initiative will attempt to answer the most pressing questions surrounding the long-term effects of COVID-19.

Summary

Data generated from the RECOVER initiative will provide guidance about missing gaps in our knowledge about long COVID and how they might be filled by data gathered through the RECOVER initiative.

### A clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition by a Delphi consensus [^8df17e09]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for long COVID, more specifically with respect to definition, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to define post-COVID-19 as a condition in patients with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with symptoms (including fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, and other symptoms affecting everyday functioning; either with a new onset after initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persisting from the initial illness; fluctuating or relapsing over time) lasting for at least 2 months, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, not explained by an alternative diagnosis.

### Work disability prevention and management [^e0e58d5c]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19–related disability and rehabilitation — COVID-19 may cause numerous significant adverse effects and, among those treated as outpatients, persistent symptoms lasting more than 6 months including fatigue, dyspnea, joint pain, chest pain, cough, anosmia, and cognitive and executive function impairments. Drawing on similar conditions, there is significant risk of delayed return to work and long-term disability, as approximately 50% of individuals surviving ARDS have not returned to work after 1 year. Evaluation often requires cardiac, respiratory, and neurological impairment measures; rehabilitative strategies targeting impairments are indicated and are typically multimodal. Some preliminary randomized clinical trials suggest CBT is indicated for ongoing post COVID-19 symptoms, particularly with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and PTSD, and employer support for recovery is believed to be critical by analogy with other conditions.

### Use of symptom-guided physical activity and exercise rehabilitation for COVID-19 and other postviral conditions [^40019e34]. BMJ Military Health (2024). High credibility.

There are many similarities in symptoms between postviral conditions, including clinical features such as fatigue, reduced daily activity and postexertional symptom exacerbation. Unfavourable responses to exercise have influenced the wider debate on how to reintegrate physical activity (PA) and exercise while simultaneously managing symptoms during recovery from post-COVID-19 syndrome (or Long COVID). This has resulted in inconsistent advice from the scientific and clinical rehabilitation community on how and when to resume PA and exercise following COVID-19 illness. This article provides commentary on the following topics: (1) controversies surrounding graded exercise therapy as a treatment modality for post-COVID-19 rehabilitation; (2) evidence supporting PA promotion, resistance exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness for population health, and the consequences of physical inactivity in patients with complex rehabilitation needs; (3) population-based challenges for UK Defence Rehabilitation practitioners for the management of postviral conditions; and (4) 'symptom guided PA and exercise rehabilitation' as an appropriate treatment option for managing individuals with multifaceted medical needs.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^a85c0803]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Combination treatments

One trial (n = 585 patients) in patients with general long covid symptoms and a history of severe covid-19, evaluated a combined physical and mental health rehabilitation programme versus usual care (single session of online advice and support). This intervention was delivered online over eight weeks by exercise physiologists, physiotherapists, and health psychologists and consisted of weekly live, supervised, group exercise and psychological support sessions that focused on motivation, fear avoidance, managing emotions, fatigue, and stress and anxiety. Supplement 30 presents the GRADE summary of findings table.

Moderate certainty evidence suggested that a combined programme of physical and mental health rehabilitation probably increases the proportion of patients who experience recovery or important improvements (161 more per 1000 patients, 95% CI 61 more to 292 more) and probably improves quality of life (mean difference 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08; PROMIS 29+2 Profile v2.1; range −0.022–1; higher scores indicate less impairment) versus providing one session of advice and support. Moderate certainty evidence also suggested that physical and mental health rehabilitation probably has little or no effect on physical and cognitive function. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that physical and mental health rehabilitation probably reduces symptoms of depression but may have little or no effect on symptoms of anxiety. No compelling evidence of benefit on fatigue, pain, or dyspnoea was found. We are very uncertain of the effects of the programme on serious adverse events.

Conclusion

Moderate certainty evidence suggests that a programme of CBT probably reduces fatigue and improves cognitive function in patients with long covid, and a programme of physical and mental health rehabilitation probably increases the proportion of patients who experience recovery or important improvements.

### Recovery of fatigue, cardiorespiratory fitness, and neuromuscular function in COVID-19 ICU patients: a 6-month follow-up study [^4c69a46d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although most patients recover well from Covid-19 infection, this may not be the case of those who experienced severe dysfunction after being admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to assess the recovery of patients who experienced severe multiple dysfunctions after being admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for Covid-19 infection.

Methods

Forty-seven patients hospitalized and mechanically ventilated in ICU for SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent evaluations at 4–8 weeks (T1) and 6 months (T2) post ICU discharge. Evaluations included questionnaires, lung function tests, incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and neuromuscular function tests.

Results

From T1 to T2, the percentage of patients classified as fatigued decreased from 56% to 21% whereas forced vital capacity and the forced expiratory volume in one second increased by 13% and 8% (p < 0.05) to reach 93% and 95% of predicted values at T2, respectively. Peak work rate also increased from 97 to 135 W (+35 ± 32%, p < 0.001). Likewise, V̇O2peak increased from 18.3 to 21.6 ml/min/kg (+18 ± 27%, p < 0.001) to reach 72% of predicted values. Maximal strength and the number of contractions during the fatigability test increased between T1 and T2 by 41% and 39%, respectively (both p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Six months of recovery improved patients' physical function and reduced fatigue.

### Effect of remdesivir post hospitalization for COVID-19 infection from the randomized SOLIDARITY Finland trial [^adbb8025]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We report the first long-term follow-up of a randomized trial (NCT04978259) addressing the effects of remdesivir on recovery (primary outcome) and other patient-important outcomes one year after hospitalization resulting from COVID-19. Of the 208 patients recruited from 11 Finnish hospitals, 198 survived, of whom 181 (92%) completed follow-up. At one year, self-reported recovery occurred in 85% in remdesivir and 86% in standard of care (SoC) (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.47–1.90). We infer no convincing difference between remdesivir and SoC in quality of life or symptom outcomes (p > 0.05). Of the 21 potential long-COVID symptoms, patients reported moderate/major bother from fatigue (26%), joint pain (22%), and problems with memory (19%) and attention/concentration (18%). In conclusion, after a one-year follow-up of hospitalized patients, one in six reported they had not recovered well from COVID-19. Our results provide no convincing evidence of remdesivir benefit, but wide confidence intervals included possible benefit and harm.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, veterans reported high rates of ongoing fatigue, pain, and disability after the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of history of COVID-19. There were no statistically significant results between these symptoms and COVID-19 illness. These results highlight the importance of acknowledging and addressing the broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health beyond those directly associated with documented infection.

### Long-term symptom severity and clinical biomarkers in post-COVID-19 / chronic fatigue syndrome: results from a prospective observational cohort [^ad093fef]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We here provide a comprehensive longitudinal characterization of the post-COVID-19 condition in patients with pronounced fatigue and exertion intolerance over a period of 20 months following COVID-19. All patients suffered from PCS with a subgroup fulfilling the CCC for ME/CFS.

While both patients with PCS and PCS-ME/CFS continued to report post-COVID-19 symptoms throughout the observation period, clinical improvement was observed to variable degrees and mostly restricted to the non-ME/CFS sub-cohort. This is in line with Tran et al.who monitored symptom evolution in patients with persisting symptoms after acute COVID-19 based on an online survey over a 12-month period. The proportion of patients with persisting symptoms in their cohort was about 85%. After an initial decrease, symptoms plateaued 6–8 months after onset. Consistently, Seeβle et al. reported that neurocognitive deficits following COVID-19 can persist beyond 12 months and lead to a marked reduction of quality of life.

We here showed that patients fulfilling criteria for ME/CFS continued to be more affected than patients with PCS by a wide range of symptoms including fatigue, physical disability, impaired social functioning, and emotional well-being. Importantly, exertion intolerance and PEM as the hallmark of post-infectious fatigue syndromes remained more pronounced in PCS-ME/CFS up to 20 months after initial infection. However, the extent of PEM did not improve in either cohort. Considering this persistence of PEM in most patients with PCS, our study provides evidence that despite early diagnosis, prognosis is poor for most patients. Due to the lack of effective causal therapies, non-pharmacological interventions are important. This includes symptom management by determining individual activity limits and balancing rest and activity (i.e. pacing). It is, however, important that pacing is approached with caution to yield beneficial effects and overseen by trained personnel to avoid over-exertion and rebound effects of symptom worsening. All patients in this study were seen in specialist outpatient clinics and received recommendations for symptomatic treatment and self-management strategies. However, symptomatic therapy in ME/CFS requires prompt clinical follow-ups, which have not been available for many patients due to a lack of knowledge among most primary care physicians. We are currently evaluating in a clinical trial if comprehensive care and close monitoring can improve physical functions and well-being in patients with ME/CFS.

### Additive benefit of rehabilitation on physical status, symptoms and mental health after hospitalisation for severe COVID-19 pneumonia [^ed27d77c]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed worldwide more than half a billion of cumulative cases and 7 million deaths and numbers are still rising every day. A significant proportion of these patients, ranging from 10% in the general populationup to 76% in hospitalised patientssuffer from a diversity of symptoms persisting for 5–12 months from disease onset. These symptoms include fatigue and muscle weakness, mental health issues (anxiety, depression, sleeping difficulties), cognitive impairment including memory loss and concentration disorders, shortness of breath, chest pain and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Fatigue is a cardinal symptom of post-COVID-19 patients. The majority of patients report worse symptoms after hospitalisationthat persist a year after. Even after discharge from an inpatient rehabilitation programme, post-COVID-19 patients suffer from a significant reduction in physical function, and the ability to perform daily activities; however, fatigue and respiratory symptoms significantly improve. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and the Royal College of General Practitioners in the UK defined this cluster of symptoms persisting for more than 12 weeks as 'post-COVID-19 syndrome'.NICE and the latest European Respiratory Society (ERS) statement integrate these definitions to describe patients with ongoing symptomatic or post-COVID syndrome using the term 'long-COVID'.

### Post-COVID-19 assessment in a specialist clinical service: a 12-month, single-centre, prospective study in 1325 individuals [^d27abf97]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Post-COVID-19 complications require simultaneous characterisation and management to plan policy and health system responses. We describe the 12-month experience of the first UK dedicated post-COVID-19 clinical service to include hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients.

Methods

In a single-centre, observational analysis, we report the demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, investigations, treatments, functional recovery, specialist referral and rehabilitation of 1325 individuals assessed at the University College London Hospitals post-COVID-19 service between April 2020 and April 2021, comparing by referral route: posthospitalised (PH), non-hospitalised (NH) and post emergency department (PED). Symptoms associated with poor recovery or inability to return to work full time were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

1325 individuals were assessed (PH: 547, 41.3%; PED: 212, 16%; NH: 566, 42.7%). Compared with the PH and PED groups, the NH group were younger (median 44.6 (35.6–52.8) years vs 58.3 (47.0–67.7) years and 48.5 (39.4–55.7) years), more likely to be female (68.2%, 43.0% and 59.9%), less likely to be of ethnic minority (30.9%, 52.7% and 41.0%) or seen later after symptom onset (median (IQR): 194 (118–298) days, 69 (51–111) days and 76 (55–128) days; all p < 0.0001). All groups had similar rates of onward specialist referral (NH 18.7%, PH 16.1% and PED 18.9%, p = 0.452) and were more likely to require support for breathlessness (23.7%, 5.5% and 15.1%, p < 0.001) and fatigue (17.8%, 4.8% and 8.0%, p < 0.001). Hospitalised patients had higher rates of pulmonary emboli, persistent lung interstitial abnormalities and other organ impairment. 716 (54.0%) individuals reported < 75% optimal health (median 70%, IQR 55%–85%). Less than half of employed individuals could return to work full time at first assessment.

Conclusion

Post-COVID-19 symptoms were significant in PH and NH patients, with significant ongoing healthcare needs and utilisation. Trials of interventions and patient-centred pathways for diagnostic and treatment approaches are urgently required.

### Safety, tolerability and clinical effects of rovunaptabin, also known as BC007 on fatigue and quality of life in patients with post-COVID syndrome (reCOVer): a prospective, exploratory, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised phase IIa clinical trial (RCT) [^4dbbf01e]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rovunaptabin neutralises functional autoantibodies targeting G-Protein coupled receptors (GPCR-fAAbs), observed in patients with Post-COVID syndrome. As we hypothesise an improvement of PCS by rovunaptabin, the aim of reCOVer was to investigate safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of rovunaptabin in PCS patients.

Methods

reCOVer is a prospective, exploratory, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised phase IIa clinical investigator initiated trial with 1350 mg rovunaptabin with additional cross-over at the Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Germany. The trial was registered in EudraCT, 2022-001781-35. Screening was done between 21·11·2023 and 25·06·2024. Eligible participants (18–80 years) showed GPCR-fAAbs, at least 3/8 defined PCS symptoms persisting ≥ 3 months after COVID-19 and fatigue as major symptom. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either receive rovunaptabin or placebo at day 0 (d0) and d48 with a follow-up of 28 days, respectively. Primary endpoint was the number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) at d28 (co-primary endpoint: TEAE at d70); secondary endpoint focused on fatigue and quality of life.

Findings

Thirty PCS patients were randomised and analysed. RCT analysis showed nine (rovunaptabin) and five TEAEs (placebo), yet without statistically significance (p = 0·1299; CI -14·80%; 63·02%); one serious adverse event, not related to treatment, was recorded. Rovunaptabin showed a neutralisation of GPCR-fAAb and a significant improvement of FACIT Fatigue Scale (effect size = 2·10, p = 0·0378), Bell score (effect size = 3·64, p = 0·0004), Fatigue Severity Scale (effect size = -2·66, p = 0·0088), and quality of life (4/8 items).

Interpretation

As this proof-of-concept study showed effects on the patient-centred endpoint PCS and a good safety profil, subsequent studies are needed to confirm these results in a larger cohort.

### Safety, tolerability and clinical effects of rovunaptabin, also known as BC007 on fatigue and quality of life in patients with post-COVID syndrome (reCOVer): a prospective, exploratory, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised phase IIa clinical trial (RCT) [^f43e1f8d]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Rovunaptabin neutralises functional autoantibodies targeting G-Protein coupled receptors (GPCR-fAAbs), observed in patients with Post-COVID syndrome. As we hypothesise an improvement of PCS by rovunaptabin, the aim of reCOVer was to investigate safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of rovunaptabin in PCS patients.

Methods

### Persistence of symptoms after improvement of acute COVID19 infection, a longitudinal study [^4803d630]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

With the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients increasing all over the world, a large number of survivors have reported changes in their quality of life or experienced re-infection. So, we aimed to detect the percentage, type, and risk factors of persistent symptoms after improvement from acute COVID-19 infection and to detect the percentage of COVID-19 re-infection and degree of severity of the second infection. One hundred seventy-two (59 male, 113 female) patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were followed up via mobile phone every 2 months for 8 to 10 months. After recovery, 105 patients (61%) (30 male, 75 female) reported one or more COVID-19 persistent symptoms. Fatigue, dyspnea, and depression were the most common persistent symptoms representing 37.3%, 22%, 22%, respectively. We found that age was independently related to the persistence of symptoms. During the follow-up, six females (3.5%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 re-infection. Their mean age was 35.7 ± 11 years. The mean interval from the complete recovery of the first infection to the onset of the second one was 53 ± 22.2 days and ranged from 30 to 90 days. The second infection was milder in severity than the first infection in 83.33% of cases. There was a high percentage of patients who complained of persistent symptoms after recovery from COVID-19. Fatigue and headache were the most common persistent symptoms. Age was considered a risk factor for persistent symptoms. Re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 can occur after recovery.

### Assessment of psychosocial aspects in adults in post-COVID-19 condition: the EURONET-SOMA recommendations on core outcome domains for clinical and research use [^21a3626d]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-COVID-19 condition or syndrome (often referred to as Long COVID) is the term coined by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the development or continuation of new symptoms 12 weeks after an acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, with these symptoms lasting for more than 2 months and not explained by an alternative diagnosis. With 6–10% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals reporting long-lasting symptoms, at least 75 million people are affected globally. With a wide variety of more than 200 symptoms reported, post-COVID-19 condition seems an urgent, complex, and massive healthcare problem. Recent studies on post-COVID-19 have identified several prevalent symptoms that persist for up to 2 years after infection: Commonly reported symptoms include fatigue, observed in approximately 28% of cases, and neurocognitive issues such as memory difficulties, dizziness, and brain fog, affecting around 28% of patients. Other symptoms like sleep disturbances (21%), depression (18%), anxiety (13%), and pain (8%) have also been frequently documented among COVID-19 survivors. Given the high variability in these estimates, which reflect diverse populations and study methodologies, we refer readers to recent meta-analyses such as Fernández-de-las-Peñas et al. for a detailed prevalence breakdown of post-COVID-19 symptoms. These symptoms significantly reduce health recovery, everyday functioning, and work capacity 6–12 months post-infection, even in young people with initially mild disease. Since our understanding of and existing treatment options for post-COVID-19 condition are limited, further research and new approaches are necessary. While the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically described with a focus on the immunological processes and growing evidence shows the relevance of biological changes, such as persistent alterations in the brainstem of post-COVID-19 patients, the chronic course of post-COVID-19 condition requires a broad biopsychosocial perspective that considers the biological (e.g. immunological) and the psychosocial factors that can contribute to or result from the clinical condition. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis has confirmed the relevance of depression and anxiety as co-occurring phenomena and predictive factors of post-COVID-19, but has dramatically shown the scarcity of available evidence on broader psychosocial predictors.

### Predictors of non-recovery from fatigue and cognitive deficits after COVID-19: a prospective, longitudinal, population-based study [^315bcc5f]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, long-COVID has become a major health issue, with an estimated 65 million long-COVID patients globally. Fatigue and cognitive deficits are amongst the most common sequelae, affecting approximately 19% and 26% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, respectively. These sequelae are also among the most debilitating conditions and are associated with decreased quality of life and social participation, and delayed return to work.

However, little is known about the long-term trajectories of these sequelae. Electronic health record data suggest that the incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia remains increased during the first two years after infection, compared to both healthy controls and patients with other respiratory infections. However, these data often fail to capture fatigue, as it is known to be underdiagnosed and uncertainty exists about which diagnosis to encode in health records.

Most of the available data stem from previously hospitalized patients. One study found that fatigue prevalence increased from 22% to 34% during the first 12 months after hospital discharge, while another study showed a decrease in fatigue between 4 and 24 months after discharge. However, hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be substantially older than non-hospitalized patients, suffer from more severe disease courses, often have relevant pre-infection comorbidities, and many suffer from treatment-related side effects or complications. Findings from hospital cohorts therefore cannot be extrapolated to the majority of COVID patients who do not require hospitalization.

Population-based studies using validated instruments are better suited to accurately depict how post-COVID fatigue and cognitive deficits develop over time in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. Longitudinal population-based reports, however, remain scarce. Ballouz and colleagues assessed symptom trajectories in a large Swiss cohort and found that fatigue and post-exertional malaise decreased in prevalence from 6 to 12 months after infection, but then remained stable at about 15% and 12% respectively. Interestingly, the proportion of patients scoring above the cutoff for fatigue on the Fatigue Assessment Scale remained stable around 38% between 6 and 24 months after infection. A recent study in a UK cohort found small but significant decreases in cognitive accuracy that persisted for almost two years after infection.

Addressing Prognostic Uncertainty and Long-Term Concerns.

The long-term impacts of COVID-19 are relevant. However, the specific outcomes of most importance were uncertain because of the lack of data on longer-term outcomes. Patients wanted to know about time to recovery — "what is worrying me now is post viral fatigue and recovery, because it's been a very long time since I've spent two weeks in bed, and I'm showing no signs of being strong enough to even function in the house, never mind go back to work. That's what's concerning me about a long-term recovery is that kind of post viral thing". Health professionals suggested that recovery should be a core outcome — "I was surprised to not see recovery as a core outcome in the first category". Participants suggested consideration of ongoing symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and cough — "I'm in day 35 and I'm still struggling with shortness of breath". Some patients were concerned about long-term impacts on lung health (e.g. lung function, lung scarring) — "I am really scared when they do tell me that I can go and get an x-ray, what my lungs are going to show because I've never had that kind of chest pain and shortness of breath before". Long-term outcomes were relevant to make trade-offs in decision-making — "imagine a kind of discrete choice experiment to decide, 'do we ventilate harder to get the patient off the ventilator sooner, but risk more pulmonary fibrosis long-term?' There's a balance between the acute outcomes and the long-term consequences".

### Return to work and health-related quality of life up to 1 year in patients hospitalized for COVID-19: the CO-FLOW study [^eb5cbf2d]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Other effective interventions for improving return to work and HRQoL among individuals with chronic diseases and mental health conditions encompassed a multidisciplinary approach that addresses person-level components, such as symptom coping mechanisms, skills training, and goal establishment, and work-directed interventions involving adaption and evaluation of working task, schedule, and environment. These strategies, proven effective in previous contexts, hold promise for potential applicability among patients recovering from COVID-19.

Other studies on patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and on non-COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome survivors showed that 12–18% and 17%, respectively, of patients did not return to work at 12 months comparable to our findings. We also found that 19% (48/251) of patients who returned to work at 12 months worked less hours than pre-hospitalization; Huang et al. reported an even higher proportion of 24%. These findings suggest that COVID-19 could hinder patients' ability to perform at pre-hospitalization levels for up to 12 months after discharge.

People who did not return or partially returned to work reported a significantly lower HRQoL compared with those who fully returned, which is in agreement with the literature, although the direction of this association is unknown. Return to work was independently associated with PCS, but not with MCS. This could be due to the emphasis on work performance in the physical domains of the SF-36, which are more heavily weighed in PCS. Other factors independently associated with PCS were a history of obesity, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, female sex, persistent fatigue, and lower physical fitness. MCS was associated with depression and persistent fatigue.

Persistent fatigue was independently associated with return to work and HRQoL, consistent with other studies, and reflecting the most common post-COVID-19 symptom. Post-COVID-19 fatigue is a multidimensional construct, affecting patients' physical and mental health, and remains poorly understood. Post-COVID-19 fatigue is associated with shortness of breath, psychological distress, cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety. Treatment options, e.g. vocational rehabilitation programs that focus on energy management and pacing, could be beneficial to manage fatigue. Moreover, physical rehabilitation could help improve physical fitness, and cognitive and psychological support could provide symptom relief. These interventions could promote a successful return to work and improve HRQoL. Overall, further research into post-COVID-19 fatigue is essential to develop effective treatment options.

### Long covid-mechanisms, risk factors, and management [^996fe22f]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, covid-19 has spread and had a profound effect on the lives and health of people around the globe. As of 4 July 2021, more than 183 million confirmed cases of covid-19 had been recorded worldwide, and 3.97 million deaths. Recent evidence has shown that a range of persistent symptoms can remain long after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition is now coined long covid by recognized research institutes. Studies have shown that long covid can affect the whole spectrum of people with covid-19, from those with very mild acute disease to the most severe forms. Like acute covid-19, long covid can involve multiple organs and can affect many systems including, but not limited to, the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. The symptoms of long covid include fatigue, dyspnea, cardiac abnormalities, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, muscle pain, concentration problems, and headache. This review summarizes studies of the long term effects of covid-19 in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients and describes the persistent symptoms they endure. Risk factors for acute covid-19 and long covid and possible therapeutic options are also discussed.

### Post-COVID syndrome: a single-center questionnaire study on 1007 participants recovered from COVID-19 [^6985851b]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Post recovery manifestations have become another concern in patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Numerous reports have shown that COVID-19 has a variety of long-term effects on almost all systems including respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, psychiatric, and dermatological systems. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of the post-COVID syndrome among COVID-19 survivors and to determine the factors associated with persistent symptoms. This prospective study enrolled in patients with COVID-19 followed in hospital or outpatient clinics in Ankara City Hospital. We performed a special questionnaire to inquire about the presence of persistent symptoms beyond 12 weeks from the first diagnosis. Demographic data, comorbid diseases, characteristics of acute COVID-19, presence of persistent symptoms by systems, and knowledge about outpatient clinic visits after recovery were assessed. Of a total of 1007 participants, 39.0% had at least one comorbidity, and 47.5% had persistent symptoms. Fatigue/easy fatigability, myalgia, and loss of weight were the most frequent persistent symptoms (overall 29.3%) followed by respiratory symptoms (25.4%). A total of 235 participants had visited outpatient clinics due to several reasons during the post-COVID-19 period, and 17 of them were hospitalized. Severe acute COVID-19, hospitalization, and presence of comorbidity were independent factors for the development of persistent symptoms. Fully understanding the spectrum of the post-COVID syndrome is essential for appropriate management of all its long-term effects. Our study once again underlined the fact that the prevalence of post-COVID syndrome is higher than expected and concerns many systems, and a multidisciplinary follow-up should be provided to COVID-19 survivors in the post recovery period.

### Estimates of incidence and predictors of fatiguing illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^dae53b0f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In our unadjusted analyses, patients with COVID-19 who had incident fatigue were at higher risk for hospitalization and death than were persons without incident fatigue. The severe outcome is likely driven, at least in part, by some of the comorbidities and predictors identified in this study. Elevated death rate was previously reported among fatigued patients without COVID-19 (HR 1.45). Increased awareness of fatigue and other PCC is warranted to enable patients to seek early care when needed. Further research is also warranted to investigate the causes and preventive measures for the severe outcomes associated with post-COVID fatigue.

In conclusion, our data indicate that COVID-19 is associated with a significant increase in new fatigue diagnoses, and physicians should be aware that fatigue might occur or be newly recognized > 1 year after acute COVID-19. Future study is needed to better understand the possible association between fatigue and clinical outcomes. The high incidence rates of fatigue reinforce the need for public health actions to prevent infections, to provide clinical care to those in need, and to find effective treatments for post–acute COVID-19 fatigue.

### Predictors of non-recovery from fatigue and cognitive deficits after COVID-19: a prospective, longitudinal, population-based study [^750db214]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While the MoCA is an excellent screening tool for cognitive deficits, it does not offer the same diagnostic accuracy as a detailed neuropsychological assessment. A recent study in patients after COVID-19 found that the MoCA had a sensitivity of only 50% for cognitive deficits detected using a comprehensive cognitive test battery, while specificity (83%) and positive predictive value (82%) were relatively high. This suggests that subtle cognitive deficits may not be detected by the MoCA in patients after COVID and that the frequency of cognitive deficits in our study may underestimate the actual prevalence. Future studies should therefore assess post-COVID cognitive deficits with more detailed neuropsychological assessments.

Risk factors for non-recovery from cognitive deficits were older age, male sex, and less than 12 years of school education. As such, pre-infection characteristics best predicted cognitive non-recovery and no COVID-specific risk factors showed significant associations. This suggests that cognitive deficits largely depend on pre-existing general factors. In many cases, COVID-19 may unmask or exacerbate neurodegenerative processes that could already be ongoing before infection. At the same time, it is crucial to investigate in more detail additional factors that contribute to the development and persistence of cognitive deficits. These may include biological factors such as serum markers of inflammation or structural and functional brain changes that can be investigated with neuroimaging.

Notably, only 6% suffered from both fatigue and cognitive deficits, which is consistent with earlier results from the first 1000 participants of this cohort. This suggests that the two syndromes are distinct in terms of who is affected and potentially also in their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Interestingly, a similar proportion improved and score improvements showed similarly large effect sizes in the two patient groups. This suggests a similar degree of reversibility for symptoms of fatigue and cognitive deficits.

Given that there are over 275 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe alone, an extrapolation from our findings would suggest that up to 100 million of them may suffer from clinically relevant levels of fatigue, cognitive deficits or both, 6–12 months after infection. Two years after infection, there may still be up to 50 million affected by these syndromes in Europe. This situation has recently been described as a "burgeoning public health crisis" and may entail that millions of people could not return to work, suffer from a reduced quality of life and impaired social participation. Hence, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms involved and to develop effective therapies.

### A review of the sequelae of post COVID-19 with neurological implications (post-viral syndrome) [^e871b168]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Post Covid-19 conditions represent a medical challenge; a unified definition is not achieved after 5 years of the Pandemic. The incidence of Post Covid-19 conditions varies, nevertheless the neurological complications represent an important aspect in the spectrums of fields involved. The current perception is that varied manifestations and long-term complications of COVID-19 reflect underlying pathophysiological processes, including inflammatory, immune-mediated, and vascular mechanisms. These mechanisms underscore the complexity of COVID-19's impact including the nervous system and its potential for lasting effects. A number of symptoms are extremely severe and may also need neurologic attention including fatigue, cognitive disturbances, autonomic symptoms, headache, and sleep disorders. Post Covid-19 conditions are often of chronic nature. Management as in other chronic conditions should rely on the conventional diagnostic measures and management of symptoms irrespective of the temporal relation to the viral infection. To date Post Covid-19 conditions is only accepted as an additional or explanatory diagnosis.

Methods

Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infections Registry (INSPIRE) is a prospective study including eight participating major health care systems, * designed to assess long-term symptoms and outcomes among persons with COVID-like illness at study enrollment who received a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result †, §, (COVID test–positive or COVID test–negative participants, respectively). Participants could report subsequent SARS-CoV-2 positive test results at each follow-up survey. Participants who completed baseline and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up surveys were included to facilitate distinguishing between emerging and ongoing symptoms. Outcomes included self-reported symptoms across eight symptom categories: 1) head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT); 2) constitutional; 3) pulmonary; 4) musculoskeletal; 5) gastrointestinal; 6) cardiovascular; 7) cognitive difficulties; and 8) extreme fatigue (based on fatigue severity scales, which measure the occurrence and severity of eight symptoms associated with postinfectious syndrome; scores range from 10 to 80 and scores ≥ 25 correspond with previously established threshold for extreme fatigue)., †† At each period, a participant was defined as having a persistent symptom if he or she had the symptom at that visit and all previous periods. Emerging symptoms were those present at a given time point but not present at the previous time point, including symptoms that resolved and reemerged after an absence.

### Recovery and symptom trajectories up to two years after SARS-CoV-2 infection: population based, longitudinal cohort study [^637f7a6f]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Secondary outcomes included the point prevalence and severity of 23 symptoms at months 6, 12, 18, and 24 (supplementary table 2). Self-perceived severity was assessed using a five point Likert-scale and recategorised into three levels (minimal or mild, moderate, and severe or very severe). We also asked participants to indicate whether they perceived the symptoms to be related to covid-19 to differentiate post-covid-19 symptoms from those due to other reasons. We report the complete wording of questions in supplementary table 3.

We further assessed the trajectories of the relative health status and symptoms between six months and 24 months. For relative health status, we grouped individuals into five categories: continued recovery (ie, recovered at all follow-up time points), improved (improvement in the health status category or in EQ-VAS by ≥ 8 points (corresponding to a minimal important difference)), worsened (deterioration of the health status category or in EQ-VAS by ≥ 8 points), alternating course (alternating periods of recovery and health impairment), and no change (no change in the level of impairment and changes in EQ-VAS of < 8 points). For covid-19 related symptoms, we grouped participants into: continued recovery (symptoms absent at all time points), improved (symptom-free by 24 months), worsened (symptoms absent at six months but reported afterwards), alternating course (symptoms alternatingly present and absent), and no change (symptoms present at all time points).

Additionally, we used scale based assessments to assess adverse health outcomes including fatigue (score ≥ 22 on the fatigue assessment scale (FAS)), dyspnoea (grade ≥ 1 on modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC)), depression (score ≥ 10 on depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (DASS-21)), anxiety (score ≥ 8 on DASS-21), and stress (score ≥ 15 on DASS-21), and health related quality of life (ie, impaired mobility, self-care, or usual activities, depression or anxiety, pain or discomfort in the EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument). Score calculation for these assessments followed official guidance, as described previously.

### Core outcome measures for trials in people with coronavirus disease 2019: respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, shortness of breath, and recovery [^8a391878]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness that is life-threatening, largely because of respiratory failure (1–3). Severe and debilitating symptoms, including shortness of breath (dyspnea), are also very common in people with COVID-19 (18–71%) and can often be prolonged (4–12). Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may still be at risk of long-term complications including lung fibrosis (13) and report debilitating ongoing symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, impaired quality of life, and a lingering inability to return to their usual activities (5, 8, 14–16). Patients have reported recovery periods lasting for more than 2 months (17).

In response to the pandemic, there has been a proliferation of trials. However, the wide variability of outcomes included and frequent omission of patient-reported outcomes including quality of life and symptoms can limit the usefulness of trials for decision-making (18–20). The global COVID-19 Core Outcomes Set (COVID-19-COS) initiative was launched in March 2020 (17, 21–23). More than 9300 patients, family members, members of the general public, and health professionals from over 110 countries participated in an international survey and consensus workshops to establish core outcome domains to be reported in trials in people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, regardless of severity of disease (17, 22). Respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, recovery, and mortality were identified as core outcome domains (17, 22). Despite being highly prioritized, these outcomes remain infrequently and inconsistently measured across trials in COVID-19, which limits the relevance and ability to compare the effect of interventions across trials.

Regarding medical management for long COVID, more specifically with respect to management of fatigue, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to assess for and manage exertional desaturation and cardiac impairment following COVID-19 before offering physical exercise training in adult patients with post-COVID-19 condition. Recognize that the presence of orthostatic intolerance and post-exertional symptom exacerbation, although amenable to rehabilitation, will require interventions to be modified in view of these diagnoses for rehabilitation to be safe.

### Medium-term outcomes in severely to critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^6f2aef42]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The strength of our study lies in the larger number of severely ill patients and the longer follow-up to, with comprehensive assessment. In addition, we have developed a service delivering clinical care that is holistic, integrated, coordinated, person-centered, multidisciplinary, and multiprofessional.

In summary, most COVID-19 survivors had good recovery from their illness and complete resolution of laboratory and imaging abnormalities. A significant proportion of patients continue to experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, pain, and reduced quality of life 4–7 months after disease onset. The proportion of patients with residual radiographic and LFT abnormalities is small but significant and will warrant ongoing follow-up to detect developing pulmonary fibrosis.

### Predictors of non-recovery from fatigue and cognitive deficits after COVID-19: a prospective, longitudinal, population-based study [^3b697e0b]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the high prevalence and major disability associated with fatigue and cognitive deficits after SARS-CoV-2 infection, little is known about long-term trajectories of these sequelae. We aimed to assess long-term trajectories of these conditions and to identify risk factors for non-recovery.

Methods

We analyzed longitudinal data from the population-based COVIDOM/NAPKON-POP cohort in Germany. Participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed at least 6 months (baseline) and again at least 18 months (follow-up) after infection using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) Scale (cutoff ≤ 30) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA, cutoff ≤ 25). Predictors of recovery from fatigue or cognitive deficits between assessments were identified through univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. The COVIDOM study is registered at the German registry for clinical studies (DRKS00023742) and at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04679584).

Findings

Between 15 November 2020 and 9 May 2023, a total of 3038 participants were assessed at baseline (median 9 months after infection) and 83% responded to invitations for follow-up (median 26 months after infection). At baseline, 21% (95% confidence interval (CI) [20%, 23%]) had fatigue and 23% (95% CI [22%, 25%]) had cognitive deficits according to cutoff scores on the FACIT-Fatigue or MoCA. Participants with clinically relevant fatigue (at baseline) showed significant improvement in fatigue scores at follow-up (Hedges' g [95% CI] = 0.73 [0.60, 0.87]) and 46% (95% CI [41%, 50%]) had recovered from fatigue. Participants with cognitive deficits showed a significant improvement in cognitive scores (g [95% CI] = 1.12 [0.90, 1.33]) and 57% (95% CI [50%, 64%]) had recovered from cognitive deficits. Patients with fatigue exhibiting a higher depressive symptom burden and/or headache at baseline were significantly less likely to recover. Significant risk factors for cognitive non-recovery were male sex, older age and < 12 years of school education. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 reinfection had no significant impact on recovery from fatigue or cognitive deficits.

Interpretation

Fatigue and cognitive deficits are common sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These syndromes improved over time and about half of the patients recovered within two years. The identified risk factors for non-recovery from fatigue and cognitive deficits could play an important role in shaping targeted strategies for treatment and prevention.

### Predictors of non-recovery from fatigue and cognitive deficits after COVID-19: a prospective, longitudinal, population-based study [^5fd68086]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Despite the high prevalence and major disability associated with fatigue and cognitive deficits after SARS-CoV-2 infection, little is known about long-term trajectories of these sequelae. We aimed to assess long-term trajectories of these conditions and to identify risk factors for non-recovery.

Methods

We analyzed longitudinal data from the population-based COVIDOM/NAPKON-POP cohort in Germany. Participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed at least 6 months (baseline) and again at least 18 months (follow-up) after infection using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) Scale (cutoff ≤ 30) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA, cutoff ≤ 25). Predictors of recovery from fatigue or cognitive deficits between assessments were identified through univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. The COVIDOM study is registered at the German registry for clinical studies (DRKS00023742) and at.

Findings

Between 15 November 2020 and 9 May 2023, a total of 3038 participants were assessed at baseline (median 9 months after infection) and 83% responded to invitations for follow-up (median 26 months after infection). At baseline, 21% (95% confidence interval (CI) [20%, 23%]) had fatigue and 23% (95% CI [22%, 25%]) had cognitive deficits according to cutoff scores on the FACIT-Fatigue or MoCA. Participants with clinically relevant fatigue (at baseline) showed significant improvement in fatigue scores at follow-up (Hedges' g [95% CI] = 0.73 [0.60, 0.87]) and 46% (95% CI [41%, 50%]) had recovered from fatigue. Participants with cognitive deficits showed a significant improvement in cognitive scores (g [95% CI] = 1.12 [0.90, 1.33]) and 57% (95% CI [50%, 64%]) had recovered from cognitive deficits. Patients with fatigue exhibiting a higher depressive symptom burden and/or headache at baseline were significantly less likely to recover. Significant risk factors for cognitive non-recovery were male sex, older age and < 12 years of school education. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 reinfection had no significant impact on recovery from fatigue or cognitive deficits.

Interpretation

Fatigue and cognitive deficits are common sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These syndromes improved over time and about half of the patients recovered within two years. The identified risk factors for non-recovery from fatigue and cognitive deficits could play an important role in shaping targeted strategies for treatment and prevention.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^9a1c480c]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Except for fatigue, gastrointestinal and cardio-respiratory symptoms, no data were retrieved on persisting symptoms of other areas for post-viral conditions other than post COVID, and this represents another gap of knowledge. Moreover, it was not possible to estimate the prevalence of symptoms and evaluate the outcomes for definite age sub-groups for post COVID, as almost half of the studies included data on pre-schoolers to adolescents.

While a post-viral condition manifests across various viruses, it remains heterogeneous and further study is needed to better understand this entity. Post-viral fatigue syndrome was a shared feature between post COVID and post EBV conditions in older children and adolescents. Despite long-lasting symptoms, recovery appears to be achieved in more than half of the cases. A better understanding of post COVID as a unique condition, sharing features with other post-viral syndromes, is needed and implicates a multidisciplinary approach and international awareness in children and adolescents. Some interesting points for further investigation would be the eventual rate of recurrence of symptoms after recovery, considering more extended periods of follow-up; the evaluation of possible differences between children with pre-existing conditions before COVID-19 and previously healthy patients, as well as the comparison of the entity of persistent symptoms developed after an asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic acute infection. Moreover, the healthcare burden and socio-economic consequences for children and their families urge further study.

Last, the experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with the surge of post COVID conditions also in pediatric patients, should be adopted as a model for preparedness for future pandemics and to better comprehend the true post-acute burden of other viral infections. The foremost requirement is the establishment of consistent and shareable definitions, as well as a consensus on outcomes, to effectively evaluate patient follow-up and quantify the burden.

### Therapeutics and COVID-19: living guideline, 10 November 2023 [^cd25534e]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for long COVID, more specifically with respect to management of fatigue, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering a combination of education, skills training on energy conservation techniques (such as pacing approaches), and a cautious return to symptom-titrated physical exercise training (in the absence of post-exertional symptom exacerbation) for the clinical rehabilitation management of fatigue in adult patients with post-COVID-19 condition. Consider providing training in the use of assistive products and environmental modifications in patients experiencing levels of fatigue limiting instrumental activities of daily living. Consider offering psychological support to support coping with the symptom.

### Short-and long-term effects of imatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a randomized trial [^514f3f9e]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We studied the short- and long-term effects of imatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Methods

Participants were randomized to receive standard of care (SoC) or SoC with imatinib. Imatinib dosage was 400 mg daily until discharge (max 14 days). Primary outcomes were mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Secondary outcomes included recovery, quality of life and long COVID symptoms at 1 year. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials studying imatinib for 30-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Results

We randomized 156 patients (73 in SoC and 83 in imatinib). Among patients on imatinib, 7.2% had died at 30 days and 13.3% at 1 year, and in SoC, 4.1% and 8.2% (adjusted HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.47–3.90). At 1 year, self-reported recovery occurred in 79.0% in imatinib and in 88.5% in SoC (RR 0.91, 0.78–1.06). We found no convincing difference in quality of life or symptoms. Fatigue (24%) and sleep issues (20%) frequently bothered patients at one year. In the meta-analysis, imatinib was associated with a mortality risk ratio of 0.73 (0.32–1.63; low certainty evidence).

Conclusions

The evidence raises doubts regarding benefit of imatinib in reducing mortality, improving recovery and preventing long COVID symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### Long COVID: an overview [^ed8aaf94]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Long COVID is the collective term to denote persistence of symptoms in those who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

WE searched the pubmed and scopus databases for original articles and reviews. Based on the search result, in this review article we are analyzing various aspects of Long COVID.

Results

Fatigue, cough, chest tightness, breathlessness, palpitations, myalgia and difficulty to focus are symptoms reported in long COVID. It could be related to organ damage, post viral syndrome, post-critical care syndrome and others. Clinical evaluation should focus on identifying the pathophysiology, followed by appropriate remedial measures. In people with symptoms suggestive of long COVID but without known history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, serology may help confirm the diagnosis.

Conclusions

This review will helps the clinicians to manage various aspects of Long COVID.

### Efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019: results of a randomized controlled trial [^05bd9da8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is prevalent and debilitating. This study investigated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for severe fatigue following COVID-19.

Methods

A multicenter, 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands with patients being severely fatigued 3–12 months following COVID-19. Patients (N = 114) were randomly assigned (1:1) to CBT or care as usual (CAU). CBT, targeting perpetuating factors of fatigue, was provided for 17 weeks. The primary outcome was the overall mean difference between CBT and CAU on the fatigue severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength, directly post-CBT or CAU (T1), and after 6 months (T2). Secondary outcomes were differences in proportions of patients meeting criteria for severe and/or chronic fatigue, differences in physical and social functioning, somatic symptoms, and problems concentrating between CBT and CAU.

Results

Patients were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred. Patients who received CBT were significantly less severely fatigued across follow-up assessments than patients receiving CAU (−8.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, −11.9 to −5.8]); P < .001), representing a medium Cohen's d effect size (0.69). The between-group difference in fatigue severity was present at T1 (−9.3 [95% CI, −13.3 to −5.3]) and T2 (−8.4 [95% CI, −13.1 to −3.7]). All secondary outcomes favored CBT. Eight adverse events were recorded during CBT, and 20 during CAU. No serious adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

Among patients, who were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred, CBT was effective in reducing fatigue. The positive effect was sustained at 6-month follow-up.

### Physical health and mental fatigue disability associated with long COVID: baseline results from a US nationwide cohort [^e58c3cd6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Persistent symptoms after severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2; long COVID) occur in 10%-55% of individuals, but the impact on daily functioning and disability remains unquantified.

Methods

To characterize disability associated with long COVID, we analyzed baseline data from an online, US-based cohort study. Adult participants included those reporting a history of COVID-19 (n = 8874) or never having COVID-19 (n = 633) without prior disability. The main outcomes were self-reported physical mobility, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and mental fatigue disability, assessed by measuring 5 disability components: difficulty walking a quarter mile or climbing 10 stairs (mobility), difficulty doing light or heavy housework (IADL), and Wood Mental Fatigue Inventory score (mental fatigue).

Results

Of 7926 participants with long COVID, 65% were classified with at least one disability, as compared with 6% and 14% for resolved COVID and no COVID, respectively. Additionally, 22% were classified as disabled in all 3 categories. Age, prior comorbidity, increased body mass index, female sex, COVID-19 hospitalization, non-white/multi-race were associated with higher disability burden. Dizziness and heavy limbs at infection were associated with disability regardless of hospitalization. Dyspnea and tremors were associated with disability in non-hospitalized individuals. Vaccination was protective against disability.

Conclusions

We observed a high burden of new disability associated with long COVID, which has serious implications for individual and societal health. Longitudinal evaluation of COVID-19 patients is necessary to identify patterns of recovery and treatment options.

### Core outcome measurement instruments for use in clinical and research settings for adults with post-COVID-19 condition: an international Delphi consensus study [^f48a025c]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID) is a new, complex, and poorly understood disorder. A core outcome set (COS) for post-COVID-19 condition in adults has been developed and agreement is now required on the most appropriate measurement instruments for these core outcomes. We conducted an international consensus study involving multidisciplinary experts and people with lived experience of long COVID. The study comprised a literature review to identify measurement instruments for the core outcomes, a three-round online modified Delphi process, and an online consensus meeting to generate a core outcome measurement set (COMS). 594 individuals from 58 countries participated. The number of potential instruments for the 12 core outcomes was reduced from 319 to 19. Consensus was reached for inclusion of the modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale for respiratory outcomes. Measures for two relevant outcomes from a previously published COS for acute COVID-19 were also included: time until death, for survival, and the Recovery Scale for COVID-19, for recovery. Instruments were suggested for consideration for the remaining nine core outcomes: fatigue or exhaustion, pain, post-exertion symptoms, work or occupational and study changes, and cardiovascular, nervous system, cognitive, mental health, and physical outcomes; however, consensus was not achieved for instruments for these outcomes. The recommended COMS and instruments for consideration provide a foundation for the evaluation of post-COVID-19 condition in adults, which should help to optimise clinical care and accelerate research worldwide. Further assessment of this COMS is warranted as new data emerge on existing and novel measurement instruments.

### Long Covid: a global health issue-a prospective, cohort study set in four continents [^69a00366]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

A proportion of people develop Long Covid after acute COVID-19, but with most studies concentrated in high-income countries (HICs), the global burden is largely unknown. Our study aims to characterise long-term COVID-19 sequelae in populations globally and compare the prevalence of reported symptoms in HICs and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Methods

A prospective, observational study in 17 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America, including adults with confirmed COVID-19 assessed at 2 to < 6and 6 to < 12 months post-hospital discharge. A standardised case report form developed by International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium's Global COVID-19 Follow-up working group evaluated the frequency of fever, persistent symptoms, breathlessness (MRC dyspnoea scale), fatigue and impact on daily activities.

Results

Of 11860 participants (median age: 52 (IQR: 41–62) years; 52.1% females), 56.5% were from HICs and 43.5% were from LMICs. The proportion identified with Long Covid was significantly higher in HICs vs LMICs at both assessment time points (69.0% vs 45.3%, p < 0.001; 69.7% vs 42.4%, p < 0.001). Participants in HICs were more likely to report not feeling fully recovered (54.3% vs 18.0%, p < 0.001; 56.8% vs 40.1%, p < 0.001), fatigue (42.9% vs 27.9%, p < 0.001; 41.6% vs 27.9%, p < 0.001), new/persistent fever (19.6% vs 2.1%, p < 0.001; 20.3% vs 2.0%, p < 0.001) and have a higher prevalence of anxiety/depression and impact on usual activities compared with participants in LMICs at 2 to < 6and 6 to < 12 months post-COVID-19 hospital discharge, respectively.

Conclusion

Our data show that Long Covid affects populations globally, manifesting similar symptomatology and impact on functioning in both HIC and LMICs. The prevalence was higher in HICs versus LMICs. Although we identified a lower prevalence, the impact of Long Covid may be greater in LMICs if there is a lack of support systems available in HICs. Further research into the aetiology of Long Covid and the burden in LMICs is critical to implement effective, accessible treatment and support strategies to improve COVID-19 outcomes for all.

### Factors associated with aspects of functioning one year after hospitalization due to COVID-19 [^dce0a22f]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present study, the walking distance on the 6-minute walk test was set as a proxy for functioning 1 year after COVID-19. An individual's ability to walk a distance with ease is an important factor of quality of life because it is highly associated with the ability to perform everyday activities. The participants walked 441 m on average, which is similar to what was described in another Swedish study of nonhospitalized individuals recovering from COVID-19. Walking distance is influenced by several factors, such as age, fitness, height, and ethnicity, and normal ranges in healthy adults are estimated to vary between 400 and 700 m, with < 300 m being linked to frailty and mortality. In this study, 11% of participants walked a distance < 300 m, indicating that the results in the present study cohort are at the lower limits of normal ranges. The mean number of chair rises was 11.8 (SD 5.3), which can be compared to normative values for individuals of a similar age (mean 67 years), who range between 11 and 18 chair rises. However, direct comparisons are challenging, as reference values primarily represent data from older adults, making generalization of the leg strength difficult. When assessing strength in the upper extremities the observed percentage of predicted value was within normative or above. In summary, it is possible that individuals with the previously discussed respiratory difficulties after COVID-19 have the strength to manage their activities but do so very close to their maximal level of exertion.

In the present study, higher levels of physical fatigue 3 months after COVID-19 were associated with lower levels of functioning 1 year after hospitalization. Although high variation was observed in the median values, higher levels of physical fatigue were noted compared to the normative values from the Swedish population. Physical activity can be seen as essential when managing fatigue. Post-COVID with respiratory symptoms may limit physical activity and rehabilitation, with prior findings indicating that individuals recovering from COVID-19 are less physically active. In this cohort, 40% of participants reported some degree of mobility problems. Physical activity and exercise increase the respiratory breathing effort and may lead to muscle fatigue and increase the sensation of dyspnea, especially in individuals with respiratory disease. Taking this into consideration, it is possible that the physical fatigue that this patient group presents can be explained, in part, by the high energy consumption spent on respiratory muscle work while engaging in physical activity and activities of everyday life.

### Clinical effectiveness of an online supervised group physical and mental health rehabilitation programme for adults with post-COVID-19 condition (REGAIN study): multicentre randomised controlled trial [^44f81da2]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Across the World Health Organization European Region during the first two years of the covid-19 pandemic, more than 17 million people may have experienced covid-19 symptoms lasting more than four weeks. As of March 2023, 1.9 million people in the UK reported covid-19 symptoms persisting beyond 12 weeks, 1.3 million beyond one year, and 762 000 beyond two years. Common debilitating symptoms of this complex multisystem condition — post-covid-19 condition (long covid) — include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, and muscle ache, all of which can profoundly affect quality of life, participation in society, and economic productivity. Post-covid-19 condition can result in prolonged and unpredictable disability.

Biomedical research has not fully characterised the underlying pathophysiology of post-covid-19 condition; symptom phenotypes are exceptionally diverse. Consequently, existing medical management and drug treatments are limited in effectiveness and generalisability. The biopsychosocial model of care may contribute to improved outcomes for people with post-covid-19 condition. Multicomponent physical and mental health rehabilitation can improve breathlessness, fatigue, and quality of life in other long term conditions. To date, only small quasi-experimental studies have investigated exercise based rehabilitation interventions for people with post-covid-19 condition, and no high quality definitive evidence exists as to the potential benefits or harms of physical and mental health rehabilitation interventions.

We assessed the clinical effectiveness of an eight week live online group rehabilitation programme — the Rehabilitation Exercise and psycholoGical support After COVID-19 InfectioN (REGAIN) intervention — versus a single online session of advice and support for people with post-covid-19 condition.

### Health-related quality of life for patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome: identification of symptom clusters and predictors of long-term outcomes [^6cc9b5a5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Following COVID-19 infection, as many as a third of patients have long-term symptoms, known as post-acute sequelae (PASC). The mechanisms contributing to PASC remain largely unknown and, due to the heterogeneity of symptoms, treating PASC provides unique challenges.

Objective

Our study sought to (1) identify clinical symptom profiles based on PROMIS Global Health (GH) items, (2) evaluate demographic and clinical differences across profiles, and (3) identify predictors of change in health-related quality of life (HRQL) over time.

Design

This was an observational cohort study of patients with PASC who completed PROMIS-GH between 2/11/21 and 12/3/21 as part of routine care, with data extracted from the electronic health record.

Participants

There were 1407 adult patients (mean age 49.6 ± 13.7, 73% female, 81% White race) with PASC seen in the recovery clinic between 2/11/21 and 12/3/21, with 1129 (80.2%) completing PROMIS-GH as routine care.

Main Measures

HRQL was measured with PROMIS-GH at initial visit and after 12 months.

Key Results

Latent profile analysis identified symptom classes based on five PROMIS-GH items (mental health, ability to carry out physical activities, pain, fatigue, and emotional problems). Four latent profiles were identified: (1) "Poor HRQL" (n = 346), (2) "Mixed HRQL: good mental/poor physical" (n = 232), (3) "Mixed HRQL: poor mental/good physical" (n = 324), and (4) "Good HRQL" (n = 227). Demographics and comorbidities varied significantly across profile with patients with more severe COVID-19 infection more likely to be in profiles 1 and 2. Overall, patients improved 2 T-score points on PROMIS-GH after 12 months, with differences by profile. Predictors of improved HRQL included profile, lower body mass index, and fewer COVID symptoms.

Conclusions

Patients with PASC have distinct HRQL symptom profiles which were able to differentiate across COVID-19 severity and symptoms. Improvement over 12 months differed by profile. These profiles may be used to better understand the mechanisms behind PASC. Future research should evaluate their ability to guide treatment decisions to improve HRQL.

### Post-sequelae symptoms and comorbidities after COVID-19 [^a1f4f834]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, up to 15 months after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, persistent symptoms are common in ambulatory and hospitalized patients. More research is needed to understand why only some persons fully recover and to promote more rapid recovery among others.

### Low vitamin D levels are associated with long COVID syndrome in COVID-19 survivors [^f47ab271]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to the well-known extraskeletal role of vitamin D in regulating immune response and immunocompetence and the consistently reported positive effects on musculoskeletal, neurocognitive, metabolic, and cardiorespiratory health areas, a possible role of vitamin D in recovery of COVID-19 survivors was also hypothesized.

This hypothesis is firstly supported by the observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels reported among 120 not-hospitalized young COVID-19 survivors 3 months after acute disease compared with matched healthy participants. COVID-19 survivors were also characterized by higher inflammatory markers and therefore reverse causality could not be excluded. Later studies have subsequently investigated the effect of vitamin D on the risk of the presence of persistent symptoms in these patients, reporting, to date, contrasting results.

Townsend et al investigated the relationship between vitamin D and fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance in a total of 149 patients recruited at a median of 79 days after COVID-19 illness. The median vitamin D level was 62 nmol/L (about 24 ng/dL), higher than the levels observed in our cohort in which, differently from the study conducted by Townsend et al, we excluded those with vitamin D supplementation, and fatigue was very common (58%), possibly related to the short-term follow-up visits and to the inclusion in the study also of those who were previously admitted to the ICU. The authors reported no significant relationships between vitamin D status and any of the physical performance outcomes assessed. A later pilot clinical trial aimed at analyzing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle fitness in 30 elderly patients during the recovery phase after SARS-CoV-2 infection has reported that treatment with cholecalciferol (2000 IU/day) vs placebo carried out for 6 weeks was associated with a reduction of serum creatine kinase levels and with slight nonsignificant improvements in physical tests. An Egyptian cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in post-COVID-19 patients and its relation to persistent symptoms included 219 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses in the previous 3 months and who were mostly managed at home during the acute clinical course. The authors evaluated different symptom categories, including constitutional, respiratory, neuropsychiatric, and gastrointestinal areas, and reported no differences among vitamin D status and these symptoms, although only 16% of the entire cohort presented with not-deficient vitamin D levels. A recent study conducted in an Italian center aimed to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and physical performance including a sample of recovered patients, both hospitalized and not hospitalized, with a mean age of 53 years and re-evaluated in a post-acute outpatient service about 3 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Vitamin D deficiency was detected in 35.6% of participants, with a higher prevalence in men than in women, similarly to our data. The authors reported that patients with vitamin D deficiency performed worse on the 6-minute walking test, particularly in those older than 65 years. Finally, in a very recent interventional clinical trial including patients receiving a single dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo at the time of hospital admission for acute COVID-19 and re-evaluated by telephone interviews at 6 months and 1 year after hospital discharge, no significant differences between vitamin D-treated and placebo groups were observed for the different constitutional and respiratory post-COVID-19 symptoms. The authors concluded that the use of vitamin D supplementation was not useful for the management of post-COVID-19 symptoms. In this study, no data regarding 25(OH) vitamin D levels after supplementation was reported, both during hospitalization and during follow-up; moreover, at baseline, both vitamin D–treated and placebo groups presented median vitamin D levels around 21 ng/mL, reducing the potential beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in a population yet to be characterized by a not-deficient vitamin D status; finally, the study did not rule out the possibility that intermediate doses of vitamin D administered during follow-up, and not tested, could modify the clinical course of these patients.

### Outcomes of a fatigue management intervention for people with post COVID-19 condition [^7bbd1d0b]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Fatigue is identified as one of the most prevalent and persistent problems reported by people with post COVID-19 condition that negatively impacts on everyday living and resumption of pre-COVID-19 lifestyle. A pilot occupational therapy fatigue management intervention was designed for patients presenting with post COVID-19 condition fatigue.

Design

A retrospective analysis was carried out after the delivery of the fatigue management intervention. Self-reported measures of fatigue, well-being, and health status were taken at baseline and repeated at 2 wks after intervention. Baseline and postintervention scores were compared using nonparametric analysis.

Results

Sixty participants (73% female), median age 50.5 yrs (range, 17–74), 93% reporting symptoms persisting for 12 wks or longer, completed the fatigue management intervention. All participants reported moderate to severe fatigue impacting on everyday activity at baseline. The greatest impact of fatigue was on engagement in leisure and work activity. Statistically significant improvement in fatigue (P < 0.001), well-being (P < 0.001), and health status (P < 0.001) were noted after the intervention.

Conclusions

Findings indicate the potential of occupational therapy fatigue management interventions to enable self-management strategies and reduce the negative impact of fatigue among people with post COVID-19 condition.

### Additive benefit of rehabilitation on physical status, symptoms and mental health after hospitalisation for severe COVID-19 pneumonia [^087e8589]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

A recent review and meta-analysisof post-COVID rehabilitation studies concluded that the effects on pulmonary function were inconsistent across studies. In our study, we report significant improvements in pulmonary function in both groups, which are likely due to natural recovery. Significant improvements between 60 and 100 days after COVID-19 diagnosis in chest CT and PFTs (including FEV 1, FVC and TL co) have been shown in post-COVID-19 patients.

Patients with long-COVID at 3 and 6 months after symptoms onset showed some improvement in EQ-VAS (mean increase of 7 points). Enrolment in rehabilitation accelerates improvement as shown in the cohort of Daynes et al (mean increase of 8 points in 6 weeks)and in our study (13 points in 8 weeks).

In line with BTS guidance, healthcare workers involved in post-COVID-19 rehabilitation programmes should screen patients for possible complications of COVID-19 infection. Indeed, during the initial evaluation three patients were excluded due to previously undiagnosed complications and one stopped rehabilitation due to new onset of pulmonary embolism (figure 1). Rigorous adherence to safety precautions is of paramount importance (see online supplement file).

Exercise training is the cornerstone of rehabilitation. Official guidance on exercise training post-COVID-19 suggested low-grade exercise with gradual increases in intensity. In line with this official guidance and considering that exercise programmes at relatively high intensity could be harmful in patients with postviral 'chronic fatigue syndrome', we implemented intermittent exercise training on the cycle ergometer starting at 50% of peak work rate. Intermittent exercise has been shown to be safe and well tolerated by COVID-19 survivors post-hospital discharge. Intermittent exercise, consisting of repeated bouts of exercise that are alternated with short periods of rest, has shown to be effective in respiratory patients with profound symptoms of exertional breathlessness and leg discomfort. Accordingly, intermittent exercise may be better suited to COVID-19 survivors than continuous exercise because it is associated with moderate exertional symptoms without significant arterial oxygen desaturation (figure 3). Moreover, there were not any adverse effects reported throughout the exercise training programme, thereby highlighting the safety aspect of progressively advancing the intensity of intermittent exercise throughout a rehabilitation programme in this population (figure 3). Importantly, despite a threefold increase in training workload throughout the 8-week programme, symptoms of dyspnoea and leg discomfort as well as HR remained unchanged. This indicates true physiological training effects compatible with those seen in healthy individuals following aerobic exercise training.

Older adults experience persistent symptoms post-COVID-19, termed as Long COVID, affecting their physical and mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Long COVID, level of physical activity, and functional decline on older adults' health-related quality of life post-COVID-19.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was conducted on 121 older adults with 60 to 90 years old post-coronavirus infection. The standardized metrics used in the study were Fatigue Severity Scale, Physical Activity Elderly, SF12, Post-COVID-19 functional status scale, and COVID-19 Yorkshire rehabilitation screening scale. The severity of coronavirus infection was evaluated by changes in chest CT scan images and O 2 saturation at hospital admission. Data were analyzed using linear regression analyses.

Results

The results of regression analysis revealed six factors to be predictors of physical health at 6 months post-COVID-19 (F = 9.046, P < 0.001; explained variance 63%), which the significant factors were fatigue, level of physical activity, worsened pain, difficulties in activities of daily living and cognitive-communication problems. Among these factors, greater fatigue and worsened pain intensity were the strongest predictors. Mental health was associated with days of hospitalization and cognitive-communication problems (F = 2.866, P < 0.001; explained variance 35%).

Conclusions

Considering the negative impact of fatigue, pain, low physical activity, and cognitive-communication problems on health-related quality of life, early and accurate evaluation and management are required for recovered older adults post-COVID-19.

### Symptoms and health outcomes among survivors of COVID-19 infection 1 year after discharge from hospitals in wuhan, China [^a8bd0881]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This study reports the long-term health outcomes of COVID-19 survivors at 1-year after hospital discharge in a large cohort of patients. We found that 1095 patients (45.0%) reported at least 1 symptom, and the most common symptoms were fatigue, sweating, chest tightness, anxiety, and myalgia. Older age, female gender, and severe disease were associated with higher risks of fatigue or more symptoms. In total, 161 patients (6.6%) had CAT total scores of at least 10, for which the risk factors included severe disease during hospital stay or coexisting cerebrovascular diseases. Taken together, our study found that patients with severe disease had increased risks of more symptoms and higher CAT scores at 1-year follow-up.

COVID-19 can affect multiple organs, which leads to both acute organ damage and long-term sequelae, with the latter effects gaining increasing concerns. We found that fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom, which is consistent with previous studies. Fatigue is common after acute lung injury and is associated with substantial impairments in physical function and quality of life. High percentage of fatigue was possibly due to multiple organ injury following infection of SARS-CoV-2. Fatigue occurred in 27.7% of individuals in this study, which is lower than the 53% to 71% as reported by other studies. This is likely to be due to longer follow-up time, allowing the patients to gradually recover from previously existing symptoms.

### Post COVID sequelae among COVID-19 survivors: insights from the Indian national clinical registry for COVID-19 [^f1513702]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The effects of COVID-19 infection persist beyond the active phase. Comprehensive description and analysis of the post COVID sequelae in various population groups are critical to minimise the long-term morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. This analysis was conducted with an objective to estimate the frequency of post COVID sequelae and subsequently, design a framework for holistic management of post COVID morbidities.

Methods

Follow-up data collected as part of a registry-based observational study in 31 hospitals across India since September 2020-October 2022 were used for analysis. All consenting hospitalised patients with COVID-19 are telephonically followed up for up to 1year post-discharge, using a prestructured form focused on symptom reporting.

Results

Dyspnoea, fatigue and mental health issues were reported among 18.6%, 10.5% and 9.3% of the 8042 participants at first follow-up of 30-60days post-discharge, respectively, which reduced to 11.9%, 6.6% and 9%, respectively, at 1-year follow-up in 2192 participants. Patients who died within 90 days post-discharge were significantly older (adjusted OR (aOR): 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), with at least one comorbidity (aOR: 1.76, 95%CI: 1.31, 2.35), and a higher proportion had required intensive care unit admission during the initial hospitalisation due to COVID-19 (aOR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.08, 2.06) and were discharged at WHO ordinal scale 6–7 (aOR: 49.13 95%CI: 25.43, 94.92). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (at least one dose) was protective against such post-discharge mortality (aOR: 0.19, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.03).

Conclusion

Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 experience a variety of long-term sequelae after discharge from hospitals which persists although in reduced proportions until 12 months post-discharge. Developing a holistic management framework with engagement of care outreach workers as well as teleconsultation is a way forward in effective management of post COVID morbidities as well as reducing mortality.

### The autonomic aspects of the post-COVID19 syndrome [^1d65921c]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, responsible for the widespread COVID-19, led to one of the most rogue pandemics in modern time, yet the major effects of the pandemic may still be ahead of us. SARS-CoV-2 had been found to possess autoimmune properties. Close to 20 distinct autoantibodies which target GPCR of the nervous system and renin-angiotensin system-related molecules were found significantly associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. The new on-set of more than 10 various autoimmune disorders were documented as well. Additionally, clinical presentations of persisted symptoms were triggered in numerous recently recovered COVID-19 patients, which led to the formulation of the novel term "post-COVID19 syndrome". Manifestations related to post-COVID-19 syndrome exist among approximately 50–80% of symptomatic COVID-19 patients who recovered, and among patients reported more than 50 different long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many of the common symptoms of the post-COVID19 syndrome are not explained by the virus-related injury alone. Similarly to chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, autoimmune-mediated autonomic nervous system dysfunction may play a significant part in the pathogenesis of such symptoms, including chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, mood related disorders, and numerous more. Importantly, therapeutic options such as immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapy may favor some post-COVID19 patients, while plasmapheresis and IVIG could be considered in severe cases. Nevertheless, as physical exercise has been found to stabilize the autonomic nervous system, exercise therapy might be a safer and more effective remedy for the post-COVID19 syndrome.

### Efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019: results of a randomized controlled trial [^d87b5aa3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is prevalent and debilitating. This study investigated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for severe fatigue following COVID-19.

Methods

A multicenter, 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands with patients being severely fatigued 3–12 months following COVID-19. Patients (N = 114) were randomly assigned (1:1) to CBT or care as usual (CAU). CBT, targeting perpetuating factors of fatigue, was provided for 17 weeks. The primary outcome was the overall mean difference between CBT and CAU on the fatigue severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength, directly post-CBT or CAU (T1), and after 6 months (T2). Secondary outcomes were differences in proportions of patients meeting criteria for severe and/or chronic fatigue, differences in physical and social functioning, somatic symptoms, and problems concentrating between CBT and CAU.

Results

Patients were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred. Patients who received CBT were significantly less severely fatigued across follow-up assessments than patients receiving CAU (-8.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -11.9 to -5.8]); P < .001), representing a medium Cohen's d effect size (0.69). The between-group difference in fatigue severity was present at T1 (-9.3 [95% CI, -13.3 to -5.3]) and T2 (-8.4 [95% CI, -13.1 to -3.7]). All secondary outcomes favored CBT. Eight adverse events were recorded during CBT, and 20 during CAU. No serious adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

Among patients, who were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred, CBT was effective in reducing fatigue. The positive effect was sustained at 6-month follow-up.

### Core outcomes set for trials in people with coronavirus disease 2019 [^a848d078]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recognizing Adverse Events

It was expected that "we are going to be trialling a lot of novel interventions" and participants urged awareness of the "variation in approach to treatment around the world and the way that that's evolving quite rapidly". However, without compelling cases for effective treatments at present and with little commonality across different interventions (e.g. drug classes), potential intervention-specific adverse events may be excluded from the core outcomes set.

Being Cognizant of Family and Psychosocial Wellbeing

Due to the potentially severe nature of COVID-19 and requirement for quarantine, emphasis was placed on the profound impacts on the psychosocial wellbeing of patients and their families. Being in isolation was thought to exacerbate sickness, deterioration, depression, and anxiety for patients and their families — "we've seen people where they've had to stand outside and speak to their loved one on a walkie talkie to say goodbye because they're dying". Patients experienced guilt, fear, and depression related to infecting others.

The COVID-19-COS Core Outcomes Set

The recommendations (Box 1) arising from the workshop were used to finalize the core outcomes set based on review by the Steering Committee and investigators. Sepsis was moved from the initial core outcomes set into Tier 2 because of overlap with multiple organ failure. Lung function, lung fibrosis, and pneumonia remained in Tier 2 to avoid overlap with respiratory failure and shortness of breath. Shortness of breath was retained in the core outcomes set because it was the most important patient-reported outcome and was a symptom relevant across the spectrum of COVID-19 and across the full trajectory of an individual's disease course. It was strongly and consistently recommended that a longer term outcome should be included. However, the top 10 ranked outcomes from the survey comprised only of acute and severe outcomes. Recovery (defined in the survey as how long it takes to recover, i.e. feel better, no longer having symptoms) was the highest rated long-term outcome and was moved from Tier 2 into the core outcomes set as in response. Six outcomes relating to symptoms and psychosocial and family impact (based on those that were highest ranked in the survey — chest pain, cough, depression, fatigue, impact on family, life participation) were moved from Tier 3 to Tier 2. The final COVID-19-COS core outcome domains are shown in Figure 1.

### Does pulmonary rehabilitation improve fatigue in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome? A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^3eb3b372]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on fatigue in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS).

Methods

A systematic review and a meta-analysis were performed until 21 October 2024 in 4 databases (CINAHL, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science). Inclusion criteria: Population: patients (≥ 18years) with PCS; Intervention: PR; Comparison: control group (CG) vs. placebo; Outcome: fatigue assessed before and after the intervention; Study: randomized clinical trials. Methodological quality was assessed with Downs and Black scale and risk of bias with Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.4.

Results

Thirteen studies were included in the systematic review and 10 in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a moderate effect size (SMD = -0.59, 95% CI = -0.89, -0.28; p = 0.0002, n = 973) in favor of PR compared to CG for fatigue, with significant differences. Compared to CG, fatigue in patients with PCS was reduced to a greater extent in PR group (both center-based PR and home-based PR, and both < 12weeks of PR and ≥ 12weeks of PR), with significant differences.

Conclusion

This review demonstrates the efficacy of PR as a promising intervention for alleviating fatigue in patients with PCS, revealing a significantly greater reduction in fatigue in PR group compared to CG.

### Clinical features, therapeutic outcomes, and recovery period of long COVID [^f00583a1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

To characterize the clinical features of long COVID, 286 patients who received care in our outpatient clinic for long COVID from May to December 2021 were surveyed. The recovery periods of each symptom and the key factors contributing to early recovery were statistically analysed. The median age of the patients was 35.8 years, with 137 men and 149 women. The median number of symptoms was 2.8. The most frequent symptoms were respiratory manifestations (52.1%), followed by fatigue (51.4%). Respiratory symptoms, fatigue, and headache/arthralgia were major complaints in the initial phase, whereas hair loss was a major complaint in the late phase, suggesting that the chief complaint of patients with long COVID may vary temporally. The best treatment outcome was observed for pulmonary symptoms, and hair loss had the worst outcome. COVID-19 severity, the number of manifestations, and the delay in starting treatment exerted a negative effect on the recovery period of long COVID. In addition, the smoking habit was an independent risk factor for slowing the recovery period from long COVID. This study provides insights into the clinical course of each manifestation and therapeutic options with a more certain future of long COVID to meet the unmet medical needs.

### Medium-term outcomes in severely to critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^b59421bd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The medium- and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 remain largely unknown. We found that just over half of patients who survived severe COVID-19 illness had persistent symptoms that interfered with activities of daily living and quality of life 4–7 months after their critical illness. Of those who were symptomatic, biochemical, hematological, and immunological findings had normalized during the follow-up periods. Chest radiographic and LFT findings were near normal to normal in most patients. However, patients with significant breathlessness tended to have high rate of comorbid conditions, residual chest radiographic abnormalities, and abnormal LFT results.

As reported above, breathlessness (63.2%) and fatigue (53.5%) were the symptoms most commonly reported by participants. However, the rate of significant breathlessness (38.2%) in our severely ill patients followed up for 7 months is lower than that reported in an earlier study (45%–53%) 2–3 months after disease onset, which suggests that dyspnea caused by COVID-19 may improve over time. On the other hand, Huang et al described the clinical follow-up in a cohort of 1733 adults with COVID-19, and 6 months after illness onset 76% of those patients reported ≥ 1 persistent symptom.

### Effectiveness of a personalised self-management intervention for people living with long COVID (listen trial): pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^7cb26ef0]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background

Long covid, the name agreed by a community of people living with long lasting symptoms following a covid-19 illness, now encompasses the UK's definitions of ongoing symptomatic covid-19 (symptoms from four weeks up to 12 weeks), post covid-19 syndrome (symptoms beyond 12 weeks), and the World Health Organization's post covid-19 condition (symptoms beyond three months and persisting for at least two months). In the UK, at least 1.9 million people are estimated to meet the criteria for long covid. Of these, 1.3 million have symptoms lasting for more than a year and 762 000 people live with symptoms for more than two years. A comprehensive study in 2021 reported a total of 203 symptoms across 10 organ systems, which are both diverse and fluctuating, and may include fatigue, joint or muscle pain, altered smell or taste, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Fatigue is by far the most common symptom (72%), followed by difficulties with cognitive function (51%), muscle aches (49%), and shortness of breath (48%). The potential legacy of long covid is serious, with a high incidence of individuals not returning to work by six months and continuing to experience limitations in their day-to-day activities, which could result in macroeconomic costs of £1.5 billion each year ($1.9 billion; €1.81 billion).

### Efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019: results of a randomized controlled trial [^35ed56cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This RCT showed that patients who reported severe fatigue 3–12 months following COVID-19 were significantly less severely fatigued after CBT than after CAU. Our findings are in line with previous studies investigating the efficacy of CBT for severe fatigue in other patient groups. Moreover, positive effects of CBT were sustained for 6 months after the intervention. This is an important finding given mixed long-term outcomes of CBT in other studies. Furthermore, patients randomized to CBT were also less often severely and chronically fatigued and reported fewer concentration problems, less severe somatic symptoms, and improved physical and social functioning across follow-up assessments.

This study has several strengths. It was a multicenter RCT and entailed a follow-up assessment 6 months after CBT or CAU. The high number of self-referrals and low attrition rate suggest that CBT is an acceptable and feasible intervention for at least a group of post–COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our preliminary data on AEs and the absence of deterioration of fatigue in the CBT group indicate that CBT for severe post–COVID-19 is safe. The intervention, due to its online format, could be relatively swiftly implemented and reach a wide patient group.

This study has limitations. As in all studies testing the efficacy of behavioral/psychotherapeutic interventions, blinding is not possible because both patient and therapist are aware of the allocated treatment. Also, this is the first study testing the efficacy of CBT for post–COVID fatigue. Replication in other settings or regions is warranted to determine the generalizability of our results. Furthermore, the majority of included patients did not require hospitalization for COVID-19. Our results might therefore not generalize to patients with hospital or ICU admission. As there is no reliable biomarker of severe fatigue, we used a patient-reported outcome to assess fatigue severity.

Despite efforts to recruit patients consecutively, the majority of included patients were self-referred. This might have caused a selection bias — for example, this group may have been more motivated to undertake a behavioral intervention than patients routinely visiting an outpatient clinic. However, self-referrals may better represent the target patient group for implementation of CBT in clinical practice.

### Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome [^6f49aed3]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in global healthcare crises and strained health resources. As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae. Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of COVID-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated COVID-19 clinics.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

PASC-CVS — definition, symptoms, diagnostic timing, and management: PASC-CVS is a heterogeneous disorder that includes widely ranging cardiovascular symptoms without objective evidence of cardiovascular disease using standard diagnostic tests, with exercise intolerance and tachycardia commonly reported along with chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, cognitive complaints (memory impairment, attention deficit, poor executive function/brain fog), sleep disturbance or nonrestorative sleep, and postexertional malaise. There are no established timelines for diagnosis; PASC-CVS should be considered when cardiovascular symptoms persist beyond a timeframe typical for the severity of acute infection and projected recovery based on a person's age and underlying health status, and it may be reasonable to consider PASC when symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks after mild acute infection, as opposed to waiting more than 12 weeks as suggested in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and World Health Organization definitions. Where possible, evaluation and management strategies for the most common PASC-CVD entities should follow existing guideline recommendations.

### How do clinicians use post-COVID syndrome diagnosis? Analysis of clinical features in a Swedish COVID-19 cohort with 18 months' follow-up: a national observational cohort and matched cohort study [^8269e9c6]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19 exhibits a wide range of symptoms including respiratory and pulmonary symptoms during the acute phase of disease. The key characteristics include remarkably variable individual health responses from those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms to those with life-threatening severe disease or even death. An increasing number of patients suffer from disabling long-term consequences, post-COVID syndrome (PCS, also known as Long COVID, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome). Furthermore, the symptomatology of PCS varies between patients creating a challenge both for disease diagnosis, management and public health overview of the extent of the problem.

The global consensus on how PCS should be diagnosed and treated is still developing based on the efforts from the WHO, patient organisations and the Centre of Disease Control in providing guidelines and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for diagnosis. PCS is thought to affect multiple organs, and potentially initial severity of COVID-19 could be a risk factor for PCS. Our understanding of the magnitude of how much vaccines protect against PCS is evolving. Breakthrough infections following vaccination and reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 also associate with long-term organ sequelae.

The symptoms attributed to PCS are still being characterised, and there could be several different clinical phenotypes; however, dyspnoea and fatigue seem to be central symptomatic components of PCS. Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) refers to a set of physical, cognitive and psychological impairments that survivors of intensive care often experience, with issues like muscle weakness, memory loss and depression. This could be similar to issues found in PCS.

To understand how clinicians attribute symptoms and PCS diagnosis, we examined risk factors and associated clinical features in patients who received a PCS ICD code in a total population of COVID-19 cohort in Sweden. To avoid classifying symptomatology due to PICS, COVID-19 patients with PCS were compared with disease severity-matched COVID-19 patients with no PCS diagnosis.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^720d85ae]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Some viral infections are known to cause post-acute infection syndromes, and may represent a considerable healthcare burden, with social and economic consequences for children, adolescents, and their families. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and includes both physical and psychological symptoms, usually without any specific clinical findings or laboratory abnormalities. The features may vary according to the etiology of the viral infection, individual patient response (complete recovery, relapse, or remitting pattern), and age (younger children being more prone to respiratory symptoms and older children often presenting with chronic fatigue). It can be argued that post-viral syndromes often share a similar symptom profile, irrespective of the involved pathogen. This suggests the potential existence of a common etiopathogenesis. Post-viral fatigue syndrome, also referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, presents symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and variable neurological abnormalities. Many viruses have been thought to be associated with post-acute infection syndromes, most commonly Coxsackie viruses, but also Influenza, Varicella, Epstein–Barr, Ebola, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection may be followed by a comparable post-acute, long-lasting multi-organ syndrome. The most commonly reported symptoms of Long/post COVID conditions include fatigue, headache, attention disorder, hair loss, cough, chest pain and dyspnea; however, with a lower prevalence in children to young adults as compared to adults. Fatigue is a dominant feature of Long/post COVID, potentially lasting for weeks to months. According to adult data, prolonged illness duration and persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection will generally resolve within six months or less, except for severe fatigue or post-exertional malaise.

Post COVID-19 conditions became a global concern after the initial acute phase of the pandemic, however little is known about the pathogenesis and long-term clinical course both in adults as well as in children, adolescents and young adults. The overlap between the clinical presentation and course of post COVID and other post-viral conditions highlights the need to review the clinical characteristics, duration of symptoms, and possible healthcare burden in the pediatric population of both entities.

This review aims to systematically describe the available evidence on symptoms persisting beyond acute COVID infection, as compared to other viral infections; to evaluate clinical characteristics, duration, and healthcare burden.

### Neurological implications of COVID-19: a review of the science and clinical guidance [^caa098b5]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion of neurological manifestations of COVID-19

From our review of the literature, it is evident that the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are common, varied and contribute significantly to the morbidity of the disease. While complications such as encephalopathy predictably affect the older population, inflammatory and thromboembolic complications affects younger patients and do not completely correlate with the severity of disease.

In addition to the immediate neurological manifestations of the disease, there are increasing reports of postinfectious fatigue and cognitive 'fog'. Postviral fatigue has been reported in other viral infections, including the coronaviridae such as SARS. In a pandemic, this illness may contribute to significant morbidity and economic burden. Ongoing international collaboration to characterise the extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are required in order to best frame the long-term care of patients as we recover from the pandemic.

Indirect implications of the pandemic for neurologists

To quote Charles Hummel, ' your greatest danger is letting the urgent things crowd out the important '. As neurologists, especially in Australia, we have played a minor direct role in front-line patient care. However, the indirect effect on the management of chronic disease is also profound, with significant reallocation of healthcare resources and altered patient consulting patterns. This section summarises the current guidance of management of neurological disease in the era of the pandemic.

In considering the management of chronic disease, individual patient preferences and circumstances must take precedence. As such, the following sections should be considered as general guidelines only. In all patients with chronic neurological conditions, an adequate supply of regular and rescue medications should be maintained, and telehealth consultations considered where appropriate. In-person visits and elective hospitalisation should be reduced and deferred whenever possible. As the primary treating clinicians, advanced care planning should be discussed with patients and their families and clearly communicated with all care providers.

The most significant change in providing neurological care has been the widespread adoption of telemedicine. The American Academy of Neurology has resources available fromand comprehensive advice on conducting remote neurological examinations can be found at.

Specific considerations including suggestions from The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand and Australian and New Zealand Society of Respiratory Sciences and The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists in investigation of neurological patients during the pandemic are addressed in table 2. The investigation of neurology patients will vary depending on the rate of community transmission, risk and yield of the test for an individual patient, however general recommendations are summarised in table 2.

### Estimates of incidence and predictors of fatiguing illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^8a9860c9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Deaths and Hospitalizations

Patients with COVID-19 in whom incident fatigue developed had far worse clinical outcomes, as evidenced by deaths and hospitalizations, than patients without fatigue (Figure 3). Among 434 COVID-19 patients in whom fatigue developed, 111 (25.6%) were hospitalized > 1 time during the postacute period, whereas 13.6% of 4,155 patients without incident fatigue were hospitalized (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.57–2.24; p < 0.001). Moreover, COVID-19 patients with incident fatigue were at higher risk of dying (23/434, 5.3%) during the postacute period than were COVID-19 patients without incident fatigue (94/4,155 [2.3%]; RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.50–3.66; p < 0.001).

### Six-month outcomes in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 [^def262d0]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous work has demonstrated that patients experience functional decline at 1–3 months post-discharge after COVID-19 hospitalization.

Objective

To determine whether symptoms persist further or improve over time, we followed patients discharged after hospitalization for severe COVID-19 to characterize their overall health status and their physical and mental health at 6 months post-hospital discharge.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Participants

Patients ≥ 18 years hospitalized for COVID-19 at a single health system, who required at minimum 6 l of supplemental oxygen during admission, had intact baseline functional status, and were discharged alive.

Main Measures

Overall health status, physical health, mental health, and dyspnea were assessed with validated surveys: the PROMIS® Global Health-10 and PROMIS® Dyspnea Characteristics instruments.

Key Results

Of 152 patients who completed the 1 month post-discharge survey, 126 (83%) completed the 6-month survey. Median age of 6-month respondents was 62; 40% were female. Ninety-three (74%) patients reported that their health had not returned to baseline at 6 months, and endorsed a mean of 7.1 symptoms. Participants' summary t-scores in both the physical health and mental health domains at 6 months (45.2, standard deviation [SD] 9.8; 47.4, SD 9.8, respectively) remained lower than their baseline (physical health 53.7, SD 9.4; mental health 54.2, SD 8.0; p < 0.001). Overall, 79 (63%) patients reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 2 out of 10 (interquartile range [IQR] 0–5), vs 42 (33%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0–1)). A total of 11/124 (9%) patients without pre-COVID oxygen requirements still needed oxygen 6 months post-hospital discharge. One hundred and seven (85%) were still experiencing fatigue at 6 months post-discharge.

Conclusions

Even 6 months after hospital discharge, the majority of patients report that their health has not returned to normal. Support and treatments to return these patients back to their pre-COVID baseline are urgently needed.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 2023.

Eligibility Criteria

Trials that randomised adults (≥ 18 years) with long covid to drug or non-drug interventions, placebo or sham, or usual care.

Results

24 trials with 3695 patients were eligible. Four trials (n = 708 patients) investigated drug interventions, eight (n = 985) physical activity or rehabilitation, three (n = 314) behavioural, four (n = 794) dietary, four (n = 309) medical devices and technologies, and one (n = 585) a combination of physical exercise and mental health rehabilitation. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, compared with usual care, an online programme of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) probably reduces fatigue (mean difference -8.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.11 to -3.69; Checklist for Individual Strength fatigue subscale; range 8–56, higher scores indicate greater impairment) and probably improves concentration (mean difference -5.2, -7.97 to -2.43; Checklist for Individual Strength concentration problems subscale; range 4–28; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, compared with usual care, an online, supervised, combined physical and mental health rehabilitation programme probably leads to improvement in overall health, with an estimated 161 more patients per 1000 (95% CI 61 more to 292 more) experiencing meaningful improvement or recovery, probably reduces symptoms of depression (mean difference -1.50, -2.41 to -0.59; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale; range 0–21; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and probably improves quality of life (0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29+2 Profile; range -0.022–1; higher scores indicate less impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that intermittent aerobic exercise 3–5 times weekly for 4–6 weeks probably improves physical function compared with continuous exercise (mean difference 3.8, 1.12 to 6.48; SF-36 physical component summary score; range 0–100; higher scores indicate less impairment). No compelling evidence was found to support the effectiveness of other interventions, including, among others, vortioxetine, leronlimab, combined probiotics-prebiotics, coenzyme Q10, amygdala and insula retraining, combined L-arginine and vitamin C, inspiratory muscle training, transcranial direct current stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen, a mobile application providing education on long covid.

Conclusion

Moderate certainty evidence suggests that CBT and physical and mental health rehabilitation probably improve symptoms of long covid.

### Safety, tolerability and clinical effects of rovunaptabin, also known as BC007 on fatigue and quality of life in patients with post-COVID syndrome (reCOVer): a prospective, exploratory, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised phase IIa clinical trial (RCT) [^5ece9541]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

ReCOVer is the first RCT of rovunaptabin in PCS patients with a seropositivity of GPCR-fAAb, showing encouraging results. The additional cross-over design enabled analysis of inter-patients' differences in validated self-reported patients' outcomes. As no epidemiology data on the presence of GPCR-fAAbs are available up to date, the number of participants was low, the study cohort represent an European cohort and recruitment was random as patients registered actively for a potential study participation, the data of the present study cannot be generalised. Further limitations were the use of self-reported questionnaires only, and the lack of established biomarkers except for GPCR-fAAbs. Patients had to complete a larger number of questionnaires, as the effect of rovunaptabin on the outcome variables was not known. As the follow-up duration was limited to a maximum of 91 days, the present results of reCOVer encourage a subsequent clinical phase II b, investigating the doses and the effects in a larger patients' group over a longer follow-up period, as well as subsequent phase III trial.

The prevalence of PCS seems to be linked to several risk factors and even the number of re-infections, thus, it can be assumed that the total number of patients with PCS will still increase in future, affecting individual life, public health care system and economy. The clinical trial reCOVer is the first RCT of rovunaptabin in PCS patients seropositive for GPCR-fAAbs, showing a neutralisation of GPCR-fAAbs, followed by a significant improvement of fatigue, severity of fatigue and quality of life compared to placebo. Next to an expected temporal anticoagulatory effect directly after treatment, participants of the rovunaptabin group showed mild to moderate TEAEs, compared to the placebo group, yet neither with a statistical significance, nor with treatment related SAEs. The data of the present clinical trial suggest that rovunaptabin might offer a novel approach for a curative and causal therapy for an autoimmune subgroup of patients with PCS.

### Prevalence of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome symptoms at different follow-up periods: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^35eb0e6d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-acute coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome is now recognized as a complex systemic disease that is associated with substantial morbidity.

Objectives

To estimate the prevalence of persistent symptoms and signs at least 12 weeks after acute COVID-19 at different follow-up periods.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted up to October 2021 in Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, and PubMed.

Study Eligibility Criteria, Participants and Interventions

Articles in English that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and included at least 50 patients with a follow-up of at least 12 weeks after acute illness.

Methods

Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to produce a pooled prevalence for each symptom at four different follow-up time intervals. Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic and was explored via meta-regression, considering several a priori study-level variables. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for prevalence studies and comparative studies, respectively.

Results

After screening 3209 studies, a total of 63 studies were eligible, with a total COVID-19 population of 257 348. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea, sleep disorder, and difficulty concentrating (32%, 25%, 24%, and 22%, respectively, at 3- to < 6-month follow-up); effort intolerance, fatigue, sleep disorder, and dyspnea (45%, 36%, 29%, and 25%, respectively, at 6- to < 9-month follow-up); fatigue (37%) and dyspnea (21%) at 9 to < 12 months; and fatigue, dyspnea, sleep disorder, and myalgia (41%, 31%, 30%, and 22%, respectively, at > 12-month follow-up). There was substantial between-study heterogeneity for all reported symptom prevalences. Meta-regressions identified statistically significant effect modifiers: world region, male sex, diabetes mellitus, disease severity, and overall study quality score. Five of six studies including a comparator group consisting of COVID-19-negative cases observed significant adjusted associations between COVID-19 and several long-term symptoms.

Conclusions

This systematic review found that a large proportion of patients experience post-acute COVID-19 syndrome 3 to 12 months after recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19. However, available studies of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome are highly heterogeneous. Future studies need to have appropriate comparator groups, standardized symptom definitions and measurements, and longer follow-up.

### Prevalence of long COVID symptoms in Bangladesh: a prospective inception cohort study of COVID-19 survivors [^f22bd328]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

A survey conducted over a 4-week period in the UK found that nearly 1 million people self-reported long COVID symptoms, which equates to 1.5% of the population. The survey also identified that 18.5% of participants reported that their daily activities had been affected a lot by the illness, indicating that long COVID has a detrimental challenge with day-to-day activities. Even many people who were suffering from long COVID reported that they had not be able to returned their previous levels of work and continuously experiencing the symptoms burden, so this should be taken seriously.

It is acknowledged that there is an urgent need for further research on the nature, prevalence and duration of long COVID experienced by affected people, along with potential associated risk factors so that overall clinical management can be improved. This is especially pertinent in low-income to middle-income countries, like Bangladesh, where the majority of the population live in rural districts, outside of an extremely densely populated capital city, Dhaka. There are only two published studies so far in Bangladesh on persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection. One survey of 1002 individuals reported that 20% had experienced persisting symptoms after COVID-19, with diarrhoea (12.7%) being the most common followed by fatigue (11.5%). A second smaller study of 355 individuals found that 46% of patients recovering from COVID-19 reported as long COVID symptoms, with fatigue being the most common symptom reported. Therefore, it is critical to gain research knowledge on the prevalence of long COVID and identify associated risk factors, as this study does, which will be of relevance to the global community.

The objectives of this study were to identify the prevalence of long COVID symptoms in people affected by COVID-19 and explore any potential associations between reported symptoms and the independent variables measured. Cardiorespiratory parameters and functional limitations were also measured to try to discern if there was an impact on the cardiac system and if functional daily activities were affected by long COVID symptoms.

### Characteristics and predictors of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^598d79c1]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A significant proportion of individuals experience lingering and debilitating symptoms following acute COVID-19 infection. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have coined the persistent cluster of symptoms as post-COVID syndrome. This has been further sub-categorised into acute post-COVID syndrome for symptoms persisting three weeks beyond initial infection and chronic post-COVID syndrome for symptoms persisting beyond twelve weeks. The aim of this review was to detail the prevalence of clinical features and identify potential predictors for acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome.

Methods

A systematic literature search, with no language restrictions, was performed to identify studies detailing characteristics and outcomes related to survivorship of post-COVID syndrome. The last search was performed on 6 March 2021 and all pre-dating published articles included. A means of proportion meta-analysis was performed to quantify characteristics of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome. Study quality was assessed with a specific risk of bias tool. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42020222855.

Findings

A total of 43 studies met the eligibility criteria; of which, 38 allowed for meta-analysis. Fatigue and dyspnoea were the most prevalent symptoms in acute post-COVID (0·37 and 0·35) and fatigue and sleep disturbance in chronic post-COVID syndrome (0·48 and 0·44), respectively. The available evidence is generally of poor quality, with considerable risk of bias, and are of observational design.

Interpretation

In conclusion, this review highlights that flaws in data capture and interpretation, noted in the uncertainty within our meta-analysis, affect the applicability of current knowledge. Policy makers and researchers must focus on understanding the impact of this condition on individuals and society with appropriate funding initiatives and global collaborative research.
