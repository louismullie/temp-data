## Question

Should my patient with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) be started on anticoagulation therapy immediately or wait for imaging confirmation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) should be started on anticoagulation immediately or wait for imaging confirmation, and under what circumstances each approach is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pretest probability and risk stratification. Then, I should verify when empiric anticoagulation is warranted before imaging. Next, I will review scenarios where waiting with serial imaging is acceptable. After that, I need to check the special cases of distal DVT and how they change management. I should also confirm how patient-specific bleeding risk modifies decisions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and state a bottom line recommendation, making sure each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: clinical features alone cannot reliably diagnose or exclude DVT, so I need to integrate a validated clinical prediction rule (e.g. Wells) with objective testing rather than relying on signs or symptoms in isolation, and I should anchor that approach in contemporary guidelines that endorse sequential, probability-based strategies using D-dimer and compression ultrasonography to safely triage suspected cases [^111SxyZo] [^111RvB9e] [^113ihkkg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify when immediate anticoagulation is appropriate before imaging confirmation. In patients with high clinical probability (Wells score indicating "likely" DVT), multiple guidelines recommend starting anticoagulation while diagnostic testing is pending because the benefits of preventing pulmonary embolism and thrombus extension outweigh the risks of short empiric therapy, and this is especially true when there is no contraindication to anticoagulation and when delays to definitive imaging are anticipated [^111SxyZo] [^116ceJ2x] [^111xmXAU].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about proximal versus distal disease and the imaging strategy. When suspicion is high, empiric anticoagulation should not be withheld just because the first ultrasound is negative — particularly if the patient has features of proximal DVT or pelvic vein involvement — so if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or limited by body habitus or edema, I should consider CT/MR venography to avoid a missed iliofemoral thrombus, recognizing that duplex sensitivity for proximal DVT is high but drops in the pelvis and with extensive edema [^111xFbfx] [^111SxyZo] [^115NxPBB].

> I need to ensure I account for patient-specific bleeding risk. In those with very high bleeding risk (recent major hemorrhage, severe thrombocytopenia, uncontrolled hypertension, etc.), the threshold for empiric therapy rises, so I should confirm whether urgent imaging can be obtained rapidly. If not, the balance may still favor empiric anticoagulation for likely proximal DVT, but in select distal or equivocal cases with very high bleeding risk, observation with serial ultrasound may be reasonable as a shared decision [^114E6zAS] [^115xpedG].

> Let me consider the opposite end of the spectrum. In patients with low pretest probability, I should not start anticoagulation immediately — instead, I should use a high-sensitivity D-dimer to safely exclude DVT without imaging when negative, reserving ultrasound for those with positive D-dimer or persistent clinical concern, which avoids unnecessary anticoagulation and imaging while maintaining diagnostic safety [^113buXtu] [^111RvB9e] [^113ihkkg].

> Next, I should review intermediate probability scenarios. Here, I should proceed directly to compression ultrasonography rather than empiric anticoagulation, and if the initial proximal ultrasound is negative but suspicion remains, I should arrange serial proximal ultrasound in about a week to detect extension rather than starting anticoagulation reflexively, aligning with guideline-endorsed serial strategies in this risk tier [^113buXtu] [^111RvB9e] [^115z2VNB].

> But wait, what if the thrombus is isolated to the calf? I should double-check the management of acute isolated distal DVT because it differs materially from proximal disease. Guidelines suggest that in patients with acute isolated distal DVT who lack severe symptoms or major risk factors for extension, serial imaging over about 2 weeks is preferred over immediate anticoagulation, initiating therapy only if there is proximal extension or if symptoms/risk factors emerge, whereas patients with severe symptoms or high-risk features should be anticoagulated promptly like proximal DVT [^111w3fPd] [^111HEo8y] [^116FvLFV].

> I will now examine the role of DOACs in deferred workup. In settings where imaging access is constrained but clinical probability is high, a prospective study showed that deferring ultrasound up to 24 hours while starting rivaroxaban was safe, with no major bleeding and no progression events in the deferral window, supporting the feasibility of empiric DOAC therapy when imaging is imminent and bleeding risk is acceptable, though this should be individualized and not generalized to all scenarios [^111xmXAU].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway without losing the key guardrails. If Wells indicates likely DVT or there are features of proximal disease or imaging delay, start anticoagulation now and obtain imaging as soon as feasible. If Wells indicates unlikely DVT, use D-dimer to exclude disease and avoid empiric therapy. If intermediate probability, obtain compression ultrasound now and, if negative with ongoing suspicion, arrange serial ultrasound rather than immediate anticoagulation. If isolated distal DVT is found without high-risk features, prefer serial imaging over immediate anticoagulation, escalating to therapy only if extension occurs or risk profile changes [^113buXtu] [^111RvB9e] [^111w3fPd].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. Yes — start anticoagulation immediately when clinical probability is high or when imaging is delayed and bleeding risk is acceptable, because the benefits of preventing PE and extension outweigh the short-term risks, whereas wait for imaging confirmation when pretest probability is low or intermediate and there is no undue delay to definitive testing, and in isolated distal DVT without high-risk features, favor serial imaging over immediate anticoagulation, all within a shared decision framework that incorporates bleeding risk and patient preferences [^111SxyZo] [^116ceJ2x] [^113buXtu] [^111RvB9e].

---

Start anticoagulation **immediately** for patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or when imaging is delayed, as this reduces the risk of PE and thrombus extension [^111SxyZo] [^111xmXAU]. For low-risk patients, **wait for imaging confirmation** — typically with D-dimer and compression ultrasound [^111RvB9e] — to avoid unnecessary anticoagulation and bleeding [^113buXtu] [^111yF8DW]. If imaging is delayed beyond 24 hours in moderate-to-high suspicion cases, initiate anticoagulation while awaiting results [^111SxyZo].

---

## Clinical assessment and pretest probability

Use **clinical prediction rules** (e.g. Wells) to stratify pretest probability and guide testing and treatment decisions [^113vKE9G] [^111RvB9e]. High suspicion warrants **empiric anticoagulation** while awaiting imaging, given the risk of PE and extension [^111SxyZo] [^111FnQvw].

---

## Diagnostic imaging and timing

- **Compression ultrasound**: first-line for suspected DVT; high sensitivity/specificity for proximal thrombosis [^111G1Afj] [^113nHUWL].

- **Whole-leg ultrasound**: preferred when serial testing is impractical or distal DVT is suspected [^114KGV8c] [^115uVefF].

- **Serial ultrasound**: repeat in 5–7 days if initial proximal ultrasound is negative but suspicion remains [^1145owBz] [^111UTWRA].

- **CT/MR venography**: use when ultrasound is inconclusive or not feasible [^115ce2Xi] [^111xFbfx].

---

## Risks of delaying anticoagulation

Delaying anticoagulation increases **PE risk** — occurring in 50–60% of untreated proximal DVT and carrying significant mortality [^111FnQvw] [^1149uZ4y]. It also promotes **thrombus extension** from distal to proximal veins, increasing complications [^1149uZ4y] [^111FnQvw].

---

## Risks of unnecessary anticoagulation

Unnecessary anticoagulation increases **bleeding risk**, including major hemorrhage, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^111yF8DW] [^113buXtu]. It also exposes patients to treatment burden, cost, and adverse effects without benefit [^113buXtu].

## Guideline recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| High suspicion or imaging delayed | Initiate anticoagulation immediately [^111SxyZo] [^111xmXAU] |
| Low suspicion | Wait for imaging confirmation (D-dimer ± ultrasound) [^111RvB9e] [^113ihkkg] |
| Isolated distal DVT without severe symptoms or risk factors | Serial imaging over anticoagulation [^111w3fPd] [^111HEo8y] |
| Severe symptoms or risk factors for extension | Initiate anticoagulation immediately [^116FvLFV] |

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors

Bleeding risk should guide the decision to start anticoagulation; **high risk may favor waiting** for imaging, whereas **low risk supports earlier treatment** [^114E6zAS]. Comorbidities such as active cancer, recent surgery, or thrombophilia may favor **early anticoagulation** [^114ZbRHf]. Patient preferences should be incorporated through **shared decision-making** regarding risks, benefits, and timing [^115iN6nq].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **High suspicion or imaging delayed**: start anticoagulation immediately [^111SxyZo] [^111xmXAU].

- **Low suspicion**: wait for imaging confirmation [^113buXtu] [^114cvuWD].

- **Isolated distal DVT without severe symptoms**: consider serial imaging over anticoagulation [^111w3fPd] [^111HEo8y].

- **Severe symptoms or risk factors**: initiate anticoagulation immediately [^116FvLFV].

---

Start anticoagulation **immediately** when suspicion is high or imaging is delayed; **wait for confirmation** when suspicion is low, balancing bleeding risk and patient-specific factors.

### Is it useful to also image the asymptomatic leg in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis? [^113Bo3va]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Venous ultrasonography is the cornerstone of the diagnostic work-up in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Significant variations exist in clinical practice between centers and/or countries, e.g. proximal vs. whole-leg ultrasound, serial tests vs. single test, and combination with clinical probability and D-dimer testing. Fewer data exist on the need for bilateral leg imaging.

Objectives

To assess the yield of bilateral leg ultrasonography in patients with suspected DVT.

Patients and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with clinically suspected DVT. A single whole-leg ultrasound scan was performed in all patients. We extracted information on demographics, risk factors, clinical signs, pretest probability, side of clinical suspicion, and ultrasound results.

Results and Conclusions

Among the 2804 included patients, 609 (21.8%) patients had a positive ultrasound finding. A total of 20 patients (0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5–1.2%) had a thrombus diagnosed in both the symptomatic leg and asymptomatic leg. Moreover, five patients (0.2%; 95% CI 0.1–0.5%) did not have a thrombus in the symptomatic leg but had a thrombus in the asymptomatic leg. Two of 2540 patients with unilateral symptoms had no proximal DVT in the symptomatic leg and a proximal DVT in the asymptomatic leg (0.08%; 95% CI 0.0–0.3%). In summary, systematic imaging of both legs in patients with suspected DVT has a very low yield, and therefore does not appear to be justified.

Duration of therapeutic anticoagulation

The ACF recommends at least a 3-month course of anticoagulation for patients who are started on anticoagulation for a presumed provoked thrombus from the inflammatory state of CAC but did not have imaging available for confirmation. The ACF also recommends that standard anticoagulation guidelines be used to determine length of anticoagulation beyond the initial 3-month period. The ACF mentions that an exception to the minimum 3-month course is in patients with recent bleeding or high risk of bleeding. In addition, the ACF comments that if confirmatory imaging cannot be obtained within a couple days of presumed diagnosis, it is possible that delayed imaging may show an absence of thrombus when one was present initially. Therefore, they recommend continuing empiric treatment for the minimum 3-month course. Similarly, the ACCP and SCC-ISTH recommend a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulation in those patients with confirmed PE or proximal DVT. The ISTH-IG, ASH, ACC, and CDC do not mention any recommendations or suggestions regarding the duration of therapeutic anticoagulation.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^113PaYQ1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

### Management of suspected and confirmed recurrent venous thrombosis while on anticoagulant therapy. what next? [^114p6sju]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Suspected recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and vexing clinical problem. Confounding the diagnosis of recurrent VTE is a high frequency of residual VTE from prior VTE. The diagnosis of recurrent VTE must be established by comparing current imaging with past imaging to distinguish acute from chronic thrombosis. Next, we must ascertain if non-compliance was the cause of "apparent therapeutic failure" and if non-compliance is at play then re-initiate anticoagulant therapy. Therapeutic failure is relatively uncommon. As such, we must consider underlying causes of therapeutic failures including malignancy and potent thrombophilias. Finally, short term anticoagulant management of therapeutic failures is controversial, and requires further research, but the best current evidence supports a course of full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (and dose escalated LMWH if failure occurs while on full-dose LMWH).

### Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^113buXtu]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism, constitute a major global burden of disease. The diagnostic work-up of suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism includes the sequential application of a clinical decision rule and D-dimer testing. Imaging and anticoagulation can be safely withheld in patients who are unlikely to have venous thromboembolism and have a normal D-dimer. All other patients should undergo ultrasonography in case of suspected deep vein thrombosis and CT in case of suspected pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulants are first-line treatment options for venous thromboembolism because they are associated with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists and are easier to use. Use of thrombolysis should be limited to pulmonary embolism associated with haemodynamic instability. Anticoagulant treatment should be continued for at least 3 months to prevent early recurrences. When venous thromboembolism is unprovoked or secondary to persistent risk factors, extended treatment beyond this period should be considered when the risk of recurrence outweighs the risk of major bleeding.

Many guidelines suggest incorporating clinical assessment, imaging, and D-dimer testing into diagnostic algorithms in patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). This special article reviews the evidence supporting the use of algorithms and their individual components for diagnosis of upper- and lower-extremity DVT and PE in adults, including pregnant women. The authors identified evidence through several electronic database searches to April 2017, evaluated the robustness of selected evidence, assessed whether diagnostic approaches that do not use algorithms are acceptable, and identified knowledge gaps that require further research.

### Improving the investigation of suspected deep vein thrombosis in the emergency department [^116WUoB6]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis is a form of venous thromboembolic disease in which a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins, most commonly in the legs or pelvis. A DVT can dislodge and travel in the blood to the lungs causing a pulmonary embolus. This results in an obstruction to the lungs' blood supply, which can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality.

The symptoms of a DVT are relatively non-specific: swelling, pain, redness and warmth in the affected limb. As a result many different and often less serious conditions could be considered a suspected DVT and require further evaluation.

The modes of investigating a suspected DVT beyond clinical examination are the D-Dimer blood test and proximal venous ultrasound scanning. The objective diagnosis depends upon ultrasound imaging. However, due to the cost and the high number of negative tests occurring for the above reasons, predictive scoring systems were developed which allow the diagnosis to be excluded in some patients without the need for imaging. The most commonly used scoring system is the Wells' Score. This uses information from the history and clinical examination to give a pre-test probability which then guides further investigation.

The NICE guidelines for venous thromboembolic disease were updated in June 2012 and provide a structured pathway for investigating DVT based upon the Wells' Score. Previous guidance has been based upon a three-level Wells' Score for risk stratification, classifying patients as Low, Moderate and High risk. The most recent guidelines utilise a simplified two-level Wells' Score which predicts patients to be 'Likely' or 'Unlikely' to have a DVT and has a higher threshold for ultrasound imaging. By not following these guidelines significant variation can occur in the approach to these patients, resulting in both increased costs and inadequate investigation.

Suspected first lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — whole-leg ultrasonography (US)–based actions are as follows: For negative whole-leg US, no further testing be performed rather than venography (Grade 1B). If proximal US is positive for DVT, we recommend treatment rather than confirmatory venography (Grade 1B). If isolated distal DVT is detected on whole-leg US, we suggest serial testing to rule out proximal extension over treatment (Grade 2C). In patients with suspected first lower extremity DVT, we recommend against the routine use of CT venography or MRI (Grade 1C).

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^115z2VNB]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — intermediate pretest probability (PTP ~25%): The ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy using whole-leg ultrasound, or starting with proximal lower extremity ultrasound for evaluating patients suspected of having DVT in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~25%). No further testing is required if the whole-leg ultrasound is negative, but a negative initial proximal ultrasound should be followed by serial proximal ultrasound if no alternative diagnosis is identified. In this population, other potentially acceptable strategies include proximal lower extremity ultrasound alone with no additional follow-up testing for negative results, or a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding DVT followed by proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound for patients requiring additional testing; the panel recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose DVT. Studies where patients are determined to have an intermediate PTP for DVT have prevalence estimates of ∼13% to 24%, and use of a D-dimer strategy in an intermediate PTP population assumes the prevalence is ∼15% or less. If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, a negative D-dimer rules out DVT and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required, and serial ultrasound is defined as 1 additional ultrasound in 1 week following the initial ultrasound.

### Updated American College of Chest Physicians guideline… [^1167MBZy]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Bottom Line The guideline covers a lot of ground. Key updates include a clear preference for direct oral anti-coagulants, including in patients with cancer, and low-dose apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended-phase anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked VTE. There is greater leeway for observation only of selected patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism or isolated distal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and outpatient treatment of selected patients with PE. Synopsis The latest update to the American College of Chest Physicians guideline regarding antithrombotic therapy for VTE adds four new recommendations and updates eight others. The authors identified an initiation phase when anticoagulants are first given, a treatment phase of three months, and an extended phase for selected patients beyond three months.

For patients with acute isolated distal DVT, the guidelines recommend two weeks of serial imaging, with anticoagulation only if the DVT extends or the patient has severe symptoms or risk factors for extension. For patients with subsegmental PE, no proximal DVT in the legs, and who are at low risk for recurrent VTE, clinical observation without anticoagulation is recommended. Outpatient therapy for PE is recommended if patients are clinically stable; there is no recent bleeding, thrombocytopenia, or severe liver or kidney disease; and they feel well enough to be treated at home and are likely to be adherent. For patients with asymptomatic PE incidentally diagnosed during computed tomography of the chest, anticoagulation is recommended because studies have shown a similar prognosis to symptomatic PE. A direct oral anticoagulant is recommended as first-line therapy.

An exception should be made for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, for whom warfarin is recommended during the treatment phase. Extended-phase low-dose anticoagulation with apixaban, 2. 5 mg twice daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, is recommended for all patients with unprovoked VTE. This has only been studied for two to four years, so extending anticoagulation beyond that is of uncertain benefit. Aspirin is recommended when patients discontinue extended-phase anticoagulation.

### Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis recurrence: ultrasound criteria [^115x5HZG]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is often suspected in patients after anticoagulant drug withdrawal. The clinical signs can be confused with the onset of post-thrombotic syndrome. For these reasons, diagnosis of DVT recurrence must rely on an accurate method.

Materials and Methods

In order to assess this challenging clinical issue, we performed an overview of the literature regarding ultrasound criteria for the diagnosis of recurrent DVT through a Medline search, which included articles published from January 1, 1980 to February 20, 2017.

Results

Eighty-eight publications were found based on the defined keywords, of which nine articles with a relevant abstract were selected. By searching the reference lists of these nine articles, we obtained another 27 relevant articles. A new non-compressible vein or an increase in the diameter of a previously thrombosed vein segment by > 4mm are sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of DVT recurrence. In contrast, an increase in diameter of < 2mm enables recurrence to be ruled out. An increase between 2 and 4mm is deemed equivocal. Criteria based on echogenicity and Doppler venous blood flow are not reproducible. Other diagnostic imaging methods, mainly direct thrombus magnetic resonance imaging, are currently under evaluation.

Conclusions

Ultrasound remains the most useful test for the diagnosis of recurrent DVT. Further imaging tests need to be validated.

### Basics of diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism [^115iN6nq]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), is common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The symptoms and signs of VTE are nonspecific. Well-established integrated diagnostic strategies combining clinical probability scores and D-dimer are used to identify patients with a low probability of VTE, where the diagnosis can be safely excluded without imaging. In patients with confirmed VTE, anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment. However, patients with high-risk features at presentation may benefit from advanced reperfusion therapies such as thrombolysis and/or interventional approaches to reduce early mortality and/or long-term morbidity. The advent of direct oral anticoagulants has greatly simplified the treatment of VTE for most patients, with a persisting role for low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists in select patient groups. Following an initial 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation, those with major transient provoking factors can safely discontinue anticoagulation. Balancing the risk of recurrent VTE and bleeding risk is central to decisions regarding long-term anticoagulation, and patients should be included in shared decision-making. Assessment and recognition of common long-term complications such as postthrombotic syndrome and post-PE syndrome are also essential, given they are associated with significant adverse impact on long-term quality of life, with a significant risk of mortality associated with the less frequent complication of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. This review provides a basic overview and framework for the diagnostic approach to deep vein thrombosis and PE, risk stratification of confirmed diagnoses, and management.

### Improving the investigation of suspected deep vein thrombosis in the emergency department [^115RVK75]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The introduction of the latest guidelines through the described intervention has had a significant impact upon the department and its patients. Fewer ultrasound scans are being performed both in the first instance and overall resulting in significant time and monetary savings for busy Emergency and Radiology Departments. Documentation has also improved substantially, although this could benefit from further action in the future. Finally, patient care has benefited with cases of suspected deep vein thrombosis now investigated more thoroughly and consistently according to the latest evidence-based guidance.

### Safety and feasibility of rivaroxaban in deferred workup of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis [^111xmXAU]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines suggest using empiric low-molecular-weight heparin if the diagnostic workup of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is expected to be delayed. The role of direct oral anticoagulants for deferred compression ultrasound imaging (CUS) in patients with suspected DVT remains unexplored. The main objective of the study was to assess the safety of deferring CUS with therapeutic doses of rivaroxaban. We prospectively included consecutive outpatients referred to the Emergency Department at Østfold Hospital, Norway, with suspected first or recurrent lower-extremity DVT between February 2015 and November 2018. Patients were discharged with rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily while awaiting CUS within 24 hours if D-dimer level was ≥ 0.5 mg/L fibrinogen-equivalent units. The primary outcome was the rate of major bleeding incidents from study inclusion until DVT was confirmed and anticoagulation therapy continued, or otherwise up to 48 hours following administration of the last tablet of rivaroxaban. The secondary outcome was the rate of progressive DVT symptoms or symptoms or signs of pulmonary embolism between hospital discharge until venous thromboembolism was diagnosed. Six hundred twenty-four of 1653 patients referred with suspected DVT were included (37.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 35.4–40.1). DVT was diagnosed in 119 patients (19.1%; 95% CI, 16.1–22.3). There were no major bleeding incidents, yielding an observed major bleeding rate of 0% (1-sided 95% CI < 0.4). No patients experienced major complications in the interval that CUS was deferred (0%; 95% CI, 0.0–0.6). Deferring CUS for up to 24 hours in patients with suspected DVT with therapeutic doses of rivaroxaban is a safe strategy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02486445.

### Diagnosis and treatment of deep venous thrombosis… [^113nHUWL]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The best diagnostic test available for DVT is venography, although magnetic resonance imaging may rival venography for accuracy. Doppler ultrasonography has a sensitivity and specificity of 95 percent for proximal DVT. The best diagnostic approach depends on pretest probability as determined by clinical characteristics. In patients with a low pretest probability, a normal Doppler ultrasonogram is enough to rule out DVT. Abnormality on the ultrasonogram would require confirmation by venography. In patients with a high pretest probability of DVT, a positive finding on ultrasonography is sufficient to initiate treatment while a negative study result would require venography to rule out DVT. In a patient with moderate probability, a positive ultrasound result would support the initiation of treatment, but a negative test result might require repeat ultrasonography in one week.

If the second test is normal, the patient can be reassured; if the test is positive, treatment is initiated. If the initial ultrasound result, as well as the d-dimer test result, is negative, the need for repeat ultrasonography is eliminated. The reason for treating DVT is to prevent pulmonary embolism. Proximal DVTs are associated with a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary embolism if left untreated and must be treated early with heparin. Distal DVTs propagate less than 20 percent of the time and usually do so within one week. A patient with a distal DVT can be observed with serial ultrasonography, and treatment can be delayed until proximal propagation is noted. DVTs that remain confined to the calf are associated with a less than 1 percent risk of pulmonary embolism and a 2 percent chance of recurrent DVT. After four to five days and when the International Normalized Ratio is greater than 2. 0 for two consecutive days, the heparin therapy can be discontinued.

In patients with idiopathic, first-episode DVT, anticoagulation therapy should continue for at least six months, although the optimal treatment time is unknown. Age and a history of prior thromboembolic events are strong risk factors for recurrence. Ofri concludes with the opinion that there is little utility in aggressive cancer work-up in patients after an initial episode of DVT. A thorough history, physical examination and age-appropriate cancer screening are adequate.

### Factors associated with positive thrombus findings at ultrasonography in COVID-19 ward patients who underwent imaging for suspected deep vein thrombosis under prophylactic anticoagulation [^112Lviq7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is increased in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its presence is associated with worse outcomes. Ultrasound examination of patients with COVID-19 with a suspected DVT is challenging owing to concerns with disease transmission; the timely initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation is essential. This study aimed to identify patient factors associated with positive thrombus findings at ultrasound examination in patients with COVID-19 who underwent imaging for suspected DVT.

Methods

Patients who did not require intensive care unit treatment and who underwent ultrasound imaging for suspected DVT between March and December 2020 were included retrospectively. Patient demographics, comorbidities, modified Well's score, and d-dimer results on the day of ultrasound examination were recorded. Parameters for a higher likelihood of a positive DVT result were determined by comparing patients with confirmed DVT on ultrasound examination and patients with negative ultrasound findings. To determine a cut-off for d-dimer levels, a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed. The sensitivity and specificity of the determined high-risk factors in the prediction of positive ultrasound results were calculated.

Results

A positive history for DVT (25% vs 4%; P < .001), thrombophilia (9% vs 2%; p = 0.048), immobilization (53% vs 23%; p = 0.001), and a Well's score ≥ 2 (50% vs 21%; p = 0.001) were more frequent in patients with DVT. The mean d-dimer levels were higher in patients with DVT (3871 ± 1805 vs 2075 ± 1543; P < .001). The presence of either thrombophilia or a d-dimer level of > 2020 had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 64%. The presence of either thrombophilia, a d-dimer level of > 2020, or a Well's score of ≥ 2 had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 51%.

Conclusions

Patients with COVID-19 with a d-dimer of > 2020, a positive history for thrombophilia, and a Well's score of ≥ 2 should undergo a timely ultrasound examination. The high risk of DVT should be remembered for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Diagnosis and Imaging of Deep Vein Thrombosis and the Post-thrombotic Syndrome

It is important to understand the reasons why imaging has become such a crucial part of the assessment of patients with an acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the potential long-term sequelae referred to as the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). The symptoms and signs of venous thrombosis are caused by obstruction to venous outflow, vascular inflammation, or pulmonary embolization. Physicians cannot rely solely on clinical signs and symptoms to establish diagnosis and extent of deep vein thrombosis, and must therefore depend on imaging studies to guide treatment. In 60–80% of patients referred for clinically suspected venous thrombosis, however, diagnosis will not be confirmed by objective testing, stressing the clinical complexity of diagnosing deep vein thrombosis.

Duplex ultrasound (DUS) is the noninvasive diagnostic modality most often used for diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, with a reported sensitivity and specificity of approximately 97%. Other imaging modalities that are currently used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis include computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

It is essential to accurately diagnose deep vein thrombosis as soon as possible to start the treatment early. Early treatment of deep vein thrombosis with anticoagulants has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of pulmonary embolism and associated mortality. Furthermore, early treatment prevents extension of deep vein thrombosis from distal veins to more proximal veins and relieves acute symptoms in the leg. Rapid achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation and adequate treatment duration prevent early recurrence of deep vein thrombosis and may also decrease the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome.

MRI for suspected DVT — capabilities and access: MRI can be applied using a variety of techniques; some techniques visualize blood flow without the need for contrast agents, and MR can identify DVT by direct thrombus imaging that visualizes thrombus against a suppressed background; this technique has the advantages of being noninvasive and not requiring IV contrast agents. However, MRI is not routinely accessible for this purpose in most centers.

### Baseline imaging after therapy for unprovoked venous thromboembolism: a randomized controlled comparison of baseline imaging for diagnosis of suspected recurrence [^116542wb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

After a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), many patients have residual pulmonary and/or lower limb vascular obstruction following completion of short-term anticoagulation. Residual vascular obstruction may complicate the diagnosis of recurrent VTE. Whether baseline imaging, conducted after completion of anticoagulation, helps in interpreting diagnostic testing in patients who subsequently have suspected recurrent VTE is unknown.

Study Design

The REVERSE study is a cohort study whose primary aim was to derive a clinical decision rule to guide the duration of anticoagulation after a first unprovoked VTE. All patients underwent baseline imaging after completing 5–7 months of anticoagulant therapy. We performed a post hoc randomized controlled comparison among 121 patients investigated for a suspected recurrent VTE during follow-up: the decision on recurrent VTE with or without baseline imaging was made available to two independent adjudicators.

Results

The proportion of patients not classifiable for recurrent VTE was statistically significantly higher in the group with no baseline imaging than in the group with baseline imaging: one in five as compared with one in 25. The interobserver agreement between the two adjudicators was better in the group with baseline imaging than in the group with no baseline imaging: κ-values were 0.78 and 0.54, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with a first unprovoked VTE, baseline imaging at completion of anticoagulant therapy helps in interpreting diagnostic tests performed in cases of suspected recurrent VTE.

### Diagnosis of suspected venous thromboembolism [^114cvuWD]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

The primary goal of diagnostic testing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is to identify all patients who could benefit from anticoagulant therapy. Test results that identify patients as having a ≤ 2% risk of VTE in the next 3 months are judged to exclude deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Clinical evaluation, with assessment of: (1) clinical pretest probability (CPTP) for VTE; (2) likelihood of important alternative diagnoses; and (3) the probable yield of D-dimer and various imaging tests, guide which tests should be performed. The combination of nonhigh CPTP and negative D-dimer testing excludes DVT or PE in one-third to a half of outpatients. Venous ultrasound of the proximal veins, with or without examination of the distal veins, is the primary imaging test for leg and upper-extremity DVT. If a previous test is not available for comparison, the positive predictive value of ultrasound is low in patients with previous DVT. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the primary imaging test for PE and often yields an alternative diagnosis when there is no PE. Ventilation-perfusion scanning is associated with less radiation exposure than CTPA and is preferred in younger patients, particularly during pregnancy. If DVT or PE cannot be "ruled-in" or "ruled-out" by initial diagnostic testing, patients can usually be managed safely by: (1) withholding anticoagulant therapy; and (2) doing serial ultrasound examinations to detect new or extending DVT.

Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (lower extremity) — diagnostic strategy for unlikely pretest probability (PTP): The ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding recurrent DVT in a population with unlikely PTP, with proximal lower extremity ultrasound for patients with positive D-dimer or likely PTP. A highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, and a negative D-dimer rules out DVT with no additional testing or anticoagulation required. D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnant), and there are limited data for patients receiving anticoagulant therapy who present with suspected recurrent DVT. The strategy assumes tests are obtained under optimal conditions; suboptimal D-dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing. If clinical suspicion remains high after a negative initial proximal ultrasound, serial proximal ultrasound could be considered, and prior imaging should be compared with current studies to determine whether findings are new and represent recurrent DVT. Compression ultrasound generally considers a new venous segment or increased noncompressibility of > 4 mm as diagnostic of recurrent DVT.

### Venous thromboembolism: diagnosis and treatment [^11588WDx]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) presents as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is the third most common fatal cardiovascular condition in the United States. Clinical prediction rules such as the Wells' Criteria for DVT, Wells' Criteria for PE, and Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria should be used to determine the pretest probability of DVT or PE. The D-dimer assay is used in low-risk patients to rule out DVT and in moderate-risk patients to rule out PE. Compression ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose DVT. PE typically is diagnosed with computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or with ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy if the patient has contraindications to computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. Preferred outpatient therapy for VTE is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant rather than a vitamin K antagonist or low-molecular-weight heparin. Most patients with acute uncomplicated DVT can be treated as outpatients. The Simplified PE Severity Index can guide treatment decisions for patients with PE. Apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used for initial management without the need to bridge with parenteral therapy. Treatment is recommended for 3 to 6 months after initial VTE. Patients with chronic risk factors, a recurrent VTE after primary treatment, or a first unprovoked VTE should be considered for secondary prevention with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant or warfarin after a bleeding-risk assessment.

Recurrent lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — diagnostic approach: For suspected recurrent lower extremity DVT, if the D‑dimer strategy is used a highly sensitive D‑dimer assay is required, and a negative D‑dimer rules out DVT with no additional testing or anticoagulation required; D‑dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in post‑surgical or pregnant populations, and data are limited in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. The strategy assumes optimal test conditions, and suboptimal D‑dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing; if clinical suspicion remains high after a negative initial ultrasound, serial ultrasound could be considered. When prior imaging is available, comparison of previous and current imaging is warranted to determine new findings, and compression ultrasound generally considers a new venous segment or an increase in noncompressibility of > 4 mm as diagnostic of recurrent DVT. In studies assessing this strategy, a modified Wells score was used to assess clinical probability, starting with D‑dimer assumes timely results and cost offset from avoiding unnecessary ultrasound in unlikely PTP, and patients at likely PTP should undergo proximal lower extremity ultrasound.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^113ihkkg]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Modern diagnostic strategies for venous thromboembolism (VTE) incorporate pretest probability (PTP; prevalence) assessment. The ability of diagnostic tests to correctly identify or exclude VTE is influenced by VTE prevalence and test accuracy characteristics.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines are intended to support patients, clinicians, and health care professionals in VTE diagnosis. Diagnostic strategies were evaluated for pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower and upper extremity, and recurrent VTE.

Methods

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) formed a multidisciplinary panel including patient representatives. The McMaster University GRADE Centre completed systematic reviews up to 1 October 2017. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess evidence and make recommendations. Test accuracy estimates and VTE population prevalence were used to model expected outcomes in diagnostic pathways. Where modeling was not feasible, management and accuracy studies were used to formulate recommendations.

Results

Ten recommendations are presented, by PTP for patients with suspected PE and lower extremity DVT, and for recurrent VTE and upper extremity DVT.

Conclusions

For patients at low (unlikely) VTE risk, using D-dimer as the initial test reduces the need for diagnostic imaging. For patients at high (likely) VTE risk, imaging is warranted. For PE diagnosis, ventilation-perfusion scanning and computed tomography pulmonary angiography are the most validated tests, whereas lower or upper extremity DVT diagnosis uses ultrasonography. Research is needed on new diagnostic modalities and to validate clinical decision rules for patients with suspected recurrent VTE.

### The unlikely presence of deep vein thrombosis in a patient with low pretest probability and a negative D-dimer: a case report [^113grqex]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is commonly encountered in the emergency department. Clinical models, such as the Wells criteria, allow physicians to estimate the probability of DVT in a patient. Current literature suggests a low pretest probability combined with a negative D-dimer laboratory study rules out DVT approximately 99% of the time.

Case Report

This case discusses a 37-year-old male patient who had a low pretest probability and a negative D-dimer, but was found to have a DVT on Doppler ultrasound. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The astute emergency physician must not discount clinical suspicion in order to decide when radiographic imaging is warranted for a possible venous thromboembolism. New adjuncts, such as bedside ultrasonography, can also be implemented to further risk stratify patients, potentially decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with DVT.

Pulmonary embolism imaging — Table 2 suggestions for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) specify the following actions using computed tomography (CT) and alternative tests. Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE", with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". Defer CT until after d-dimer result for "Intermediate pretest probability" or "Low pretest probability and PERC > 0", supported by "Low incidence of PE (< 1.1%) if d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0", given an "Incidence of PE < 1%". For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography", because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast". A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required".

Remarks specify that US imaging of the deep veins of both legs should be done to exclude proximal DVT, clinical surveillance can be supplemented by serial US imaging of the proximal deep veins of both legs to detect evolving DVT, and patients and physicians are more likely to opt for clinical surveillance over anticoagulation if there is good cardiopulmonary reserve or a high risk of bleeding. The document notes the evidence supporting these recommendations is low quality because of indirectness and limited ability to predict which patients will have VTE complications without anticoagulation.

Deep vein thrombosis epidemiology and diagnostic testing — DVT is a common condition that affects approximately one in 1,000 persons per year. Objective testing for DVT is crucial because clinical assessment alone is unreliable, and the consequences of misdiagnosis are serious, including fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). Three categories of tests are typically used to determine the probability of DVT: (1) clinical probability assessment based on patient history and clinical findings, (2) D-dimer assays, and (3) imaging studies (most commonly venous ultrasonography [US] and less frequently venography, CT scan, or MRI).

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111SxyZo]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2.0 (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3.1 to 4.0) [Grade 1A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1.5 to 1.9) compared to INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Grade 1A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1A). For most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend clinicians not use systemic thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for PE, the recommendations are similar to those for DVT.

Figure 8 — Suspected recurrent lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after nondiagnostic proximal ultrasonography (US) with a prior US for comparison is managed using defined test-and-interpret pathways: current US is "nondiagnostic" when the only abnormality is an increase in residual venous diameter of < 4 mm but ≥ 2 mm; "Negative" is a normal US or prior noncompressible segment with stable/decreased diameter or an interval increase of < 2 mm; "Positive" is a new noncompressible segment or an interval increase of ≥ 4 mm. Available strategies include repeat proximal US in 1 week, testing with a moderate or highly sensitive D-dimer (with serial testing if positive), or venography, with comparative grading specified as "Grade 2B for repeat proximal US in 1 week or moderate or highly sensitive D-dimer over treating for DVT" and "Grade 1B for venography over treating for DVT".

Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — diagnostic testing recommendations: In patients suspected of having upper extremity DVT, we suggest initial evaluation with combined-modality ultrasound (US) (compression with either Doppler or color Doppler) over other initial tests, including highly sensitive D-dimer or venography (Grade 2C). If initial US is negative for thrombosis despite a high clinical suspicion, we suggest further testing with a moderate or highly sensitive D-dimer, serial US, or venographic-based imaging (traditional, CT scan, or MRI) rather than no further testing (Grade 2C). In patients with an initial negative combined modality US and subsequent negative moderate or highly sensitive D-dimer or CT scan or MRI, we recommend no further testing, rather than confirmatory venography (Grade 1C). We suggest that an initial negative combined-modality US with a positive D-dimer or less than complete US evaluation undergo venography rather than no further testing, unless there is an alternative explanation for symptoms (Grade 2B), in which case testing to evaluate for an alternative diagnosis should be performed. We suggest that patients with a positive D-dimer or those with less than complete US evaluation but an alternative explanation for their symptoms undergo confirmatory testing and treatment of this alternative explanation rather than venography (Grade 2C). Remarks note that further radiologic testing rather than D-dimer testing is preferable in patients with comorbid conditions typically associated with elevated D-dimer levels.

### Incidental deep venous thrombosis diagnosed on lower extremity computed tomography is a rare but clinically impactful finding [^111yF8DW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The CHEST guidelines currently do not specifically distinguish the management of incidentally found DVTs from DVTs diagnosed in patients where there is a high index of suspicion. In this study, this resulted in a wide variety of treatment decisions with differing patient outcomes. Among the patients with incidental DVTs, five were started on anticoagulation. The two patients who had DVT confirmed on subsequent imaging completed an appropriate course of anticoagulation and did not experience any complications from their DVT or anticoagulation. One patient who did not have repeat imaging ultimately completed a 3-month course of anticoagulation and also did not experience any complications associated with their DVT or with their treatment. Among the two patients whose repeat imaging did not demonstrate DVT, one had the anticoagulation discontinued after the negative repeat study, whereas the other had continuation of the anticoagulation and experienced significant bleeding complications.

Although this risk of major hemorrhage on anticoagulation for DVT is generally outweighed by the benefits of preventing proximal extension and PE, the bleeding risk is not insignificant for patients on anticoagulation. The rates of significant bleeding complications for patients on anticoagulation for DVT vary greatly depending on the patient's risk factors, which include age, hypertension, renal disease, liver disease, prior stroke, prior bleeding, alcohol/drug abuse, and cancer, among others. For patients with no risk factors for hemorrhage, the risk of major bleeding is 0.8% per year. In patients with one risk factor, that rate is doubled to 1.6% per year. In patients with two or more risk factors, the rate of major bleeding is greater than 6.5% per year. Although most patients with incidental DVTs in this study did well, one patient did have significant bleeding complications from anticoagulation, suggesting that there is a cost to these incidental diagnoses. In their recommendation against the routine use of CT venography for diagnosis of DVT, the CHEST guidelines specifically note the lack of management studies to determine the consequences of using CT venography in practice.

### How I treat isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (IDDVT) [^113KVRsi]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Thromboses limited to infrapopliteal leg deep veins (isolated distal deep vein thrombosis [IDDVT]) are frequently diagnosed in subjects with suspected pulmonary embolism or DVT and account for one-fourth to one-half of all diagnosed leg DVTs. Despite their frequency, the natural history of IDDVTs and their real risk of thromboembolic complications are still uncertain because of the scarcity of prospective, blind, nonintervention studies. Therefore it is still debated whether they warrant diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis is based on ultrasonographic examination, which is more operator dependent and less sensitive in distal than in proximal veins. The available data seem to support the view that most IDDVTs are self-limiting and inconsequential for patients, though in some cases they can be associated with complications and warrant diagnosis and treatment. The available guidelines for treatment of IDDVTs give different indications ranging from serial imaging of the deep veins for 2 weeks to detect and treat only in case of proximal extension, to giving oral anticoagulation in all IDDVT patients for 3 months. I review this issue, focusing on possible and suggested treatments in symptomatic IDDVT patients, and describe our current therapeutic approach to these patients.

### Duplex follow-up of patients with DVT: does it have clinical significance? [^112pzJmV]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Venous duplex ultrasonography is now the diagnostic test of choice for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at many institutions. In the research setting, the ability to serially evaluate thrombi localized to specific venous segments has shown the importance of recurrent thrombotic events and recanalization in the natural history of acute DVT. In addition, its availability and noninvasive nature have led increasingly to the use of serial venous ultrasound examinations in the clinical management of acute DVT. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to support the use of follow-up ultrasonography for many of these purposes. Based on the limited evidence available, follow-up ultrasound examinations appear to be warranted only in patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis and contraindications to conventional anticoagulation, patients with recurrent symptoms, and to establish a baseline after completion of therapy in patients at risk for recurrence. In contrast, the anticoagulant management of acute DVT should be guided by the results of clinical trials, and currently available evidence provides no basis for using ultrasonography to guide the duration of anticoagulation. Therefore, if therapy is based on guidelines derived from clinical trials, there are few indications for the noninvasive follow-up of DVT during anticoagulant treatment in the absence of new symptoms.

Whether and how to prescribe anticoagulants to patients with isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — AT9 discouraged routine whole-leg US examinations in patients with suspected DVT; the rationale for not routinely examining distal veins after proximal DVT is excluded includes that other assessment may indicate isolated distal DVT is unlikely, a repeat US of the proximal veins can be done after a week to detect possible extension and need for treatment, and false-positive findings for DVT occur more often with distal than proximal US; if the calf veins are imaged and isolated distal DVT is diagnosed, two management options are stated: treat with anticoagulant therapy or do not treat unless extension is detected on a follow-up US.

### Residual thrombosis on ultrasonography to guide the duration of anticoagulation in patients with deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^1151XQXk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities remains uncertain.

Objective

To assess whether tailoring the duration of anticoagulation on the basis of the persistence of residual thrombi on ultrasonography reduces the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with the administration of conventional fixed-duration treatment in adults with proximal DVT.

Design

Parallel, randomized trial from 1999 to 2006. Trained physicians who assessed outcomes were blinded to patient assignment status, but patients and providers were not.

Setting

9 university or hospital centers in Italy.

Patients

538 consecutive outpatients with a first episode of acute proximal DVT at completion of an uneventful 3-month period of anticoagulation.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned (stratified by center and secondary vs. unprovoked DVT by using a computer-generated list that was accessible only to a trial nurse) to fixed-duration anticoagulation (no further anticoagulation for secondary thrombosis and an extra 3 months for unprovoked thrombosis) or flexible-duration, ultrasonography-guided anticoagulation (no further anticoagulation in patients with recanalized veins and continued anticoagulation in all other patients for up to 9 months for secondary DVT and up to 21 months for unprovoked thrombosis). For the primary outcome assessment, 530 patients completed the trial.

Measurements

The rate of confirmed recurrent VTE during 33 months of follow-up.

Results

Overall, 46 (17.2%) of 268 patients allocated to fixed-duration anticoagulation and 32 (11.9%) of 270 patients allocated to flexible-duration anticoagulation developed recurrent VTE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.99]). For patients with unprovoked DVT, the adjusted HR was 0.61 (CI, 0.36 to 1.02) and 0.81 (CI, 0.32 to 2.06) for those with secondary DVT. Major bleeding occurred in 2 (0.7%) patients in the fixed-duration group and 4 (1.5%) patients in the flexible-duration group (P = 0.67).

Limitations

The trial lacked a double-blind design. The sample size was not powered to detect differences in bleeding between groups and to detect effectiveness of the intervention in the subgroups of patients with unprovoked and secondary DVT. Patients with previous thromboembolism, permanent risk factors for thrombosis, and thrombophilic abnormalities other than factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation were excluded.

Conclusion

Tailoring the duration of anticoagulation on the basis of ultrasonography findings reduces the rate of recurrent VTE in adults with proximal DVT.

### Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis using the wells rule in clinically important subgroups: individual patient data meta-analysis [^115awxgr]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Thirdly, controversy remains on the value of the Wells rule in patients with suspected recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Leg problems in patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis can be clinically a difficult dilemma, as the probable causes include either an exacerbation of post-thrombotic syndrome or recurrent disease. In addition, recurrent deep vein thrombosis is difficult to confirm even with imaging, and this diagnosis often leads to long term anticoagulation treatment. An incorrect diagnosis commits the patient to an unnecessary risk of bleeding complications. An accurate method to exclude recurrent thrombosis is therefore of high clinical importance. An updated version of the Wells rule was created for this purpose that included one extra point given if a suspected patient has a history of confirmed deep vein thrombosis. Yet, this modified model was never properly validated. In fact, in our individual patient data meta-analysis, seven studies even excluded patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis. Consequently, the ninth American College of Chest Physicians guideline concluded that diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected recurrent deep vein thrombosis were never adequately evaluated. As such, available evidence on this topic was graded as low. Our individual patient data meta-analysis is the largest present dataset available to tackle the problem of how to diagnose deep vein thrombosis in patients with a history of the condition: we included nearly 1000 patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (n = 941) with 220 confirmed cases in that particular sample. Using this dataset, we found that using the original Wells model an unacceptably high proportion of low risk patients combined with a negative D-dimer test result still have deep vein thrombosis: 2.5% (95% confidence interval 1.2% to 5.4%). In a sensitivity analysis, using the updated model, this failure rate was indeed lower. Adding one point to the original Wells score in patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (the updated model), and defining low risk as a score ≤ 1 combined with a negative D-dimer test result leads to a failure rate of 1.0% (95% confidence interval 0.6% to 1.6%; see appendix IV on bmj.com for details of the model). This in turn enables a safe exclusion of deep vein thrombosis in (still) around 1 in every 3 patients (efficiency 27.2%, 95% confidence interval 19.2% to 37.0%; see appendix IV on bmj.com).

### Diagnostic management of clinically suspected acute deep vein thrombosis [^115x37dL]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease that may lead to potentially fatal complications, such as pulmonary embolism. In the past decades several diagnostic tools and algorithms for DVT have been studied. Currently the combination of a clinical decision rule, D-dimer testing and compression ultrasonography has proved to be safe and effective for the diagnosis of DVT in the lower extremities. Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be useful as additional or secondary imaging modalities. This review will discuss the elements currently used in making the clinical diagnosis of DVT. These elements include clinical decision rules and D-dimer testing, different imaging investigations and the appropriate use of these within diagnostic algorithms in patients with clinically suspected DVT. Although current knowledge of the options available to diagnose DVT of the lower extremities is well established, there are still unresolved issues, including the optimal diagnosis of recurrent DVT and distal DVT. Furthermore, the diagnosis of DVT of the upper extremities will be discussed, including the different imaging modalities and the limitations of these techniques.

### How we diagnose and treat deep vein thrombosis [^114NwUKM]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires both clinical assessment and objective testing because the clinical features are nonspecific and investigations can be either falsely positive or negative. The initial step in the diagnostic process is to stratify patients into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories using a validated clinical model. When the clinical probability is intermediate or high and the venous ultrasound result is positive, acute symptomatic DVT is confirmed. Similarly, when the probability is low and the ultrasound result is normal, DVT is ruled out. A low clinical probability combined with a negative D-dimer result can also be used to rule out DVT, thereby obviating the need for ultrasonography. In contrast, when the clinical assessment is discordant with the results of objective testing, serial venous ultrasonography or venography is required to confirm or refute a diagnosis of DVT. Once a patient is diagnosed with an acute DVT, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the agent of choice for initial therapy and oral anticoagulant therapy is the standard for long-term secondary prophylaxis. Therapy should continue for at least 3 months; the decision to continue treatment beyond 3 months is made by weighing the risks of recurrent thrombosis and anticoagulant-related bleeding, and is influenced by patient preference. Screening for associated thrombophilia is not indicated routinely, but should be performed in selected patients whose clinical features suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state. Several new anticoagulants with theoretical advantages over existing agents are undergoing evaluation in phase 3 studies in patients with venous thromboembolism.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116ceJ2x]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

### Decision-making in the management of venous thromboembolism [^115MWraP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism comprising deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus is common. Patients with venous thromboembolism may present to a variety of health care providers, and while a significant proportion of patients begin treatment in the hospital, ambulatory management of both deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus is feasible and becoming more common. Initial anticoagulant management, investigation of venous thromboembolism etiology, and decisions about extended anticoagulation require coordinated care by physicians from multiple specialties. Comprehensive management of venous thromboembolism requires coordinated care from the time of presentation in order to expedite diagnosis, initiate timely anticoagulant treatment, determine the need for extended anticoagulation based on risk of bleeding and recurrent thrombosis, and advise on thromboprophylaxis during future high-risk periods for venous thromboembolism. In this review we use case scenarios to provide an operational framework, based on current evidence-based recommendations, for informed decision-making about a number of clinical practice issues that are frequently encountered in the management of venous thromboembolism patients.

### Anticoagulation in patients with suspected DVT… [^11499QrM]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography frequently is performed to evaluate patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis of the leg. Simplified compression ultrasonography has high accuracy for symptomatic proximal venous thrombosis but can miss thrombosis of the distal calf veins. A repeat simplified compression ultrasonography is necessary within five to seven days to look for proximal thrombus propagation. Comprehensive duplex ultrasonography examines the deep veins within the entire leg down to the malleolus, thus potentially obviating routine repeat scanning. Stevens and associates performed a prospective cohort study of patients with a suspected first episode of DVT who had a negative comprehensive leg duplex ultrasonogram. The researchers examined the rate of venous thromboembolism in these patients after withholding anticoagulant therapy for three months. Exclusion criteria included previous DVT, pregnancy, and patients receiving long-term anticoagulation therapy for another reason.

Comprehensive ultrasonography was performed by registered vascular technologists and interpreted by a vascular surgeon. If a single, noncompressible segment was identified, the study was reported as positive, and the patient was diagnosed with DVT. If the results of all imaged venous segments were negative, anticoagulation was withheld without consideration of symptoms or clinical signs. The authors conclude that although comprehensive duplex ultrasonography takes more time to perform than simplified compression ultrasonogaphy, the advantage of requiring only a single examination is significant. They state that it is safe to withhold anticoagulation from patients with suspected symptomatic DVT who have a negative comprehensive duplex sonogram, repeatedly negative simplified compression ultrasonograms, or one negative simplified duplex ultrasonogram and normal results on a whole blood D-dimer test.

When comprehensive ultrasonography reveals thrombosis isolated to the calf vein, anticoagulation can be withheld if ultrasonography is repeated to monitor extension of these thrombi into proximal deep veins. The authors add that these results may not apply to patients who are pregnant or if factors prevent visualization of the deep venous system of the calf. In an accompanying editorial, El Kheir and Büller confirm the value of the single comprehensive ultrasonogram approach and recommend further testing of this procedure with good pretest clinical probability analysis or D-dimer testing to find the optimal algorithm to evaluate patients for symptomatic DVT.

### Venous thromboembolism [^111RvB9e]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, comprising both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a chronic illness that affects nearly 10 million people every year worldwide. Strong provoking risk factors for venous thromboembolism include major surgery and active cancer, but most events are unprovoked. Diagnosis requires a sequential work-up that combines assessment of clinical pretest probability for venous thromboembolism using a clinical score (eg, Wells score), D-dimer testing, and imaging. Venous thromboembolism can be considered excluded in patients with both a non-high clinical pretest probability and normal D-dimer concentrations. When required, ultrasonography should be done for a suspected deep vein thrombosis and CT or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy for a suspected pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first-line treatment for almost all patients with venous thromboembolism (including those with cancer). After completing 3–6 months of initial treatment, anticoagulation can be discontinued in patients with venous thromboembolism provoked by a major transient risk factor. Patients whose long-term risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism outweighs the long-term risk of major bleeding, such as those with active cancer or men with unprovoked venous thromboembolism, should receive indefinite anticoagulant treatment. Pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is generally warranted in patients undergoing major orthopaedic or cancer surgery. Ongoing research is focused on improving diagnostic strategies for suspected deep vein thrombosis, comparing different DOACs, developing safer anticoagulants, and further individualising approaches for the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism.

Adjunct imaging when ultrasound (US) is negative or impractical: In patients with extensive unexplained leg swelling, if there is no DVT on proximal CUS or whole-leg US and D-dimer testing has not been performed or is positive, the iliac veins should be imaged to exclude isolated iliac DVT.

Suspected first lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — initial testing and follow-up actions: We suggest initial use of a moderately sensitive (Grade 2C) or highly sensitive (Grade 2B) D-dimer rather than proximal compression ultrasound (CUS). If the proximal CUS is negative, we recommend no further testing compared with (i) repeat proximal CUS after 1 week, (ii) whole-leg ultrasound (US), or (iii) venography (Grade 1B for all comparisons). If the D-dimer is positive, we suggest further testing with CUS of the proximal veins rather than (i) whole-leg US (Grade 2C) or (ii) venography (Grade 1B). If CUS of the proximal veins is positive, we suggest treating for DVT and performing no further testing over performing confirmatory venography (Grade 2C). In patients in whom US is impractical or nondiagnostic, we suggest CT scan venography or magnetic resonance (MR) venography, or MR direct thrombus imaging could be used as an alternative to venography.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on suspected lower extremity deep vein thrombosis [^111FnQvw]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common clinical concern, with an incidence that increases with advanced age. DVT typically begins below the knee but may extend proximally and result in pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism can occur in 50% to 60% of patients with untreated DVT and can be fatal. Although clinical examination and plasma d-dimer blood evaluation can often predict the presence of DVT, imaging remains critical for the diagnostic confirmation and treatment planning of DVT. Patients with above-the-knee or proximal DVT have a high risk for pulmonary embolism and are recommended to receive anticoagulation therapy. On the other hand, patients with below-the-knee or distal DVT rarely experience pulmonary embolism, and anticoagulation therapy in these patients remains controversial. However, one sixth of patients with distal DVT may experience extension of their thrombus above the knee and therefore are recommended to undergo serial imaging assessment at 1 week to exclude proximal DVT extension if anticoagulation therapy is not initiated. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging method for evaluation of patients with newly suspected lower extremity DVT. Magnetic resonance and CT venography can be especially helpful for the evaluation of suspected DVT in the pelvis and thigh. Contrast x-ray venography, the historic gold standard for DVT assessment, is now less commonly performed and primarily reserved for patients with more complex presentations such as those with suspected recurrent acute DVT.

### Current challenges in diagnostic imaging of venous thromboembolism [^113e7wpo]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Because the clinical diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is nonspecific, integrated diagnostic approaches for patients with suspected venous thromboembolism have been developed over the years, involving both non-invasive bedside tools (clinical decision rules and D-dimer blood tests) for patients with low pretest probability and diagnostic techniques (compression ultrasound for deep-vein thrombosis and computed tomography pulmonary angiography for pulmonary embolism) for those with a high pretest probability. This combination has led to standardized diagnostic algorithms with proven safety for excluding venous thrombotic disease. At the same time, it has become apparent that, as a result of the natural history of venous thrombosis, there are special patient populations in which the current standard diagnostic algorithms are not sufficient. In this review, we present 3 evidence-based patient cases to underline recent developments in the imaging diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1135PqXD]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of suspected recurrent lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — limitations of venography and compression ultrasonography (CUS) are highlighted. As many as one-third of patients with suspected recurrence have a venogram that is considered inadequate because of nonfilling of venous segments. The evaluation of suspected ipsilateral recurrence using CUS is problematic because persistent abnormalities of the deep veins are common following a first episode of thrombosis. Prospective follow-up studies have reported residual US abnormalities (noncompressibility), in approximately 60% of patients at 3 months and 50% of patients 1 year after the diagnosis of proximal DVT. Thus, the presence of a noncompressible venous segment on CUS is not diagnostic of recurrent thrombosis, and recurrence can only be confirmed if there is evidence of new thrombus formation.

### Update from the clinic: what's new in the diagnosis of cancer-associated thrombosis? [^116vVCv3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Malignancy is associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and treatment with anticoagulant therapy is associated with a high risk of bleeding. Thus, accurate and timely VTE diagnosis in cancer patients is essential for identifying individuals who would benefit from anticoagulant therapy and for avoiding unnecessary treatment that can cause anticoagulant-related bleeding. The approach to the diagnosis of VTE in non-cancer patients involves a stepwise process beginning with an assessment of the pretest probability (PTP) of VTE using a validated clinical prediction rule (CPR) followed by D-dimer testing and/or diagnostic imaging. In patients with a low PTP and a negative D-dimer result, VTE can be excluded without additional imaging. However, published data suggest that CPRs and D-dimer testing may not be as accurate or as useful in patients with cancer. Studies have shown that the combination of a low PTP and negative D-dimer result is not efficient for exclusion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) in the cancer patient population because the vast majority of patients still require radiologic imaging. We propose that cancer patients with suspected VTE should proceed directly to radiologic imaging to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of DVT or PE.

Suspected first lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) without risk stratification — initial test selection and alternatives: If risk stratification is not performed in patients with suspected first lower extremity DVT, we recommend one of the following initial tests: (i) proximal CUS or (ii) whole-leg US rather than (i) no testing (Grade 1B), (ii) venography (Grade 1B), or D-dimer testing (Grade 2B). Remarks: Whole-leg US may be preferred to proximal CUS in patients unable to return for serial testing and those with severe symptoms consistent with calf DVT or risk factors for extension of distal DVT. In patients with suspected first lower extremity DVT in whom US is impractical (eg, when leg casting or excessive subcutaneous tissue or fluid prevent adequate assessment of compressibility) or nondiagnostic, we suggest that CT scan venography, MR venography, or MR direct thrombus imaging could be used as an alternative to venography.

### Diagnosis of venous thromboembolism-clinical practice guideline… [^1131xmcR]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The guideline on Diagnosis of Venous Thromboembolism was developed by the American Society of Hematology and was endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians. Pulmonary Embolism For individuals with a low or intermediate pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should use a D-dimer strategy to rule out PE followed by VQ scan or CTPA in patients requiring additional testing. D-dimer testing alone should. not be used to rule in a PE. For individuals with a high pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should start with CTPA to diagnose PE. If CTPA is not available, a VQ scan be used with appropriate follow up testing. D-dimer testing alone should not be used to diagnose PE and should not be used as a subsequent test after CT scan in individuals with a high pretest probability/prevalence.

Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis For individuals with a low pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should use a D-dimer strategy to rule out DVT followed by proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound in patients requiring additional testing. For individuals with low pretest probability or prevalence, positive D-dimer alone should. not be used to diagnose DVT and additional testing following negative proximal or whole-leg ultrasound should not be conducted. For individuals with an intermediate pretest probability or prevalence, whole-leg ultrasound or proximal lower extremity ultrasound should be used. Serial proximal ultrasound testing is needed after a negative proximal ultrasound. No serial testing is needed after a negative whole leg ultrasound.

Upper Extremity DVT For individuals with low prevalence/unlikely pretest probability, D-dimer testing should be used to exclude upper extremity DVT, followed by duplex ultrasound if positive. For individuals with high prevalence/likely pretest probability, either D-dimer testing followed by duplex ultrasound/serial duplex ultrasound, or duplex ultrasound/serial duplex ultrasound alone can be used for assessing patients suspected of having upper extremity DVT. A positive D-dimer alone should not be used to diagnose upper extremity DVT. See the full recommendation for more information.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116gJ1uz]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Evaluation strategies for suspected first lower extremity DVT — impact of pretest probability: Pretest probability assessment, D-dimer testing, and venous US have been extensively investigated and are widely used either alone or in combination, and the pretest assessment (ie, prevalence of DVT) has a significant effect on the usefulness of D-dimer and proximal US. Categorizing patients as having a low pretest probability for DVT eliminates the need for radiologic imaging in those with a negative D-dimer and eliminates serial or repeat testing in those with a normal proximal US. In a study of 529 symptomatic patients, the posttest probability of DVT in those with a positive CUS (as assessed by venography) was 100% in patients with a high pretest probability, 96% in those with a moderate pretest probability, and 63% in patients with a low pretest probability.

### What is the optimal duration of treatment for DVT? An update on evidence-based medicine of treatment for DVT [^114QCH9i]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represent a major source of morbidity and mortality today. Incidence of DVT is estimated to be 56 to 160/100,000 population per year. Systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with initiation of oral vitamin K antagonist therapy has been shown to be beneficial in preventing pulmonary embolism and reducing extension and recurrence of DVT. The duration of anticoagulation following an episode of DVT is determined by the greatest predictors of recurrence. These include the presence of reversible risk factors, nonreversible risk factors, and no risk factors (idiopathic or unprovoked DVT). Short durations of anticoagulation are only appropriate for calf DVTs in patients with reversible risk factors. Patients with nonreversible risk factors, such as malignancy and certain inherited thrombophilias with a strong family history of venous thromboembolism will require lifelong anticoagulation. Those with proximal DVT due to reversible risk factors require 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic DVT require reassessment of risk-to-benefit ratio of hemorrhage from oral vitamin K antagonist therapy compared to reducing risk of recurrence and frequently require prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring with d-dimer and serial ultrasounds may offer an individualized approach to therapy.

### Office management of deep venous thrombosis in the elderly [^111Szzis]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis is common in the elderly. Diagnosis and management are now a part of office practice. As signs and symptoms are inconsistent and nonspecific, diagnostic testing is necessary. For patients with a low clinical probability, a normal D-dimer result can rule out disease. For patients with a high clinical suspicion or an elevated D-dimer, duplex ultrasonography may confirm the diagnosis. Anticoagulation, usually with low-molecular-weight heparin, should begin on suspicion and continue, along with warfarin, until the international normalized ratio is therapeutic. Arrangements for the initial daily injections can be made with a visiting nurse. Treatment should continue for at least 3 months, when a risk-versus-benefit analysis for continuing anticoagulation should be undertaken. Therapy may be discontinued for thromboses associated with a reversible risk factor or for patients in whom anticoagulant management was unstable or complicated by bleeding. A persistently high D-dimer result or evidence of residual clot on repeat duplex ultrasonography may support continuation. For all patients, the use of compression stockings to prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome is recommended.
