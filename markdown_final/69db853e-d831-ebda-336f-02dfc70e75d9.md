## Question

Jack Conlon is employed on a salary-plus-commission basis. He receives a salary, of $200 a week, plus a commission of 3% of his sales. He had sales of $3,550 over a two week period. What were his earnings for the two weeks?

Answer Choices:
A. $610.50
B. $455.00
C. $560.50
D. $600.00
E. $700.00
F. $350.50
G. $406.50
H. $256.50
I. $300.50
J. $506.50

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate Jack Conlon's total earnings over two weeks given a weekly salary of $200 and a 3% commission on $3,550 in sales. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fixed salary component over two weeks. Then, I should calculate the commission on total sales. Next, I will add salary and commission to get total earnings. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and match the result to the provided answer choices.

> Let me first confirm the salary component. At $200 per week, over two weeks that is $200 times 2, which equals $400 in fixed salary, and I should keep that separate from the variable commission piece for now.

> Now, I need to calculate the commission. A 3% commission on $3,550 in sales is 0.03 multiplied by 3,550, which equals $106.50, and I should verify that multiplication to avoid a careless error.

> Next, I should add the salary and commission together to get total earnings. $400 plus $106.50 equals $506.50, and wait, let me verify that sum one more time to ensure accuracy before concluding.

> Hold on, I should verify the final figure against the answer choices. $506.50 corresponds to option J, so the correct answer is J. I initially wondered if I should divide the sales by 2 for a per-week commission, but that would be incorrect because the 3% commission applies to total sales over the two-week period, not weekly sales, so my original calculation stands.

---

Jack's total earnings for the two weeks are **$506.50**. This is the sum of his fixed salary ($200/week × 2 weeks = $400) and his commission (3% of $3,550 = $106.50). The correct answer is **J. $506.50**.

---

## Calculation breakdown

| **Component** | **Calculation** | **Amount** |
|-|-|-|
| Fixed salary | $200/week × 2 weeks | $400.00 |
| Commission | 3% × $3,550 | $106.50 |
| Total earnings | $400.00 + $106.50 | $506.50 |

---

Therefore, Jack's total earnings for the two weeks are **$506.50**.

### Anterior cruciate ligament injuries in Australian football: should women and girls be playing? You' re asking the wrong question [^302b6cc6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

A biological problem, or something else?

A higher rate of ACL injuries in women over men has been observed in other sports, with the supposition that differences due to biological sex leads to hazardous neuromechanical strategies being employed during sporting tasks. However, this notion has been questioned in systematic reviews of the evidenceand takes a myopic view that biological differences would solely explain such disparity, with no consideration of environmental and sociocultural differences due to gendered experiences.

The relative infancy of participation by women and girls in AF results in many AFLW players having limited to no AF experience during their youth. In 2019, AFLW teams were also required to have at least two 'cross-code rookies' (ie, not played organised AF for the past 3 years), a stark contrast to the typically lifelong developmental experience of men in the AFL. The combination of reduced sport-specific motor skill development acquired through deliberate practice, along with very short preseason training periods for the AFLW, could create a 'perfect storm' of athletes with higher risk of ACL injury in a 'new' sport encompassing high-risk tasks.

AFLW players earned between $A13 400 and $A24 600 in the 2018 season. The AFLW involves a condensed schedule (eg, in 2019, the AFLW season included seven rounds plus 2 weeks of finals compared with the 23 rounds plus 4 weeks of finals in the men's competition), and subsequently AFLW salaries meet the minimum pay standards of the men's competition on a pro rata basis. However, a significant pay gap still exists between the two competitions. Even the highest payment tier of an AFLW salary does not meet the minimum wage requirement in Australia (ie, $A719.20 per week, equating to $A37 398.40 per annum), whereas the minimum base payment ($A75 000) and average wage ($A362 471) for the AFLsubstantially exceeds minimum wage. AFLW players are likely managing training commitments with other employment, leading to reduced access to facilities, training opportunities and medical/athletic development staff. Additional financial support and access to environments that bridge the gap between men's and women's AF can maximise opportunities to prepare players to meet the sport demands.

2. Earnings supplements

Participants in four studies received top‐ups to earned income when they worked for a specified number of hours per week or over a given period (New Hope 1999; SSP Applicants 2003; SSP Recipients 2002 (minimum 30 hours work per week, tapering above a certain level of earnings); UK ERA 2011 (up to six payments of GBP 400 for each period when participants worked 30 or more hours per week for 13 out of 17 weeks)). Supplements were limited to a period of three years. While supplements were being paid, respondents' total income could increase even if their earned income was low.

3. Earnings disregards

Five interventions disregarded a proportion of earned income when calculating welfare entitlement (CJF 2002; FTP 2000; IFIP 2002; IWRE 2002; MFIP 2000). Methods of calculating and levels of generosity varied across studies. Where earned income was disregarded, respondents could claim welfare while earning at much higher levels than previously. However, in CJF 2002, FTP 2000 and IWRE 2002, these periods while working and claiming welfare counted towards the respondent's lifetime limit on welfare receipt. While respondents received earnings disregards, total welfare receipt and numbers on welfare were higher. As with supplements, disregards could increase total income even if earned income was low.

4. Childcare subsidies

All but four interventions provided childcare subsidies (NEWWS 2001; SSP Applicants 2003; SSP Recipients 2002; UK ERA 2011). Financial contributions toward the cost of child care were made either directly to childcare providers or to parents for a period of one to two years following uptake of employment. Ontario 2001 provided a childcare programme to one arm of the intervention only.

### The price of a drink: levels of consumption and price paid per unit of alcohol by Edinburgh's ill drinkers with a comparison to wider alcohol sales in scotland [^b8e28426]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

For the entire patient sample, an independent-samples t -test showed a significant difference between the percentage of units consumed by men and women as on-sales (mean percentage for men was 14.5% and for women was 6.3%, P = 0.02, equal variance not assumed). Thus, a possible reason why patients from quintile 3 consume proportionately more as on-sales was due to the slightly higher proportion of men in quintile 3 (in this sample), 75.4% compared to the total sample mean of 67.9%. However, a χ² test of gender by quintile found this not to be statistically significant. An ANOVA test was performed to check whether age may be a factor in the quintile difference for on-sales consumption, but the results did not reveal a significant difference in mean age between the quintiles.

The heaviest consumers

A total of 137 individuals consumed 200 units or more per week, drinking a mean of 299 units/week. The majority (60.5%) were in quintiles 1 and 2, although 19% belonged to quintile 5.

These heaviest consumers paid a mean of £0.30 per unit (range 0.13–0.58) in contrast to those who drank less than 200 units/week who paid a mean of £0.37 (range 9–103) and purchased 97% of their alcohol from off-sales in contrast to 89%. A one-way analysis of variance performed on the group consuming 200 units or more per week did not show a statistically significant difference in the mean unit price between the quintiles (P = 0.55).

### Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis and planning for the future [^7ea31762]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 AND THE U.S. ECONOMY

In early to mid-March, many U.S. state and local governments started implementing temporary restrictions on public life and nonessential work in an attempt to decrease the spread of the virus, leading to a temporary economic shutdown. Accordingly, U.S. economic output declined sharply and drastically for quarter 1 of 2020, with real gross domestic product decreasing at an annual rate of 5.0%. Simultaneously, the number of people filing for unemployment increased rapidly, reaching 43 million by the end of the second week in May. The unemployment rate increased from 3.5% in February to 14.7% in April, which, when considering all workers placed on temporary layoff, could have been as high as 22%. Simultaneously, U.S. retail sales declined by 16.4% (∼$80 billion) in April as compared with March 2020. In early May, the U.S. government started to place increasing emphasis on the necessary economic recovery from the COVID-19–related temporary shutdown. Given uncertainties about the further spread of COVID-19, it is not surprising that predictions about the shape and speed of economic recovery in the United States vary among experts and are adjusted continuously. For instance, predictions about the decline of real gross domestic product at an annual rate for quarter 2 of 2020 are in the range of 25%–40%, with an estimated growth of −5.6% for all of 2020 as compared with 2019. Of note, in the United States, consumer demand for goods and services has been a key element of economic growth over the past 50 years. Accordingly, as long as consumer confidence remains low, at least in part because of uncertainty about employment and health status, economic recovery will remain sluggish. In a recent survey among global business chief financial officers (91% from the United States), participants from all industries expressed less (!) optimism about the state of the economy and the financial prospects of their own company than during quarter 1 of 2020, and 60% did not expect a return to near-normal operating levels until sometime in 2021. In another survey among global business executives, only 48% of participants from North America expected a moderate or substantial improvement in the economy. The Congressional Budget Office projects a robust uptick in economic growth for the second half of 2020. Nevertheless, it may take until the end of 2021 or beyond for real gross domestic product to recover to pre–COVID-19 levels. Finally, global supply chains could be disrupted for an extended period.

Outcomes

We defined employment as having any nonzero earnings based on the employment income recorded in tax filings from the T1FF file, excluding income from assets and investments. Total employment income includes wages, salaries, and commissions from employment; training allowances; tips; and gratuities. It also includes any income from self-employment. Individuals who file taxes with negative income (indicating net losses from self-employment) were included in the analysis given that they have positive employment status; however, their income was set to zero to reduce downward bias in final model estimates for income. All income values are reported in 2022 Canadian dollars (CAD $1.00 = US $0.73). All income values were rounded to the nearest CAD $1000 due to data source restrictions.

We studied 2 outcomes of interest. First, we assessed the change in income for each year over the 5-year period after injury. Second, we assessed the change in the proportion of employed individuals for each year of the postinjury period.

Statistical Analysis

To evaluate the parallel-trends assumption for individual income and employment status, we ran an event study estimation model to assess the difference in exposed and comparison group outcomes at times prior to injury. We found that there were no significant differences between preinjury trends in comparison and exposed groups for earnings or employment status (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1).

The association of SCI with income was estimated with a mixed-effects multivariable regression model, adjusting for individual-level fixed effects over time. We quantified the change in mean yearly earnings as a function of exposure group status, preinjury or postinjury period, and interaction between time and injury status. The interaction term is the DID estimate. There were 2 exogenous outcomes that were of concern in the analysis. First, individuals typically experience rapid wage growth in their mid-20s to early 30s, which then stabilizes in their later years (ages 40–50 years). Second, broad economic factors create variability in annual earning; thus, it is possible that an economic cycle may be associated with wages and thereby bias the association of a traumatic SCI with income and employment. We adjusted for the current age of the individual as a continuous variable and included the fiscal year as a categorical variable in all models (eMethods 3 in Supplement 1).

### Financial markets value skillful forecasts of seasonal climate [^978d713b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Scientific agencies spend substantial sums producing and improving forecasts of seasonal climate, but they do so without much information about these forecasts' value in practice. Here we show that financial market participants value the production of seasonal forecasts: options traders price the uncertainty generated by upcoming United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Winter and El Niño Outlooks. Each outlook affects firms throughout the economy, with total market capitalization of $6 and $13 trillion, respectively. A 1% improvement in the skill of the El Niño Outlook reduces firms' exposure to a one standard deviation shock by $18 billion and induces traders to spend an additional $2 million hedging the outlook's news. Firms must not be able to undertake ex-ante adaptation that would eliminate their exposure to the forecasted portion of seasonal climate without imposing substantial costs of its own.

### Comparison of sales income and research and development costs for FDA-approved cancer drugs sold by originator drug companies [^320919b5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

High costs and risks of research and development (R&D) have been used to justify the high prices of cancer drugs. However, what the return on R&D investment is, and by extension what a justifiable price might be, is unclear.

Objective

To compare incomes from the sales of cancer drugs with the estimated R&D costs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational study used global pharmaceutical industry sales data to quantify the cumulative incomes generated from the sales of cancer drugs for companies that have held patents or marketing rights (originator companies). All cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration from 1989 to 2017 were identified from the United States Food and Drug Administration's website and literature. Itemized product sales data were extracted from the originator companies' consolidated financial reports. For drugs with data missing in specific years, additional data was sought from other public sources, or where necessary, estimated values from known reported values. Drugs were excluded if there were missing data for half or more of the years since approval. Data analysis was conducted from May 2018 to October 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sales data were expressed in 2017 US dollars with adjustments for inflation. Cumulative incomes from the sales of these drugs were compared against the R&D costs estimated in the literature, which had been adjusted for the costs of capital and trial failure (risk adjusted).

Results

Of the 156 US Food and Drug Administration-approved cancer drugs identified, 99 drugs (63.5%) had data for more than half of the years since approval and were included in the analysis. There was a median of 10 years (range, 1–28 years) of sales data with 1040 data points, 79 (7.6%) of which were estimated. Compared with the total risk-adjusted R&D cost of $794 million (range, $2827-$219 million) per medicine estimated in the literature, by the end of 2017, the median cumulative sales income was $14.50 (range, $3.30-$55.10) per dollar invested for R&D. Median time to fully recover the maximum possible risk-adjusted cost of R&D ($2827 million) was 5 years (range, 2–10 years; n = 56). Cancer drugs continued to generate billion-dollar returns for the originator companies after the end-of-market exclusivity, particularly for biologics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cancer drugs, through high prices, have generated returns for the originator companies far in excess of possible R&D costs. Lowering prices of cancer drugs and facilitating greater competition are essential for improving patient access, health system's financial sustainability, and future innovation.

Nonmedical Costs

Productivity Losses Attributable to Illness and Death

We used the human-capital method to estimate productivity losses attributable to illness and death. The productivity losses are measured as income forgone because of illness or premature death. These losses are also referred to as mortality cost. Information about workdays missed by patients or caregivers was obtained through the patient questionnaire. Of 139 respondents, 65 were employed before becoming infected with WNV. Respondents provided information about their earnings; income data were missing for 12 of 65 patients and for 15 of 36 caregivers who missed work to care for a patient. For these cases we used Bureau of Labor Statistics 2001 Louisiana state occupational employment and wage estimates, converted to 2002 dollars using the ratio of 2002 hourly wages to 2001 hourly wages. Ten of these 65 patients reported stopping work entirely because of WNV illness. Because the dates when each stopped working were not available and when each could resume work was unknown, we estimated their productivity losses from the second week of August (about half of Louisiana cases occurred before this date) until the last patient interview on February 27, 2003. Respondents provided information on their earnings before they stopped working. We estimated their productivity losses with the methods described.

The Louisiana Office of Public Health provided demographic information about patients who died. For persons < 75 years of age, mortality costs were estimated as the present value of labor market earnings and household production based on productivity loss tables. Because the tables presented the current values of productivity losses at 5-year intervals, we interpolated the present values for consecutive ages within that 5-year interval and chose the values corresponding to deceased patients.

For persons 76–85 years of age, we used productivity loss tables on the annual weighted average earnings (1990 dollars adjusted to 2002 dollars) by age group for labor-force and nonlabor-force persons. We estimated the expected lifespan for each age group using life tables for the total U.S. population (Appendix 4). Then we added the annual earnings by age throughout the expected lifespan of the person, while making adjustments for a 3% discount rate (defined in Appendix 2) to calculate the present value of the person's earnings during future years of his or her lifespan (3% discount rate is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine) and a 1% annual productivity increase (1% is the usual assumption for long-term growth in labor productivity).

### Bupropion slow release vs placebo with adaptive incentives for cocaine use disorder in persons receiving methadone for opioid use disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^6be57604]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Study Design

Eligible participants were enrolled in a 30-week randomized clinical trial with thrice-weekly visits. Participants completed a 6-week incentive lead-in period in which monetary incentives were available for evidence of urinalysis-verified cocaine abstinence beginning day 1. Participants who achieved 6 consecutive negative samples (ie, 2 weeks of abstinence) during this period were categorized to a relapse prevention (RP; 20 participants) incentive group. Participants who did not achieve 6 consecutive negative samples during weeks 1 through 6 were categorized to an abstinence initiation (AI; 60 participants) incentive condition. After assignment, participants were stratified separately within each incentive condition via a minimization procedure (Beck Depression Inventory summed total scores from screening; ≥ 14 vs < 14; range, 0–63 and sex) to receive bupropion SR or placebo by the research pharmacist, who had no participant interaction. Participants continued to attend thrice-weekly visits for the duration of the 30-week protocol; urinalysis samples and self-reported cocaine use were collected at every visit. To facilitate data collection, participants received randomly allocated incentives (prize range, $0-$50) for session attendance independent of urinalysis outcomes.

Incentive Conditions

Incentives were available during weeks 1 to 26 (eTable 2 in Supplement 2) for urinalysis-based evidence of cocaine abstinence. During weeks 1 to 6, incentives began at $0.50 per cocaine-negative sample and increased by $0.50 for each subsequent negative sample to a possible total of $9 per negative sample and a maximum week 1 through 6 earning of $85.50. After week 6, participants categorized into RP had payments increased to $11 for 12 weeks before they were tapered to $0 by week 26. After week 6, participants categorized into AI could earn $3, and values increased by $0.50 to $11 through week 26. Participants could earn bonuses ($3, $7, and $10) for 3 consecutive negative samples through week 26. Positive samples resulted in no earnings for that sample, reset the earning schedule to $0.50, and required 2 consecutive negative samples to return to the same place on the earning schedule. Total potential earnings were $675.00 for the RP and $725.50 for the AI groups. Participants were not told that incentive structures would change based on their initial treatment response.

### Finance 101 for physicians [^28982501]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Although physicians enjoy extensive educational backgrounds, financial planning typically is not a significant component of the curricula they have completed. As a result, many physicians could benefit from greater financial acumen, and their preparation for retirement might be lacking in light of their relatively high-income levels. This article by a private wealth advisor with 29 years of industry experience provides physicians with the basic building blocks to understand and manage their finances. It focuses on 3 pillars of financial planning: (1) protecting themselves, their families, and their assets; (2) reducing their taxes; and (3) growing their wealth.

Transmission risk assessment by HIV RNA levels and antenatal timing — Table 12 categorizes risk using three antenatal periods. At HIV RNA at ≤ 4 Weeks Prior to Delivery, ≥ 50 copies/mL corresponds to In Utero High and Intrapartum High. When HIV RNA is ≥ 50 copies/mL at ≥ 20 Weeks' Gestation to 4 Weeks Prior to Delivery but < 50 copies/mL at ≤ 4 weeks prior, risk is In Utero Low to moderate and Intrapartum Low. When HIV RNA at < 20 Weeks' Gestation is ≥ 50 copies/mL with later values < 50 copies/mL, risk is In Utero Low and Intrapartum Low. When HIV RNA is < 50 copies/mL across all three time periods, risk is In Utero Low and Intrapartum Low. HIV RNA levels in this time period do not change the transmission risk categorization because transmission risk is determined by viremia later in gestation.

The posterior sample size is 20,000. Further details are provided in the Supplementary Method. The bars denote the 95% CIs, and the dots denote the mean. The means and the 95% CIs were plotted assuming the participant had accumulated total step counts in intervals of 500 steps at the start of the hour from 0 to 12,500 steps (x -axis). The daily step goals (diagonal lines) were 5000, 7500, and 10,000 steps.

For the first half of the day (12 a.m. to 12 p.m.), the logistic and gamma regression covariates were dummy variables for age group, BMI group and sex, as these covariates were associated with physical activity.

Accounting for the financial incentive structure of NSC3, the daily step goals were 5000, 7500, and 10,000 steps, which earned participants 10, 25, and 40 HealthPoints, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). For the second half of the day (12 p.m. to 12 a.m.), we defined four disjoint intervals: (i) 0–4999 steps, (ii) 5000–7499 steps, (iii) 7500–9999 steps, and (iv)10,000 steps. The model was stratified into the above four disjoint intervals based on the sum of the step counts up to the previous hour. The logistic and gamma regression covariates were age, BMI, sex, and the sum of step counts up to the previous hour divided by 10,000. This scaling ensured that the variable was equal to one when participants had just completed all their daily step goals. A value that exceeded one meant that the participant exceeded the daily 10,000-step goal. Furthermore, the scaling ensured that the prior was uninformative.

### Health and economic cost estimates of short-term total and wildfire PM2.5 exposure on work loss: using the consecutive California health interview survey (CHIS) data 2015–2018 [^d2447075]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Health and economic impacts of work loss associated with daily total PM 2.5

We first calculated the weekly incidence rate of the work-loss days per person per year by dividing the number of respondents who reported work-loss events by the total number of respondents who were in the workforce using CHIS data. We then applied the mean annual number of workdays lost due to injury or illness (3.26 days) in California from pooled 2001–2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)to the weekly incidence rate and then multiplied the number by 52 weeks to derive the annual rate of work-loss days per person in California (annual rate of work-loss days per person = weekly incidence rate (0.017 cases per week)×3.26 days per case×52 weeks per year). The average daily salary ($249.04 per day in 2015–2018 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics) was used to calculate the related economic cost.

### Effect of different financial incentive structures on promoting physical activity among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^debd526c]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Few adults engage in recommended levels of physical activity. Financial incentives can promote physical activity, but little is known about how the structure of these incentives influences their effectiveness (eg, how incentives are disbursed over time).

Objective

To determine if it is more effective to disburse fixed total financial incentives at a constant, increasing, or decreasing rate to encourage physical activity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A 2-week randomized clinical trial was conducted from June 2 to 15, 2014, using an online platform that automatically records daily steps of pedometer-wearing users and awards points redeemable for cash. The study population comprised 3515 adult users of the online platform in the lower 70th percentile of steps taken among all users before treatment. Data analyses were performed from August 20, 2014, to February 1, 2018. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to either a control group or to 1 of 3 intervention groups during the 2 weeks of the study. Participants in the control group received a constant daily rate of $0.00001 per step. The 3 intervention groups received a 20-fold incentive increase ($0.00020 per step) distributed differently during the 2 weeks of the study: at a constant, increasing, or decreasing rate. Reminder emails explaining incentive schedules were sent the day before the intervention and halfway through the 2-week intervention.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in mean daily steps during the 2-week intervention and 3 weeks after the intervention. The study had 80% power to detect a difference of 280 steps per day during the intervention at α = .05.

Results

The study included 3515 participants (879 in the control condition, 879 in the constant incentive condition, 881 in the increasing incentive condition, and 876 in the decreasing incentive condition). During the intervention, compared with participants in the control group, participants receiving constant incentives logged 306.7 more steps per day (95% CI, 91.5–521.9 steps; P = 0.005), those receiving decreasing incentives logged 96.9 more steps per day (95% CI, 15.3–178.5 steps; P = 0.02), and those receiving increasing incentives logged no significant change in steps per day (1.5 steps per day; 95% CI, -81.6 to 84.7 steps; P = 0.97). One week after the intervention, compared with participants in the control group, only participants receiving constant incentives logged significantly more steps per day (329.5; 95% CI, 20.6–638.4; P = 0.04). Two and 3 weeks after the intervention, there were no significant differences compared with participants in the control group. Overall, for each $1 spent, participants in the constant incentives group logged 475.4 more steps than those in the increasing incentives group and 429.3 more steps than those in the decreasing incentives group.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that financial incentives for physical activity were more effective during a payment period when they were offered at a constant rate rather than an increasing or decreasing rate. However, this effectiveness dissipated shortly after the incentives were removed.

### Risk of major labour-related complications for pregnancies progressing to 42 weeks or beyond [^5539f868]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study compared labour-related outcomes among women who gave birth at 42 completed weeks and beyond (42 +0–43 +6) with those who gave birth at 39 completed weeks (39 +0–39 +6). The aim of this study was to determine labour-related risks of progressing to 42 weeks of pregnancy or beyond, compared with those giving birth at 39 completed weeks of pregnancy. Thirty-nine weeks completed gestation was chosen as a reference due to the evidence of favourable perinatal outcomes at this gestation and the findings of the ARRIVE trial which identified this as a viable birth choice that does not increase obstetric risk and avoids the risk of progressing to a significantly advanced gestation undelivered.
