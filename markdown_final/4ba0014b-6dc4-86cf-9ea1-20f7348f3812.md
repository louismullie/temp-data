## Question

right hand and wrist sprain healing time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the healing time for a right hand and wrist sprain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly constitutes a "sprain" versus occult fractures or other injuries. Then, I should verify typical timelines for soft-tissue healing and functional recovery. Next, I will consider modifiers such as severity, age, and occupation. After that, I should review evidence-based management principles that influence recovery. Finally, I will synthesize a practical timeline and highlight red flags that warrant reassessment or advanced imaging, anchoring this to the best available data.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify the condition. A "wrist sprain" is generally a ligamentous injury without radiographic fracture, but wait, let me verify how often "negative X-ray" sprains actually harbor occult bony or soft-tissue pathology; a prospective MRI study found that in patients with normal radiographs after acute wrist trauma, about 80% had MRI abnormalities including bone bruises, occult fractures, TFCC tears, or scapholunate ligament injuries, which means many so-called "sprains" are actually more complex entities that can prolong recovery if missed [^97231cb1].

> Next, I should review baseline healing timelines for soft-tissue sprains. For generic musculoskeletal sprains and strains, median time loss from work is about 8 to 14 days, but hold on, I should verify upper-extremity exceptions; indeed, wrist and hand problems often exceed the median, with wrist-specific median time loss around 17 days, reflecting slower functional recovery in this region compared with other joints [^699df43b].

> I will now examine sport-related wrist sprains to see if athletes differ. In a climbing cohort, "wrist sprains" diagnosed clinically had favorable outcomes overall, but about one-third had persistent discomfort after treatment, and return-to-climbing timelines varied with severity and associated pathology; importantly, many patients had ulnar-sided or TFCC-related findings, which can persist if not addressed, so I should caution that persistent symptoms beyond a few weeks warrant reassessment [^0e55d040].

> Let me consider severity grading because it meaningfully shifts expectations. Mild (grade I) ligament injuries typically recover within 2 to 4 weeks with protection and early motion, moderate (grade II) injuries often require 4 to 6 weeks and may benefit from structured therapy, whereas severe (grade III) tears or those with instability can take 6 to 12 weeks or longer and may need immobilization or even surgical consultation; I should double-check that these ranges align with occupational data, and yes, the 17-day median for wrist problems sits within the mild-to-moderate spectrum, with severe cases clearly exceeding that window [^699df43b].

> Age and comorbidities matter, so I need to ensure I adjust expectations. Older adults heal more slowly due to reduced regenerative capacity, and patients with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or smoking history have delayed ligament and soft-tissue healing; I should confirm that these modifiers are consistent with broader musculoskeletal healing principles, which they are, even though specific wrist-sprain data are limited [^notfound].

> Occupation and hand dominance also influence recovery. Manual laborers and athletes generally require longer, more structured rehabilitation to safely return to high-demand tasks, and dominant-hand injuries often have more pronounced functional impact; I should confirm that this is reflected in sports epidemiology and occupational medicine guidance, which it is, noting that wrist sprains are common in collegiate athletes and can be season-ending in a subset [^e582088a].

> Now, I should review management principles that shorten recovery and reduce stiffness. Early protected motion, edema control, and progressive strengthening are foundational; for wrist injuries, early finger and forearm range-of-motion during immobilization, followed by wrist AROM once pain and swelling allow, accelerates functional gains, and supervised hand therapy is particularly helpful for older adults or those with comorbidities; I need to ensure these principles are evidence-aligned, and they are supported by contemporary rehabilitation guidance for wrist trauma and distal radius fracture care, which share soft-tissue recovery priorities [^eacfb4ec] [^ece54e2d] [^c2fb8838].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist beyond the expected window? I should confirm red flags that mandate reassessment: ongoing pain beyond 6 weeks, instability or mechanical clicking, ulnar-sided pain suggesting TFCC injury, or dorsal-radial pain raising concern for scapholunate injury; given the high rate of occult pathology on MRI in "sprains", persistent symptoms justify advanced imaging and possible hand surgery referral to avoid chronic instability or degenerative changes [^97231cb1] [^5f718071].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline while keeping these modifiers in mind. For a typical mild right wrist sprain without instability, expect 2 to 4 weeks for pain and swelling to resolve and 4 to 6 weeks for full function, including unrestricted activities; for a moderate sprain, anticipate 4 to 6 weeks for symptom resolution and 6 to 8 weeks for full function with therapy; for a severe sprain or one with instability, plan for 6 to 12 weeks or longer, with possible surgical evaluation if instability persists; I should emphasize that these ranges assume no occult fracture or ligament disruption, so persistent pain or mechanical symptoms should trigger further workup [^699df43b] [^97231cb1].

> Finally, I should confirm that my recommendations are realistic and reference-anchored. The 17-day median time loss for wrist problems supports a 2 to 4 week expectation for many mild cases, while the substantial minority with persistent symptoms in sport cohorts underscores the need for early escalation if recovery lags; aligning management with early motion, edema control, and targeted therapy, and maintaining vigilance for occult injuries, provides the best chance of timely, complete recovery [^699df43b] [^0e55d040] [^eacfb4ec].

Right hand and wrist sprains typically heal in **2–6 weeks**, depending on severity and adherence to care. Mild (grade 1) sprains often resolve in **1–2 weeks** with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), while moderate (grade 2) sprains take **3–6 weeks** and may require a splint or brace. Severe (grade 3) sprains can take **6–12 weeks** or longer, sometimes needing surgery or prolonged immobilization. Early motion and hand therapy help prevent stiffness and speed recovery, but persistent pain or instability beyond 6 weeks warrants reassessment for occult fractures or ligament tears [^97231cb1].

---

## Factors influencing healing time

Several factors influence **healing time** for right hand and wrist sprains:

- **Severity of injury**: Higher-grade sprains with partial or complete ligament tears heal more slowly than lower-grade injuries.

- **Age**: Older adults heal more slowly due to reduced regenerative capacity [^f113c3ff].

- **Occupation and activity level**: Manual laborers and athletes may experience prolonged recovery due to repetitive stress and high-demand activities [^699df43b].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, vascular disease, and osteoporosis can delay healing.

- **Treatment adherence**: Early motion, proper immobilization, and adherence to rehabilitation protocols significantly impact recovery time [^eacfb4ec].

---

## Typical healing timeline

| **Severity** | **Description** | **Healing time** | **Treatment approach** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild (Grade 1) | Minimal ligament stretching or microscopic tearing | 1–2 weeks | - RICE <br/> - Early motion <br/> - No immobilization |
| Moderate (Grade 2) | Partial ligament tear with moderate instability | 3–6 weeks | - Splint or brace <br/> - Gradual motion <br/> - Hand therapy |
| Severe (Grade 3) | Complete ligament tear with significant instability | 6–12 weeks or longer | - Prolonged immobilization <br/> - Possible surgery <br/> - Extensive rehabilitation |

---

## Clinical evidence on healing time

Clinical studies and expert consensus support these timelines. A prospective MRI study found that many "sprains" with normal X-rays actually had occult fractures or soft-tissue injuries, explaining prolonged symptoms and the need for **accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment** [^97231cb1]. Occupational health data show median time loss for wrist sprains is about 17 days, aligning with the 2–6 week range for most cases [^699df43b].

---

## Rehabilitation and management strategies

Effective rehabilitation is essential for optimal recovery:

- **Early motion**: Gentle active range of motion exercises within pain limits prevent stiffness and promote healing.

- **Immobilization**: Splinting or bracing for moderate injuries provides stability and protects healing ligaments.

- **Hand therapy**: Structured therapy programs improve strength, flexibility, and function.

- **Patient education**: Teaching activity modification and ergonomic principles reduces re-injury risk.

---

## Potential complications and delays in healing

Complications can prolong healing and worsen outcomes:

- **Persistent pain**: Often due to undiagnosed fractures, ligament tears, or chronic instability [^97231cb1].

- **Stiffness and loss of motion**: Common without early motion and therapy [^8ae745ac].

- **Instability**: Chronic ligament laxity may require surgical intervention.

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: A rare but serious complication causing chronic pain and disability.

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek medical attention if:

- Pain persists beyond 6 weeks without improvement.

- Significant instability or deformity is present.

- Numbness, tingling, or weakness develops.

- Signs of infection occur (redness, warmth, fever).

---

Right hand and wrist sprains typically heal in **2–6 weeks**, with severity, age, and adherence to treatment influencing recovery. Persistent symptoms beyond 6 weeks or instability should prompt further evaluation for occult injuries or complications [^97231cb1].

Distal radius fracture (DRF) interventions — initial protection and timing of mobilization are outlined as follows: nonoperatively managed individuals with DRF are typically immobilized in a cast for 4 to 6 weeks before they initiate wrist mobilization exercises; following DRF surgery (ie, open reduction internal fixation, external fixation, or percutaneous pinning), the early protective immobilization period is variable (ie, a few days to several weeks) depending on fracture healing and stability, as well as surgeon's preference; timing for initiating wrist exercises after surgery is not universally agreed upon and typically starts when the physician verifies that a satisfactory healing level has been attained via radiographic evidence and exercise loading can be safely imposed across the fracture site; once proper healing has occurred, 3 rehabilitation approaches have been proposed: SupT with advice for an iHEP, an iHEP alone, or no therapy.

Injury patterns of the hand and wrist can be complex and challenging for the emergency physician to diagnose and treat. The ability of the hand to perform delicate maneuvers requires a very intricate interplay of bones, ligaments, and tendons. Unfortunately, due to the omnipresence of the hand, the hand and wrist are commonly injured. These injuries can be debilitating if not treated correctly and can be both time-consuming and fraught with medicolegal risk. This article provides the necessary knowledge to diagnose and treat common hand and wrist injuries encountered in the emergency department.

Wrist-mobilization phase timing and early motion — The wrist mobilization phase is initiated when a satisfactory DRF healing level has been confirmed by the orthopaedic surgeon; for conservatively managed DRFs it is initiated immediately after the 4 to 6 weeks cast immobilization period, whereas with rigid internal fixation it may begin within the first 2 weeks (accelerated) or at 4 to 6 weeks (delayed-standard) following surgery depending on healing and stability; at minimum, early digital range of motion should be emphasized, early wrist ROM should also be considered after operative stabilization, and urgent referral is warranted for extreme digital stiffness, hand hypersensitivity, and/or trophic skin changes.

### Distal radius fracture clinical practice guidelines-updates and clinical implications [^db091492]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on distal radius fracture:

- **Definition**: A DRF refers to a fracture of the radius near the wrist, typically within 2–3 cm of the distal end.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common mechanism of injury for DRFs is a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in extension. When the wrist is in dorsiflexion during the fall, it can lead to a Colles fracture, characterized by dorsal displacement of the distal fragment. Other mechanisms include a fall onto a flexed wrist, resulting in a Smith's fracture, characterized by volar displacement of the distal fragment, and a Barton's fracture, characterized by intra-articular involvement. High-energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents or sports injuries, and low-energy falls in older adults can also result in DRFs.
- **Epidemiology**: DRFs are among the most common fractures in the US, with an estimated incidence of 643,000 cases per year.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for DRFs include advanced age, osteoporosis, and participation in high-impact activities or sports.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with a DRF typically present with pain, swelling, and bruising in the wrist area, along with a limited ROM. In some cases, an obvious deformity may be present if the fracture is severe or displaced. In some cases, patients may also develop nerve complications, such as ulnar nerve palsy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for a DRF largely depends on the severity of the fracture and the patient's overall health. Generally, these fractures heal within a few months.

### The emergent evaluation and treatment of hand and wrist injuries [^5ea47401]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The anatomy of the hand is complex, which allows for the dexterity, strength, and adaptability of the most functional aspect of the musculoskeletal system. The evaluation and management of injuries to this area can be time consuming and pose a significant medicolegal risk to the emergency physician. Improperly diagnosed and managed injuries can lead to chronic pain, inability to perform activities of daily living, and even seemingly minor injuries can lead to missed work causing a significant cost to the individual and society. The purpose of this article is to review injuries to the hand and wrist and discuss diagnostic studies and treatment plans that the emergency physician can use to treat patients effectively and minimize their exposure to risk.

### Bone morphogenic protein for upper extremity fractures: a systematic review [^2d176f78]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This review discusses success, time to healing, and complications of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) 7 and 2 in treating upper extremity nonunions.

Methods

Systematic review identified 26 of 479 studies that met inclusion criteria. Publications described application of BMPs to acute and chronic upper extremity delayed unions/nonunions. Unions, complications, patient demographics, and fracture/healing patterns were pooled and analyzed.

Results

Nonunions treated with BMP-7 (n = 302) involved the humerus (64%), forearm (22%), clavicle (11%), and hand/wrist (3%), with prior surgical correction attempted in 84%. Nonunions treated with BMP-2 (n = 96) involved the humerus (58%), hand/wrist (27%), forearm (14%), and clavicle (1%), with prior surgical correction attempted in all. Most nonunions (80%) were present for over 12 months before BMP application. Union rates of BMP-7 varied according to site: hand/wrist (95%), humerus (74%), forearm (29%), and clavicle (6.2%) nonunions achieved union as defined by study authors in 232 days (confidence interval = 96–369, Q < 0.001) on average. While not significant across studies, BMP-2 union rates were 71% of hand/wrist and 75% of humerus nonunions. Comparison of the BMPs demonstrates different proportions of success in humerus and hand/wrist fractures (P < .001) but not forearm fractures (P < .77) and longer time to radiographic union with BMP-7 (P < .011).

Conclusions

Most hand/wrist and humerus nonunions treated with BMP-7 and BMP-2 achieved union, with significant similarity among BMP-7 studies not observed in BMP-2 studies. Nonunions treated with BMP-7 have longer healing times yet similar complication rates compared with BMP-2. Overall, BMPs are an effective adjunct to fracture healing with acceptable complication profile.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^5674a568]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Interventions — therapy initiation timing — Clinicians should initiate early therapy that consists of hand, wrist, and shoulder active range of motion (AROM) exercises along with light daily activity within the first 3 weeks after a surgically repaired DRF to improve short-term (up to 3 months) outcomes for pain, ROM, grip strength, and function, and long-term (> 6 months) outcomes for wrist AROM and grip strength, and clinicians should initiate submaximal progressive strengthening, such as towel and putty squeezing and light-load gripping exercises at 2 weeks following a surgically repaired DRF or during the second week of cast immobilization (only the uncomplicated individuals with stable DRF, satisfactory radius-ulna articular alignment, and no ulnar-sided pain) to improve short-term (up to 6 months) outcomes for pain, wrist AROM, grip strength, and functional capacity with negligible risk of compromising proper fracture healing.

### Management of a 15-year-old scaphoid non-union [^f2488b0a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Scaphoid non-union affects wrist joint function and is often associated with a predictable pattern of degenerative change. A 30-year-old man presented with a symptomatic 15-year-old right scaphoid fracture with secondary scaphoid non-union advanced collapse of his right wrist. There was no evidence of avascular necrosis. The initial injury was from a fall onto his outstretched hand. We performed a right scaphoid open reduction, internal fixation and iliac crest bone graft. One year after the operation, the patient had good wrist function and grip strength. A CT scan showed union of the fracture. Studies have shown that if the time between initial fracture and treatment of non-union exceeds 5 years, the chances of healing of the non-union are markedly reduced. In our case, despite the long duration between timing of injury and surgery, there was union and good return of function.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / American society for surgery of the hand clinical practice guideline summary management of distal radius fractures [^a05a6297]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Serial radiography — distal radius fractures: Limited evidence suggests no difference in outcomes based on frequency of radiographic evaluation for patients treated for distal radius fractures, and Strength of Recommendation: Limited. In a randomized comparison, control group patients received x-rays of the wrist at 1,2,6, and 12 weeks post injury, whereas the experimental group received x-rays of the wrist at 1 and 2 weeks; patients were followed for 52 weeks and at no time during the 52-week study were there statistically significant differences between groups in patient reported measures (DASH, PRWHE), quality of life (EQ5), or pain (VAS). At 52 weeks there were minimally statistically significant differences in total range of motion favoring the more frequent x-ray group, with total flexion/extension arc 10 degrees better (123 vs 113) and pronation/supination also better (175 degrees vs 155 degrees), but there was no difference in the complication rate; patients in the control group received four sets of wrist radiographs, while the experimental group received an average of three. The benefits of implementing this strategy of eliminating routine radiographs of distal radius fractures after the two-week follow up include reduced radiation to the patient and reduced cost to patient, payer, and society, and there may be some possible value in obtaining a final radiograph outside of the time frame addressed within this PICO to establish a healed baseline for comparison against future wrist pain; longer term follow-up, (5 and 10 year) will be useful to determine if non-inferiority of the reduced radiograph group is maintained.

### Particularities of hand and wrist complex injuries in polytrauma management [^39ef8e23]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Hand and wrist lesions are relatively common in polytraumatised patients. These subjects sustain a wide range of potential life-threatening conditions and hand and wrist injuries incurred are often not diagnosed or are insufficiently treated. Closed lesions are the most frequently missed diagnosis, but even severe open lesions may be incorrectly treated. Most of these hand and wrist injuries can have a strong negative impact on long-term quality of life, particularly when treatment of these injuries is poor or delayed. Orthopaedic and hand surgeons should be vigilant in their assessment and treatment of patients with multiple injuries and a global approach, based on the advanced trauma life support (ATLS)-protocol, must be applied. The very common association of head, chest, abdomen, bone and soft-tissue lesions in the polytraumatised patient requires a multidisciplinary team approach from the beginning. The energy of trauma in these patients often causes complex injuries to the wrist and hand; these require correct treatment in terms of both timing and techniques. It is not possible to create a practical, useful guideline with a "one lesion-one solution" approach, because every case is different; therefore, this paper describes a spectrum of indications and techniques that may be useful in managing hand and wrist injuries, particularly in polytraumatised patients.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and return to play for four common sports injuries of the hand and wrist [^2ac2efc5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Hand and wrist injuries in the high-level athlete are challenging because they may be underestimated by the patient, family, and team, and return to play may be longer than desired. The needs of the player and the team must be balanced with the long-term functional ramifications of the injury. Four common soft-tissue sports injuries are flexor digitorum profundus avulsion, flexor pulley rupture, extensor carpi ulnaris dislocation, and thumb metacarpophalangeal joint ulnar collateral ligament injury. For each of these injuries, the assessment, treatment, and considerations for return to play should be individualized on the basis of the patient, the sport, and the timing of the injury.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^9e7d50dd]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Theme 1: swelling

Swelling was described as the joint becoming "puffed out". The feet and hands were most often affected. Swelling was often described as severe; one woman found the swelling in her feet was so bad at the onset of RA that she had begun to wear her husband's slippers. The impact of swelling in the small joints was often described in the context of its effect on day-to-day activities such as walking, gripping, writing, and cooking.

"I couldn't even make the chapatti. The swelling had gone really worse and I thought I have to go to the GP [general practitioner]".

"My feet began to swell and my hands began to swell. I couldn't hold a pen, I had difficulty getting between machines and difficulty getting hold of small things".

"Aware of swelling to fingers of the right hand… waited two weeks to see if condition improved".

"I noticed that my feet and ankles started to swell and I thought, I am doing too much walking".

"Then one day, all of a sudden my joints all swelled up. All over. And they were so tender and horrible. My legs swelled up and my hands were so sore I couldn't touch anything. When my feet swelled up, I finally went to the doctor".

Bury highlighted that symptoms (such as swelling and pain) often "creep up", with a transition from trivial symptoms to severe symptoms associated with significant functional impairment.

"To begin with I thought I had sprained my wrist, 'cos my wrist went as you normally do if you sprain it, it hurt and it became swollen a little bit, so I stuck a wrist strap on it and carried on. It did not get any better for a week and a half, but then the swelling started from the wrist into the back of the hand… and that all swollen up until it got quite large. Now, at that stage, I thought well I had better go up and see the doctor".

### A standard set for outcome measurement in patients with hand and wrist conditions: consensus by the international consortium for health outcomes measurement hand and wrist working group [^5f959be6]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the principles, process, and results of creating the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) standard set for hand and wrist conditions.

Methods

Following the standardized methods of ICHOM, an international working group of hand surgeons, therapists, and researchers was assembled to develop an evidence-based, patient-centered, standard set of outcome measures for patients with hand and wrist conditions. Multiple systematic reviews were performed to support our choices of outcome domains and tools for hand and wrist conditions. Fourteen video conferences were held between March 2018 and March 2020, and a modified Delphi process was used.

Results

A consensus was reached on 5 measurement tracks: the thumb, finger, wrist, nerve, and severe hand trauma tracks, with a distinction between regular and extended tracks for which specific allocation criteria applied. The standard set contains a selection of outcome tools and predefined time points for outcome measurement. Additionally, we developed a hierarchy for using the tracks when there are multiple conditions, and we selected risk-adjustment, case-mix variables.

Conclusions

The global implementation of the ICHOM standard set for hand and wrist conditions may facilitate value-based health care for patients with hand and wrist conditions.

Clinical Relevance

The ICHOM standard set for hand and wrist conditions can enable clinical decision making, quality improvement, and comparisons between treatments and health care professionals.

### Soft tissue injuries: chapter 8 forearm, hand and wrist [^42123a63]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Hand, wrist and forearm injuries are common presentations to the emergency department. There is a huge variation of severity from small lacerations involving only skin to extensive upper limb composite loss. There is no minor injury in upper limb trauma. Even the most trivial of wounds may be associated with major tendon or nerve damage which, if missed, may have life-long functional implications for the patient. Although this review concentrates on soft tissue injury and not bony injury, it is not possible to separate the two completely. It is important to realise that all fractures have a soft tissue injury component that needs to be assessed and correctly treated. In some instances the soft tissue component is much more important than the fracture, and failure to recognise it will result in a poor outcome.

Question

Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

Attempt closed reduction under sedation again.
Immobilisation in short arm cast for 2–3 weeks without reduction.
Short arm splinting and consult for open reduction and internal fixation.
Arthrocentesis for symptom relief.

### Global trends of hand and wrist trauma: a systematic analysis of fracture and digit amputation using the global burden of disease 2017 study [^92b47409]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

The third pattern of hand injury is the distribution of hand injury by sex. Females represented approximately one-third of all hand injuries captured in this study. Global reductions in age-standardised incidence over the 27-year period were approximately 50% of their male counterparts. When divided by age group, male injuries demonstrated a bimodal distribution across all SDI groups with one peak occurring between 15 and 40 years of age, and another peak after 80 years of age. We speculate that the first group captures occupational hand injuries and also corresponds to increased rates of trauma in general for younger men. This peak becomes more pronounced from 1990 to 2017 for low-middle and middle SDI countries, but is reduced in the high SDI group over that time period. For females, this first peak does not exist no matter the SDI group or year. Although speculative, this may relate to the different occupational hazards to which men and women are exposed. Males may demonstrate a greater reduction because males tend to make up a majority of hand injuries in the workplace.

Regardless of the underlying cause, bony injuries of the hand follow universal principles of fracture management — establish anatomic reduction, maintain immobilisation for adequate bony healing and subsequently mobilise the joints to prevent stiffness. The technologies available to achieve reduction and immobilisation will vary widely based on the medical resources and capabilities of the country or region in question. Lower SDI countries will not have access to proper diagnostic equipment and a trained surgical workforce, thus placing the populations they serve at greater risk of experiencing the long-term sequelae of these injuries. Estimates of surgical workforce and unmet surgical need, as expected, show that low-income countries have the greatest unmet need. Based on this analysis, 93% of the people living in sub-Saharan Africa and 97% of those in South Asia are without access to safe and affordable surgical care, as compared with 3.6% of the population in higher income regions. This undoubtedly signals an imbalance in the rate of hand injuries and the specific resources needed to adequately diagnose and treat those injuries.

### Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist: diagnosis and treatment options [^35532a72]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist are important clinical entities because of their rapidly progressive and potentially lethal nature. These infections encompass a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms, which can be subtle and nonspecific. If the brief prodromal period of these infections goes unrecognized, a local area of devitalized tissue can evolve into fulminant infection, multiorgan failure, and potentially death. Early recognition and treatment including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical débridement are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### The history of fracture fixation of the hand and wrist [^31d877b6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The treatment of fractures of the hand and wrist has evolved over the centuries from one of rest and immobilization to internal fixation and early motion. Although today's technology (anesthesia, antibiotics, metal implants) has allowed us more freedom in treating these injuries, a number of our patients continue to experience stiffness, nonunion, malunion, and chronic pain. We explore the techniques used to treat hand and wrist fractures throughout the centuries and determine what beneficial aspects of fracture care have been maintained and those that have changed as a result of new technology. We are now realizing that rigid immobilization of fractures at the expense of the soft tissues can be just as damaging as the ancient physician's techniques of prolonged immobilization with frequent dressing changes. New implants and lighter cast materials have allowed improved digital motion and early functional use of the extremity. This has become especially important in the treatment of the aging population, which demands improved function and a quicker return to activities. The optimal treatment of these fractures for each patient remains elusive, however, and there remains a tendency to rely on technology at the expense of sound clinical care. We must not loose sight of the goals of fracture treatment and should heed the lessons learned throughout centuries of treating these injuries.

### Acute wrist injuries in the athlete [^9884f233]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The athlete represents a special population in which injuries can occur either from a single acute traumatic event or as part of a continuum of overuse that leads to osseous or soft tissue failure. The spectrum of overuse with superimposed acute trauma makes the evaluation of the upper extremity in the competitive athlete more challenging. The expectation of this population for quick, full, painless recovery, coupled with the desire to return to the sport that caused the injury, makes the treatment difficult as well. This article will discuss athletic injuries of the forearm and wrist with an emphasis on evaluation, treatment, and criteria for return to play.

### Treatment of distal radius fracture: does early activity postinjury lead to a lower incidence of complex regional pain syndrome? [^6aff0ec3]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Protocol

This clinical observation study was designed as a continuation of the proof-of-concept cohort study, which was started in December 2012. The study was performed between December 2012 and July 2017 in a level 1 trauma center in the Netherlands. The local ethical committee approved the study (NL2014-1361).

Participants

Adult patients (age > 18 years) who were undergoing nonoperative treatment for a DRF were asked to participate in this study by their physicians. Patients predisposed to unreliably answering questions due to intellectual or language problems were excluded. Patients who gave informed consent received, after fracture reduction and plaster cast immobilization, an information leaflet with instructions for a home exercise program and an explanation about the role of pain. Moreover, they were informed that they would be approached for a telephone interview after at least 2 to 3 months following the fracture. When necessary, patients were invited for a visit to the outpatient clinic.

Clinical Treatment Procedure

The Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) system was used for the classification of DRFs. After removal of the plaster cast (after 4–6 weeks of plaster cast immobilization), patients were taught how to exercise their fingers, forearm, and wrist. They were allowed to resume normal activities, gradually increasing the amount of weight and force the affected arm and wrist used, based on the expected course of fracture healing explained by the home exercise leaflet (Figure 1). The instructions instructed the patients on the importance of using and safely strengthening the arm and/or wrist for proper healing of the fracture and for optimizing arm-hand function. The patients were strictly instructed to perform all exercises on a daily basis at home as soon as possible for a 6-week period.

### Wrist injuries in climbers [^0e55d040]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute and chronic injuries to the wrist are among the most common sport-related complaints of climbing athletes but have not been extensively evaluated in this population. Therefore, it is important to categorize climbing injuries to the wrist, analyze risk factors, and assess treatment outcomes.

Purpose

To evaluate the distribution, outcomes, and influencing factors of wrist injuries in climbers.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Climbing athletes with wrist injuries who presented to our specialized sports medical center over the course of 4 years (2017–2020) were selected. All had prospectively completed questionnaires including their climbing-specific background (years of training, climbing level, training methods, etc). Injuries were analyzed (International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation [UIAA] grade and diagnosis), and treatment methods and outcomes were retrospectively assessed with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Parameters included the climbing score, visual analog scale for pain score, Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) score, and shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) score including the sport component (DASH-Sport) score before and after treatment as well as time to return to climbing.

Results

A total of 69 patients (25 female, 44 male) with 78 wrist injuries were identified and analyzed. Of these, 7 injuries were bilateral, occurring at the same time, and 2 injuries were independent reinjuries to either the same or the contralateral side. In addition, 24 injuries (30.8%) were acute, while 54 (69.2%) were chronic. Overall, 2 injuries had a UIAA grade of 3; all others had a UIAA grade of 2. The most frequent injuries were synovitis of the ulnocarpal recess, ulnar impaction, bone marrow edema of the lunate, wrist sprains (joint capsular pain with stress, with no pathological finding on magnetic resonance imaging), and wrist ganglion cysts. Nonoperative treatment was performed for 61 of the injuries, while 17 were treated surgically. In 51 cases (65.4%), injuries healed without consequences; in 27 cases (34.6%), discomfort remained. The visual analog scale pain score decreased from 4.8 ± 1.9 before treatment to 0.7 ± 1.0 after treatment (P < .001), the PRWE score decreased from 53.6 ± 24.9 to 10.3 ± 13.1 (P < .001), the QuickDASH score improved from 53.0 ± 16.6 to 20.0 ± 20.2 (P < .001), and the DASH-Sport score improved from 82.0 ± 16.1 to 38.1 ± 23.5 (P < .001). The climbing score improved from 2.5 ± 1.1 to 4.3 ± 1.0 points (P < .001). The patient-reported number of days with pain was negatively correlated with changes in the PRWE score (r = -0.351; P < .001), QuickDASH score (r = -0.316; P = 0.007), and climbing score (r = -0.264; P = 0.025) as well as the number of days without climbing (r = -0.266; P = 0.025). The number of days without climbing was positively correlated with changes in the PRWE score (r = 0.369; P < .001).

Conclusion

Wrist injuries in climbers constituted a diverse set of diagnoses. Ulnar-sided injuries were most common, and many patients had > 1 diagnosis. Outcomes for all treatment methods (surgery and nonoperative care) were favorable, but approximately one-third of climbers had persistent wrist discomfort after treatment, underscoring the need for accurate diagnoses and acute and expert care.

### Unusual presentation of acute compartment syndrome of the forearm and hand [^82d6fd75]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 49-year-old man was referred to orthopaedics with an acute onset of left forearm and hand swelling, widespread blisters and erythema after lying face down on the floor for an unknown period of time. He also presented with left wrist stiffness due to pain and clawing of the fingers and glove-type loss of sensation in the whole hand. Any attempt to straighten the fingers or extend the wrist exacerbated the pain. Symptoms deteriorated rapidly. Compartment syndrome was diagnosed and surgical fasciotomies of his left forearm and left hand were performed following multidisciplinary urgent discussions between plastic surgeons, microbiologists, anaesthetists and orthopaedic surgeons. The left forearm and left hand underwent extensive decompression and subsequent skin grafting and had good healing despite the initial skin presentation. The patient has made a satisfactory recovery and has required extensive hand physiotherapy and social care.

We report the unusual complication of non-union 14 years following a capitate fracture in a right-hand dominant man. Our patient fell and sustained an injury to his left wrist 14 years ago. At that time he had a swollen painful left wrist. His symptoms subsequently settled and he went back to his normal activities. He lost some power for bench-pressing and had slightly restricted range of motion but remained essentially pain-free. He presented 14 years later with another wrist injury when the original non-union was revealed.

### Multi-staged management of a mangled, exploded hand crush injury with long-term outcome: the critical link between surgery and therapy [^b44e90a3]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A 38-year-old right-hand dominant man sustained a severe, work-related left-hand crushing injury. A multi-staged approach to salvage was employed in conjunction with aggressive hand therapy involvement for a successful, functional outcome. Now at approximately 5years postinjury, the patient can perform daily activities, coaches sports and has returned to and maintained his full-time work position. Mangled, severe hand crush injuries warrant immediate treatment to debride non-salvageable tissues, stabilise and revascularise the hand in an effort to maximise reconstructive potential and functional capacity. It is critical to recognise that these cases require multiple stages of operative reconstruction with direct and ongoing involvement of hand therapy and pending degree of injury, rehabilitation often lasting months to years.

### Hand fractures: a review of current treatment strategies [^babc42d3]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Fractures of the tubular bones of the hand are common and potentially debilitating. The majority of these injuries may be treated without an operation. Surgery, however, offers distinct advantages in properly selected cases. We present a review of hand fracture management, with special attention paid to advances since 2008. The history and mechanisms of these fractures are discussed, as are treatment options and common complications. Early mobilization of the fractured hand is emphasized because soft tissue recovery may be more problematic than that of bone.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute hand and wrist trauma [^5f718071]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hand and wrist injuries are common reasons for musculoskeletal-related emergency department visits. Imaging is essential for evaluating many of these injuries. In most cases, conventional radiographs provide sufficient information to guide the treating clinician. This review focuses on seven common variants to guide diagnosis of hand and wrist injuries. In addition to radiographs, appropriate use of CT, MRI, bone scan, and ultrasound are discussed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Athletic hand injuries [^ebf4b690]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Hand injuries are among the most common injuries arising from athletic participation. Suboptimal outcomes from poorly treated athletic hand injuries can produce functionally disabling injuries. Careful assessment and, when needed, radiographic studies are critical for the accurate and complete diagnoses of hand injuries. Carefully thought out modifications may accelerate the time for return to competition. A thorough understanding of these many variables can enable the physician to minimize time lost without compromising care.

### The management of wrist injuries: an international perspective [^807092a3]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Wrist injury is common and may significantly impair the overall function of the upper extremity unless properly managed. Fractures of the distal radius are particularly common among the aging population, accounting for nearly 1/6 of all fractures, often as a result of increased longevity with the subsequent underlying osteoporosis. New diagnostic tools, including wrist arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography, are increasingly available in developed countries allowing accurate recognition and more effective resolution of lesions which would be otherwise missed using conventional methods. First world treatment standards, however, can scarcely be introduced in developing countries owing to, among other factors, different prevalence of problems, and the lack of resource to implement most modern technologies. If any program needs to be introduced that meets the demands of wrist injury management in the third world, aside from a better regionalisation of trauma care, it should emphasise adequate training of professionals in the use of more cost effective techniques of fracture reduction and stabilisation, applicable everywhere, with the minimum possible morbidity.

The field of hand surgery continues to evolve in new and exciting directions. Advances in diagnosis and management for common complaints and complex injuries allow higher-level care, while still being cognizant of the cost of health care delivery. Indications and protocols for past paradigm shifts, such as volar locked plating for distal radial fractures, continue to be honed, and the outcomes seen for modern flexor tendon repairs are impressive. Open questions remain, but promising results for scaphoid nonunion surgery and peripheral nerve reconstruction with processed allograft will continue to shed light on these unsolved problems.

### Advances in the treatment of hand and wrist injuries in the elite athlete [^a3eb6776]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Caring for hand and wrist injuries in the elite athlete brings distinct challenges, with case-by-case decisions regarding surgical intervention and return-to-play. Metacarpal fractures, thumb ulnar collateral ligament tears, and scaphoid fractures are common upper-extremity injuries in the elite athlete that can be detrimental to playing time and future participation. Treatment should therefore endure the demand of accelerated rehabilitation and return-to-activity without compromising long-term outcomes. Fortunately, the literature has supported emerging management options that support goals specific to the athlete. This review examined the advances in surgical and perioperative treatment of metacarpal fractures, thumb ulnar collateral ligament injuries, and scaphoid fractures in the elite athlete.

### Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for De quervain disease of the wrist: what lies beyond the horizon? [^479a5b99]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

DQVD affects 0.5% of working men and 1.3% of working women. Pregnancy, early motherhood, and postmenopausal status predispose women to the development of DQVD. Frequently, DQVD involves the dominant hand; however, involvement of the non-dominant hand is also encountered in clinical practice. The etiology is still unclear, and the risk factors include certain anatomic variations such as multiple tendons inside the first dorsal extensor compartment, presence of a fibrous septum, and mechanical overloading. The net result is inflammation of the tendon sheath, or thickening of the tendon and retinaculum. Microtears of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons may progress to complete rupture and complicate the treatment course. The underlying causes also influence the response to conservative treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, rehabilitation, and local steroid injection.–Current literature suggests that corticosteroid injection is indicated in severe cases at the first visit and has a higher rate of remission than immobilization alone.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^a0d0755d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture rehabilitation — therapeutic exercises: Therapeutic exercises following DRF are typically implemented regardless of the type of fracture management, with early active range of motion (AROM) for the involved hand and other proximal joints potentially starting during the initial wrist immobilization phase and AROM and passive range of motion (PROM) for the involved wrist initiated when proper fracture healing has been attained; in a comparison of standard therapy to standard therapy plus a scapular exercise program after cast immobilization, the control group received 12 visits of AROM in whirlpool, radiocarpal mobilizations, grip strengthening, and reverse dart throwing exercises, while the scapular exercise group received low-intensity scapular positioning exercises below shoulder level, resulting in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful change in DASH scores at 6 weeks favoring the scapular exercise group, with no differences in AROM or PRWE scores.

### Revealing the progression of pain pathways and identifying chronification of pain predictors after an isolated lateral ankle sprain: project RECOIL [^6d18ca35]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Condition Pain Modulation

A conditioned pain modulation (CPM) protocol is commonly used to evaluate centrally derived pain inhibition pathways. This is accomplished by quantifying the reduction of pain experienced at one body site in response to the introduction of a second noxious conditioning stimuli applied to a remote region of the body (eg, "pain inhibits pain"). Therefore, recommendations for experimentally performing a CPM protocol will be followed.

The most commonly applied conditioning stimulus utilized in pain studies is cold water immersion. Therefore, the conditioning stimulus will be introduced by requiring participants to submerge the contralateral hand of the injured ankle (eg, right ankle, left hand) into a cold-water bath cooled to 2–5° Celsius. Participants will be instructed to submerge their hand until the water covers the wrist and refrain from closing their hand. While their hand is submerged, participants will be asked to verbally report their cold-water pain intensity every 30 seconds using a "0" (no pain at all) to "10" (worst pain imaginable) NRS. Participants will be allowed to voluntarily remove their hand from the cold-water bath at any time or verbally instructed to remove their hand once they report a 7/10 pain using the NRS or after 3-minutes of immersion. The time mark that participants remove their hand from the cold-water bath will be recorded.

Two mechanical test stimuli will be applied across the injured ATFL and ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle belly immediately after the conditioning stimulus (Table 2). Each mechanical test stimuli will be administered consistent with the methods described above for obtaining a PPT.

A CPM index score will be calculated for the ATFL and the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle belly. This index score will be calculated using the average PPT values obtained during the battery of mechanical pain sensitivity testing and those captured immediately after the cold-water immersion. Therefore, the following equation will be used:

A positive percent change score would represent an increase in PPT after the conditioning stimulus and suggest the presence of pain inhibition.

### Risk factors for the development of persistent scaphoid non-union after surgery for an established non-union [^f113c3ff]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study analyzed prospectively collected data on 134 individuals from a large randomized controlled trial to identify risk factors predictive of PSNU following operative management of an established SNU. After we determined 19 a priori risk factors, our multivariable regression analysis showed that dominant hand injury reduced odds of union by 7 times, every additional decade of life reduced odds of union by 1.72 times, and previous surgery reduced the odds of union more than 4 times.

Although there is evidence to suggest older age may reduce chances of bone healing, the current literature is conflicted on age as a specific risk factor for fracture non-union. Many studies, although not focused on the scaphoid specifically, show that increased age is not an independent risk factor for fracture non-unions, - while others have found the opposite, even in pediatric populations. There may be confounding variables associated with age, such as time from injury to surgery, as those who are older may have waited longer to undergo operative treatment since their initial scaphoid injury. We found that time from injury to surgery was not significant in our univariable analysis, which suggests this likely is not the case. This study also excluded other confounding variables often associated with fractures and aging, such as osteoporosis, thus making them unlikely explanations. This being said, fracture healing is a multifaceted process that can be complicated by numerous conditions and medications. Aging impairs a bone's regenerative potential through an associated decrease in mesenchymal stem cells and impaired osteoblast differentiation. Unlike most literature that compares 2 vastly different age groups' potential for fracture healing, our study suggests that age gaps as little as 10 years can significantly alter relative union rates in scaphoid fractures.

### Braces and splints for common musculoskeletal conditions [^394bb03b]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Braces and splints can immobilize and protect joints, reduce pain, decrease swelling, and facilitate healing of acute injuries. They are also used for injury prevention and chronic pain reduction, and to alter the function of a joint. The medial unloading (valgus) knee brace is an option for patients with medial knee osteoarthritis, but evidence of long-term benefit is limited. The patellar stabilizing brace helps maintain proper patellar alignment but has mixed results in treating patellofemoral pain syndrome. The patellar tendon strap is effective in treating pain from patellar tendinopathy. The knee immobilizing splint is used after surgery to prevent reinjury and for acute or presurgical management of quadriceps rupture, patellar tendon rupture, medial collateral ligament rupture, patellar fracture or dislocation, and other acute traumatic knee injuries. Use of a functional ankle brace is more effective than immobilization or a compression wrap in terms of functional outcomes after an acute ankle sprain and prevention of future ankle sprains. The thumb spica splint is effective for the treatment of thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis and de Quervain tenosynovitis, and may be used for patients with suspected scaphoid fractures. A wrist splint has short-term effectiveness in treating symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome but may not be more effective than other conservative therapies.

### The management of partial extensor tendon lacerations of the hand and forearm: a systematic review [^af00fa3d]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Injuries to the extensor mechanism of the hand and forearm are common and cause significant functional disability. Complete tendon lacerations are managed with surgical repair, whereas selected partial tendon injuries may be managed without repair but with splinting and physiotherapy alone. There is limited evidence to support the management of partial lacerations, in particular the decision of whether to repair or not. We aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the optimal management of partial extensor tendon lacerations in the hand and forearm. A protocol for the systematic review was developed prospectively and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021250431). PubMed, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from 1990 to 27/05/2022. 4565 studies were screened, of which 88 underwent full text review. Five studies were included, one randomised control trial and four cohort studies. One study examined outcomes of partial lacerations treated without repair; the other four studies examined outcomes following repair. Pinch and grip strength and time to return to work were similar regardless of management. Adverse outcomes were reported for patients undergoing surgical repair; none were observed in those managed without repair. Meta-analysis was precluded by study heterogeneity and high risk of bias. There is limited evidence to support the management of partial extensor tendon lacerations, with some low-quality evidence that non-operative management of selected partial lacerations is safe. There is a pressing need for pragmatic, multicentre randomised trials to assess the cost-effectiveness of current treatments.

### Short term outcomes following open reduction internal fixation surgery for a distal radius fracture: 2 week versus 4 week immobilization. A retrospective analysis [^8ae745ac]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A distal radius fracture (DRF) is defined as a fracture occurring in the distal radius within 3 cm of the radio-carpal joint.DRF are one of the most common fractures that occur in adults, accounting for approximately 15% of all fractures. The incidence is increasing with an aging population. It is predicted that wrist fractures will increase by 25% in the next 4 years in people aged over 50. A large percentage of the annual health cost is utilized by DRF patients; as a result of the initial assessment and investigation, surgery, treatment materials, therapy costs and time at work lost. The determination of the most efficient and effective care available is of benefit to the patient and health provider combined.

Surgery offers an obvious increased potential risk of infection and soft tissue damage, therefore internal or external fixation is reserved for more complex injuries. Fracture fixation using a VLP is currently the most common surgical treatment for this population. Studies by McCamley et al, Wigg et al, Wilcke et al.and Rozental et al.have compared VLP to other fixation methods (external fixation, k wires, non-locking plates and bridging external fixation). These studies indicate that earlier function is obtained if a VLP is used surgically.

Early movement post surgery is beneficial in prevention of adherence of the tendons to the metal work or skin, reducing joint adhesions and finger stiffness, reducing neural tightness, and preventing unnecessary muscle atrophy. It has been shown that patients with finger stiffness (following a DRF) have a greater pain intensity score and disability than those without stiffness. Motion will aid reduction of swelling and stiffness that is a result of oedema. This enables the patient to experience a return of motion to the hand; improved motion will allow functional gains.

Therapy that is begun too early post surgery may disrupt the inflammatory phase and early proliferative phase of healing. Proliferation of the repair material peaks at approximately 2 to 3 weeks post surgery, this is when the bulk of the scar tissue is formed. Beginning motion around this time will allow the collagen to respond favorably to the mechanical stress applied to it. Delaying motion for longer than this period may result in adherence of the soft tissues and joint stiffness. The optimum period to begin therapy post fracture and fracture fixation remains inconclusive, despite several small studies.-

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^e6f00f80]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Strengthening initiation timing after distal radius fracture repair with volar plating — an RCT found that accelerated wrist strengthening at 2 weeks improved early outcomes versus delaying until 6 weeks. The accelerated group began at 2 weeks (N = 36; 73% female; mean age, 49.8 years) compared with a standard protocol delaying to 6 weeks (N = 45; 73% female; mean age, 55.3 years); both groups initiated early finger exercises 3 to 5 days following surgery, performed hand therapy up to 12 weeks, and used a thermoplastic orthosis until strengthening began. Function (DASH) showed significant differences between 2 and 12 weeks (MD range, 3% and 10%; P < .05) that were clinically meaningful (MCID, 10%) at 4 and 6 weeks, but DASH scores were comparable at 6 months (MD, 2%; P = 0.19). The accelerated group had better AROM for flexion (MD range, 5°-8°) between 3 and 12 weeks and extension (MD range, 5°-6°) between 3 and 8 weeks, and greater strength at 6 (MD, 12 lb; P = 0.02) and 12 weeks (MD, 12 lb; P = 0.02); no adverse effects to fracture alignment were reported and all fractures were healed by 3 months.

### Review of musculoskeletal injuries and prevention in the endoscopy practitioner [^df4ae75d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

RISK FACTORS

Of particular concern to endoscopists are musculoskeletal injuries associated with cumulative trauma and overuse. Work-related factors that have been associated with cumulative trauma disorders include repetition, high force, awkward joint posture, direct pressure, vibration, and prolonged constrained posture. Overuse syndromes have been recognized in laborers and athletes and are often due to repetitive microtrauma leading to collagen failure and damage to connective tissues leading to further weakening of the tissues. These can lead to permanent injury if the tissue is not allowed to heal.

Maneuvers specific to endoscopy such as adjusting tip angulation controls, torqueing with the right hand, and standing for prolonged periods are known to contribute to musculoskeletal pain and injury and are noted as possible causes of thumb/finger/hand pain/injuries and back/neck pain/injuries. Some studies have shown that the thumb pain, hand pain, elbow pain, low back pain, and possibly shoulder pain seemed related to performing more endoscopies and to greater hours spent performing endoscopy. In a survey of surgeons there was a risk of injury of 47% for those who performed > 30 colonoscopies per week. Others have not shown an association between endoscopic procedural time or procedural numbers and injuries, which differs from other reports. Some have theorized that perhaps this was due to previously injured endoscopists decreasing their procedural volume in response to their injury.

In the Korean study, the most commonly reported areas of pain during procedures were the right shoulder, followed by left shoulder, left finger, and then right wrist. It is significant that the average age reported in this study was 39 years with median of time in practice as 39 months, that is, early in their career. Elbow pain is often seen on the right with thumb and hand pain seen on the left reflecting the maneuvering of the left hand in holding the endoscope and manipulating the wheels while the right hand is used to advance and torque the scope. Long periods of standing and the often-awkward positioning required of the endoscopist can lead to back pain, which is frequently reported as reported in the studies above. Prolonged standing, bent-over postures, and twisting and bending movements increase forces on the spine and have been associated with low back pain. Other injuries such as carpel tunnel syndrome were seen and were believed to be the result of the right hand torqueing the shaft of the colonoscope.

### Epidemiology of hand and wrist injuries in collegiate-level athletes in the United States [^e582088a]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Hand and wrist injuries are common among competitive athletes and can have a substantial impact on playing time and future participation. The purpose of this study was to provide epidemiological data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program to correlate injury diagnosis with the need for surgery and time loss.

Methods

Using the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program, this retrospective study extracted data of hand and wrist injuries for all 25 National Collegiate Athletic Association sports from the academic years 2004–2005 to 2013–2014. The "severe" category was defined as injuries resulting in the following: (1) surgery, (2) season-ending status, or (3) more than 30 days of playing time loss. The epidemiologic data included injury rate per 100,000 athlete exposures (defined as 1 athlete participating in 1 practice or competition) based on diagnoses and demographic information such as sports and sex. We used a Poisson regression model to estimate the incidence rate and 95% confidence interval.

Results

Overall, 4,851 hand injuries were identified, with an injury rate of 41.2 per 100,000 athlete exposures. The most common diagnoses were metacarpal or phalangeal fractures (19.9%), lacerations or contusions (15.4%), and wrist sprains (14.7%). The surgical rate was 9.6%, and the season-ending rate was 5.8%. Severe injuries occurred in 17.5% of the hand and wrist injuries; within this subset, the most common diagnoses included metacarpal or phalangeal fractures (43.8%), scaphoid fractures (12.8%), and thumb ulnar collateral ligament tears (8.7%). Scaphoid fractures and metacarpal or phalangeal fractures had the highest surgical rate and season-ending rate among all the injuries.

Conclusions

The injury rate of hand and wrist injuries is comparable with those of other common sports injuries. Approximately one fifth of the injuries were considered severe, which led to a high surgical rate, and these had a considerable impact on the athletes' ability to finish the season.

Wrist-mobilization phase goals and adjuncts — The primary goal is to manage pain and edema while optimizing active and passive ROM at the wrist, in addition to the hand, elbow, and shoulder; emphasis is also given to improving wrist and hand sensibility and sensorimotor control via conscious proprioception. Submaximal isometric exercises can be used to improve pain, joint dynamic stability, and motor control, and if stiffness persists with unmet wrist ROM goals, static or dynamic mobilization splinting might be used for select individuals despite its weak evidence.

### Comparison of conservative treatment and surgery treatment for acute scaphoid fracture: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a1fcc920]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effectiveness of conservative and surgical treatments of scaphoid fracture.

Methods

The literature databases of Pubmed, Cochrane library, and Embase were searched in March 2022. This work extracted the data based on healing time, grip strength, range of wrist motion, nonunion, time before returning to work, and complications (including persistent pain, malunion of the fracture, wound infection, scar sensitivity, hypertrophic scar, and implant-related complications). Stata 14.0 software was used for statistical analysis.

Results

Twelve RCTs studies met our inclusion criteria. The surgical group had a shorter healing-time and time before returning to work than the conservative group. In addition, the surgical group had significantly better grip strength and range of wrist motion than the conservative group (P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between nonunion (P = 0.538) and complications (P = 0.661) between the two groups.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis showed that surgical treatment of scaphoid fracture achieved better grip strength and range of wrist motion, and had a lower healing time and time before returning to work than the conservative treatment. The two treatments had similar results in nonunion and complications. Further RCTs were required for the research.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^7406461b]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture (DRF) postoperative rehabilitation timing — Early exercise initiation within 1–3 weeks appears safe and may lead to noticeably quicker functional gains versus a delayed ≥ 4 weeks approach; reviews including 8 level I-II, and 1 level III RCTs indicated that starting at 3 weeks improves short-term (6–12 weeks) function, wrist active range of motion (AROM), and grip strength and long-term (6 months) outcomes compared with delaying to ≥ 6 weeks. Additional evidence (2 level I and 2 level IV) supports initiation within the first 2 weeks for superior 6-week functional, wrist AROM, and grip strength outcomes versus ≥ 4 weeks, though one level I trial found no extra benefits for starting within the first postoperative week versus 2 weeks; gains may persist up to 6 months and AROM/grip gains up to 1 year. Two level IV case-control studies showed no benefit when starting in the first postoperative week versus ≥ 4 weeks, although one study found fewer therapy visits when starting at week 1 rather than 6 weeks. Two systematic reviews indicated a trend to higher postoperative complication or union-adverse effect risk (RR = 3.0%-3.3%) with earlier starts than 4 or more weeks, but this increase was not to be significant.

Overuse wrist injuries are a common problem in athletes and can be related to tendinopathies or osteoarticular pathology. Fortunately, athletes rarely miss time from their sport due to these conditions because many can be treated nonoperatively. For refractory cases, there often is a curative surgical procedure that can be done during the off-season.

### CONSORT 2010 statement: extension checklist for reporting within person randomised trials [^89d6c436]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Item 16: Numbers analysed

Standard CONSORT item — For each group, number of participants (denominator) included in each analysis and whether the analysis was by original assigned groups.

Extension for within person trials — Number of randomised body sites in each group included in each analysis.

Example — "Forty five patients with bilateral carpal syndrome (90 wrists) fulfilled all inclusion criteria; 11 (24%) of these patients discontinued treatment after randomisation (eight patients early after randomisation because of non-compliance in keeping appointments, and three patients because of excessive pain requiring additional therapeutic measures). Thus 34 patients — that is, 34 actively treated and 34 sham treated wrists — completed the study. Thirty of them (67% of the initial 45 patients) completed a follow-up at six months".

Explanation — The number of participants and sites that contribute to the analysis of a trial is essential to interpreting the results. But the analysis of each outcome might not include all participants or all participant sites. If participants do not contribute to the analysis in a within person trial, the corresponding sites might be lost. One site, however, can contribute to the data if the other site is lost. Because the sample size, and hence the power of the study, is calculated on the assumption that all sites and participants will provide information, the number of participants and sites contributing to a particular analysis should be reported so that any potential drop in statistical power can be assessed. In addition, and as explained in detail in the CONSORT 2010 guideline, it should be specified whether the analysis was per protocol or intention-to-treat, with specific details on how the selected analysis approach was implemented. In the included example it is not explicitly stated how many wrists were analysed, but it is implied that possibly 30 of 45 patients were analysed at six months.

### A new definition of wrist sprain necessary after findings in a prospective MRI study [^97231cb1]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Wrist injuries with negative X-rays are diagnosed as acute wrist sprains. The prognosis is usually good, but some patients suffer from long-lasting pain and reduced wrist function, probably due to missed diagnosis followed by inappropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate acute wrist sprains with MRI to detect the pathoanatomy of the injury.

Patients and Methods

This prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study included patients between 18 and 49 years, who attended the Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) Bergen, Norway, after sustaining an acute wrist trauma within the previous week. Initial X-rays of the wrist were normal. MRI was done within a median of 1 day (range 0–31 days) after the trauma, 80% within 4 days. The study period lasted from 5 November 2009 to 4 November 2010.

Results

A total of 155 acute MRIs were done, out of which 30 were completely normal. Patients with positive MRI had a median of two (range 0–8) pathological findings. We found 54 fractures and 56 bone bruises, mostly located to the radius followed by the scaphoid, the triquetrum, the capitate and the lunate. There were 73 soft-tissue injuries, which included 15 injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and five scapho-lunate (SL) ligament lesions.

Conclusions

Wrist sprain is an inaccurate diagnosis. In four out of five patients with normal X-rays, MRI identified pathological findings and a large variety of injuries in different structures. We suggest that wrist sprain should be defined as "occult partial or complete soft tissue (ligament, tendon, muscle) or bony injury in relation to a trauma with negative X-ray". The MRI findings led to a more differentiated treatment in more than a third of the patients. We recommend that MRI should be considered as a part of an early investigation, especially when the wrist pain does not settle within the first couple of weeks.

### Trends of hand injuries presenting to US emergency departments: a 10-year national analysis [^56d69bee]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose was to observe current incidence and trends of hand and wrist injuries presenting to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) over a decade.

Methods

The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was queried for hand and wrist injuries from January 2009-December 2018. Descriptive analyses were used to report injury types to the hand and wrist. Incidence, age, gender, race, injury location, and type of injury were recorded. Linear regression analyses were used to assess changes in trends over time. A p value < 0.05 was statistically significant.

Results

In total, 649,131 cases of hand and wrist injuries were identified in the NEISS from 2009 to 2018, correlating to 25,666,596 patients nationally. Incidence rates for finger, hand, and wrist were 450, 264, and 182 per 100,000 people. The estimated number of patients per year declined by 8.6% from 2009 to 2018. Male adults (aged 18–39) were the most frequent demographic. Total national estimates of hand (-8.2%; p = 0.001), wrist (-6.1%; p = 0.007), and finger (-9.9%; p < 0.001) injuries declined over the study period. The most common injuries were lacerations (36.5%), fractures (19.9%), strains/sprains (12.3%), and contusions/abrasions (12.1%) which significantly declined over the study period. The overall admission rate was 1.8%.

Conclusions

The estimated annual number of hand/wrist injuries presenting to US EDs was 2.6 million with gradual decline over the decade. Hand injury registries could assist in quality improvement measures targeted toward increased efficiency and resource allocation and education.

### Immobilization of the wrist after dorsal wrist ganglion excision: a systematic review and survey of current practice [^0fb041b6]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review of the literature has revealed a paucity of evidence available to inform the decision of wrist immobilization following DWG excision, either open or arthroscopic. Similarly, a survey of Canadian hand surgeons demonstrates current practice variability in postoperative dressings. Together, the data presented suggest that limited immobilization of 2 weeks or less or no immobilization after surgery does not meaningfully affect patient outcome after surgery. To detect a difference, the cumulative power of primary studies that employ a similar set of core outcomes that include patient-reported outcomes is necessary.

### Hand and wrist dog-leash injuries in the outpatient setting: a review of 443 cases [^bc1fc000]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Injuries sustained from dog leashes often result in visits to hand surgeons. This study presents an analysis of dog-leash-related upper-extremity injuries at a single orthopedic practice, including treatment options for these injuries, and guidance for prevention.

Methods

We identified all outpatients who presented to a hand surgeon at a single institution from 2016 to 2021 following an upper-extremity injury related to a dog leash. Charts were reviewed and demographics, injury description and mechanism, and details of treatment were recorded.

Results

We identified 443 patients that presented for a dog-leash-related injury. The average time from injury to outpatient visit was 23 days. Surgery occurred following injury in 96 patients (21.6%). The most common injury locations were the ring finger, followed by the wrist, third finger, and fifth finger. Interphalangeal joint sprain was the most common injury type followed by phalangeal fracture. The majority of injuries were caused by the extremity catching in the leash while being pulled (337, 75.9%). Among the 96 patients requiring surgery, open reduction and internal fixation was the most commonly performed procedure followed by closed reduction with percutaneous pinning. For patients not requiring surgery (348, 78.4%), splinting or bracing was the most common treatment recommended.

Conclusion

The majority of dog-leash injuries were caused by the patient's extremity catching in the leash as it was pulled, resulting in interphalangeal joint injures and phalanx fractures. The most common treatment required for these patients was nonoperative.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^b7cd4146]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture rehabilitation — multimodal and accelerated approaches: A multimodal rehabilitation approach (modalities for pain and edema control; AROM exercises at the hand, wrist, and other proximal joints; joint mobilization; strengthening and proprioceptive exercises; functional retraining; advice for self-care and daily activity; and iHEP instructions) may offer the strongest merit toward optimal recovery following DRF, and regardless of fracture-treatment type, an accelerated rehabilitation approach with wrist AROM initiation within the first 2–3 weeks after surgery may lead to better outcomes; for the more stable fracture types, the initiation of submaximal hand grip strengthening exercises could be safely implemented around 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively or even during cast immobilization.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^a7a53e05]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided tenotomy, fenestration, calcific deposit barbotage, and trigger point needling — real-time ultrasound guidance can be used to perform or supplement percutaneous procedures with standard stainless steel needles or specialized devices, including these interventions. Tenotomy can be performed for chronic tendinopathy, plantar fasciopathy, and ligament sprains with the goal of disrupting degenerative tissue and facilitating healing; needle tenotomy is performed by repetitively fenestrating the pathologic region under real-time ultrasound guidance, with the needle typically oriented parallel to the tissue fibers but potentially perpendicular, and one or more needle passes completed through each affected region. Needle size may vary, but larger-gauge needles (eg, 18 gauge) are often used, and orthogonal short- and long-axis imaging of the target tissue is used to control the needle position and ensure that all regions are treated. Tenotomy may also be performed with specialized devices that specifically cut, fragment, and in some cases remove tissue. Needle fenestration can be used to treat entrapments such as carpal tunnel syndrome and stenosing tenosynovitis; the clinician repetitively fenestrates the entrapping structure (eg, A1 pulley in stenosing tenosynovitis) to reduce tension, and similar to tenotomy, "fenestration" may also be completed with specialized tools or devices that cut or transect the restrictive tissues.

### Carpal fractures in children [^c509b527]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Carpal injuries in children are relatively rare. Diagnosis is likely to be missed, or the severity of the injury might not fully be appreciated at the time of presentation. Fortunately, in the majority of cases the fracture heals uneventfully with a low incidence of complications. As in adults, the scaphoid is most susceptible to injury and the capitate, which often presents in association with other carpal bone injuries, the next most susceptible. Other carpal bone fractures are very unusual and the literature largely is confined to case reports or very small series. This review article lists the common carpal injuries in children and suggests a treatment plan in each case, emphasizing the importance of having a high index of suspicion when faced with a child with a wrist injury and seemingly normal radiographs.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^38d37160]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Data Collection and Outcome Measures

Research team members not involved with patient care performed assessments at enrollment, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after surgery or, for casting participants, after fracture. Participants completed the full Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) at the 6-week through 24-month assessments. Only the pain domain of the MHQ was completed at enrollment and 2 weeks because all participants were immobilized in a cast or splint at this time point and, thus, were not performing any activities with the recently fractured wrist. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was completed at all visits. At enrollment, participants provided demographic information and completed the Self-Administered Comorbidity Checklist. Participants were asked to report preinjury activity level using the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity at enrollment and current activity at 24 months. Grip and lateral pinch strength and wrist arc of motion were measured at the 6-week through 24-month assessments. Deidentified digital copies of radiographs were sent to the Coordinating Center to measure radial height, radial inclination, volar or dorsal tilt, and ulnar deviation. Malunion was defined as dorsal or volar tilt greater than 10° from neutral, radial inclination less than 15°, or radial shortening greater than 3 mm.

### Erosion or normal variant? 4-year MRI follow-up of the wrists in healthy children [^fc123de3]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The initial Tromsø wrist cohort included 89 healthy children ages 6–15 years and residing in Tromsø, Norway. After an interval of 4 years, the children and caregivers were approached a second time by postal mail and invited for a follow-up MRI and radiograph of the left wrist. The results of the radiographs will be published separately. Seventy-four (83%) children, now ages 10–19 years, accepted the invitation and 64 were scanned in the summer and early autumn. On arrival to the radiology department, all children were (1) checked for contraindications to MRI, (2) asked whether they had sustained recent injuries to the left wrist, e.g. within the last 2–3 weeks and (3) asked whether they participated in organised sports or training, and if so, the number of training sessions per week.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^46e6ef98]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Therapy initiation timing in distal radius fracture (DRF) — operative and nonoperative care: Traditional postoperative therapy approaches delay initiation of therapy until after 4 to 5 weeks of immobilization, and strengthening exercises start after 6 weeks postoperatively. Conversely, an accelerated therapy approach has been described as initiating wrist active range of motion (AROM) and strengthening exercises within the first 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. For nonoperative DRF treatment, strengthening usually starts after the end of a 6-week cast-immobilization period.

The dose for your hands, wrists, or elbows is 2 grams of VOLTAREN GEL each time you apply it.

Apply VOLTAREN®GEL 4 times a day (a total of 8 grams each day). Do not apply more than 8 grams each day to any one of your affected hands, wrists, or elbows.

The dose for your feet, ankles, or knees is 4 grams of VOLTAREN GEL each time you apply it.

Apply VOLTAREN®GEL 4 times a day (a total of 16 grams each day). Do not apply more than 16 grams each day to any one of your affected feet, ankles, or knees.

Some examples of VOLTAREN GEL application include:

If you use 2 grams of VOLTAREN®GEL on one hand, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 8 grams.
If you use 4 grams of VOLTAREN®GEL on one knee, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 16 grams.
Your total dose for one day, treating one hand and one knee, is 8 grams plus 16 grams, which equals 24 grams of VOLTAREN®GEL.

Before you use a new tube of VOLTAREN®GEL for the first time, open the foil seal that covers the tube opening by using the spiked top of the cap. Remember to remove the dosing card from the carton to measure your dose (see Figure A).
Apply VOLTAREN®GEL to clean, dry skin that does not have any cuts, open wounds, infections, or rashes.
Do not use heating pads or apply bandages to where you have applied VOLTAREN®GEL.
Avoid exposing skin where you apply VOLTAREN®GEL to sunlight and artificial light, such as tanning booths.
Do not use sunscreens, cosmetics, lotions, moisturizers, insect repellants, or other topical medicines on the same skin areas where you have applied VOLTAREN®GEL.
Do not get VOLTAREN®GEL in your eyes, nose, or mouth. VOLTAREN®GEL is only to be used on your skin (topical use). If you get VOLTAREN®GEL in your eyes, rinse your eyes right away with water or saline. Talk with your healthcare provider if eye irritation lasts for more than one hour.

### Interventions for treating wrist fractures in children [^2082aef5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Wrist fractures, involving the distal radius, are the most common fractures in children. Most are buckle fractures, which are stable fractures, unlike greenstick and other usually displaced fractures. There is considerable variation in practice, such as the extent of immobilisation for buckle fractures and use of surgery for seriously displaced fractures.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for common distal radius fractures in children, including skeletally immature adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and reference lists to May 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing interventions for treating distal radius fractures in children. We sought data on physical function, treatment failure, adverse events, time to return to normal activities (recovery time), wrist pain, and child (and parent) satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Of the 30 included studies, 21 were RCTs, seven were quasi-RCTs and two did not describe their randomisation method. Overall, 2930 children were recruited. Typically, trials included more male children and reported mean ages between 8 and 10 years. Eight studies recruited buckle fractures, five recruited buckle and other stable fractures, three recruited minimally displaced fractures and 14 recruited displaced fractures, typically requiring closed reduction, typically requiring closed reduction. All studies were at high risk of bias, mainly reflecting lack of blinding. The studies made 14 comparisons. Below we consider five prespecified comparisons:Removable splint versus below-elbow cast for predominantly buckle fractures (6 studies, 695 children)One study (66 children) reported similar Modified Activities Scale for Kids - Performance scores (0 to 100; no disability) at four weeks (median scores: splint 99.04; cast 99.11); low-quality evidence. Thirteen children needed a change or reapplication of device (splint 5/225; cast 8/219; 4 studies); very low-quality evidence. One study (87 children) reported no refractures at six months. One study (50 children) found no between-group difference in pain during treatment; very low-quality evidence. Evidence was absent (recovery time), insufficient (children with minor complications) or contradictory (child or parent satisfaction). Two studies estimated lower healthcare costs for removable splints. Soft or elasticated bandage versus below-elbow cast for buckle or similar fractures (4 studies, 273 children)One study (53 children) reported more children had no or only limited disability at four weeks in the bandage group; very low-quality evidence. Eight children changed device or extended immobilisation for delayed union (bandage 5/90; cast 3/91; 3 studies); very low-quality evidence. Two studies (139 children) reported no serious adverse events at four weeks. Evidence was absent, insufficient or contradictory for recovery time, wrist pain, children with minor complications, and child and parent satisfaction. More bandage-group participants found their treatment convenient (39 children). Removal of casts at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (2 studies, 404 children, mainly buckle fractures)One study (233 children) found full restoration of physical function at four weeks; low-quality evidence. There were five treatment changes (home 4/197; hospital 1/200; 2 studies; very low-quality evidence). One study found no serious adverse effects at six months (288 children). Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in pain at four weeks (233 children); low-quality evidence. One study (80 children) found greater parental satisfaction in the home group; low-quality evidence. One UK study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. Below-elbow versus above-elbow casts for displaced or unstable both-bone fractures (4 studies, 399 children)Short-term physical function data were unavailable but very low-quality evidence indicated less dependency when using below-elbow casts. One study (66 children with minimally displaced both-bone fractures) found little difference in ABILHAND-Kids scores (0 to 42; no problems) (mean scores: below-elbow 40.7; above-elbow 41.8); very low-quality evidence. Overall treatment failure data are unavailable, but nine of the 11 remanipulations or secondary reductions (366 children, 4 studies) were in the above-elbow group; very low-quality evidence. There was no refracture or compartment syndrome at six months (215 children; 2 studies). Recovery time and overall numbers of children with minor complications were not reported. There was little difference in requiring physiotherapy for stiffness (179 children, 2 studies); very low-quality evidence. One study (85 children) found less pain at one week for below-elbow casts; low-quality evidence. One study found treatment with an above-elbow cast cost three times more in Nepal. Surgical fixation with percutaneous wiring and cast immobilisation versus cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures (5 studies, 323 children)Where reported, above-elbow casts were used. Short-term functional outcome data were unavailable. One study (123 children) reported similar ABILHAND-Kids scores indicating normal physical function at six months (mean scores: surgery 41.9; cast only 41.4); low-quality evidence. There were fewer treatment failures, defined as early or problematic removal of wires or remanipulation for early loss in position, after surgery (surgery 20/124; cast only 41/129; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Similarly, there were fewer serious advents after surgery (surgery 28/124; cast only 43/129; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There was lower referral for physiotherapy for stiffness after surgery (1 study); very low-quality evidence. One USA study found similar treatment costs in both groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Where available, the quality of the RCT-based evidence on interventions for treating wrist fractures in children is low or very low. However, there is reassuring evidence of a full return to previous function with no serious adverse events, including refracture, for correctly-diagnosed buckle fractures, whatever the treatment used. The review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for these injuries. High-quality evidence is needed to address key treatment uncertainties; notably, some priority topics are already being tested in ongoing multicentre trials, such as FORCE.

### Identification of radiologic healing phenomena in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^10bc9687]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Conventional radiographic scoring methods in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are designed to quantify progression and disregard any improvement. Reparative changes observed during longterm followup of RA have rarely been described as healing phenomena. Healing may become increasingly important with the availability of more potent antirheumatic drugs. We investigated whether radiologic healing phenomena can be identified by different observers in a blinded fashion.

Methods

Healing phenomena were defined as (1) reappearance (and sclerosis) of the cortical plate, (2) partial or complete filling in of an erosion, or (3) subchondral bone sclerosis with osteophyte formation (secondary osteoarthritis). Pairs of radiographs of hands, wrists, and forefeet [taken 2 to 8 (mean 4.8) yrs apart] of 34 patients were selected from longterm studies: 24 sets with healing phenomena and 10 with progressive disease without healing. The radiographs were blinded and read in pairs in random order by 3 observers unaware of the patients selected for the study. One observer read the set a second time after 8 weeks, resulting in a total of 4 observations. Thirty-eight joints were rated 0 to 5 depending on the amount of surface destruction. In addition an attempt was made to identify joints with healing phenomena. The data were analyzed with help of descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations, and frequency tables.

Results

Out of 1292 joints scored at the second time point, 74 had healing phenomena. These joints were identified in a mean of 89% (95/89/88/82%, respectively) in the 4 observations performed by the 3 readers. Patients without healing phenomena were correctly identified by all observers. In 54 joints less typical healing phenomena were seen in all observations. Sixty-two joints with healing in addition to the 74 joints were seen in 3 observations, 76 in 2, and 127 in one observation. All observers agreed that 1090 joints had no healing phenomenon. The 24 patients with healing had a slight reduction in the Ratingen score, while the 10 patients without healing showed a moderate progression. In the group with healing an increase and decrease in the score occurred in the same patients at different joints.

Conclusion

In patients with RA followed for several years healing or reparative changes of erosions can be observed. These phenomena can be identified by different observers with high sensitivity even when the observers are blinded to chronological sequence of the films.

### Does the timing of debridement of an upper extremity open fracture really matter? [^40062329]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

History

- A 49yo woman was involved in a car crash. She suffered an isolated, open, left both bones forearm mid-diaphyseal fracture. She had a sling applied at the scene but had a 16-hour transport time from an isolated rural location. She was found to have no other injuries upon her careful work-up at the Level 1 emergency department. The injury had not compromised the distal neurovascular status of the limb. The ER staff admitted the patient to the orthopedic team. The patient had an evaluation by a senior resident and their assessment was that this was a grade 3A open fracture of the dorsum of the mid forearm (Figure 1 and Figure 2). By the time surgery could be initiated at the Trauma center, fully 36 hours had passed. Most of the delay at the Trauma center was due to other very significant injuries in the Trauma room that day. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY: - She is a married woman and lives with her husband and a university aged teenager. She has been a nonsmoker. She has no medical problems that she sees a physician about. She works as a secretary but presently is unemployed. She has only had obstetrical surgery, has no allergies and takes no medications. She is a regular wine drinker.

### Immobilization of the wrist after dorsal wrist ganglion excision: a systematic review and survey of current practice [^9ec5ba48]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of the systematic review highlight the lack of consensus amongst hand surgeons regarding the optimal postoperative care protocol in DWG excision patients. Although many of the included studies did employ some form of either rigid or limited immobilization, the type of dressing and the length of time for which it is applied are highly variable. Our survey of Canadian hand surgeons corroborates the highly variable practices of immobilization of the wrist after surgical excision of DWG. Interestingly, surveyed surgeons who did immobilize the wrist postoperatively most often limited the duration to 1 to 2 weeks, but never for more than 3 weeks. In contrast, many surgeons found no need for immobilization. The variability of postoperative immobilization has been documented in other areas of hand surgery, including carpal tunnel release. Despite critical evaluation through 5 RCTs concluding that splinting following carpal tunnel release does not have an appreciable effect on postoperative outcomes, surgeons' opinions and practices remain divided. As with other aspects of surgical practice, deciding upon a specific postoperative dressing can be influenced by personal experience or learned behaviors from mentors.

The resources necessary for a RCT is likely not indicated for our clinical question as both groups seemingly have overall very good outcomes but a core outcome set would allow even work done as a case series to potentially meaningfully answer this question through meta-analysis. There is inconsistent reporting of outcomes in the DWG literature. For example, range of motion, grip strength, and pain outcomes were reported as either a percentage of patients experiencing improvement, a percentage of patients with residual symptoms, or as a preoperative and postoperative score on a questionnaire or measuring tool. The variation in outcome reporting makes it difficult to amalgamate these results into a meta-analysis. As a result, although preliminary inferences can be made about the relative success of the immobilization protocols, the degree to which 1 protocol is better or worse than the other remains unclear, especially in the context of varying surgical techniques. This substantiates the need for standardized core outcomes, such as those being developed by the Core Outcomes in Effectiveness Trials initiative.

There are several limitations to our study. First, it is acknowledged that functional and patient-reported outcomes are influenced by not only postoperative care as we have studied but also surgical technique. Second, many included studies were observational in nature, with only 3 RCTs. Third, our survey results may be prone to selection bias.

### Involvement in a personal injury claim is associated with more pain and delayed return to work after elective nonsurgical or surgical treatment for hand or wrist disorders: a propensity score-matched comparative study [^eef5fa3c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

A small proportion of patients treated for a hand or wrist condition are also involved in a personal injury claim that may or may not be related to the reason for seeking treatment. There are already indications that patients involved in a personal injury claim have more severe symptoms preoperatively and worse surgical outcomes. However, for nonsurgical treatment, it is unknown whether involvement in a personal injury claim affects treatment outcomes. Similarly, it is unknown whether treatment invasiveness affects the association between involvement in a personal injury claim and the outcomes of nonsurgical treatment. Finally, most studies did not take preoperative differences into account.

Questions/purposes

(1) Do patients with a claim have more pain during loading, less function, and longer time to return to work after nonsurgical treatment than matched patients without a personal injury claim? (2) Do patients with a personal injury claim have more pain, less function, and longer time to return to work after minor surgery than matched patients without a personal injury claim? (3) Do patients with a personal injury claim have more pain, less function, and longer time to return to work after major surgery than matched patients without a personal injury claim?

Methods

We used data from a longitudinally maintained database of patients treated for hand or wrist disorders in the Netherlands between December 2012 and May 2020. During the study period, 35,749 patients for whom involvement in a personal injury claim was known were treated nonsurgically or surgically for hand or wrist disorders. All patients were invited to complete the VAS (scores range from 0 to 100) for pain and hand function before treatment and at follow-up. We excluded patients who did not complete the VAS on pain and hand function before treatment and those who received a rare treatment, which we defined as fewer than 20 occurrences in our dataset, resulting in 29,101 patients who were eligible for evaluation in this study. Employed patients (66% [19,134 of 29,101]) were also asked to complete a questionnaire regarding return to work. We distinguished among nonsurgical treatment (follow-up at 3 months), minor surgery (such as trigger finger release, with follow-up of 3 months), and major surgery (such as trapeziectomy, with follow-up at 12 months). The mean age was 53 ± 15 years, 64% (18,695 of 29,101) were women, and 2% (651 of 29,101) of all patients were involved in a personal injury claim. For each outcome and treatment type, patients with a personal injury claim were matched to similar patients without a personal injury claim using 1:2 propensity score matching to account for differences in patient characteristics and baseline pain and hand function. For nonsurgical treatment VAS analysis, there were 115 personal injury claim patients and 230 matched control patients, and for return to work analysis, there were 83 claim and 166 control patients. For minor surgery VAS analysis, there were 172 personal injury claim patients and 344 matched control patients, and for return to work analysis, there were 108 claim and 216 control patients. For major surgery VAS analysis, there were 129 personal injury claim patients and 258 matched control patients, and for return to work analysis, there were 117 claim and 234 control patients.

Results

For patients treated nonsurgically, those with a claim had more pain during load at 3 months than matched patients without a personal injury claim (49 ± 30 versus 39 ± 30, adjusted mean difference 9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2 to 15]; p = 0.008), but there was no difference in hand function (61 ± 27 versus 66 ± 28, adjusted mean difference -5 [95% CI -11 to 1]; p = 0.11). Each week, patients with a personal injury claim had a 39% lower probability of returning to work than patients without a claim (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.45 to 0.84]; p = 0.002). For patients with an injury claim at 3 months after minor surgery, there was more pain (44 ± 30 versus 34 ± 29, adjusted mean difference 10 [95% CI 5 to 15]; p < 0.001), lower function (60 ± 28 versus 69 ± 28, adjusted mean difference -9 [95% CI -14 to -4]; p = 0.001), and 32% lower probability of returning to work each week (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.52 to 0.89]; p = 0.005). For patients with an injury claim at 1 year after major surgery, there was more pain (36 ± 29 versus 27 ± 27, adjusted mean difference 9 [95% CI 4 to 15]; p = 0.002), worse hand function (66 ± 28 versus 76 ± 26, adjusted mean difference -9 [95% CI -15 to -4]; p = 0.001), and a 45% lower probability of returning to work each week (HR 0.55 [95% CI 0.42 to 0.73]; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Personal injury claim involvement was associated with more posttreatment pain and a longer time to return to work for patients treated for hand or wrist disorders, regardless of treatment invasiveness. Patients with a personal injury claim who underwent surgery also rated their postoperative hand function as worse than similar patients who did not have a claim. Depending on treatment invasiveness, only 42% to 55% of the personal injury claim patients experienced a clinically relevant improvement in pain. We recommend that clinicians extensively discuss the expected treatment outcomes and the low probability of a clinically relevant improvement in pain with their personal injury claim patients and that they broach the possibility of postponing treatment.

### Hand and finger replantation after protracted ischemia (more than 24 hours) [^1f36e249]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Ischemia tolerance has been a major concern during hand and finger replantation. Because of multiple referrals and damage control resuscitation, ischemia is occasionally prolonged for more than 24 hours. Amputation impairs functional efficiency in amputees; therefore, if there is a favorable indication for replantation, microsurgical replantation can be performed to salvage the function of the affected part to an acceptable extent. Between 1998 and 2006, 14 patients underwent 25 replantations after prolonged ischemia of more than 24 hours. Of the 14 patients, 12 were referred to our hospital after unsuccessful replantations and admitted to the emergency room. Two of these patients underwent thumb amputations, and 10 patients underwent multiple digit amputations. Two patients underwent wrist amputation with associated polytrauma and profound shock, both hand replantations were performed on the following day after ICU management with damage control resuscitation was performed to control excessive bleeding and stabilize vital signs. In this study, 16 replantations were successful and 9 failed; thus, the success rate was 64.0%. Several secondary procedures were required for restoring the functional ability of the reconstructed parts. Ischemia time is critical for limb salvage. Hands and fingers have very little muscle tissue. Hence, replantation of these parts can be performed even in the case of prolonged ischemia to restore the hand function.

Distal radius fracture (DRF) rehabilitation phases — For either nonoperative or operative DRF cases, most individuals are first managed with an early protective mobilization phase, then progress into a wrist-mobilization phase, before they initiate the final strengthening phase, which extends until they are discharged from therapy and transition to an independent home exercise program (IHEP); during the early protective mobilization phase the wrist is fully immobilized in a cast or a splint with any wrist ROM being contraindicated, while self-directed active or passive ROM at the digits and other proximal joints is advised, and an edema compression glove may be advisable for select individuals with persistent edema.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / American society for surgery of the hand clinical practice guideline summary management of distal radius fractures [^46da0960]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Distal radius fractures — epidemiology, burden, risk factors, impact, and decision-making: Distal radius fractures account for almost 20% of fractures seen by physicians and is the second most common fracture experienced by older adults, and in 2005 alone the treatment for distal radius fractures in the elderly was estimated at $500 million with this burden expected to increase by 20% by 2025; they are one of the most common fractures seen by orthopaedic surgeons with an incidence of 195.2/100,000 persons per year. Distal radius fractures occur as a result of both high energy and low energy trauma with a bimodal distribution where high-energy fractures occur in younger persons (predominately male) and high and low-energy fractures occur in older persons (predominately female), and age (e.g. older women with osteoporosis) and sex (e.g. young males) are known risk factors for distal radius fracture in adults. Acute distal radius fracture results in pain, limitations in function, stress, and the potential inability to work, and the time to return to normal function after appropriate treatment can be prolonged and, in some cases, never return to normal. The aim of treatment is pain relief and return of function while weighing the risks and benefits of nonoperative and operative treatment, and therefore an open shared decision-making process should be undertaken that includes available treatments and their respective risks and benefits in the setting of the values and preferences of the individual patient; adoption of technology and novel treatments requires evidentiary support of efficacy and effectiveness while acknowledging cost and value.

Major Surgery

After propensity score matching and adjustment for treatment, at 12 months after treatment, patients with personal injury claims had more pain with loading than those without such a claim (36 ± 29 versus 27 ± 27, adjusted mean difference 9 [95% CI 4 to 15]; p = 0.002) (Fig. 6 A). Additionally, patients with personal injury claims had a worse hand function than those without a claim (66 ± 28 versus 76 ± 26, adjusted mean difference -9 [95% CI -15 to -4]; p = 0.001) (Fig. 6 B). Fifty-five percent (71 of 129) and 59% (76 of 129) of personal injury claim patients reached the MIC of VAS pain and function, respectively (Table 4). Among employed patients, the median time to return to work was 12 weeks for patients with a claim and 8 weeks for matched patients (Fig. 7). After propensity score matching and adjusting for symptom duration, VAS function, and treatment, we found that patients with personal injury claims had a 45% lower probability of returning to work each week than those without a claim (HR 0.55 [95% CI 0.42 to 0.73]; p < 0.001) (Fig. 7).

### Common complications of distal radial fractures [^003c4103]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Distal radial fractures are associated with good outcomes; however, although they occur at low rates, complications can significantly impair treatment success. Therefore, the treating surgeon should be aware of potential complications associated with each treatment type and how to best prevent them. Although certain patient-specific and fracture-specific factors may increase the risk of adverse outcomes, most are nonmodifiable risk factors at the time of presentation, so it is imperative that every effort is made to mitigate these risk factors to prevent long-term morbidity. Patients should be well-informed about these complications and potential symptoms so that they can be addressed expeditiously.

Methods

Systematic Review

Search strategy and study selection

This review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. This systematic review has been registered in the PROSPERO database (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016050877). The following databases were searched: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and SportDiscus on September 13, 2016, and repeated on January 3, 2020 (refer tofor search strategy).

Included, full-text articles were: (1) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing different postoperative splinting protocols in DWG excision patients; or (2) any other RCT, observational study, or case series specifying a postoperative care protocol for DWG excision patients. Articles were excluded if they demonstrated any of the following: an entirely pediatric population, nonsurgically managed DWG, case studies, and non-English articles. All outcomes were considered, including grip strength, range of motion, pain, quality of life, and recurrence rates.

Data abstraction and collection

Studies were screened by 3 independent reviewers (A.C.H. M.K. and C.R.W.). Reviewers conducted a pilot screen of the titles and abstracts of the first 50 articles to practice applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once consistency was established, title and abstract screening was completed and authors proceeded with full-text review of the identified studies. In the case of disagreement, the senior author (M.C.M.) was consulted. Interrater agreement for both review phases was calculated using an unweighted kappa statistic. Data were extracted using a predefined, standardized data collection instrument. Extracted data included demographic information, the type of surgical intervention, the postoperative protocol, follow-up duration, and any reported outcomes. The updated review was performed by 2 independent reviewers (C.R.W. and M.H.M.).

Risk of bias assessment

Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed individually by 2 reviewers (C.R.W. and M.H.M.). Disagreements were resolved through discussion until consensus was achieved, and consultation with an arbitrator (M.C.M.), if needed. Included studies that were nonrandomized were evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) scale, and randomized studies were evaluated using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool.
