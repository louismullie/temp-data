## Question

How is flat foot diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how flat foot (pes planus) is diagnosed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key elements of history and risk factors. Then, the focused physical examination in weight-bearing and non–weight-bearing. Next, I will delineate the core maneuvers that distinguish flexible from rigid flatfoot and classify accordingly. After that, I should decide when imaging is indicated and which modalities to choose. I will then consider functional and biomechanical assessments, special population nuances, and the evidence around orthoses and conservative versus surgical pathways, concluding with a succinct diagnostic algorithm that links each step to management implications.

> Let me first confirm the critical pieces of the history because they anchor pretest probability: age at onset (congenital versus acquired), symptom burden (pain, fatigue, gait issues, ankle instability, medial callus), growth and neurodevelopmental history, and activity level changes that may unmask symptoms, while also checking modifiable factors like obesity that track with higher prevalence of flatfoot, especially in younger age groups and males, and considering family history or risks for tarsal coalition or neurogenic etiologies that would shift me toward a rigid process [^notfound] [^115VJ6tn] [^115hdihQ] [^114keitA] [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify my examination sequence so I don't miss positional findings: I need to observe the medial longitudinal arch, hindfoot alignment, and midfoot abduction in relaxed bipedal stance and then in non–weight-bearing, correlate with gait, and inspect footwear for asymmetric or accelerated wear that suggests biomechanical overload, being mindful that footwear inspection is an established part of comprehensive foot assessment even if derived from broader foot-health guidance, which still applies at the point of care [^117J8ebL] [^114keitA] [^116pUqui] [^116oYxVf].

> Hold on, I should verify the distinguishing maneuvers because management hinges on flexible versus rigid categorization: during the double-limb heel rise or Jack test, a flexible flatfoot will recreate the arch with correction of hindfoot valgus, whereas a rigid flatfoot will not, and I should double-check subtalar inversion–eversion range prone to confirm rigidity if suspected; I can also test correctability of forefoot adduction and measure the thigh–foot angle to identify rotational contributors so I don't over-attribute arch loss to a single plane deformity — wait, I almost called the maneuver only a "tip-toe test"; to be precise, the Jack test and heel-rise maneuver are the critical dynamic assessments that restore the arch in flexible deformity [^117J8ebL] [^114keitA] [^116DcMSx].

> Let me consider classification and immediate implications: if the arch is present in non–weight-bearing or reappears with heel rise and the child is asymptomatic, observation and reassurance are appropriate because most physiologic flexible flatfeet improve by age 6–7, whereas a rigid flatfoot, or any flatfoot with pain, asymmetry, progression, or functional limitation, warrants further evaluation for underlying pathology such as tarsal coalition or congenital vertical talus and early referral as needed [^115VJ6tn] [^1148tSqv] [^116DcMSx].

> I should confirm when radiographs are truly indicated so I avoid unnecessary imaging: typical flexible, asymptomatic cases do not need imaging, but painful, rigid, severe, or progressive deformities — or preoperative planning — justify weight-bearing foot radiographs, where I will assess lateral calcaneal pitch, talar–first metatarsal (Meary) angle, and talocalcaneal relationships, and on AP views evaluate forefoot abduction and talonavicular coverage, recognizing that some measurements have better interobserver reliability than others, with calcaneal pitch and Meary angle generally more reproducible [^114keitA] [^116nDcc3].

> Next, I should review advanced imaging pathways: if I suspect a coalition or soft-tissue pathology, MRI is more sensitive for cartilaginous coalitions and tibialis posterior tendon or spring ligament abnormalities, while CT better delineates bony anatomy for osseous coalitions and complex deformity; in infants, where ossification is incomplete, ultrasound can visualize cartilaginous tarsal structures dynamically; in complex or multiplanar deformities, weight-bearing cone-beam CT can quantify 3D alignment under physiologic load to refine surgical planning [^114keitA] [^112gfFSk] [^1127zDJK] [^1144FbLR].

> I will now examine whether functional and biomechanical assessments add value beyond the clinic: plantar pressure analysis can document increased midfoot contact area and load transfer typical of flatfoot phenotypes, while postural stability testing using ground reaction force thresholds may detect subtle balance deficits with thresholds below 15 N particularly sensitive under eyes-open conditions; these tools are optional clinically but can aid research, longitudinal tracking, or complex surgical decision-making [^113sdDA6] [^111Pnx9E].

> But wait, what if the patient is not a typical child with a flexible variant; I need to ensure I tailor to special populations: in most children, flexible flatfoot is a benign developmental variant and observation suffices, yet adolescents with stiffness or pain deserve coalition workup; adults with acquired flatfoot commonly have posterior tibial tendon dysfunction and benefit from tendon-focused clinical and MRI evaluation, and in people with diabetes, a thorough neurovascular examination is indispensable even if pes planus is incidental, because neuropathy and vascular disease change risk stratification and follow-up frequency [^115VJ6tn] [^114keitA] [^111hXX4E] [^114Nu7UU] [^116Yh48k] [^112JJ7BX].

> I should double-check the evidence basis for orthoses and conservative measures so I don't overpromise: high-quality evidence for orthoses altering the natural history or foot shape in pediatric flexible flatfoot is limited, though orthoses may relieve pain in symptomatic cases, and overall systematic reviews and critical appraisals advise cautious, symptom-driven use rather than routine prescription in asymptomatic children, with physical therapy and activity modification considered when pain or fatigue are present [^116wPQBh] [^115g5UsQ] [^115VJ6tn].

> Let me reconsider imaging thresholds one more time so I don't miss a coalition: if heel-rise fails to restore the arch or subtalar motion is limited, that is my cue for weight-bearing radiographs first and then MRI or CT depending on whether I suspect cartilaginous versus osseous coalition, keeping in mind that timely identification in the stiff, painful adolescent foot changes management and prognosis [^114keitA].

> To summarize my diagnostic algorithm and check for internal consistency: history focused on onset, symptoms, risks, and activity → examination in weight-bearing and non–weight-bearing with gait and footwear assessment → Jack test and subtalar motion to distinguish flexible from rigid → if flexible and asymptomatic, observe; if painful, rigid, asymmetric, or progressive, obtain weight-bearing radiographs → escalate to MRI or CT when coalition or soft-tissue pathology is suspected → optionally add plantar pressure or stability testing for complex cases → align management to classification, symptoms, and patient context, ensuring pediatric reassurance versus targeted workup of rigid or adult acquired forms is consistently applied [^115VJ6tn] [^1148tSqv] [^114keitA].

Flat foot diagnosis is based on a **clinical assessment** that distinguishes flexible from rigid deformity, with flexible flatfoot showing arch restoration on tiptoe or non-weight-bearing and rigid flatfoot lacking arch in all positions [^116DcMSx]. Key clinical tests include the **tiptoe test** and Jack's test, and radiographs are used to confirm diagnosis and assess severity, with MRI or CT reserved for suspected tarsal coalition or posterior tibial tendon dysfunction [^114keitA]. Most pediatric flexible flatfoot is benign and requires no treatment, while symptomatic or rigid cases need further evaluation and management [^1148tSqv] [^116wPQBh].

---

## Clinical assessment

### History

History should document **age of onset** (congenital vs. acquired), **symptom profile** (pain, fatigue, functional limitations, and shoe wear patterns), family history suggesting genetic predisposition, and review **relevant medical comorbidities**, including neurological, rheumatological, or musculoskeletal conditions [^115hdihQ].

---

### Physical examination

- **Inspection**: Medial longitudinal arch, hindfoot valgus, forefoot abduction, calluses, shoe wear patterns [^115VJ6tn].
- **Palpation**: Tenderness, swelling, warmth, crepitus.
- **Range of motion**: Subtalar and midfoot joints [^116DcMSx].
- **Neurological assessment**: Sensation, reflexes, muscle strength [^1173x75F].

---

### Clinical tests

- **Tiptoe test**: Arch restoration indicates flexible flatfoot; absence indicates rigid flatfoot [^117J8ebL].
- **Jack's test**: Passive dorsiflexion of the hallux restores arch in flexible flatfoot [^115VJ6tn].
- **Heel rise test**: Hindfoot inversion on heel rise indicates flexible flatfoot; absence indicates rigid flatfoot [^114keitA].

## Imaging modalities

### Radiographs

Radiographs are the **primary imaging modality** [^116nDcc3] for flatfoot diagnosis and severity assessment [^114keitA]. Key radiographic parameters include:

| **Radiographic parameter** | **Normal range** | **Flatfoot findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Calcaneal pitch angle | 20–30° | Decreased |
| Meary's angle (talo-first metatarsal angle) | 0° | Increased |
| Talonavicular coverage angle | < 7° | Increased |
| Hindfoot alignment angle | 0–5° | Increased valgus |

---

### Advanced imaging

MRI evaluates soft tissue structures — including **posterior tibial tendon dysfunction** — and tarsal coalition [^114keitA]. CT delineates detailed bony anatomy for tarsal coalition and complex deformities [^1144FbLR]. Ultrasound is useful in infants and young children to assess cartilaginous structures [^1127zDJK].

---

## Classification systems

Classification considers flexibility (**flexible** vs. **rigid**), etiology (congenital vs. acquired), and severity (mild, moderate, or severe), with severity graded based on combined clinical and radiographic findings [^1113taLp].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Tarsal coalition**: Rigid flatfoot, often presenting in adolescence [^114keitA].
- **Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction**: Adult-acquired flatfoot [^111hXX4E].
- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy [^116DcMSx].
- **Inflammatory arthritis**: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis [^1173x75F].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

For pediatric flexible flatfoot, asymptomatic cases warrant **observation and reassurance**, while symptomatic cases may benefit from orthotics or physical therapy [^116wPQBh]. Adult-acquired flatfoot should be diagnosed early and treated with **conservative management** initially [^114Nu7UU], with surgical intervention reserved for advanced cases [^116yrWWh]. Rigid flatfoot warrants further evaluation and referral to a specialist [^114keitA].

---

Flat foot diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment**, **imaging**, and **classification systems**. Most pediatric cases are benign, while symptomatic or rigid cases require further evaluation and management [^115VJ6tn].

### What's new in pediatric flatfoot [^1148tSqv]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2016). Low credibility.

Children with flatfeet are frequently referred to pediatric orthopedic clinics. Most of these patients are asymptomatic and require no treatment. Care must be taken to differentiate patients with flexible flatfeet from those with rigid deformity that may have underlying pathology and require treatment. Rigid flatfeet in infants may be attributable to a congenital vertical talus (CVT), whereas those in older children and adolescents may be due to an underlying tarsal coalition. We performed a review of the recent literature regarding evaluation and management of pediatric flatfeet to discuss new findings and suggest areas where further research is needed.

- **Methods**: We searched the PubMed database for all papers related to the treatment of pediatric flatfoot, tarsal coalition, and CVT published from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014, yielding 85 English-language papers.

- **Results**: A total of 18 papers contributed new or interesting findings.

- **Conclusions**: The pediatric flexible flatfoot (FFF) remains poorly defined, making the understanding, study, and treatment of the condition extremely difficult. Pediatric FFF is often unnecessarily treated. There is very little evidence for the efficacy of nonsurgical intervention to affect the shape of the foot or to influence potential long-term disability for children with FFF. The treatment of tarsal coalition remains challenging, but short-term and intermediate-term outcome studies are satisfactory, whereas long-term outcome studies are lacking. Management of the associated flatfoot deformity may be as important as…

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of pediatric foot and ankle pain [^117J8ebL]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

- **Special tests**: Evaluation of pediatric foot and ankle pain involves several specific tests.
	1. **Tests for rigid or flexible flat feet**: Observe the patient's medial longitudinal arch while they are standing, standing on their toes, and sitting. The presence of an arch when on one's toes or sitting, and its absence when standing, suggests flexible flat feet. Conversely, the absence of an arch in all positions indicates rigid flat feet.

	2. **Thigh-foot angle**: This is a measure of tibial torsion. The patient is positioned prone with the knee flexed to 90° and the foot in a relaxed state. The angle between the axis of the thigh and foot is measured. Typically, the thigh-foot angle rotates laterally with increasing age, with the upper limit for normal being 30°. Negative values are common in infants, while deviations beyond the normal range are referred to as medial (internal) tibial torsion for negative values and lateral (external) tibial torsion for positive ones.

	3. **Forefoot adduction correction test**: Conducted while the patient is supine or prone, the test observes the lateral border of the foot, which is usually straight. If forefoot adduction can be corrected to neutral or beyond with abduction, it is deemed "correctable". If it is "fixed", orthopedic intervention and casting may be necessary.

	4. **Anterior drawer and talar tilt tests for lateral ankle sprains**: The anterior drawer test evaluates the stability of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), while the talar tilt test assesses the stability of the calcaneofibular (CFL) ligament. Although a small amount of movement is normal, pain, a soft endpoint, and a noticeable difference from side to side indicate ligament injury. For the anterior drawer test, the ankle should be relaxed in a neutral or slightly plantar flexed position. The tibia and fibula are stabilized with one hand while the other hand performs the test.

### Evaluation and management of adolescents with a stiff flatfoot [^114keitA]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

While flatfeet are normal in children, persistence into adolescence with associated pain or asymmetry warrants additional evaluation. Rigidity of a flatfoot deformity, whether as a clinical report or evident on examination, should raise suspicion for pathology. The differential diagnosis includes tarsal coalition, neurogenic planovalgus, and peroneal spasticity. History must include pointed inquiry into birth and neurologic histories to probe for a source of central spasticity.

Examination must include standing assessment of hindfoot and midfoot alignment. Hindfoot rigidity may be assessed by the double limb heel rise test and manual examination. Radiographs should include standing ankle (anterior-posterior and mortise) and whole foot (anterior-posterior, external rotation oblique, and lateral) images. Magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive for identifying coalitions and better characterizes adjacent cartilage, subchondral edema, and tendon pathology, whereas CT better characterizes the anatomy of a bony coalition.

Conservative treatments are pathology-dependent and play a more prominent role in neurogenic or peroneal spastic flatfoot. Surgical management of coalitions is centered on coalition resection coupled with arthrodesis in the case of a talocalcaneal coalition with a dysplastic subtalar joint; concomitant planovalgus reconstruction is considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Interobserver reliability in the radiological evaluation of flatfoot (pes planus) deformity: A cross-sectional study [^116nDcc3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

This study was designed to analyze the interobserver reliability in diagnosing flatfoot. It aims to evaluate the interobserver reliability of digital radiography for patients with flatfoot. Eight parameters were assessed in digital X-rays, which were statistically analyzed in two groups. The study group included 34 patients, divided into two groups assessed by four medical specialists: two orthopedists and two radiologists. The orthopedists conducted measurements on X-ray views, focusing on the calcaneal pitch (CP), defined as the CP floor; calcaneus-1 metatarsal angle; calcaneus-5 metatarsal angle; longitudinal arch angles (LAAs), both medial and lateral; Tomeno-Meary angle (TMA); and anteroposterior and lateral CYMA line.

The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis was performed to determine reliability. Fleiss Kappa and Kappa analyses were used to investigate the qualitative data reliability between two observers. ICCs were high for the CP floor, calcaneus-1 metatarsal angle, calcaneus-5 metatarsal angle, and TMA. However, ICCs for LAA-medial and LAA-lateral were not as high as the other measurements. For the CYMA line, in the anteroposterior and lateral views, the Kappa value was 0.140 for right feet in the quadruple group (p = .045; .458; and .314) and 0.197 for left feet in the same group (p = .005; .146; .377). ICCs were excellent for CP angles and TMA across all groups. However, the LAAs, both medial and lateral longitudinal arch angles, did not achieve high ICCs. The CYMA line showed significant p-values in the quadruple group but not among orthopedists and radiologists.

### Paediatric flat foot and foot dimension in Central Anatolia [^114Xw9oU]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine the foot sizes and foot structures of children living in Central Anatolia. The foot structures of children aged 6–10 years were shown to differ according to sex and increasing age. Age, gender, and body weight were associated with foot dimensions and pes planus diagnosis. According to the classification made with the Staheli arch index, 63.3% of the children were identified with pes planus, 9.8% with pes cavus, and 27.7% with normal arch structure. The results of the study may serve as an important resource for shoe designers concerning child foot health.

### The efficacy of nonsurgical interventions for pediatric flexible flat foot: a critical review [^115g5UsQ]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

The pediatric flat foot frequently presents as a common parental concern in the healthcare setting. Foot orthoses are often used, yet their benefits are uncertain and disputed, having been variably investigated. A recent Cochrane review cites limited evidence for nonsurgical interventions. This critical and structured review evaluates the effect of pediatric foot orthoses from an assessment of the literature.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of the following electronic databases was conducted: Medline, CINAHL, AMED, and SPORTDiscus, using an array of search terms. A further search was also performed on relevant reference listings. Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed journal articles, a publication date from 1970 onwards, and English language. Exclusion criteria were surgical interventions, adult subjects, rigid flat foot, and articles based on opinion. A structured Quality Index was used to evaluate the research quality of articles. Three reviewers independently assessed the studies, with disputes resolved by majority consensus. Studies were then grouped according to the outcome measures used.

- **Results**: Thirteen articles, from an initial 429, met the criteria for quality evaluation. The mean Quality Index score was 35% (range: 13% to 81%), indicative of generally poor and varying methodological quality.

- **Conclusions**: The low quality of the studies negates definitive conclusions. Only 3 out of 13 quality evaluations scored above 50%; hence, evidence for the efficacy of nonsurgical interventions for flexible pediatric flat feet is very limited. Future research needs validated foot type assessments.

### Do we screen, examine or assess to identify the "at-risk" foot in diabetes-time for agreed terms and definitions [^116Eu7kn]. Diabetic medicine (2023). High credibility.

The identification of the "at-risk" foot in diabetes is crucial for preventing severe complications. Using consistent terminology is key to effective communication and intervention in diabetic foot management. Standardizing the terms "screen", "examine", and "assess" can help ensure that healthcare providers and patients have a clear understanding of the risk factors involved. Strategizing a unified approach could enhance early detection and treatment outcomes in diabetic foot care.

### Prevalence of flat foot in preschool-aged children [^116pUqui]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Our aim with this study was to establish the prevalence of flat foot in a population of 3- to 6-year-old children to evaluate cofactors such as age, weight, and gender, and to estimate the number of unnecessary treatments performed.

- **Methods**: A total of 835 children (411 girls and 424 boys) were included in this study. The clinical diagnosis of flat foot was based on a valgus position of the heel and a poor formation of the arch. The feet of the children were scanned (while they were in a standing position) using a laser surface scanner, and the rearfoot angle was measured. The rearfoot angle was defined as the angle of the upper Achilles tendon and the distal extension of the rearfoot.

- **Results**: The prevalence of flexible flat foot in the group of 3- to 6-year-old children was 44%, while the prevalence of pathological flat foot was less than 1%. Ten percent of the children were wearing arch supports. The prevalence of flat foot decreased significantly with age: in the group of 3-year-old children, 54% showed flat foot, whereas in the group of 6-year-old children, only 24% had flat foot. The average rearfoot angle was 5.5 degrees of valgus. Boys had a significantly greater tendency for flat foot than girls: the prevalence of flat foot in boys was 52%, compared to 36% in girls. Thirteen percent of the children were overweight or obese, and significant differences in the prevalence of flat foot were observed between overweight, obese, and normal-weight children.

- **Conclusions**: This study is the first to use a three-dimensional laser surface scanner to measure the rearfoot valgus in preschool-aged children. The data demonstrate significant age-related and weight-related variations in flat foot prevalence.

### Pediatric pes planus: A state-of-the-art review [^115VJ6tn]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Flatfoot (pes planus) is common in infants and children and often resolves by adolescence. Thus, flatfoot is described as physiologic because it is usually flexible, painless, and of no functional consequence. In rare instances, flatfoot can become painful or rigid, which may be a sign of underlying foot pathology, including arthritis or tarsal coalition. Despite its prevalence, there is no standard definition for pediatric flatfoot. Furthermore, there are no large, prospective studies that compare the natural history of idiopathic, flexible flat feet throughout development in response to various treatments. The available literature does not elucidate which patients are at risk for developing pain and disability as young adults. Evidence suggests that it is safe and appropriate to simply observe an asymptomatic child with flat feet. Painful flexible flatfoot may benefit from orthopedic intervention, such as physical therapy, bracing, or even a surgical procedure. Orthotics, although generally unproven to alter the course of flexible flatfoot, may provide relief of pain when present.

- **Surgical procedures**: Include Achilles tendon lengthening, bone-cutting procedures that rearrange the alignment of the foot (osteotomies), fusion of joints (arthrodesis), or insertion of a silicone or metal cap into the sinus tarsi to establish a medial foot arch (arthroereisis). It is important for a general pediatrician to know when a referral to an orthopedic specialist is indicated and which treatments may be offered to the patient.

### pGALS - Paediatric gait arms legs and spine: A simple examination of the musculoskeletal system [^116DcMSx]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Knock knees (genu valgus) are common and are often associated with in-toeing, which is maximal at approximately 4 years of age, and most resolve by the age of 7 years. Flat feet are common, as most children have a flexible foot with a normal arch on tiptoeing; this condition typically resolves by 6 years. Crooked toes usually resolve with weight bearing.

- **Normal variants: Indications for referral**:
	- Persistent changes (beyond the expected age ranges)
	- Progressive or asymmetrical changes
	- Short stature or dysmorphic features
	- Painful changes with functional limitation
	- Regression or delayed motor milestones
	- Abnormal joint examination elsewhere
	- Suggestion of neurological disease or developmental delay

Joint abnormalities can be subtle or difficult to appreciate in young children, especially with 'chubby' ankles, fingers, wrists, and knees. Looking for asymmetrical changes is helpful; however, it can be falsely reassuring if symmetrical joint involvement is present. Muscle wasting, such as of the quadriceps or calf muscles, indicates chronicity of joint disease (knee or ankle respectively). Increased symmetrical calf muscle bulk is associated with types of muscular dystrophy. Proximal myopathies may be suggested by delayed milestones, such as walking later than 18 months or an inability to jump in a school-aged child.

Ranges of joint movement should be symmetrical, and an understanding of the 'normal' range of movement in childhood can be gained with increased clinical experience. Hypermobility may be generalised or limited to peripheral joints, such as hands and feet, and generally spea

### Prevalence and clinical factors associated with pes planus among children and adults: A population-based synthesis and systematic review [^115hdihQ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Estimates of pes planus ("flatfoot") prevalence vary considerably across studies, and there is uncertainty over which factors are associated with pes planus prevalence. We aimed to systematically review the prevalence and clinical factors associated with flatfoot among children and adults. A search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases, reporting population-based flatfoot prevalence. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of the studies.

Subgroup analysis was conducted to analyze the factors associated with flatfoot prevalence. Frequencies, odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were performed using descriptive analysis and chi-square test accounting for heterogeneity. Any conflict in the data analysis was discussed by all reviewers.

Twelve studies, including 2509 flatfoot cases, were analyzed, with an overall prevalence of 15.6% (n = 16,000). The subgroup analysis indicated that male gender (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15–1.37), age groups 3 to 5 years (OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.78–2.30) and 11 to 17 years (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.64–2.22), Asian race (OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 2.10–2.60), and obesity (OR = 2.62, 95% CI: 2.06–3.32) were significantly more associated with flatfoot (p < .001). Conversely, female gender (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.40–0.48) and White race (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.47–0.57) were less associated with flatfoot (p < .001). Our findings may be valuable for clinical and surgical settings, particularly for those modifiable factors and targeted populations.

### Flexible adult acquired flatfoot deformity: Comparison between weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing measurements using cone-beam computed tomography [^1144FbLR]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2017). Low credibility.

The 3-dimensional nature of adult acquired flatfoot deformity can be challenging to characterize using radiographs. We tested the hypothesis that measurements on weight-bearing (WB) cone-beam computed tomography (CT) images were more useful for demonstrating the severity of the deformity than non-weight-bearing (NWB) measurements.

- **Methods**: We prospectively enrolled 12 men and 8 women (mean age, 52 years; range, 20 to 88 years) with flexible adult acquired flatfoot deformity. The subjects underwent cone-beam CT while standing (WB) and seated (NWB), and images were assessed in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes by 3 independent observers who performed multiple measurements. Intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities were assessed with the Pearson or Spearman correlation and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. Measurements were compared using paired Student t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

- **Results**: We found that overall the measurements had substantial intraobserver and interobserver reliability on both the NWB images (mean ICC, 0.80; range, 0.49 to 0.99) and the WB images (mean ICC, 0.81; range, 0.39 to 0.99). Eighteen of 19 measurements differed between WB and NWB cone-beam CT images, with more pronounced deformities on the WB images. The most reliable measurements, based on intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities and the difference between WB and NWB images, were the medial cuneiform-to-floor distance, which averaged 29 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] = 28 to 31 mm) on the NWB image.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^1173x75F]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommendations for assessment and diagnosis**: In adults, children, and young people with suspected or confirmed inflammatory arthritis (IA), questions regarding foot symptoms should be asked at each visit. If appropriate, a clinical examination of the foot should be undertaken. This examination should include an assessment of disease activity, deformities, foot posture, musculoskeletal function, gait, footwear, range of motion, vascular and neurological status, and skin and nail pathologies. SOR: 1; LOE: B/C; SOA: 92.

- **Rationale**: The strength of recommendation (SOR) is based on evidence from cross-sectional studies and expert consensus. Clinical assessment should be patient-centered and guided by symptoms and concerns. Foot symptoms should prompt a detailed clinical examination involving an assessment of disease activity, including palpation of the foot joints for localized swelling and tenderness. There is weak evidence from cross-sectional studies for the specificity of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint squeeze test to identify synovitis in patients with suspected IA, but the test has been shown to lack sensitivity. Foot posture, deformities, and gait should be visually assessed, while footwear and any existing insoles should be physically examined for wear. Footwear should also be assessed for motion, width and depth, fastening mechanism, and arch support. The overall condition of soft tissues and the range of motion in the ankle, subtalar, midfoot, and MTP joints should be assessed, in addition to the quality of this motion. Skin and toenails should be assessed for pathologies, including skin disease (e.g. psoriasis), callus, wounds, and anhidrosis.

### Foot orthoses and physiotherapy in the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome: Randomised clinical trial [^112aAeUR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of foot orthoses in managing patellofemoral pain syndrome with flat inserts or physiotherapy, as well as to investigate the effectiveness of foot orthoses combined with physiotherapy.

The research was designed as a prospective, single-blind, randomised clinical trial conducted within a community setting in Brisbane, Australia. The participants included 179 individuals (100 women), aged 18 to 40 years, who had a clinical diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome lasting more than six weeks and had not previously received treatment with foot orthoses or physiotherapy in the past 12 months.

The interventions consisted of six weeks of physiotherapist-led treatment using off-the-shelf foot orthoses, flat inserts, or multimodal physiotherapy. This included patellofemoral joint mobilisation, patellar taping, quadriceps muscle retraining, and education, or a combination of foot orthoses and physiotherapy.

Main outcome measures were global improvement, severity of usual and worst pain over the preceding week, anterior knee pain scale, and functional index questionnaire, which were assessed at 6, 12, and 52 weeks.

The results indicated that foot orthoses produced improvement beyond that of flat inserts in the short term, notably at six weeks, with a relative risk reduction of 0.66 and a 99% confidence interval of 0.05 to 1.17 (NNT 4; 99% confidence interval 2 to 51). No significant differences were found between foot orthoses and physiotherapy, or between physiotherapy and the combination of physiotherapy and orthoses. All groups showed clinically meaningful improvements in primary outcomes over 52 weeks.

### Demographic, physical, and radiographic factors associated with functional flatfoot deformity [^113sdDA6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

In one of our previous studies, the occurrence of self-reported flatfoot was associated with self-reported increased age, male gender, Asian and African American races, veteran status, poor health, increased body mass index, callus, bunion, hammertoe, and arthritis. However, we had to rely on survey data to identify these risk factors, and the accuracy of the survey results was unknown. Therefore, we decided to identify the risk factors associated with flatfeet using objectively and more accurately measured data.

A total of 94 patients were enrolled in the present study. The demographic data and physical and radiographic examination results were recorded by the investigators in the clinic. The data were then analyzed to identify the factors unique to flatfoot, measured and defined using a plantar pressure measurement system during natural gait. We learned that a painful tibialis posterior tendon was associated with flatfoot. The calcaneal inclination angle was also decreased in the flatfoot group. The talar declination, intermetatarsal, hallux abductus, and calcaneal cuboid angles, and static calcaneal stance eversion were elevated in the flatfoot group compared with the non-flatfoot group. Systematic evaluation of these associated factors will help in understanding the functional status of the flatfoot deformity.

Patient G

- **Surgery type**: Foot.

- **Date of surgery (patient sex, age)**: January 26, 2016 (female, 61 years).

- **Preoperative diagnosis**: The patient presented with a flat left foot and had undergone surgery in 2014 involving an arthrodesis. Persistent pain was observed, and it was found there was poor fusion of a triple arthrodesis accompanied by tibiotalar arthritis. The surgical plan involved realignment of the hindfoot in addition to a tibiotalar arthrodesis.

- **Surgery**: Osteotomy of the ankle and calcaneus.

- **Previous judgment**: Poor alignment of the hindfoot and previous tibiotalar arthrodesis necessitated further surgery.

- **Surgical details**: A lateral approach was taken with identification and resection of the distal fibula. The arthritic tibiotalar joint was noted with necrotic talus and poorly fused subtalar joint presenting talus valgus and lateral displacement. Temporary fixation was achieved using a Kirschner needle. Osteosynthesis included the removal of the previous arthrodesis of the lateral column. Lateral calcaneal exostectomy was performed, and proper posterior apposition of the lateral arthrodesis plate (Arthrex) was achieved. Fixation to the proximal cortex and arthrodesis fixation was secured with two screws. Tibiotalocalcaneal compression planters and the fixation of the lateral plate to proximal and distal sites were completed.

- **3D utility**: The printed model (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 3B) was instrumental in precisely defining the location of the malformation. The virtual simulation of the surgery significantly decreased the overall surgery time. Moreover, given the complexity of the procedure, the 3D model facilitated the convergence of different professional viewpoints regarding the optimal surgical approach.

### The sensitivity of thresholds by ground reaction force and postural stability in subjects with and without navicular drop [^111Pnx9E]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding plantar pressure changes is an important component of the functional evaluation of subjects with flat foot. However, the altered postural control determined by the threshold from the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) requires clarification. The purpose of our study was to investigate the various GRF thresholds in subjects with and without flat foot during one-leg standing. We included 34 control subjects and 30 subjects with flat foot in the present study. They performed the one-leg standing test for 30 seconds, with the contralateral hip and knee flexed approximately 90°.

- **GRF thresholds sensitivity**: The sensitivity of the various GRF thresholds (3, 7, 15, 50, and 100 N) for the postural stability index was analyzed with and without visual input. The standing times for the control and flat foot groups were 23.76 ± 4.42 and 21.78 ± 6.59 seconds, respectively, with no significant differences (t = 1.23; p = .22). The two groups demonstrated a significant interaction between the visual condition and the threshold levels (F = 11.40; p = .001).

The postural stability index was significantly different in the eyes-open condition (0.95 ± 0.08 for the control group versus 0.84 ± 0.23 for the flat foot group; t = 2.29; p = .02). However, no difference was found in the eyes-closed condition (0.94 ± 0.10 for the control group versus 0.81 ± 0.30 for the flat foot group; t = 1.45; p = .15). These results indicate that GRF thresholds less than the 15N setting are sensitive to detect postural stability between groups, especially in the eyes-open condition. The GRF threshold setting, in addition to the visual condition, could alter the results significantly.

### An investigation into the aetiology of flexible flat feet: The role of subtalar joint morphology [^115pLW7g]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2016). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that flexible flatfoot (FF) can lead to symptoms and impairment in health-related quality of life. As such, we undertook an observational study investigating the aetiology of this condition to help inform management. The hypothesis was that, alongside increased body mass index (BMI) and increased flexibility of the lower limb, an absent anterior subtalar articulation would be associated with a flatter foot posture.

A total of 84 children aged between eight and 15 years old were prospectively recruited. The BMI for each child was calculated, flexibility was assessed using the lower limb assessment scale (LLAS), and foot posture was quantified using the arch height index (AHI). Each child underwent a sagittal T1-weighted MRI scan of at least one foot.

An absent anterior subtalar articulation (p < 0.001) and increased LLAS (p = 0.001) predicted a low AHI. BMI was not a significant predictive factor (p = 0.566).

This is the first study to demonstrate the importance of the morphology of the subtalar joint on the underlying foot posture in vivo. Flexibility of the lower limb and absence of the anterior facet of the subtalar joint are associated with flexible FF and may influence management of this common condition.

### Investigations of potential phenotypes of foot osteoarthritis: Cross-sectional analysis from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^116ja3Ye]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

The identification of a subgroup with isolated first MTP joint involvement, frequently occurring in isolation, is suggestive that some individuals have a specific predilection for the development of OA in this joint. This could possibly result from altered foot structure or inappropriate footwear. Indeed, cross-sectional studies have reported characteristic variations of skeletal morphology in two conditions commonly associated with first MTP joint OA: hallux valgus and hallux rigidus. Although we found no significant differences in the prevalence of hallux valgus between the three subgroups, the role of other structural characteristics, such as variation in metatarsal length, cannot be discounted.

Although non-statistically significant, there was a slight increase in the probability that individuals had worn high- or very high–heeled shoes between the ages of 20 and 49 years. This is consistent with a previous study that found high-heeled footwear to be associated specifically with disorders of the forefoot and toes. However, while the proportion reporting they had worn narrow-toed footwear was higher in the isolated first MTP joint OA than in the no or minimal foot OA subgroup, it was lowest in the polyarticular foot OA subgroup.

While multiple joint involvement and symmetry were observed in both the isolated first MTP joint and polyarticular foot OA subgroups, those in the polyarticular foot OA subgroup had wider joint involvement, which also included the first MTP joint. This is suggestive of a stronger influence of systemic risk factors and could be indicative of a generalized form of OA.

### Adult acquired flatfoot deformity [^111hXX4E]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

Adult acquired flatfoot deformity (AAFD) is a condition commonly seen by orthopaedic surgeons. Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction is thought to be the initial pathoanatomic etiology that leads to this deformity. Successful resolution of the pain associated with AAFD can be achievable with nonsurgical methods. Patients who continue to have pain or functional limitations despite nonsurgical treatment can find improvement with appropriately selected surgical interventions.

- **New advances in treatment**: This article addresses new advances in treatment based on the stage of AAFD and identifies areas of continued development with a focus on surgical management. The literature continues to evolve, as demonstrated by a recent update regarding the nomenclature and treatment of this condition to progressive collapsing flatfoot deformity.

- **Future research goals**: Future goals of research include understanding the natural history of the disease, from asymptomatic to symptomatic, and studying a wide array of newer treatments and implants that have not been prospectively evaluated.

### From asymptomatic flatfoot to progressive collapsing foot deformity: Peritalar subluxation is the main driver of symptoms [^1123C92Q]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). Low credibility.

Flatfoot, or pes planus, is a common anatomical variation marked by a reduced or absent longitudinal arch. Although it is often considered benign, the condition can progress to progressive collapsing foot deformity (PCFD), a debilitating pathology. This study aimed to identify imaging biomarkers that distinguish asymptomatic flatfoot from PCFD by comparing 3D measurements among normally aligned feet, asymptomatic flatfeet, and feet with PCFD.

- **Methods**: A prospective, comparative, and controlled study was conducted on 561 feet in 475 subjects: 88 control subjects with 98 normally aligned feet, 66 control subjects with 132 asymptomatic flatfeet, and 321 patients with 331 feet with symptomatic PCFD. Bilateral weight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT) scans were performed, and various 3D measurements were analyzed, focusing on hindfoot valgus (Class A deformity), midfoot and/or forefoot abduction (Class B), arch collapse (Class C), and peritalar subluxation (PTS) (Class D). Statistical analysis, including multivariable nominal regression, was used to identify significant predictors of symptoms.

- **Results**: Progressive increases in Class A, B, and C deformity parameters were observed from normally aligned feet to asymptomatic flatfeet and finally to feet with PCFD. Significant differences in PTS (Class D deformity) were found only in the comparison between the feet with PCFD and the control groups, with reduced joint coverage and increased sinus tarsi coverage, indicating extra-articular impingement. Multivariable analysis identified the minimum sinus tarsi distance as [text continues].

### Foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet [^116wPQBh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Paediatric flat feet are a common presentation in primary care; the reported prevalence approximates 15%. A minority of flat feet can cause pain and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy or consensus for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase up to 1 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 7 August 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, and customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We followed the standard methods recommended by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic, and developmental coordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic presentations.

### Delayed diagnosis of Charcot foot: A systematic review [^117KFvpM]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

This study aims to examine the duration and rate of delayed diagnosis in Charcot foot. We systematically reviewed articles published in Medline, SCOPUS, and the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature to identify articles discussing delayed or misdiagnosis of Charcot foot. Random-effects models were generated to determine the average time from symptom onset to correct diagnosis (diagnostic delay duration) and the proportion of patients misdiagnosed prior to being correctly diagnosed (delayed diagnosis rate). Our search identified 142 articles, 7 of which are included in this review. The review found that 53.2% of cases of Charcot osteoarthropathy experienced a delay in diagnosis (95% CI: 28.9%-77.4%). Overall, the duration of diagnostic delay was determined to be 86.9 days (95% CI: 10.5–162.1). We found that patients with Charcot foot experienced prolonged delays from symptom onset to correct diagnosis, and a majority of patients are misdiagnosed. These delays in diagnosis contribute to worse patient outcomes.

### Adult-acquired flatfoot deformity [^114Nu7UU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Originally known as posterior tibial tendon dysfunction or insufficiency, adult-acquired flatfoot deformity encompasses a wide range of deformities that vary in location, severity, and rate of progression. Establishing a diagnosis as early as possible is crucial in treatment. Prompt early, aggressive nonsurgical management is important; if this approach fails, the patient should strongly consider surgical correction to prevent worsening of the deformity.

In all four stages of deformity, the goal of surgery is to achieve proper alignment and maintain as much flexibility as possible in the foot and ankle complex. However, controversy remains regarding the management of flexible deformities, particularly when they are severe.

### Foot typology, dynamic and static weight distribution, and radiographic changes after subtalar arthroereisis in juvenile symptomatic flexible flat feet [^111xW3S1]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Flexible flatfoot is among the most common skeletal disorders in childhood. This study describes the dynamic and static correction effects of subtalar arthroereisis in adolescents with symptomatic flexible flatfeet compared to normal subjects, as well as the results before and after metal removal. Eighteen adolescents with 25 symptomatic flexible flatfeet were treated surgically with subtalar arthroereisis at a mean age of 12.5 years (range 10–16 years). At follow-up (mean 3.9 years, range 0.4–8 years), patients completed the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society questionnaire, received radiographs, and were examined using dynamic and static pedobarography, in addition to static hindfoot axis examination.

Results were compared to healthy controls (n = 13; 26 feet). Surgically treated feet (n = 25) had better questionnaire results after surgery than before, but lower scores than healthy feet. Radiological parameters improved significantly after surgery. Removal of metal did not influence post-surgical results (follow-up 2.8 years). Surgically treated feet exhibited larger contact areas than normal feet, with a predominance in the midfoot region. The relative maximum force, relative peak pressure, and contact time were higher in the midfoot of treated feet compared to controls. When comparing pedobarography data of treated versus untreated feet of the same patients (subgroup n = 11 feet), no differences were observed. Subtalar arthroereisis was able to effectively treat symptomatic flexible flatfeet in this population. Results improved significantly as evaluated by the questionnaire, radiographs, and dynamic assessments.

### Biomechanical assessment of flexible flatfoot correction: Comparison of techniques in a cadaver model [^114wS9oJ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Options for the surgical correction of acquired flexible flatfoot deformity involve bone and soft-tissue reconstruction. We used an advanced cadaver model to evaluate the ability of key surgical procedures to correct the deformity and resist subsequent loss of correction.

- **Methods**: Stage-IIB flatfoot deformity was created in ten cadaver feet through ligament sectioning and repetitive loading. Six corrective procedures were evaluated: (1) lateral column lengthening, (2) medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy with flexor digitorum longus transfer, (3) Treatment 2 plus lateral column lengthening, (4) Treatment 3 plus "pants-over-vest" spring ligament repair, (5) Treatment 3 plus spring ligament repair with use of the distal posterior tibialis stump, and (6) Treatment 3 plus spring ligament repair with suture and anchor. Correction of metatarsal dorsiflexion and of navicular eversion were quantified initially and periodically during postoperative cyclic loading.

- **Results**: Metatarsal dorsiflexion induced by arch flattening was initially corrected by 5.5° to 10.6°, depending on the procedure. Navicular eversion was initially reduced by 2.1° to 7.7°. The correction afforded by Treatments 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 exceeded that of Treatment 2 initially and throughout postoperative loading. Inclusion of spring ligament repair did not significantly enhance correction.

- **Conclusions**: Under the tested conditions, medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy with flexor digitorum longus tendon transfer was inferior to the other evaluated treatments for stage-IIB deformity.

### Adult flat foot with multiple accessory navicular bones treated surgically: A case report and review of the literature [^114y8ouD]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple accessory navicular bones is an extremely rare condition. To the best of our knowledge, only eight cases across two imaging studies have been published. We report a case of a patient with flat foot with two accessory navicular bones. This patient required surgical intervention, which was successful, with short-term follow-up. We believe this is the first documented case of multiple accessory navicular bones treated surgically in English literature. The incidence of multiple accessory navicular bones might be higher. There is a risk associated with remaining ossicles if not resected or fixed during surgery; therefore, we strongly recommend using not only radiographs but also 3-dimensional computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans to confirm the type of accessory navicular bone before surgery, for both painful accessory navicular bone and flat foot with accessory navicular bone.

### Trends in hospitalization for paediatric flatfoot: An Italian nationwide study from 2001 to 2016 [^114xzkRx]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The data for this study came from the SDO reports filed with the Italian Ministry of Health, covering the period between 2001 and 2016. The SDO publishes all data on each surgical treatment done in Italy. The information in the SDO relates to the patient's characteristics such as age, sex, length of hospital stay, diagnosis, and procedure performed. The Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) publishes national and regional population data every year.

Paediatric flatfoot was determined by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) major primary diagnosis code 734 (Acquired flatfoot) and 754.61 (Congenital pes planus). The analysis focused on patients under 15 years old, with "young" defined as a patient aged between 0 and 14 years according to ISTAT. The principal surgical procedure codes included were:

- **78.58**: Internal fixation of bone without fracture reduction, tarsals and metatarsals
- **81.13**: Subtalar fusion
- **78.48**: Other repair or plastic operations on bone, tarsals and metatarsals
- **81.18**: Subtalar joint arthroereisis

In Italy, the healthcare system is based on the Beveridge model, where the government is responsible for public health. The combination of public and private healthcare is known as private healthcare. The SDO gathers data on the types of reimbursements, whether public or private.

Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. As appropriate, continuous and categorical variables were summarized as the mean and standard deviation or the count.

### Foot orthoses and physiotherapy in the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome: Randomised clinical trial [^114MqXuy]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

The study's objective was to compare the clinical efficacy of foot orthoses in the management of patellofemoral pain syndrome with flat inserts or physiotherapy. It also investigated the effectiveness of combining foot orthoses with physiotherapy.

- **Design**: Prospective, single-blind, randomised clinical trial.

- **Setting**: Single-centre trial within a community setting in Brisbane, Australia.

- **Participants**: 179 participants (100 women) aged 18 to 40 years, with a clinical diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome of greater than six weeks' duration, who had no previous treatment with foot orthoses or physiotherapy in the preceding 12 months.

- **Interventions**: Six weeks of physiotherapist intervention with off-the-shelf foot orthoses, flat inserts, multimodal physiotherapy (patellofemoral joint mobilisation, patellar taping, quadriceps muscle retraining, and education), or foot orthoses plus physiotherapy.

- **Main outcome measures**: Global improvement, severity of usual and worst pain over the preceding week, anterior knee pain scale, and functional index questionnaire measured at 6, 12, and 52 weeks.

Results showed that foot orthoses produced improvement beyond that of flat inserts in the short term, notably at six weeks (relative risk reduction 0.66, 99% confidence interval 0.05 to 1.17; NNT 4, 99% confidence interval 2 to 51). No significant differences were found between foot orthoses and physiotherapy, or between physiotherapy and physiotherapy plus orthoses. All groups demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in primary outcomes over 52 weeks.

The conclusion indicated that while foot orthoses are superior to flat inserts, according…

### Trends in hospitalization for paediatric flatfoot: An Italian nationwide study from 2001 to 2016 [^1162Ycf5]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Pes planus is a common condition in the young population and is frequently encountered in adults. From 2001 to 2016, the rate of hospital admissions in Italy for flatfoot patients under 15 years old increased from 28.97 in 2001 to 142.79 per 100,000 inhabitants. The data harvested from the SDO reported that the most common treatment was the "internal fixation of bone without fracture reduction, tarsals and metatarsals", followed by subtalar fusion and arthroereisis.

Pes planus could be divided clinically into flexible or rigid forms and etiologically into congenital or acquired forms. "Flexible flatfoot" does not have a proper code in ICD-9-CM. As other conditions of flatfoot involve a wide range of topics, the aim of this discussion is focused on the flexible form of flatfoot that constitutes the most common and benign condition. Most hospitalizations to treat flatfoot were performed in subjects from 10 to 14 years old. In this age group, young patients increase their sports activity, leading to an increase in symptomatic forms. Concerning the days of hospitalization, a progressive decrease over the years was found.

### Trends in hospitalization for paediatric flatfoot: An Italian nationwide study from 2001 to 2016 [^117QszmB]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Most cases of flexible flatfoot do not require surgical intervention. The presence of symptoms is the essential consideration in determining whether to treat conservatively or surgically. Symptoms may include pain, fatigue of the foot muscles, quick and frequent shoe breakdown, ankle sprains, and calluses on the medial portion of the foot. Many instances are asymptomatic, and non-invasive treatments, such as casting, orthoses, and modified weight-bearing, are frequently used. However, there is no high-quality evidence that orthotics or surgery can decrease the odds of future problems. The use of orthotics in symptomatic cases is contentious, and there is currently insufficient data to support this approach.

Only a few non-comparative studies have assessed the advantages of orthotics in patients with flexible flatfoot. On the other hand, surgery may be beneficial in children experiencing discomfort, with or without a short Achilles tendon. Procedures may include soft tissue plications, osseous excisions, osteotomies (such as medial cuneiform osteotomy, medial slide calcaneal osteotomy, and lateral column lengthening), tendon lengthening or transfers, arthroereisis, and combinations of these methods. These are used to treat flexible flatfoot caused by constitutional laxity or other acquired conditions like trauma, obesity, tumors, infections, and neurological diseases.

The most interesting finding of this study was the progressive rising trend in operative management for acquired flatfoot. The most frequently performed surgery is arthroereisis of the subtalar joint, which is minimally invasive and carries low surgical risks.

### Comprehensive foot examination and risk assessment: A report of the task force of the foot care interest group of the American Diabetes Association, with endorsement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^116oYxVf]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

A comprehensive inspection of the feet in a well-lit room should always be conducted after the patient has removed shoes and socks. Given that inappropriate footwear and foot deformities commonly contribute to foot ulceration, the shoes should be inspected, prompting the question, "Are these shoes appropriate for these feet?" Examples of inappropriate shoes include those that are excessively worn or too small (too narrow, too short, with a toe box that is too low), potentially causing rubbing, erythema, blisters, or calluses.

- **Dermatological assessment**: The dermatological evaluation should begin with a thorough inspection, including interdigital areas, to identify any ulceration or abnormal erythema. Findings such as calluses (especially if hemorrhagic), nail dystrophy, or paronychia should be documented, with any of these warranting a referral to a specialist or specialty clinic. Differences in skin temperature between one foot and the other, either focal or global, may indicate vascular disease or ulceration and should also prompt referral for specialized foot care.

- **Musculoskeletal assessment**: This assessment should involve evaluating for any gross deformities. Rigid deformities, defined as contractures that cannot be easily manually reduced, are most commonly found in the digits. Common forefoot deformities known to increase plantar pressures are associated with various complications.

### Association between foot type and lower extremity injuries: Systematic literature review with meta-analysis [^113yBKAZ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

The study design involves a systematic literature review with meta-analysis. The objectives are to investigate the association between nonneutral foot types (high arch and flatfoot) and lower extremity and low back injuries, and to identify the most appropriate methods for foot classification.

Methods include a search of five electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, along with Google Scholar and reference lists of included studies to identify relevant articles. The review included comparative cross-sectional, case-control, and prospective studies that reported qualitative/quantitative associations between foot types and lower extremity and back injuries. The quality of the selected studies was evaluated, and data synthesis for the level of association between foot types and injuries was conducted. A random-effects model was used to pool odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) results for meta-analysis.

Results revealed that twenty-nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. A significant association between nonneutral foot types and lower extremity injuries was determined (OR = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11, 1.37; p < 0.001). Foot posture index (OR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.33, 5.02; p < 0.01) and visual/physical examination (OR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.28; p < 0.01) were two assessment methods using distinct foot-type categories that showed a significant association with lower extremity injuries. For foot-assessment methods using a continuous scale, measurements of lateral calcaneal pitch angle (SMD, 1.92; 95% CI: 1.44, 2.39; p < 0.00001).

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112JJ7BX]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetic foot, specifically concerning indications for screening in pediatric patients, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend screening for diabetic neuropathy through a comprehensive foot examination. This includes foot inspection, assessment of foot pulses, pinprick tests, 10-g monofilament sensation tests, testing vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork, and ankle reflex tests. These screenings should be conducted at diagnosis and annually thereafter in young patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

### Variation in diagnosis and management of common foot problems by GPs [^111Goumd]. Family Practice (2001). Low credibility.

There are indications that the diagnosis and management of common foot problems vary widely in general practice.

- **Objectives**: Our aim was to explore the variation in GPs' diagnosis and management of common foot problems and the possible correlation between GPs' characteristics and their competence to diagnose correctly.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional design, 90 GPs in The Netherlands were invited to complete a questionnaire regarding seven vignettes with common foot problems (hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, fasciitis plantaris, tarsal tunnel syndrome, metatarsalgia, corns and calluses, and rheumatoid arthritis), combined with questions covering diagnoses, management options, and some GP characteristics.

- **Results**: A total of 72 GPs responded (80%). They most often diagnosed hallux valgus (79%) and rheumatoid arthritis (86%) correctly, and most often hallux rigidus (37%) and tarsal tunnel syndrome (74%) incorrectly. GP characteristics did not correlate with their competence in diagnosing. The most frequently suggested management was referral to a podiatrist. The referral rate to medical specialists was low, except in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (79%).

- **Conclusions**: More than half of the GPs were competent in diagnosing vignettes of common foot problems. This diagnostic competence showed great variation and was not associated independently with GP characteristics. Educational programmes are recommended. Management showed less variation and often included referral to podiatrists. Further research into the effectiveness of specific treatments for different foot problems is needed.

### So what exactly is progressive collapsing foot deformity [^1113taLp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Low credibility.

Progressive collapsing foot deformity is a new nomenclature coined by a group of expert foot and ankle orthopaedic surgeons who have published numerous articles on adult flatfoot deformities. The consensus statements were released in 2020 due to concerns that traditional terminologies such as "posterior tibial tendon dysfunction", "adult acquired flatfoot deformity", and others could be confusing to physicians and healthcare professionals and do not adequately encompass the deformity. The consensus group also designed a new classification system to simplify the decision-making process that could be reproducible among surgeons.

This article provides an overview of the consensus statements on surgical goals and summarizes some of the newest articles on progressive collapsing foot deformity, including reliability, diagnostic accuracy, and roles of advanced imaging along with soft-tissue reconstruction. Although the new classification system has room for improvement, it offers an option to aid surgeons in approaching this complex 3-dimensional deformity and individualizing treatment for each patient's unique anatomy.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^113hPRMK]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Studies were included if they concerned adults, children, or young people with suspected or confirmed inflammatory arthritis (IA). Recent secondary evidence from 2018 onwards, such as meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and umbrella reviews, were included, as well as primary research: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any design; secondary, post-hoc, and subgroup analyses of individual RCTs, and RCT extension studies. Where RCTs were sparse for interventions or were not relevant, such as for questions related to assessment, diagnosis, referral, or monitoring, non-randomized controlled studies, before-after studies, cohort studies, and case series were included. Additionally, only published conference abstracts of primary or secondary research from 2021 onwards, along with service evaluations and clinical audits, were included. Other study types, including case studies, editorials, commentaries, trial protocols, letters, trials registry records, and study protocols, were excluded, as well as full papers in any language other than English without an English translation. A detailed description of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Supplementary Table S3, available at Rheumatology online.

- **Screening**: One reviewer screened titles, excluding studies that were clearly irrelevant. Abstracts, and then full texts, were screened against eligibility criteria by one reviewer, with 10% double screened by a second reviewer to ensure accuracy. Any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer.

- **Data extraction**: A standardized data extraction form was developed, piloted, and used to collect data.

### Nonoperative care for the treatment of adult-acquired flatfoot deformity [^115NWX4H]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Nonoperative therapy for adult-acquired flatfoot is a reasonable treatment option that is likely to be beneficial for most patients. In this article, we describe the results of a retrospective cohort study that focused on nonoperative measures, including bracing, physical therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications used to treat adult-acquired flatfoot in 64 consecutive patients. The results revealed the incidence of successful nonsurgical treatment to be 87.5% (56 of 64 patients) over the 27-month observation period. Overall, 78.12% of the patients with adult-acquired flatfoot were obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30), and 62.5% of the patients who failed nonsurgical therapy were obese; however, logistic regression failed to show that BMI was statistically significantly associated with the outcome of treatment.

- **Bracing and treatment success**: The use of any form of bracing was statistically significantly associated with successful nonsurgical treatment (fully adjusted OR = 19.8621, 95% CI 1.8774 to 210.134).

- **Split-tear of tibialis posterior**: The presence of a split-tear of the tibialis posterior on magnetic resonance image scans was statistically significantly associated with failed nonsurgical treatment (fully adjusted OR = 0.016, 95% CI 0.0011 to 0.2347).

The results of this investigation indicate that a systematic nonsurgical treatment approach for adult-acquired flatfoot deformity can be successful in most cases.

### Ultrasound evaluation of foot deformities in infants [^1127zDJK]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Foot deformity in infants is the most common congenital musculoskeletal condition. A precise diagnosis can sometimes be impossible to establish clinically. Radiologic imaging plays a major role in the evaluation of musculoskeletal abnormalities. However, conventional imaging techniques, such as plain radiographs of the foot, are of very little help in this age group because of the lack of ossification of the tarsal bones. Ultrasound (US) presents a significant advantage because it permits the visualization of cartilaginous structures. This leads to the detailed assessment of foot deformities in infants. Furthermore, US can also be used as a dynamic imaging modality. Different scanning views are beneficial to evaluate the complete anatomy of the foot; depending on the suspected clinical diagnosis, some planes are more informative to display the pathological features of a specific deformity.

We describe the US findings of five of the most common foot deformities referred to our pediatric orthopedic clinic (clubfoot, simple metatarsus adductus, skewfoot, and oblique and vertical talus). For each deformity, we propose a specific imaging protocol based on US to provide an accurate diagnosis. US is a complementary tool to the clinical examination for determining the diagnosis and the severity of the deformity and also for monitoring the efficacy of treatment. Radiologists investigating foot deformities in infants should consider using US for the detailed assessment of the foot in this age group.

### Investigations of potential phenotypes of foot osteoarthritis: Cross-sectional analysis from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^1134R6nB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). High credibility.

Several methodological strengths and limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings in this article. This analysis included participants recruited from the general population who reported having foot pain in the previous year; therefore, a wide range of foot pain and radiographic severities were present. A standardized radiographic protocol was used to obtain weight‐bearing views, so joint space narrowing (JSN) was appropriately assessed, and multiple planes captured osteoarthritis (OA) features, which have been noted to vary on different views. However, in this analysis, only five joints in each foot were examined. It is possible that other foot joints may be affected by OA and contribute to the patterning and subgroups observed.

Intrarater reliability for the presence of OA was found to be excellent. Despite interrater reliability being moderate, it was comparable with the original atlas. Although the study population had a prevalence of OA in one or more foot joints of 63%, when multiple foot joints were examined, the numbers in some of the combinations were quite small. This is likely to have reduced the statistical power, potentially leading to type II error. Additionally, although all individuals in the study had reported having foot pain in the last year, the latent classes of foot OA were based only on radiographic structural changes. As discordance between symptoms and structural changes is often seen, further investigation characterizing polyarticular foot OA and first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint OA in relation to symptomatic radiographic disease is needed.

### Paediatric flat foot and foot dimension in Central Anatolia [^112ApVAa]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Paediatric pes planus is described as the decreasing of the medial longitudinal arch and has been researched worldwide for years. Pes planus generally has two classifications: flexible and fixed pes planus. Flexible pes planus can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Most symptomatic pes planus causes pain in the feet, problems in the proximal joints, and early fatigue during gait, which decreases the quality of life. Hindfoot can cause the valgus position of a flat foot. Pes planus is common in the paediatric group, and foot arches usually develop with age. Paediatric flexible pes planus is common, affecting around 48 to 77.9% of children.

Pes cavus is defined as an increase in the height of the medial longitudinal arch. The deformity does not correct upon weight bearing. Elevation of the medial longitudinal arch, forefoot pronation, valgus and adduction, and clawing of the toes are typical in this deformity. The hindfoot is in the varus position, and pes cavovarus is the most common cause. The underlying cause of pes cavus is mostly neurological.

When designing shoes for any age group, anthropometric data of that group is of great importance. The use of the correct foot sizes improves one's foot health and comfort. Shoes that do not fit the foot structure used at a young age can lead to permanent foot deformities. However, foot deformities noticed at a young age can be eliminated before reaching the developmental period. Foot measurements can be taken by different methods, such as measuring with a caliper or tape measure, three-dimensional scanning, and photographs.

### The Charcot foot: Pathophysiology, diagnosis and classification [^116HkHzj]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Neuropathic changes in the foot are common with a prevalence of approximately 1%. The diagnosis of neuropathic arthropathy is often delayed in diabetic patients, leading to harmful consequences, including amputation. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment can prevent an extensive treatment program characterized by significant morbidity for the patient, high costs, and delayed surgery. The pathogenesis of a Charcot foot involves repetitive micro-trauma in a foot with impaired sensation and neurovascular changes caused by pathological innervation of the blood vessels. In most cases, changes result from a combination of both pathophysiological factors. The Charcot foot is triggered by a combination of mechanical, vascular, and biological factors, which can lead to late diagnosis, incorrect treatment, and eventual destruction of the foot.

This review aims to raise awareness of the diagnosis of Charcot foot (diabetic neuropathic osteoarthropathy), including the differential diagnosis, erysipelas, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. It also describes the ways in which the diagnosis may be made. Clinical diagnostic pathways based on different classifications are presented.

### Executive summary: The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^114vwGWi]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Recommendations for assessment and diagnosis

- **Assessment**: In adults, children, and young people with suspected or confirmed inflammatory arthritis (IA), questions relating to foot symptoms should be asked at each visit. If appropriate, a clinical examination of the foot should be undertaken, including disease activity, deformities, foot posture, musculoskeletal function, gait assessment, footwear, range of motion, vascular and neurological status, and skin and nail pathologies. The strength of recommendation (SOR) is 1; level of evidence (LOE) is B/C; strength of agreement (SOA) is 92.

- **Rationale**: The SOR is based on cross-sectional studies and expert consensus. Clinical assessment should be patient-centered and guided by symptoms and concerns. Foot symptoms should prompt a detailed assessment of disease activity, including palpation of the foot joints for localized swelling and tenderness. There is weak evidence from cross-sectional studies for the specificity of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint squeeze test to identify synovitis in patients with suspected IA, but the test has been shown to lack sensitivity. Foot posture, deformities, gait, range of motion, skin, toenails, and neurological and vascular status should be assessed, and footwear/insoles physically examined.

In children and young people with IA specifically, age and developmental stage should be considered. Foot joints should be assessed as part of the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score-71 (JADAS-71) and paediatric Gait Arms Legs and SPine (pGALS) screening.

- **Imaging**: Health professionals managing adults, children, and young people with suspected or confirmed IA should have access to appropriate imaging.
