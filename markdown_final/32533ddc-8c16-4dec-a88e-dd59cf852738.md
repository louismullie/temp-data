## Question

Prognosis of tetralogy of fallot

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis of tetralogy of Fallot. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history without surgery to anchor the magnitude of benefit from repair. Then, I should verify contemporary survival after repair and how it has evolved over time. Next, I will examine long-term morbidity and the biphasic hazard pattern. After that, I need to review risk stratification tools and key predictors of adverse outcomes. I will then consider the impact of surgical strategy, including timing and valve-sparing techniques. I should also assess special populations such as neonates, low-birth-weight infants, and those with genetic syndromes. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based management and surveillance to synthesize a practical, forward-looking prognosis framework.

> Let me first confirm the baseline without repair, because I need to ensure we are not underestimating the disease burden. Untreated tetralogy of Fallot carries dismal survival, with only about 3% surviving to age 40, and death typically results from hypoxemia, cerebrovascular events, and brain abscesses, underscoring why surgical repair fundamentally alters prognosis [^117K8gor] [^112zUi3R].

> Now, I should verify contemporary survival after repair, and I need to be precise about time horizons. In a large multicenter U.S. cohort, transplant-free survival after simple TOF repair was 98.6% at 1 year, 97.8% at 5 years, 97.1% at 10 years, 95.5% at 20 years, and 94.5% at 25 years, with an early peaking hazard shortly after repair and a late-phase hazard that accelerates around 20 years, which establishes a biphasic mortality pattern that I will revisit shortly [^113EreGU]. Wait, let me verify consistency across populations; a Swedish nationwide cohort showed survival rising from 68.5% in the 1970s to 96.0% in the 2010s among surgically treated children, confirming substantial era-related improvement while still noting an approximately 11-fold higher mortality risk versus matched controls, which aligns with the U.S. data on excellent absolute survival but persistent relative excess risk [^116oKZf9] [^115BnwA6]. I should also confirm that 30-year survival approximates 85–90% in contemporary series, which is consistent with imaging-era cohorts and meta-analytic estimates of late mortality around 0.42% per year [^1154ZMLH] [^112scnsK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "cure" after repair; I need to check long-term morbidity because survival is only part of the story. Nearly all repaired patients have residual hemodynamic and electrophysiologic abnormalities, with pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction being nearly universal and driving exercise intolerance, arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death beginning in early adulthood, which mandates lifelong surveillance and often reintervention [^116eoNEV] [^113xTGUM]. Let me verify the hazard shape; the mortality hazard is biphasic with an early steep phase in the first few postoperative years and a late phase that rises slowly and accelerates after about two decades, mirroring the accumulation of RV volume load, ventricular dysfunction, and arrhythmic burden over time [^113EreGU].

> Next, I should review risk stratification, and I need to ensure I integrate both invasive and noninvasive markers. Independent predictors of death include older age at CMR, obesity, transannular patch repair, greater RV end-systolic volume index, and lower biventricular global function index, and a validated risk score stratifies patients into low- versus high-risk groups with 15-year survival of 95% versus 74%, respectively, which is clinically actionable for targeting surveillance and interventions [^114xH8zb] [^113tbYbP]. I should double-check arrhythmic risk markers; atrial tachyarrhythmias, RV hypertrophy, and biventricular dysfunction on CMR predict death and sustained ventricular tachycardia, and QRS fragmentation on ECG provides additional prognostic information, while the incidence of sudden cardiac death approximates 2% per decade and rises steeply after age 45, reinforcing the need for structured electrophysiologic risk assessment in higher-risk adults [^114LSHZk] [^112hnV7q] [^11454W4B] [^114UcvcV].

> I will now examine surgical strategy, because I need to ensure I distinguish the effects of timing and valve preservation. Primary repair between 3 and 6 months is generally reasonable and associated with excellent outcomes, whereas very early neonatal repair may increase complications without clear mortality benefit in many settings, though strategy must be individualized to anatomy and cyanosis severity [^116u7vRY] [^1118rVNY]. Wait, let me verify the neonatal strategy debate; contemporary multicenter data suggest no mortality difference between primary and staged repair in symptomatic neonates, but staged approaches often incur longer lengths of stay and more cumulative interventions, while some analyses note a trend toward more reinterventions with initial palliation, so center expertise and patient factors should guide the choice rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^114R3eAy] [^1116EEJS]. Let me consider valve-sparing techniques; preserving the native pulmonary valve reduces freedom from pulmonary valve replacement at 15 years compared with transannular patch, but may increase the risk of reintervention for residual RVOT obstruction, so the balance depends on annular size and RVOT morphology at the index operation [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient is a neonate with low birth weight or has a genetic syndrome; I should confirm how these modify risk. Weight less than 2.5 kg is a strong risk factor for mortality irrespective of primary versus staged strategy, with reported in-hospital mortality odds ratios around 12.5 in large registries, and prematurity, small or discontinuous pulmonary arteries, and genetic syndromes such as 22q11.2 deletion or trisomy 21 further increase risk and may influence both early and late outcomes, which argues for specialized perioperative planning and long-term surveillance in these subgroups [^111H6vkE] [^116jcTYE]. I should confirm that genetic screening and pre-pregnancy counseling are recommended given the elevated risk of fetal CHD and the prognostic implications of syndromic disease, which is consistent with ACHD guidance [^114T7Dmj].

> Next, I should review functional capacity and imaging surveillance, because I need to ensure we capture early ventricular dysfunction. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrates chronically reduced peak VO2 with a mean around 68% predicted and an average decline of about 1.4% per year in adults, and an elevated VE/VCO2 slope can unmask pulmonary blood flow maldistribution from branch PA stenosis, all of which carry prognostic implications and inform timing of pulmonary valve replacement and other interventions [^1173uwpa]. Hold on, I should verify the role of multimodality imaging; echocardiography, CMR, and CT are complementary, with CMR providing precise RV volumes, regurgitant fractions, and fibrosis assessment that guide decisions on pulmonary valve replacement and arrhythmia risk, and guideline statements endorse periodic imaging by ACHD-experienced teams to detect evolving ventricular dysfunction and valvular disease [^116KJY1J] [^116vqRtz] [^11773Cpm].

> I need to ensure management recommendations align with contemporary guidance, so let me reconsider the thresholds for pulmonary valve replacement and arrhythmia mitigation. For adults with repaired TOF and moderate or greater pulmonary regurgitation, valve replacement is recommended when symptomatic, and it is reasonable in asymptomatic patients with ventricular enlargement or dysfunction to preserve RV function, with both surgical and transcatheter options acceptable depending on anatomy and concomitant lesions [^115foJYX]. For sudden death prevention, primary prevention ICDs should be considered when standard criteria are met, and may be reasonable in selected adults with additional risk factors such as marked RV dilation or dysfunction, sustained ventricular ectopy, or inducible ventricular tachycardia, recognizing that risk models and electrophysiologic testing inform but do not perfectly predict events [^11454W4B] [^1146vwcA].

> Let me synthesize the prognosis succinctly, and I should double-check that I reflect both phases of risk. In the modern era, most patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot survive into adulthood with 25-year survival around 94–95% and 30-year survival approximately 85–90%, yet they face a lifelong burden of pulmonary regurgitation, RV remodeling, arrhythmias, and the need for reintervention, with mortality risk rising again after two decades and remaining higher than the general population, which mandates structured lifelong follow-up and proactive risk modification [^113EreGU] [^1154ZMLH] [^116oKZf9]. Hold on, I should verify that this framing captures the key modifiers; indeed, era of repair, surgical strategy including valve preservation, and patient-specific factors such as low birth weight and genetic syndromes meaningfully influence outcomes, reinforcing the need for individualized care plans anchored in guideline-directed surveillance and timely intervention [^113EreGU] [^116jcTYE] [^113xTGUM].

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) has a **poor prognosis without surgery** [^112vdbAy], with only ~3% surviving to age 40 [^117K8gor] and median survival of 12–19 years [^notfound]. After repair, **early survival exceeds 95%** [^1154ZMLH], but long-term outcomes are limited by pulmonary regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, and the need for reinterventions [^116eoNEV]. Survival to adulthood is now **common** [^113EreGU], yet mortality remains 2–3× that of the general population [^notfound], with a 30-year survival of ~85–90% [^1154ZMLH] and a 20-year freedom from reintervention of ~55% [^notfound]. Lifelong surveillance and timely pulmonary valve replacement are essential to mitigate complications and improve outcomes [^115foJYX].

---

## Natural history and prognosis without surgical intervention

Untreated TOF carries a **grim prognosis** [^112vdbAy]:

- **Infant mortality**: High due to hypoxia, polycythemia, and complications such as brain abscess and stroke [^notfound].
- **Childhood survival**: Only ~50% reach age 6; ~10% reach age 10.
- **Adult survival**: ~3% survive to age 40; median survival is 12–19 years [^117K8gor] [^112zUi3R].

---

## Prognosis after surgical repair

Surgical repair has transformed TOF into a **survivable condition** [^116GKLTG], though it is not curative [^112vdbAy]:

- **Early mortality**: Contemporary early mortality is < 2% [^1154ZMLH].
- **Long-term survival**: 25-year survival ~94.5% [^113EreGU]; 30-year survival ~85–90% [^1154ZMLH].
- **Adult outcomes**: Most patients reach adulthood, but lifelong morbidity persists [^113xTGUM].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **significantly affect outcomes**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Age at repair | Earlier repair improves outcomes; neonatal repair increases complications [^1118rVNY] [^116mb4qb] |
| Surgical technique | Valve-sparing repairs reduce pulmonary regurgitation and RV dysfunction [^117K8gor] [^116mb4qb] |
| Genetic syndromes | 22q11 deletion and trisomy 21 increase mortality and morbidity [^116jcTYE] |
| Residual lesions | Pulmonary regurgitation, RV dysfunction, and arrhythmias worsen prognosis [^116eoNEV] [^114LSHZk] |

---

## Long-term complications and their impact on prognosis

Despite repair, patients face **significant long-term complications**:

- **Pulmonary regurgitation**: Occurs in ~85%, causing RV dilation, dysfunction, and heart failure [^116pwQ7B].
- **Arrhythmias**: Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are common; sudden cardiac death risk is ~2% per decade [^11454W4B] [^114UcvcV].
- **Reinterventions**: ~55% need reintervention within 20 years, most often pulmonary valve replacement [^114femwF].
- **Exercise intolerance**: Reduced aerobic capacity is common and correlates with RV dysfunction [^1173uwpa].

---

## Quality of life and functional outcomes

Quality of life is **generally good** but often limited by physical capacity, arrhythmias, and the need for repeated interventions [^114Bsu7J]. Many adults experience **exercise intolerance** and reduced functional capacity, particularly with significant pulmonary regurgitation or RV dysfunction [^1173uwpa].

---

## Current medical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **lifelong, specialized care**:

- **Follow-up**: Annual cardiology follow-up with periodic imaging (echocardiography, CMR) [^11773Cpm] [^116KJY1J].
- **Pulmonary valve replacement**: Recommended for significant pulmonary regurgitation with symptoms or RV dysfunction [^115foJYX].
- **Arrhythmia management**: ICDs considered for high-risk patients; electrophysiology study for risk stratification [^1146vwcA] [^11454W4B].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances include **improved surgical techniques** (e.g. valve-sparing repairs) [^1151rnYc], transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement [^113A11x6], and enhanced risk stratification with CMR and biomarkers [^1168ti9L]. Future directions focus on **personalized medicine**, earlier intervention, and strategies to reduce reinterventions and arrhythmias [^116eoNEV].

---

Tetralogy of Fallot now has a **favorable prognosis after repair** [^113EreGU], with most patients surviving into adulthood; however, **lifelong morbidity** from pulmonary regurgitation, RV dysfunction, and arrhythmias remains common [^116eoNEV]. Prognosis is shaped by age at repair, surgical technique, genetic factors, and residual lesions, and **lifelong surveillance** with timely interventions is essential to optimize outcomes [^113xTGUM].

### Tetralogy of Fallot [^116GKLTG]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease, and one of the first to be successfully repaired by congenital heart surgeons. Since the first procedures in the 1950s, advances in the diagnosis, perioperative and surgical treatment, and postoperative care have been such that almost all those born with tetralogy of Fallot can now expect to survive to adulthood. The startling improvement in outcomes for babies born with congenital heart disease in general-and for those with tetralogy of Fallot in particular-is one of the success stories of modern medicine. Indeed, in many countries adults with tetralogy of Fallot outnumber children. Consequently, new issues have emerged, ranging from hitherto unpredicted medical complications to issues with training for caregivers and resource allocation for this population of survivors. Therefore, evolution of treatment, recognition of late complications, research on disease mechanisms and therapies-with feedback to changes in care of affected children born nowadays-are templates on which the timely discussion of organisation of care of those affected by congenital heart diseases from the fetus to the elderly can be based. Here, we focus on new developments in the understanding of the causes, diagnosis, early treatment, and late outcomes of tetralogy of Fallot, emphasising the continuum of multidisciplinary care that is necessary for best possible lifelong treatment of the 1% of the population born with congenital heart diseases.

### Long-term management of right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction in repaired tetralogy of Fallot: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116eoNEV]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular outflow dysfunction, manifesting as stenosis, regurgitation, or both, is nearly universal in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot, precipitating a complex pathophysiological cascade that leads to increasing rates of morbidity and mortality with advancing age. As the number of adolescent and adult patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot continues to grow as a result of excellent survival during infancy, the need to improve late outcomes has become an urgent priority. This American Heart Association scientific statement provides an update on the current state of knowledge of the pathophysiology, methods of surveillance, risk stratification, and latest available therapies, including transcatheter and surgical pulmonary valve replacement strategies, as well as management of life-threatening arrhythmias. It reviews emerging evidence on the roles of comorbidities and patient-reported outcomes and their impact on quality of life. In addition, this scientific statement explores contemporary evidence for clinical choices such as transcatheter or surgical pulmonary valve replacement, discusses criteria and options for intervention for failing implanted bioprosthetic pulmonary valves, and considers a new approach to determining optimal timing and indications for pulmonary valve replacement.

### The predicament of surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot [^112vdbAy]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgery for tetralogy of Fallot has a long history, which may be described as both a success story and a failure story. It is a success story because prognosis without surgery is very poor, but surgery makes it possible for affected babies to reach adulthood and lead productive lives. It is a failure story, however, since we still cannot cure this condition; we can only palliate it as illustrated in the sobering long-term outcome of affected patients. In this review article, we aim to explore the reason for this failure. This may be summed up in terms of the nature of the obstruction to the right ventricular outflow tract, which characterizes this malformation and must be relieved. This obstruction has several possible components, but none may be eliminated without harming the ventricle. There seems to be no 'extra' muscle band in tetralogy of Fallot that may be dispensed with without undermining ventricular function; every muscle band that is there should be there, just like in the normal heart, except that these are thicker than normal and somewhat displaced in tetralogy of Fallot, thus narrowing the right ventricular outflow tract. Consequently, ventricular function deteriorates with every muscle band that is cut, just like in the normal heart. We have to harm the heart in order to repair it. Every repaired Fallot is inevitably a damaged heart. Consequently, repair of this condition cannot be curative at present; it is palliative surgery.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot — epidemiology and survival — has an average incidence of 32.6 per 100,000 live births, and in the United States, approximately 4 million live births annually translate to roughly 1,300 new patients each year. Contemporary reports indicate that > 98% of these infants survive surgical repair, usually during the first year of life, and long-term outcomes show a 30-year survival rate of 90%. As a result, the number of patients with repaired TOF increases each year, and in many communities, adult survivors now outnumber infants and children.

Key Points

Question

Have the survival and risk of mortality for congenital cardiac surgery in children with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) in Sweden changed during the past 50 years?

Findings

This cohort study including 1848 patients with TOF noted increased survival, from 68.5% to 96.0%, in children born in the 1970s compared with those born in the 2010s. The risk of mortality associated with congenital cardiac surgery decreased substantially but was 11 times higher than the risk in controls.

Meaning

This study found that, despite marked success in increasing survival over the past 50 years, the overall mortality risk for patients with TOF who undergo congenital cardiac surgery appears to remain higher than in individuals without TOF.

### Does valve-sparing repair improve outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot? A systematic review [^117K8gor]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

More than half of the cases of tetralogy of Fallot are diagnosed antenatally via fetal echocardiography. It can also be diagnosed via a chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, or echocardiogram. Other diagnostic tools include chest radiographs, which may show a 'boot-shaped' heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy and a decreased main pulmonary artery segment. Without surgical intervention, survival rates drop significantly, with only about 3% reaching 40 years of age. Patient death from tetralogy of Fallot is due to hypoxia, cerebrovascular events, and brain abscesses. For patients who survive, adults face complications due to chronic issues, including the hemodynamic consequences of chronic pulmonary regurgitation, pulmonary stenosis, ventricular arrhythmia, and a lifetime of follow-up with cardiologists. There are also conflicting studies that show the effects of chronic cyanosis; studies that report impact cites impaired motor skills, decreased academic achievement, and worsened behavior. When TOF is diagnosed, TOF repair involves closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and relief of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction. The method of RVOT relief varies based on patient-specific anatomy and may include transannular patch (TAP), valve-sparing repair, or other techniques such as infundibular muscle resection or pulmonary valvotomy. These surgical techniques are effective in relieving RVOT obstruction and improving oxygenation, thereby addressing the primary pathophysiology of TOF. With a transannular patch, there are also consequences of increased right ventricular dilatation, arrhythmia, reintervention, and pulmonary valve replacement. Essentially, a transannular patch creates a state of chronic pulmonary regurgitation. Advancements in surgical techniques, including trans-atrial and transpulmonary approaches, have enabled valve-sparing procedures in appropriately selected TOF patients, preserving the native pulmonary valve when feasible.

### Survival to the age of 87 years in a woman with unoperated tetralogy of Fallot [^112zUi3R]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, affecting approximately 2700 infants per year born in the United States. The natural history of the tetralogy reflects the adverse physiologic consequences of the underlying structural abnormalities, with only approximately 3% of uncorrected patients surviving past age 40. In this case report, we report an 87-year-old woman with unoperated tetralogy of Fallot, who we believe to be the oldest and only second octogenarian described in the literature.

### Development and validation of a mortality risk score for repaired tetralogy of Fallot [^114xH8zb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Robust risk assessment is crucial for the growing repaired tetralogy of Fallot population at risk of major adverse clinical outcomes; however, current tools are hindered by lack of validation. This study aims to develop and validate a risk prediction model for death in the repaired tetralogy of Fallot population.

Methods and Results

Patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot enrolled in the INDICATOR (International Multicenter Tetralogy of Fallot Registry) cohort with clinical, arrhythmia, cardiac magnetic resonance, and outcome data were included. Patients from London, Amsterdam, and Boston sites were placed in the development cohort; patients from the Toronto site were used for external validation. Multivariable Cox regression was used to evaluate factors associated with time from cardiac magnetic resonance until the primary outcome: all-cause death. Of 1552 eligible patients (n = 1221 in development, n = 331 in validation; median age at cardiac magnetic resonance 23.4 [interquartile range, 15.6–35.6] years; median follow up 9.5years), 102 (6.6%) experienced the primary outcome. The multivariable Cox model performed similarly during development (concordance index, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.78–0.88]) and external validation (concordance index, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.71–0.90]) and identified older age at cardiac magnetic resonance, obesity, type of tetralogy of Fallot repair, higher right ventricular end-systolic volume index, and lower biventricular global function index as independent predictors of death. A risk-scoring algorithm dividing patients into low-risk (score ≤ 4) versus high-risk (score > 4) groups was validated to effectively discriminate risk of death (15-year survival of 95% versus 74%, respectively; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

This externally validated mortality risk prediction algorithm can help identify vulnerable patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot who may benefit from targeted interventions.

### Survival trends in children with tetralogy of Fallot in Sweden from 1970 to 2017 [^1112Xmmp]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

In this study, we observed a significant reduction in absolute and relative mortality among patients with TOF from 1970 to 2017. However, there still exists a considerable increased risk of in mortality in patients with TOF compared with age- and sex-matched controls. The remaining challenge is to identify the routes for further survival improvements for pediatric patients with TOF by noting the predictors of good and poor outcomes and determining the modifiable factors for further outcome improvements.

### Survival and freedom from reinterventions in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot: up to 42-year follow-up of 917 patients [^111hzJAq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Since the first repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) in 1954, early and long‐term results of treatment, surgical techniques and approach, timing of initial repair and reinterventions have been extensively studied in this most common cyanotic heart defect. Despite excellent survival after TOF repair, it is now clear that a high number of patients will require additional interventions. We present a retrospective long‐term follow‐up study of patients with TOF repaired in childhood. The study was performed at a single nationwide pediatric cardiac center and represents a complete surgically treated population with TOF from a defined territory.

### Survival and freedom from reinterventions in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot: up to 42-year follow-up of 917 patients [^116jqoSa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Most patients with TOF currently undergo repair within the first year of life. Initial surgical repair is now a safe procedure approaching zero early mortality. Long‐term results, and specifically pulmonary valve competence and need for later replacement, are dictated by the surgical approach to the initial repair. This has shifted towards transatrial approach over time. Specific right ventricular outflow tract anatomy, however, still remains the main driving factor for surgical decision making.

Tetralogy of Fallot — synopsis of clinical risks after repair: Long-term survival after surgery for TOF continues to improve, but residual hemodynamic and electrophysiological abnormalities are common in adulthood, and adults with repaired TOF face an increased risk of arrhythmias, exercise intolerance, heart failure, and death beginning in early adulthood.

Tetralogy of Fallot — pregnancy counseling and fetal risk: Pregnancy is not advised in patients with unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot. After repair of tetralogy of Fallot, the prognosis for a successful pregnancy is good provided there are no important hemodynamic residua and functional capacity is good, and a comprehensive, informed cardiovascular evaluation is recommended before each pregnancy. Pregnancy is usually well tolerated except in the setting of severe pulmonary regurgitation, as long as RV function is no more than mildly depressed and sinus rhythm is maintained. Patients with tetralogy of Fallot have an increased risk of fetal loss, and their offspring are more likely to have congenital anomalies than offspring in the general population, especially in the setting of a 22q11.2 microdeletion. Screening for 22q11.2 microdeletion should be considered in patients with conotruncal abnormalities before pregnancy; in the absence of a 22q11 deletion, the risk of a fetus having CHD is approximately 4% to 6%, and fetal echocardiography should be offered to the mother in the second trimester.

### Does valve-sparing repair improve outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot? A systematic review [^116mb4qb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

There are good outcomes for patients with TOF due to the development of surgery and enhanced health care. With surgical correction, more than 95% of patients with TOF survive into adulthood. In contrast, among patients who do not undergo corrective surgery, more than 70% are expected to die before reaching adulthood. Early TOF repair is typically performed between 2 and 12 months of age, with optimal timing often between 3 and 6 months in asymptomatic cases, balancing surgical risks and pulmonary vascular development. Early TOF repair in children is one of the surgical improvements that has contributed to these outcomes. Early TOF repair can reduce the negative development of the lungs; in children with TOF, the developing pulmonary vasculature has abnormally reduced flow and pressure, which leads to a reduced cross-sectional area for gas exchange in the lungs. Additionally, failure to repair TOF early can lead to decreased right ventricular compliance, lower left ventricular function, and the presence of arrhythmias. Despite positive outcomes for patients with TOF, improvements in surgical outcomes still have not advanced fast enough. As the prevalence of congenital heart disease increases, continuous refinements in surgical techniques are crucial to improving long-term outcomes for TOF patients. While TOF repair strategies are well established, ongoing discussions exist regarding the optimal timing of repair — particularly the choice between early primary repair and staged palliation in certain high-risk neonates. Additionally, while existing classifications differentiate TOF from TOF with pulmonary atresia, clinical decision-making remains highly individualized based on anatomical and hemodynamic factors, such as duct-dependent circulation and MAPCAs. Rather than relying solely on rigid classification schemes, surgical decisions are tailored to patient-specific presentations. Although there is a growing preference for correcting TOF within the first year of life, the ideal timing remains a subject of discussion. Current practice generally favors performing repair once the infant reaches approximately 6 kg, but in cases of significant cyanosis or hemodynamic instability, earlier intervention may be necessary. Factors contributing to this debate include ongoing discussions regarding the optimal timing of TOF repair within the first year of life, particularly balancing the benefits of early correction with potential risks in smaller infants. While neonatal repair is generally avoided when possible, most centers aim to perform TOF correction as soon as the infant reaches an appropriate weight threshold, typically around 6 kg. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery reported that despite evolving treatment strategies, there are limited data to help clinicians make decisions. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of preserving the native pulmonary valve in TOF repair for patients in whom valve-sparing techniques are feasible, compared with the non-valve-sparing approach. It is well recognized that the pulmonary annular diameter is a key determinant of surgical strategy, and valve-sparing repair is only applicable in patients with an adequate annulus. In cases of significant annular hypoplasia, transannular patch repair or other techniques are required to relieve right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. While the choice of surgical strategy is dictated by anatomical and clinical considerations, understanding the long-term functional outcomes of these approaches may aid in optimizing postoperative care and patient counseling.

### Contemporary predictors of death and sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot enrolled in the INDICATOR cohort [^114LSHZk]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, RV hypertrophy and LV and RV dysfunction measured by CMR, as well as atrial tachyarrhythmias predict death and sustained VT in patients with repaired TOF. The likelihood of a poor outcome increases substantially when multiple risk factors coexist. Elevated RV systolic pressure may confer an additional risk, though the mechanism that distinguishes it from that of RV hypertrophy requires additional study. These findings may inform the design of future trials on therapeutic interventions in this population.

Key messages

What is already known about this subject?
Patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) experience increased rates of mortality and morbidity beginning in early adulthood but the risk factors for late adverse outcomes are poorly defined.

How might this impact on clinical practice?
Our findings inform risk stratification and clinical decisions as well as the design of future trials on therapeutic interventions in patients with repaired TOF.

What this study adds?
We analysed risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in a large, contemporarily managed cohort of young adult patients with repaired TOF enrolled in the International Multicentre TOF Registry (INdiCaTOR). The results uncover new risk factors for death and sustained ventricular tachycardia, including right ventricular hypertrophy, left and/or right ventricular dysfunction and history of atrial tachyarrhythmias. This information informs risk stratification and clinical decisions in this rapidly growing population of adult patients.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. Intracardiac correction was pioneered by Walton Lillehei in 1955 and has since then gone through major developments. The aim of this study was to provide a systematic literature review of published results on the long-term outcome of complete surgical correction of TOF.

Methods

MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for literature published between January 2000 and July 2018. Pooled estimates with a random effects model after log-transformation were calculated for mortality and reintervention. Potential heterogeneity was assessed by subgroup analyses and meta-regression.

Results

A total of 143 papers of 137 distinct cohorts comprising 21,427 patients and total follow-up duration of 147,430 patient-years were included. Overall mean age at correction was 3.7 ± 5.6 years, but excluding papers exclusively focusing on correction in adults yielded a mean age of 0.5 ± 2.5 years at correction. Previous palliative shunts (107 studies), a transventricular approach (81 studies), and a transannular patch (124 studies) were used in 16% (range 0%-78%), 39% (range 0%-100%), and 49% (range 0%-100%) of the patients. respectively. In case a transannular patch was used, monocusp reconstruction was applied in 15% (range 0%-100%) (49 studies). The most common genetic abnormality was Down syndrome, with a pooled estimated prevalence of 4.6% (range 0%-12.3%). The pooled estimates of early and late mortality were 2.84% (95% confidence interval, 2.34–3.45) and 0.42%/year (95% CI, 0.33–0.54), respectively. The pooled estimate of late cardiac mortality was 0.26%/year (95% CI, 0.21–0.34). Valve-related mortality and non-valve-related mortality had pooled estimates of 0.20%/year (95% CI, 0.15–0.26) and 0.17%/year (95% CI, 0.12–0.22), respectively. The pooled estimate of reintervention was 2.26%/year (95% CI, 1.86–2.75).

Conclusions

TOF can be surgically corrected at a young age with low perioperative and long-term mortality. Life-long intensive follow-up and substantial reintervention rates characterize the clinical course.

### An apology for primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot [^116QTrMT]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2005). Low credibility.

The first repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) was 50 years ago, so it would seem that the details for optimal management strategies would be clear. Timing of repair and operative repair strategy for TOF are still a source of debate. Varying institutions have published excellent outcomes with a primary repair strategy or a selective staged repair strategy. In this article, the current and historic strategy for repair of TOF at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto is delineated along with associated outcomes. Data from our institution indicate a clear survival advantage for primary repair of TOF.

### Mechanism and risk factors for death in adults with tetralogy of Fallot [^114GKH2K]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the goals of lifelong care in adults with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is early identification and treatment of patients at high risk for adverse events. Clinical risk stratification tools are critical for achieving this goal. We reviewed the Mayo Adult Congenital Heart Disease database and identified 465 TOF patients (age 37 ± 14 years, men 223 [48%]) seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1990 and 2017. The aim was to determine the risk factors for death and/or heart transplant through a comprehensive analysis of 8 groups of variables (demographics, co-morbidities, medications, heart rhythm, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac catheterization, and cardiopulmonary exercise test data) using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. The end point of death and/or transplant occurred in 57 (12%) patients during a follow-up of 13.6 ± 8.2 years, yielding an event rate of 0.9% per year. Independent risk factors were age > 42 years, atrial fibrillation, ≥ moderate QRS fragmentation, left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure > 16 mm Hg, and left ventricle end-diastolic pressure > 16 mm Hg. There is nearly a twofold increase in the risk of death and/or transplant per unit increase in number of risk factors (hazard ratio 1.92, 95% confidence interval 1.62 to 2.27, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the current study provides risk stratification indices based on a comprehensive risk model of all clinical variables in an unselected TOF population. Further studies are required to determine whether interventions targeted at modifying these risk factors will alter the annual event rate.

### Survival trends in children with tetralogy of Fallot in Sweden from 1970 to 2017 [^115BnwA6]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Mortality in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) has decreased substantially since the start of surgical correction of this abnormality in the 1950s. However, nationwide data in Sweden comparing survival trends among pediatric patients with TOF with the general population are still limited.

Objective

To study survival trends in pediatric patients with TOF and compare them with matched controls.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A Swedish registry-based, nationwide, matched cohort study was conducted; data were collected from national health registers from January 1, 1970, to December 31, 2017. Patients with a registered diagnosis of TOF as well as controls without TOF matched by birth year and sex were included in the study. Follow-up data were collected from birth to age 18 years, death, or the end of follow-up (December 31, 2017), whichever occurred first. Data analysis was performed from September 10 to December 20, 2022. Survival trends among patients with TOF were compared with matched controls using Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality during childhood in patients with TOF and matched controls.

Results

The population included 1848 patients (1064 [57.6%] males; mean [SD] age, 12.4 [6.7] years) with TOF and 16 354 matched controls. The number of patients who underwent congenital cardiac surgery (henceforth, surgery group) was 1527 (897 [58.7%] males). In the whole TOF population from birth until age 18 years, 286 patients (15.5%) died during a mean (SD) follow-up time of 12.4 (6.7) years. In the surgery group, 154 of 1527 patients (10.1%) died during a follow-up time of 13.6 (5.7) years with a mortality risk of 21.9 (95% CI, 16.2–29.7) compared with matched controls. When stratified by birth period, a substantial decrease in the mortality risk was noted in the surgery group, from 40.6 (95% CI, 21.9–75.4) in those born in the 1970s to 11.1 (95% CI, 3.4–36.4) in those born in the 2010s. Survival increased from 68.5% to 96.0%. The risk of mortality for surgery decreased from 0.52 in the 1979s to 0.19 in the 2010s.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest there has been substantial improvement in survival in children with TOF who underwent surgery from 1970 to 2017. However, the mortality rate is still significantly higher in this group compared with matched controls. Predictors of good and poor outcomes in this group need to be further explored, with the modifiable ones evaluated for further outcome improvements.

### Pathophysiologic and prognostic implications of right atrial hypertension in adults with tetralogy of Fallot [^111TVzjM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In adults with repaired TOF, increasing RAP correlates with worse exercise capacity and greater disease severity including arrhythmic burden and risk of heart failure and also predicts future cardiovascular adverse events. These data provide new insight in the pathophysiology of disease progression for symptomatic patients with TOF and can be used to improve risk stratification in this population.

### Does valve-sparing repair improve outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot? A systematic review [^111pMPdm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases, with surgical intervention being dictated by patient-specific anatomical and clinical factors. While the choice of surgical technique is determined by these preoperative factors, evaluating postoperative outcomes remains essential to optimizing patient care. In addition, inadequate early intervention contributes to an annual increase in the prevalence of congenital heart disease. Congenital heart disease affects approximately 1% of live births. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, contributing to 7–10% of all congenital heart defects. There are no known genetic or environmental causative agents of TOF, but many associations exist, such as untreated maternal diabetes, phenylketonuria, retinoic acid intake, and trisomy 13, 18, and 21. The tetralogy of Fallot pathology occurs during embryogenesis and is pathognomy with four distinct features: pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defect, overriding of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. This tetrad of features comes from a structural abnormality in utero that results in anterior and leftward displacement of the infundibular septum. There is variation in the severity of symptoms. Nevertheless, the determining factor for the severity level seems to be the degree of blood flow obstruction through the right ventricular outflow tract. Most cases of Tetralogy of Fallot present within the first few months of life, often with cyanosis, though the timing can vary depending on the severity of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, prominence of a systolic murmur, and accompanied clubbing in chronically cyanotic patients. However, clubbing has become more unusual in the modern era as diagnosed patients undergo surgical repair before clubbing can develop.

### Tetralogy of Fallot and its variants [^1131ooRN]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are to discuss the anatomy, pathophysiology, surgical repair, and perioperative management strategies for tetralogy of Fallot and its variants.

Data Source

MEDLINE and PubMed.

Conclusions

Significant refinements have been made in the repair strategy for tetralogy of Fallot, based on improved understanding of postrepair physiology. Important considerations for timing and technique of surgery and perioperative management have been presented, and continued evolution is expected. Expanded use of the pulmonary valve reconstruction technique outlined herein, whatever the age of repair, may improve long-term outcome.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and low weight — risk data — indicate that "weight < 2.5 kg was identified as a risk factor for mortality", with the TOF subgroup showing similar survival for those " < 2.5 kg" whether undergoing primary repair or initial palliation but with an "overall mortality of 5% to 8.5%". A study from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium of "more than 3000 patients" found "weight < 2.5 kg at the time of surgery to be a risk factor for in-hospital mortality with an odds ratio of 12.5". A Congenital Cardiac Research Collaborative analysis of patients " < 2.5 kg" reported "more than 15% at 5 years" mortality for either approach.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) multimodality imaging — executive summary explains that despite improved survival, residual anatomic and hemodynamic abnormalities are common; diagnostic information in repaired TOF can be obtained via echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, computed tomography (CT), nuclear scintigraphy, and diagnostic catheterization, with the choice dictated by the clinical questions and patient, modality, and clinical circumstances; the overarching goals of imaging are to identify anatomic and functional abnormalities, assess severity, and inform clinical decisions; the document aims to describe the role of each diagnostic modality and to provide guidelines for a multimodality approach, and it proposes an integrated multimodality imaging approach for this group of patients.

### Tetralogy of Fallot will be treated interventionally within two decades [^113A11x6]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot is considered a prototype congenital heart disease because of its embryological, anatomical, pathophysiological, and management aspects. Current management usually relies on a complete surgical repair that is electively performed between 3 and 6 months of age. With the advances of interventional cardiology especially in the fields of ventricular septal defect closure, stent, and pulmonary valve replacement, the question of complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot by interventional means can be discussed. Tetralogy of Fallot is a complex disease with multiple lesions, all individually amenable to transcatheter treatment. In this article, we will review current status of various aspects of tetralogy of Fallot focusing on interventional aspects, giving insights of what would be the ideal platform of a fully interventional repair.

Strengths and Limitations

In our study, there are some factors that strengthen it, the main one being the large number of included patients and its coverage of nearly 5 decades (48 years). Furthermore, the data in our study were extracted from nationwide registers with good quality enabling us to achieve almost complete follow-up. Since our aim was to thoroughly describe the entire cohort of patients with TOF and their survival over time, we chose to include all patients with a diagnosis of TOF and not just those who had undergone congenital cardiac surgery. Much of the literature on children and adults with TOF has a focus on postsurgical survival and omits the group of patients without congenital cardiac surgery. Our study suggests the paramount importance of congenital factors in regard to survival probability. Our study also included a control population matched on birth year and sex enabling us to compare survival not only within the group of patients with TOF but also with the general population.

Our study has limitations. First, the follow-up period for patients born after 2000 (ie, the 2 last birth periods) was shorter than for patients born before 2000. Patients born after 2000 were not aged at least 18 years before the end of the study in December 2017; therefore, the improved survival in these patients may not be quite accurate. Despite this, based on the data we can suggest that most of the diminishing difference in mortality between patients with TOF and controls had already occurred in the beginning of the new millennium.

Second, the study was based on data from registers and we did not have any clinical data available. Therefore, we were not able to categorize the patients with TOF by the severity of their anatomic defects, which could have been interesting because of the heterogenicity of the diagnosis itself. As in all data from registers there is a risk of misclassification of diagnoses and procedures. To our knowledge, there is no publication on the formal validations of the diagnostic codes of CHDs in the Swedish national health registers; however, the Swedish National Inpatient register has been reported to have high validity for many diagnoses. Owing to the long span of the study period, we used 3 different versions of ICD codes (ICD-8 from 1970–1986, ICD-9 from 1987–1996, and ICD-10 from 1997 and thereafter), which might affect the comparability of the patients with TOF. Third, our study has the limitation that genetic syndromes may have been less well captured in the early years of our investigation, and there are other genetic conditions that may not have been captured but could contribute to TOF and its outcome.

### Multimodality imaging guidelines for patients with repaired tetralogy of fallot: a report from the americanSsociety of echocardiography: developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and the society for pediatric radiology [^113W8Ny9]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot — post-repair abnormalities, arrhythmias, and surveillance — features residual anatomic and hemodynamic abnormalities that are nearly universal, with surgical relief of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction commonly involving infundibulectomy, resection of obstructive muscle bundles, and patch enlargement from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries. Conduction and rhythm abnormalities contribute to morbidity and are associated with mortality; right bundle branch block with QRS prolongation is nearly universal, and atrial flutter or fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia increase beginning in the third and fourth decades of life. Although burdens may be tolerated during childhood and adolescence, incidences of arrhythmias, exercise intolerance, heart failure, and death increase in early adulthood, supporting close lifelong medical surveillance. Diagnostic imaging is a mainstay, providing anatomic and hemodynamic information over time that is vital for clinical decisions such as when to recommend pulmonary valve (PV) implantation or other transcatheter or surgical procedures, with the choice of test dictated by the clinical question and patient-, modality-, and circumstance-related factors.

### Derivation and validation of a nomogram to predict in-hospital complications in children with tetralogy of Fallot repaired at an older age [^1128tah9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to incorporate per‐ and intraoperative characteristics to develop and validate a predictive model for in‐hospital complications in children with tetralogy of Fallot repaired at an older age. Our findings show that the triple‐risk classifier can effectively classify patients into different risk groups of in‐hospital complications, thereby improving predictive value for the assessment of patient prognosis. Moreover, we showed that the optimized ARIAR‐Risk classifier might have significantly better predictive performance than the triple‐risk classifier for identifying patients who would develop in‐hospital complications following tetralogy of Fallot repair at an older age. A nomogram including the ARIAR‐Risk classifier might help clinicians in directing personalized therapeutic regimen selection for patients with tetralogy of Fallot repaired at an older age. However, attention should be paid to the fact that the patients included in this study underwent surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot at an older age that is different from much of the rest of the world.

### Long-term outcomes of tetralogy of Fallot: a study from the pediatric cardiac care consortium [^116qjA2s]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a surgically repairable form of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Multicenter data for long-term survival following repair are sparse.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term transplant-free survival of TOF by surgical strategy adjusted for era and patient characteristics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study enriched with data from the National Death Index and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network through 2014. Multicenter cohort from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium (PCCC), a large, US-based clinical registry for interventions for congenital heart disease. The cohort included patients with adequate identifiers for linkage with the National Death Index and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network who were enrolled in the PCCC registry between 1982 and 2003 and survived surgical repair of simple TOF. Data were analyzed between September 2015 and April 2018.

Exposures

We examined patient-associated and surgery-associated risk factors affecting survival.

Main Outcomes and Measures

We analyzed the transplant-free survival during early (< 6 years) and late (≥ 6 years) phase after TOF surgical repair.

Results

Of the 3283 patients who survived repair for simple TOF and met the study's inclusion criteria, 56.4% were male and 43.6% were female. Twenty-five-year survival following TOF repair was 94.5%. Multivariable analysis demonstrated increased risk of early mortality with staged repair (HR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.59–4.49) and non-valve-sparing operation (HR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.53–9.19). Presence of a genetic abnormality was associated with increased risk of death both in the early (HR, 3.64; 95% CI, 2.05–6.47) and late postoperative phase (HR, 4.41; 95% CI, 2.62–7.44).

Conclusions and Relevance

Long-term survival after simple TOF repair is excellent. Staged repair and non-valve-sparing operations were negatively associated with survival in the early postrepair phase but not the late postrepair phase. These data are important for patients with repaired TOF and their caretakers and may guide surgical strategies for optimizing the long-term outcomes of this population.

### Late outcomes in patients with surgically treated congenital heart disease [^113ep5Qq]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2005). Low credibility.

Optimizing late outcomes should be the end result of improvements in medical and surgical care for congenital heart disease (CHD). In addition to mortality, significant morbidities after surgery for CHD need to be considered. These include the need for reintervention, cardiovascular complications, exercise limitations, neurocognitive morbidities, effects on pregnancy, difficulty obtaining insurance, need for chronic medications, and impaired functional status and quality of life. Long-term outcome studies are difficult to perform, and their interpretation is complicated by intervening changes in management. Specific discussion of long-term follow-up of tetralogy of Fallot, D-transposition of the great arteries, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome illustrates the myriad management changes over the last three decades, the challenges in predicting outcomes for recent patients, and the need for ongoing initiation of long-term follow-up studies.

### Adults with repaired tetralogy: low mortality but high morbidity up to middle age [^115ixnq1]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Improved survival of patients with congenital heart disease now means that there are more adults than children with repaired congenital disease in developed countries. Medium-term survival of repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rToF) has been documented to be good, with 20-year survival rates at or above 90%. This survival has resulted in a large and expanding cohort of adults with rToF.

Despite this, survival beyond the third and fourth decades is substantially lower than the age-matched normal population and is often associated with significant sequelae, including progressive exercise intolerance, arrhythmia, right heart failure and sudden death.

We have previously reported better functional outcomes for patients with rToF from our tertiary referral centre in Sydney, compared with elsewhere. Follow-up of these patients into adult life might provide important information concerning outcomes in the contemporary era. Furthermore, near-complete follow-up of these patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is facilitated by relatively low population mobility in Australia, few local ACHD centres and a National Death Index (NDI) that allows for complete vital status.

### Early primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot [^113hgdnd]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2009). Low credibility.

Outcomes for surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis are often considered to be a useful benchmark for the assessment of congenital surgical programs. This procedure, including preoperative assessment and postoperative management, falls in the middle of the spectrum of difficulty of all the congenital cardiac procedures. Within this anomaly itself, there is a wide spectrum of severity and difficulty. However, it is important to distinguish tetralogy with pulmonary stenosis or "simple tetralogy" from the much more complex anomaly tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis is virtually always operable. It is also a progressive condition that is therefore best repaired in early infancy following echocardiographic diagnosis alone.

### Clinical status and reintervention in neonates with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot: a landmark analysis [^111x4d5F]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonates with tetralogy of Fallot and symptomatic cyanosis (sTOF) require early intervention to establish a stable circulation. Management strategies involve either primary repair (PR) or staged repair (SR), with initial palliation (IP) followed by complete repair (CR). Identifying the optimal approach has proven challenging, with early studies limited by methodological flaws and evolving care standards. Recent data fail to show a mortality difference between strategies but consistently favor PR in terms of early reintervention (RI) rates and cumulative risk exposure. Early advantages may, however, come at a long-term cost. To more fully understand the implications of initial treatment strategies, it is essential to assess outcomes beyond the early high-risk period. In this study, we leveraged a large, multicenter cohort of sTOF patients to evaluate long-term outcomes and RI rates among infants who survived beyond the first year of life, stratified by initial management strategy.

### Long-term follow-up and sex differences in adults operated for tetralogy of Fallot [^111z4o65]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) has an incidence of 0.34 per 1000 live births, and is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease.

Since the first surgical repair of TOF reported in 1954, the life expectancy of children born with TOF has dramatically improved to a survival of 94% at 25 years, and 72% at 40 years, following TOF repair. After surgical correction, patients generally enjoy a good quality of life that is almost similar to that of the general population. However, long-term survival is still significantly lower than in the general population.

Despite significant advances in treatment and management, previous studies have documented a high risk of arrhythmias in patients with TOF. Especially ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) remain major concerns in adults corrected for TOF late after surgical repair.

Previous reports have indicated a slightly higher prevalence of atrial and VA in male patients; however, significant sex differences in cardiac function and outcome are not known.

We aimed to investigate cardiac function, prevalence of VA and heart failure in adult patients operated for TOF. Furthermore, we aimed to explore possible sex differences.

### Outcome of tetralogy of Fallot through initial palliation and surgical repair [^113pZUYX]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, frequently diagnosed prenatally. To enhance understanding, we reviewed 18 years of our institutional outcomes for patients with classic ToF. There were 410 patients of whom 233/410 (56.8%) were diagnosed prenatally. A genetic abnormality was diagnosed in 38/410 (9.3%), most commonly 22q11.2 microdeletion (43.6%). There were 10/410 (2.4%) deaths in the neonatal period prior to any cardiac intervention. Prior to complete ToF repair, 66/400 (16.5%) of patients required cardiac procedures, in 15 in the first week after birth. Babies with an antenatal diagnosis were more likely to require at least one procedure before complete ToF repair than those with a postnatal diagnosis (p = 0.039). There was a trend to shorter median length of stay in patients with RVOT stent (median 5.4 days) or duct stenting (median 4.2 days) versus BTT shunt (median 8 days). Complete ToF repair was undertaken in 396/410 at a median age of 6 months (IQR: 4.0–8.0 months), with a 30-day postoperative survival rate of 99.5%. The actuarial survival for the whole group (n = 410) of 410 patients was 98.5% at 30 days, 96.2% at 1 year, and 95.2% at 3 years of age. Following complete surgical repair, reintervention was required in 25% of cases: 3.3% at 30 days, 10.6% at 1 year, and 19.2% at 5 years. The freedom from reintervention was 89.4% after 1 year and 80.8% after 5 years. There were no deaths beyond 2.5 years post-repair. In conclusion, ToF can be repaired with a low procedural mortality rate and promising long-term survival outcomes, but there may be pre-procedural deaths and there is a likelihood of requiring reinterventions during follow-up.

### The prognostic value of myocardial deformation in adult patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot [^115zSsrw]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adult patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) are at risk for complications such as heart failure and sudden cardiac death, and identifying high-risk patients is important. Reduced left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function has been identified as a predictor of outcomes. However, LV ejection fraction is often preserved, and RV function is difficult to assess. With the introduction of strain analysis, an easy and more sensitive parameter became available. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between strain variables and cardiovascular events in patients with ToF.

Methods

Stable adult patients with repaired ToF were consecutively included in a prospective observational study between 2011 and 2013 (N = 151; median age, 33.2 years [interquartile range, 25.5–42.0 years]; 61.6% men). For the left ventricle, global longitudinal strain and apical and basal rotation were measured, and longitudinal strain was measured for the right ventricle. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or heart failure. The secondary endpoint was a composite of death, heart failure, arrhythmia, reintervention, or hospitalization for cardiac reasons.

Results

During a median follow-up period of 71.5 months (interquartile range, 64.0–75.3 months), the primary and secondary endpoints occurred in 14 (9%) and 62 (41%) patients, respectively. After adjusting for LV ejection fraction and LV global longitudinal strain, RV longitudinal strain remained independently associated with the primary endpoint in a ridge regression analysis. LV apical rotation remained independently associated with the secondary end point (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52–0.98; p = 0.035) after adjusting for age, New York Heart Association functional class, QRS duration, LV ejection fraction, RV longitudinal strain, and LV global longitudinal strain.

Conclusions

Myocardial deformation variables of both the left and right ventricles were associated with cardiovascular events in patients with ToF. LV and RV longitudinal strain and LV rotation should become part of the routine assessment of patients with ToF.

### Rationale and design of an international multicenter registry of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot to define risk factors for late adverse outcomes: the INDICATOR cohort [^112DHEAq]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Although early survival after tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair in the modern era is excellent, studies on late outcomes have shown increasing rates of mortality and morbidity. Despite multiple publications on factors associated with late complications, risk factors for major outcomes (death and sustained ventricular tachycardia [VT]) remain poorly defined. Consequently, the International Multicenter TOF Registry (INDICATOR) was established. This article describes the development, structure, and goals of this registry and characterizes the initial cohort derived from four large congenital heart centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. A data coordinating center with a core cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) laboratory and statistical core was established. Subjects with repaired TOF who had CMR imaging performed between 1997 and 2010 and ≥ 1 year follow-up were included. Clinical end points were death and sustained VT. Demographic, electrophysiologic, exercise, and outcome data were collected. A total of 873 subjects fulfilled inclusion criteria (median age at repair 2.9 years and at CMR imaging 22.8 years). Of these, 9% had QRS duration > 180 ms on electrocardiogram (ECG). On CMR imaging, 38% had severe right-ventricular (RV) dilatation (≥ 160 mL/m(2)), and 6% had severe RV dysfunction (ejection fraction < 35%). Of the 551 subjects with exercise testing available, 28% had severely decreased exercise capacity with < 50% predicted peak oxygen consumption. The INDICATOR cohort allows robust statistical analysis to evaluate major clinical outcomes in patients with repaired TOF. Continued follow-up and further expansion of the registry may provide new insights into innovative therapeutic strategies to improve late outcomes.

### Pregnancy outcomes among 31 patients with tetralogy of Fallot, a retrospective study [^1174SBCM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a severe type of congenital heart disease (CHD) with an incidence of 10% in all reported CHD, which is characterized by four components: large ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. In the past decades, the overall prognosis of CHD has been greatly improved and many patients could reach adulthood because of early diagnosis and timely therapy. However, TOF as a complex and cyanotic type of CHD, its prognosis remain poor, especially in those who did not undergo surgical repair, and it remains the leading cause of indirect maternal mortality among CHD patient with pregnancy. There are great variations in cardiac complication rates for maternal mortality among published studies for TOF patients with pregnancy, it ranged from 0 to 17.5%. It has been thought that it is approximately 1/10,000 in developed countries and may be up to 25 times higher in the developing countries.

After surgical repair, the majority of young women with TOF could survive into their reproductive age. Without repair, TOF patients rarely reach childbearing age and get pregnant. Since pregnancy introduces extra load on the heart, and can damage cardiac functions, resulting in the increase in both maternal and perinatal morbidity. Previous studies have demonstrated that cardiac and obstetric complications are more likely to occur in patients without surgical repair. The most common cardiac complications include progressive dilatation of the right ventricle and ventricular failure, thromboembolism, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, progressive aortic root dilatation and endocarditis. The common obstetric complications include the increased risk in miscarriage, premature birth, and low birth weights, postpartum hemorrhage, paradoxical embolism, thromboembolism, congestive cardiac failure, infective endocarditis, and arrhythmias. Among these complications, the pulmonary hemorrhage, brain abscess and thromboembolism have been thought to be the most common causes of death.

To date, the outcomes of pregnant women with TOF have not not well characterized due to limited number of studied cases and lack of data for close follow-up. Therefore, the management of TOF pregnant women remains challenging. Here, we present 31 cases of pregnant women with or without surgical repair for TOF.

### Prenatal and postnatal survival of fetal tetralogy of Fallot: a meta-analysis of perinatal outcomes and associated genetic disorders [^112ACQfy]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to compare the postnatal outcomes, genetic testing results, and sonographic findings in 3 subtypes of tetralogy of Fallot.

Methods

Thirty-six articles from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were selected for this review. The postnatal outcomes, karyotyping results, and sonographic findings of fetal tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, and tetralogy of Fallot with an absent pulmonary valve were collected and compared.

Results

The survival rates (termination of pregnancy was considered fetal death) for prenatally diagnosed tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and tetralogy of Fallot with an absent pulmonary valve at the end of neonatal period were significantly lower than the rate for tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (P < .05). The survival rate for tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia was also lower at birth (P < .001). Major chromosomal anomalies were more frequently detected in tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (P < .05); conversely, 22q11 deletion was present more often in fetuses with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and tetralogy of Fallot with an absent pulmonary valve (P < .001). Compared to tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis, a right aortic arch was more associated with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (32.6%; P < .05), and the ductus arteriosus was almost always absent in tetralogy of Fallot with an absent pulmonary valve (87.5%; P < .001).

Conclusions

The postnatal outcomes, genetic testing results, and sonographic findings are different among subtypes of tetralogy of Fallot. Documenting those details at diagnosis can help specialists better counsel their patients.

TETRALOGY OF FALLOT AND RELATED PHYSIOLOGY

Indications

Patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) can have multiple functional derangements following repair, including pulmonary insufficiency, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, arrhythmias, and right ventricular dysfunction. In response, the American Heart Association guidelines for adults with TOF recommend routine CPET every 1 to 5 years (no such guidelines exist for children or adolescents).CPET has prognostic significance, may unmask arrhythmias, and is an integral part of decision‐making for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR).

Findings

Important CPET findings for patients with TOF are described in. Peak 2 is significantly impaired throughout adolescence and adulthood, with a mean of 68% predicted. This impairment in peak 2 likely starts at younger ages with an accelerated decline in peak 2 into adulthood. A study of 300 patients with TOF observed a reduced or blunted increase in peak 2 throughout adolescence, rather than the expected rise that is associated with growth and maturation. Additionally, in adults, there is an accelerated loss of fitness with an overall mean decline in peak 2 of 1.4% per year. Interestingly, no clinical or imaging characteristics (including magnetic resonance imaging) discriminated between those who did and did not have a significant decline in peak 2 over time, suggesting CPET may provide independent insights for identifying patients at risk of cardiac‐related events, death, or in need of intervention.

Another important CPET variable, the VE/V 2 slope has been a strong predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with congenital HD. An elevated VE/V 2 slope ≥ 31 can suggest important pulmonary blood flow maldistribution secondary to residual branch pulmonary stenoses and resultant ventilation/perfusion mismatch.

Severity of adult congenital heart disease — severity of disease is determined by native anatomy, surgical repair, and current physiology, and patients with the same underlying anatomy may have different repairs with variable physiologic consequences. For example, a patient with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) after a valve-sparing primary repair may have excellent biventricular function with normal exercise capacity and no arrhythmias, whereas another patient with TOF may have had palliative shunting followed by a transannular patch repair resulting in severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR) with right ventricular (RV) enlargement, biventricular dysfunction, and ventricular tachycardia; to categorize disease severity more comprehensively, the writing committee developed an ACHD Anatomic and Physiological (AP) classification system that incorporates anatomic and physiological variables with prognostic value in patients with ACHD.

### Role of QRS fragmentation for risk stratification in adults with tetralogy of Fallot [^1124vYyY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, 1 and despite improvement in medical and surgical management of this disease, adults with repaired TOF remain at risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 2, 3, 4 Patients with repaired TOF have reduced survival compared with the general population, with a 30‐year survival of ≈85% to 90%. 2, 4, 5 As a result, risk stratification is important in this population to identify and treat patients at high risk for cardiovascular death.

Several studies have described risk factors for mortality in adults with repaired TOF. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 The proposed risk factors include patient demographics such as age at time of TOF repair, left and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, RV fibrosis, RV hypertrophy, ventricular arrhythmia, and increased left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Unfortunately, some of the available risk scores include variables derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cardiac catheterization, and such tests are not routinely performed during annual evaluation. ECG, on the other hand, is inexpensive, noninvasive, readily available, and routinely performed during annual evaluation of patients with TOF. 11 In a recent study, Bokma et al 12 reported that QRS fragmentation (QRS‐f), assessed using a standard 12‐lead ECG, could reliably predict mortality in this population. The purpose of our study was to determine whether QRS‐f derived from a standard 12‐lead ECG could independently predict mortality in a different population of adult patients with TOF.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common complex congenital heart disease (CHD) with an incidence rate of approximately 4.2 per 1000 live births per year. The tetralogy consists of 4 anatomic features: nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and subsequent right ventricular hypertrophy. Currently, the diagnosis of TOF is often made by antenatal fetal ultrasonography; however, the condition may be recognized postnatally or even later in life depending on the severity of the malformations and the clinical presentation.

The clinical features of TOF include progressive cyanosis, hypoxia, and heart murmurs noted on auscultation. Surgical correction of TOF includes closure of the ventricular septal defect and right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction, often with pulmonary valve surgery. Left uncorrected, TOF will mainly lead to varying degrees of heart failure, dyspnea with cyanosis, and chronic hypoxia due to the right-to-left shunt through the ventricular septal defect. A limited number of patients survive to their middle-aged years without congenital heart surgery (henceforth, surgery).

The first corrective surgery of TOF was performed by Lillehei in 1954 using extracorporeal circulation by controlled cross-circulation (oxygenated circulation provided by a living donor). The long-term results after corrective surgery of TOF in the early years reported a 30-year-survival of 77%. Since the first surgical correction, both short-term and long-term survival have improved. An early mortality rate of 1.9% to 2.3% has been reported, and the 30-year-survival rate has increased to approximately 90%. However, most of these studies were small and single center, focused on postsurgery outcome, and excluded patients who did not undergo surgery.

Tetralogy of Fallot is associated with several genetic conditions. The prevalence of genetic syndromes varies in different studies, from 5% to more than 27%, with 22q11 deletion (DiGeorges syndrome) and trisomy 21 the most frequently reported syndromes. Most of the studies reported an increased risk of mortality associated with the presence of a genetic syndrome.,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the nationwide survival in Swedish children with TOF compared with matched controls and note survival changes throughout almost 50 years. This study is, to our knowledge, the first national survey of pediatric mortality in patients with TOF in Sweden.

### Multimodality imaging guidelines for patients with repaired tetralogy of fallot: a report from the americanSsociety of echocardiography: developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and the society for pediatric radiology [^111gbcqu]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot — left ventricular (LV) size and function: LV systolic dysfunction measured by ejection fraction (EF) has been shown to be an important prognostic marker for premature death in patients with repaired TOF, and its assessment is an essential element of the echocardiographic examination. Systolic flattening of the ventricular septum suggests RV pressure overload, whereas diastolic septal flattening indicates volume overload; the biplane area-length method is preferred when technically feasible, and measurements of LV volumes and EF by 3D echocardiography are preferred over 2D measurements. In patients with marked RV dilatation, the right ventricle is often apex forming, necessitating adjustment of the transducer position in the apical windows to avoid foreshortening of the left ventricle. In a study of 413 adult patients with repaired TOF, nongeometric indices of longitudinal LV function were associated with adverse clinical outcomes, specifically decreased mitral annular plane excursion and LV longitudinal strain associated with the outcome independent of QRS duration. Given that most patients with repaired TOF reach adulthood and the average age continues to increase, the risk for acquired ischemic heart disease is likely to increase; therefore, stress echocardiography may play an increasing role and stress can be induced with exercise or through a pharmacologic agent (e.g., dobutamine).

### Short-term outcomes following total correction of tetralogy of Fallot in adult patients [^112jvDR5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although it is better to perform TFTC in childhood, age is not a contraindication for surgical management. Moreover, according to the high rate of late diagnosis of TOF in developing countries, TOF should be kept in mind as a potential differential diagnosis in children and adults who have suspicious symptoms and signs. In addition, knowing that accompanying anomalies can affect the course of the disease and the type of surgery, careful preoperative assessment is recommended.

### Prognostic value of right ventricular dyssynchrony in adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot [^114yELtb]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD) and is present in 7%–10% of children with CHD. Since surgical repair was introduced in 1955, long-term prognosis of patients with TOF has improved steadily. Today, more than 95% of children with repaired TOF (rTOF) reach adulthood, compared with less than 20% in historical cohorts without repair. However, residual sequelae after surgical repair (eg, atrial or ventricular scars, pulmonary valve or right ventricular (RV) outflow tract dysfunction) can impact long-term outcomes by affecting ventricular size and function, and predisposing patients to arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death and heart failure. So far, most attention has been directed to the negative consequences of residual pulmonary regurgitation on RV size and function and the occurrence of arrhythmias. Less attention has been paid on the consequences of right bundle branch block and intraventricular dyssynchrony on biventricular function, exercise capacity and clinical outcome.

Echocardiographic 2D-speckle tracking strain analysis allows the assessment of the electromechanical dyssynchrony within the left and right ventricle. Previous studies have shown the prognostic importance of RV myocardial strain for various conditions, such as in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmogenic RV dysplasiaor with a systemic right ventricle. With only a few studies performed in children with rTOF, the prognostic value of RV strain and dyssynchrony in adults with rTOF is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RV dyssynchrony surrogates and the risk stratification of patients with rTOF years after surgical repair with clinical parameters.

### Factors associated with health-related quality of life among adults with tetralogy of Fallot [^114Bsu7J]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect. Due to continuous improvements in intervention techniques and care during childhood, the numbers of adults with ToF are increasing. Although reintervention rates in children with ToF are low and quality of life (QoL) is good or even better than healthy counterparts, living longer raises questions concerning long-term morbidity and mortality. It is well known that physical capacity in patients with ToF is impairedand long-term follow-up has shown that only a quarter of patients with corrected ToF are free from events after 40 years and nearly half need future reintervention. With this in mind, it becomes important to address QoL issues.

Many previous studies report that overall QoL in adults with congenital heart disease is good, but there are inconsistent findings especially regarding differences between diagnosis groups. Furthermore, such inconsistent findings are also valid regarding the impact of impaired physical capacity on QoL.

Identifying factors associated with impaired QoL is important as this may lead to changes in routines for follow-up and counselling. Former studies have for example implicated that sense of coherenceand level of physical activity are associated with QoL.

Since former studies addressing QoL mainly have been performed at highly specialised tertiary centres, it is not evident that these results are applicable to a population with national multicentre-derived patients. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional registry study based on the Swedish national registry on congenital heart disease (SWEDCON).

In the present study, the aim was to identify factors associated with best possible self-reported health status measured by EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) in adult patients with previously repaired ToF.

### Survival and freedom from reinterventions in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot: up to 42-year follow-up of 917 patients [^114femwF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate long‐term outcome of tetralogy of Fallot repair analyzing an unbiased country‐wide surgically treated population with tetralogy of Fallot.

Methods and Results

Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients aged < 18 years who underwent tetralogy of Fallot repair at a single nationwide pediatric cardiac center. Death from any cause and need for surgical or catheter reintervention were the study end points. Cox regression analysis was used to identify related risk factors. A total of 917 patients (male, 56.3%) were analyzed. Staged repair was performed in 16.9%. Early mortality (24/917, 2.62% patients) was confined to the early surgical eras. Late mortality was 4.5% (40/893 patients). Survival probability was 95.1%, 93.8% and 91.9% at 10, 20 and 30 years after repair, respectively. Early surgical era (P = 0.013) and surgical/catheter reinterventions (P < 0.001) were multivariable predictors of late death. A total of 487 reinterventions were performed after initial repair in 253/917 patients (27.6%), with pulmonary artery revalvulation (196/917 patients, 21.4%) being most frequent. Probability of freedom from first reintervention was 89.0%, 73.3%, and 55.1% at 10, 20, and 30 years after primary repair, respectively. Transannular repair was associated with the need for pulmonary artery revalvulation (P < 0.001). Patients who underwent staged repair were more likely to need reinterventions on pulmonary arteries (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In an unbiased nationwide cohort, tetralogy of Fallot repair carried a favorable survival of > 90% at 30 years. Each reintervention significantly incrementally increased the risk of mortality. Type of initial repair predicted the need for specific surgical or catheter reinterventions.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — risk factors for adverse outcomes include low weight treated as a continuum, prematurity, pulmonary artery (PA) anatomy, genetic syndromes, and baseline clinical status. Others propose < 2.0 kg as the new marker for lower weight; weight should be considered on a continuum. Prematurity has been shown to be a risk factor for mortality. The presence of small, or discontinuous, PAs increases technical complexity, leading to higher mortality and an increased need for reintervention. Genetic abnormalities are seen in about 15% of those with TOF, with 22q11.2 deletion and trisomy 21 most common, may be associated with haploinsufficient pulmonary arteries, and increase the risk of mortality; a multicenter consortium identified genetic abnormalities as a risk factor for both early and late postoperative mortality, and Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) data show extracardiac abnormalities have significantly worse outcomes. In many studies, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a notable exception with outcomes similar to those without genetic syndromes; a PHIS study including 430 patients with trisomy 21 showed increased morbidity but not mortality. Clinical status before surgery or palliation is important, with intracranial hemorrhage or significant infection perhaps portending a worse prognosis, although these risk factors have not been specifically evaluated.

### Outcomes of anticoagulation therapy in adults with tetralogy of Fallot [^117KYTHf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this review of the indications and outcomes of anticoagulation therapy in 130 adult TOF patients, the most common indications for anticoagulation were atrial arrhythmias, perioperative anticoagulation, and mechanical prosthetic valves. The annual risk of all major bleeding complications and unprovoked major bleeding complications was 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, and mechanical valve prostheses and HAS‐BLED score ≥ 2 were risk factors for major bleeding complications.

Anticoagulation with warfarin is routinely recommended in adults with CHD who have thromboembolic risk factors such as atrial arrhythmia, mechanical valve prosthesis, and history of thrombosis or thromboembolism. 1, 2, 3 These anticoagulation indications are similar to those suggested for patients with acquired heart disease. We did not identify any additional indications for anticoagulation in our patient population.

The HAS‐BLED score was derived and validated in large cohorts of patients with acquired heart disease, 13, 15 and prognostic data of the HAS‐BLED score in adults with CHD are limited. 11, 12 The current study shows an association between HAS‐BLED score and annual bleeding risk in TOF patients, and this is consistent with the limited data from studies of other CHD patients. 11, 12 Since the components of the HAS‐BLED score are based on information from history, physical exam, and routine laboratory blood tests, it can be assessed in all patients, and taken into account when deciding on anticoagulation therapy in the CHD population.

### Prognostic value of preoperative absolute lymphocyte count in children with tetralogy of Fallot [^115ywgAc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is a low‐cost and easy‐to‐obtain inflammatory indicator; however, its association with the prognosis of patients with TOF remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of preoperative ALC in children with TOF.

Methods and Results

This retrospective study included 707 patients aged < 6 years who underwent corrective operations for TOF between January 2016 and December 2018 in Fuwai Hospital, China. The end points were mortality, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation placement, postoperative hospital stay > 30 days, and severe postoperative complications; patients were grouped on the basis of prognosis: poor prognosis (n = 76) and good prognosis (n = 631). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for poor prognosis, on which a risk scoring system was based. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess model performance. Using another model without ALC, the effect of the addition of ALC was assessed. Results suggested that ALC was an independent factor with a cutoff point of 4.36×10⁹/L. The addition of ALC improved the area under the curve from 0.771 to 0.781 (P < 0.001). To avoid reverse causality and further control for confounding factors, the patients were further divided on the basis of ALC level, and a propensity score matching was performed; 117 paired patients were identified for further analysis. Low ALC levels had an odds ratio of 3.500 (95% CI, 1.413–8.672).

Conclusions

Low preoperative ALC represents an independent predictor of poor prognosis in children with TOF.

Evidence includes cohorts where 277 patients had "age younger than 3 months" linked to longer ventilation and length of stay; a 130-patient series with a "mean follow-up of 3.9 years" showed higher complications in those "younger than age 3 months (70% vs 43%)" without mortality or reintervention differences; and a database study of "1112 infants" found postoperative complications "was 40% lower in those aged 3 months or older compared with < 30 days". Longer-term analyses reported worse outcomes when primary repair was performed at "younger than 60 days", and mortality was assessed "at 12 years".

### Outcomes of anticoagulation therapy in adults with tetralogy of Fallot [^116N2rZS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The guidelines for management of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) recommend anticoagulation with warfarin for patients with risk factors for thromboembolism such as atrial arrhythmia, mechanical valve prosthesis, and prior history of thromboembolism. 1, 2, 3 In addition to these standard thromboembolic risk factors, the risk for thromboembolism also varies with certain CHD diagnoses and underlying physiology. 4, 5, 6 Even within a specific diagnosis such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the risk for thromboembolism will change over time as the patients become older and develop more comorbidities such as atrial arrhythmia, renal failure, ventricular dysfunction, and need for prosthetic valves. 7, 8 There are limited data about outcomes of anticoagulation in adults with CHD, 9, 10, 11, 12 and there are no studies specifically looking at outcomes of anticoagulation in adults with TOF. The purpose of the study was to describe the indications for anticoagulation and the incidence and risk factors for major bleeding complication in adults with TOF.

Appendix 3 — literature search strategy for tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — A librarian used a mix of controlled vocabulary terms and free text terms to create individual search hedges that were combined and searched in Embase to answer pertinent research questions about TOF, and an example focused question asked: "What literature is available on TOF AND ('palliative procedure' transcatheter palliation, PDA stent, RVOT stent) OR surgical palliation OR (systemic-pulmonary shunt, limited RVOT patch OR RV-PA conduit without VSD closure) AND outcomes?" The corresponding Embase query combined TOF terms with palliative therapy and device/procedure concepts including 'patent ductus arteriosus stent', 'heart right ventricle outflow tract' stent, and 'blalock taussig shunt', conduit terminology such as 'right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit', 'rv-pa', and 'right ventricle pulmonary artery', and outcome terms including 'survival', 'mortality', pulmonary artery or pulmonary valve 'size' or 'growth', 'z score'/'z-score', reintervention or reoperation rate, 'quality of life', and 'outcomes', with limits "2006–2021/py" and "'article'/it NOT 'review'/it".

### Impact of clinical follow-up and diagnostic testing on intervention for tetralogy of Fallot [^114zby1M]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

This is a retrospective study. The only outcome studied was active management change, whereas clinically important decisions not to change management were not accounted for in this design. The patient population was heterogeneous, and included many potential confounders, ranging from a variety of insurance types and financial circumstances, to other non-cardiac medical conditions, chromosomal anomalies, diverse ages at intracardiac repair and at entry into the study, inconsistent history of prior palliative shunts and inconsistent history of subsequent surgical and catheter-mediated cardiac procedures. While this heterogeneity is an advantage in the sense that it reflects the clinical realities of surgically modified TOF, the influences of the many clinical factors on the frequency of clinical follow-up and the application of diagnostic modalities could not be effectively addressed. Attribution of the decision to the information gathered by one or more of the diagnostic tools was done with care, but when derived from record review, is recognised to be imperfect. Finally, there are no safeguards to assure that the clinical INTs in this series were always appropriate. While we believe that most times they were, and therefore the tests on which they are based were of positive value to the patient, we acknowledge that it is a leap to conclude that a diagnostic modality is good just because it leads to an INT.

### Contemporary predictors of death and sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot enrolled in the INDICATOR cohort [^112QZTmF]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite significant advances in the early management of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and 20-year survival rates exceeding 90%, residual hemodynamic and electrophysiological abnormalities contribute to increasing morbidity and mortality rates beginning in the third decade of life. Since the first reports of sudden death in survivors of TOF repair from 40 years ago, numerous attempts have been made to define risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. Most reports, however, suffer from a small sample size of patients predominantly operated in the late 1950s to the early 1970s when surgical techniques were evolving rapidly. Furthermore, the ability to noninvasively assess RV size and function, which are notably affected by sequelae of TOF surgery, was limited and imprecise. A previous multicentre cohort study identified QRS duration ≥ 180 ms as a predictor of death and clinical arrhythmia in patients with repaired TOF. However, as with other studies from that era, assessment of the RV was imprecise. More recently, the advent of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has allowed accurate and reproducible noninvasive measurements of biventricular size and function and quantification of valvular regurgitation. Several single-centre studies have indicated that severe RV dilatation and RV and/or LV dysfunction measured by CMR are important risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes, superseding the importance of QRS prolongation as a predictor of outcome. These studies, similarly, were hampered by small sample sizes and paucity of hard outcomes.

To overcome these limitations and to determine risk factors for death and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a large contemporary cohort of TOF repair survivors, we have established the International Multicenter TOF Registry (INDICATOR). The goals of this registry, which enrolled contemporarily managed patients from four large congenital heart centres in the United States, Canada and Europe, were to allow risk stratification based on clinical, ECG, exercise and CMR data and to explore whether these risk factors vary according to type of repair.

### Outcomes of primary vs. staged repair in 4628 neonates with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116EEJS]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are two strategies to treat neonates with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), primary repair (PR) and staged repair (SR). There is still a debate on the best surgical strategy. We aim to compare PR and SR regarding mortality and comorbidities. We executed a systematic search on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), and Cochrane Central till January 10, 2025. We included studies with neonates with symptomatic TOF who received an intervention within the first 30 days of life, either with SR or PR. The primary outcomes were in-hospital, 30-day, and 2-year mortality rates. We used Review Manager to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for categorical variables and the mean difference (MD) and its 95% CI for continuous outcomes. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. The I-squared test was used to assess heterogeneity. The RRs of mortality at 30 days and 2 years were comparable between both approaches (RR = 0.53; [95% CI = 0.22–1.27], P = 0.15) and (RR = 1.22; [95% CI = 0.0.99–1.51], P = 0.07) respectively. While the length of hospital stay (MD = 18.47 days; [95% CI = 10.87–26.08], P < 0.00001), length of intensive care unit stay (MD = 4.18 days; [95% CI = 3.12–5.23], P < 0.00001), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (MD = 46,47 day; [95% CI = 37.71–55.24], P < 0.00001), all were longer with SR. PR and SR strategies are equivalent regarding short- and long-term mortality in neonates with symptomatic TOF.

CONCLUSIONS

A combination of demographic, clinical, echocardiographic, and CMR characteristics can contribute to prediction of risk in patients late after TOF repair. Further study of the proposed score will be required to evaluate the utility of risk stratification for identification of individuals who may benefit from enhanced surveillance, intensified medical therapy, and/or optimally timed interventions.

### Prognostic value of preoperative absolute lymphocyte count in children with tetralogy of Fallot [^111BNVbM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although many studies have explored the prognostic value of ALC for outcomes in other types of cardiac surgery, as far as we know, this is the first study in children with TOF. In this study, we retrospectively compared the preoperative and intraoperative data that may influence the outcome of the patients with TOF, minimized the effect of the confounding factors through various methods, and finally clarified the prognostic value of ALC in children with TOF. The main finding of the current data is that the children with TOF with a lower ALC level preoperatively tend to have a poor prognosis after surgery, and the cutoff point is 4.36×10⁹/L. In addition, younger age, longer CPB time, lower BSA, and preoperative SpO₂ are also independent risk factors for poor prognosis. We also established a practical risk score for prognosis, hoping to identify high‐risk patients as early as possible to improve the patients' prognosis.

In‐hospital mortality in our study (0.42%) was significantly lower than that in other similar studies,(ranging from 1.99% to 4.13%), but similar to the results from a previous study in Fuwai hospital(0.24%). This might be mainly because some patients with a poor prognosis forewent treatment and died at home because of economic reasons and the national culture. In addition, it is closely related to the patients' inclusion criteria and the advances in surgical techniques. Our results suggest a male predominance, which was also reported in other studies. The specific mechanism remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Some studies suggest that this may be because the Y chromosome is more susceptible than the X chromosome. Furthermore, the sex variations in this study were more prominent than in other studies, which may be related to sex discrimination and the preference for male children in China.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot — long-term outcomes and sudden death after repair indicate that late survival after tetralogy repair is excellent; 35-year survival is approximately 85%, yet there remains a concerning incidence of unexpected sudden death during long-term follow-up, estimated to be on the order of 2.5% per decade of follow-up. Table 15 reports series such as Murphy 1993 with 6% of cases followed up 30 years (No. of patients 163), Nollert 1997 with 3% of cases followed up 25 years (No. of patients 490), Norgaard 1999 with 5.6% of cases followed up 25 years (No. of patients 125), Gatzoulis 2000 with 6% of cases followed up 21 years (No. of patients 793), and Silka 1998 with approximately 2 deaths per 1000 patient-years; VT appears to be the mechanism responsible for most events, although rapidly conducted IART (atrial flutter) or AV block may be responsible in some cases.

Statistical Analysis

Summary statistics were calculated for the population as a whole and after stratification by occurrence of the primary outcome. Categorical variables were summarized by counts and proportions, and continuous variables by means ± SD or medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate.

Cumulative incidence curves were created for the primary and secondary outcomes, overall and stratified by age (< 40 years or 40+ years) at enrollment. To mitigate against immortal time bias (that could be introduced by the study entry requirement that each patient have a CMR), time zero in time‐to‐event analyses was defined by the date of the CMR (and events before this were not counted). With the exception of cumulative incidence plots and estimation of event rates, all survival analyses were restricted to patients ≥ 18 years at entry, given the very small number of outcome events observed in those < 18 years at entry.

### Long-term outcomes of tetralogy of Fallot repair: a 30-year experience with 960 patients [^1151rnYc]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study evaluates the long-term results of tetralogy of Fallot repair and assesses the risk factors for adverse outcomes.

Methods

This retrospective study included 960 patients who underwent transatrial transpulmonary tetralogy of Fallot repair between 1990 and 2020.

Results

A transannular patch was placed in 722 patients, and pulmonary valve preservation was achieved in 233 patients. The median age at tetralogy of Fallot repair was 9.4 (interquartile range, 6.2–14.2) months. The median follow-up duration was 10.6 (interquartile range, 5.4–16.3) years. There were 8 early deaths (0.8%) and 20 late deaths (2.1%). Genetic syndrome and pulmonary valve annulus Z score less than -3 were risk factors for mortality. The survival was 97.7% (95% confidence interval, 96.4–98.5) and 94.5% (95% confidence interval, 90.9–96.7) at 10 and 30 years, respectively. Freedom from any reoperation was 86.4% (95% confidence interval, 83.6–88.7) and 65.4% (95% confidence interval, 59.8–70.4) at 10 and 20 years, respectively. Postoperative right ventricular outflow tract peak gradient of 25 mm Hg or greater correlated with reoperation. Propensity score-matched analysis demonstrated that freedom from pulmonary valve replacement at 15 years was higher in the pulmonary valve preservation group compared with the transannular patch group (98.2% vs 78.4%, P = 0.004). Freedom from reoperation for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction at 15 years was lower in the pulmonary valve preservation group compared with the transannular patch group (P = 0.006).

Conclusions

The long-term outcomes of tetralogy of Fallot repair are excellent. A postoperative right ventricular outflow tract peak gradient less than 25 mm Hg appears to be optimal to prevent reoperation. If the pulmonary valve size is suitable, pulmonary valve preservation reduces the risk of pulmonary valve replacement, yet increases the reoperation rate for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

Severity of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) and ACHD Anatomic and Physiological (AP) classification — In a patient with congenital heart disease (CHD), severity of disease is determined by native anatomy, surgical repair, and current physiology. This variability is illustrated by tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) examples ranging from a valve-sparing primary repair with excellent biventricular function with normal exercise capacity and no arrhythmias to a transannular patch repair resulting in severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR) with right ventricular (RV) enlargement, biventricular dysfunction, and ventricular tachycardia (VT). To categorize disease severity more comprehensively, the writing committee developed an ACHD AP classification system that incorporates CHD anatomic variables as well as physiological variables, many of which have prognostic value in patients with ACHD, and is intended to capture the complexity of ACHD anatomy and physiology, which are not always correlated.

### Contemporary predictors of death and sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot enrolled in the INDICATOR cohort [^112GCoW1]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) experience increased rates of mortality and morbidity in adulthood. This study was designed to identify risk factors for death and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a large contemporary cohort of patients with repaired TOF.

Methods

Subjects with repaired TOF from four large congenital heart centres in the United States, Canada and Europe were enrolled. Clinical, ECG, exercise, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and outcome data were analysed.

Results

Of the 873 patients (median age 24.4 years), 32 (3.7%) reached the primary outcome (28 deaths, 4 sustained VT; median age at outcome 38 years; median time from CMR to outcome 1.9 years). Cox proportional-hazards regression identified RV mass-to-volume ratio ≥ 0.3 g/mL (HR, 5.04; 95% CI 2.3 to 11.0; p < 0.001), LV EF z score < -2.0 (HR, 3.34; 95% CI 1.59 to 7.01; p = 0.001), and history of atrial tachyarrhythmia (HR, 3.65; 95% CI 1.75 to 7.62; p = 0.001) as outcome predictors. RV dysfunction was predictive of the outcome similar to LV dysfunction. In subgroup analysis of 315 subjects with echocardiographic assessment of RV systolic pressure, higher pressure (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.62; p < 0.001) was associated with death and sustained VT independent of RV hypertrophy and LV dysfunction.

Conclusions

RV hypertrophy, ventricular dysfunction and atrial tachyarrhythmias are predictive of death and sustained VT in adults with repaired TOF. These findings may inform risk stratification and the design of future therapeutic trials.

### Role of QRS fragmentation for risk stratification in adults with tetralogy of Fallot [^112hnV7q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) remain at risk for cardiovascular events despite successful repair. Some of the current risk stratification tools require advanced imaging and invasive studies, and hence are difficult to apply to routine patient care. A recent study showed that QRS fragmentation (QRS -f) is predictive of mortality in patients with TOF. The current study aims to validate this result by assessing whether severity of QRS -f could predict all-cause mortality in a different TOF population. Methods and Results The authors reviewed the Mayo Adult Congenital Heart Disease database for patients with TOF who had ECG from 1990–2017. QRS -f was defined as notches in QRS complex in ≥ 2 contiguous leads on ECG, not related to bundle branch block, and classified as none, mild (≤ 3 leads), moderate (4 leads), or severe (≥ 5 leads). Of 465 patients (age 37 ± 14 years) in the study, QRS -f was present in 161 (35%): mild (n = 43, 9%), moderate (n = 77, 17%), and severe (n = 41, 9%). There were 55 deaths (12%) during 13.6 ± 8.2 years of follow-up. Severity of QRS -f remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality after adjustment for other ECG parameters, patient demographics, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmia (hazard ratio, 1.74 per class; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–2.93 [P = 0.041]). Conclusions The presence of severe QRS -f may be used as complementary data to the usual clinical indices to determine whether interventions such as invasive electrophysiology study should be performed in patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or to proceed with pulmonary valve replacement in patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation with ventricular volumes below the guideline-directed threshold for intervention.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot — arrhythmia and sudden death epidemiology and ICD consideration: In adults with repaired TOF, prevalence rates for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias have been estimated to be 20% and 15%, respectively, with steep increases after 45 years of age. The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) after surgical repair of TOF is approximately 2% per decade. Primary prevention ICDs should generally be considered in patients who otherwise meet standard qualifying criteria, specifically left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≤ 35% with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III symptoms, and there may be a role for primary prevention ICDs in selected adults with TOF who have additional risk factors for SCD but would not meet standard criteria otherwise.

Tetralogy of Fallot — therapeutic recommendations: For adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), pulmonary valve replacement (surgical or percutaneous) for relief of symptoms is recommended for moderate or greater pulmonary regurgitation (PR) with cardiovascular symptoms not otherwise explained (Class I, Level B-NR). Pulmonary valve replacement (surgical or percutaneous) is reasonable for preservation of ventricular size and function in asymptomatic patients with ventricular enlargement or dysfunction and moderate or greater PR (Class IIa, Level B-NR). Primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is reasonable in adults with TOF and multiple risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) (Class IIa, Level B-NR). Surgical pulmonary valve replacement may be reasonable for adults with repaired TOF and moderate or greater PR when other lesions require surgical interventions (Class IIb, Level C-EO). Pulmonary valve replacement, in addition to arrhythmia management, may be considered for adults with repaired TOF and moderate or greater PR and ventricular tachyarrhythmia (Class IIb, Level C-EO).

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) staged repair versus primary repair in symptomatic neonates showed no difference in mortality (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.66–2.24), a trend toward more reinterventions in the initial palliation group (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.96–2.98), and no difference in reintervention after the definitive repair (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.66–2.64); the cumulative LOS was longer with staged repair, 44 days (IQR, 27–75 days) versus primary repair, 23 days (IQR, 15–34 days) (P < .001), and delaying complete repair with initial palliation may permit more patients to undergo a valve-sparing procedure (staged repair, 7.6% vs primary repair, 0%; p = 0.06).

### Right ventricular function late after total repair of tetralogy of Fallot [^113MYopA]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Over the past decades, life expectancy in patients with congenital heart disease has increased dramatically. However, serious complications may develop late after total repair in infancy. These complications are usually the result of longstanding pulmonary regurgitation, which leads to dilatation of the right ventricle and an increased risk for severe arrhythmias. Therefore lifelong follow-up in these patients is required. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the current imaging tool of choice because it offers superior imaging quality and enables accurate quantification of functional parameters such as flow volumes and systolic and diastolic performance.

The other 3 studies, focused on reporting trends in survival in patients with CHD after congenital cardiac surgery and/or cardiac interventions. They all noted a distinct improvement in survival over time in patients with all types of CHD, including a subset of patients with TOF and congenital cardiac surgery, congruent with our results. Larsen et alreported, in a Danish nationwide study, 10-year freedom of death among patients with TOF who underwent surgery of 61% in 1977 to 1989 and 95% in 2003 to 2015. A Norwegian study of postoperative survival in patients with TOF reported a cumulative survival of 86.3% until patients were aged 16 years in 1970 to 1989 and 94.3% in 1990 to 2011. Raissadati et alreported, in a 6-decade study in Finland, a 22-year survival rate postsurgery in patients with TOF that improved from 87% in 1953 to 1989 up to 90% in 1990 to 2009, with an HR of 0.52 for death in 1990 to 2009 (95% CI, 0.28–0.94). The same study also reported a significant decrease in early mortality (up to 30 postoperative days) from 9% in 1953 to 1989 to 1% in 2000 to 2009. A large US study using data from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium, found an increased risk of long-term mortality after surgery for CHDs compared with the general population. When specifically studying survival trends in patients with TOF, the investigators noted an improvement from the first study period (1982–1992), with a 15-year survival estimate of 91.4%, to the latest period (1998–2003), with a 15-year survival estimate of 93.7%.

Mortality prediction in contemporary adults with rTOF

It is well-recognized that no single risk factor accurately predicts adverse outcome in patients with rTOF. A 2008 multifactorial risk score from a retrospective multicenter study was pioneering. However, the previous study included patients who were already considered high risk with significant PR and included recurrent events in those with secondary prevention ICDs, hence limiting its application. Furthermore, invasive tests (LV end-diastolic pressure and VT inducibility) included in this 2008 risk score are not considered pragmatic in unselected patients, especially for serial study. The addition of LGE CMR to the risk assessment armamentarium that we propose here is noninvasive, hence safer and more applicable. In addition, other noninvasive risk predictors for outcomes have since been described. In keeping with the largest multicenter observational registry study to date (International Multicenter TOF Registry), atrial arrhythmia and CMR-derived RVEF and LVEF were predictors of outcome in our study. Prospective studies have also identified other CMR-derived factors including RAAi ≥ 16 cm 9 and increased RVOT akinetic length, reduced peak VO 2, increased BNP, and increased RVSP. These parameters were also univariable predictors of outcome in our study. In contrast, QRS duration > 180 ms, previous palliative shunt, or ventriculotomy were not predictive of outcome. This may relate to the changing profiles of more contemporary adult rTOF cohorts over the past few decades. In the recent era, a more conservative approach to RVOT reconstruction, avoidance of ventriculotomy with a trans-atrial/trans-pulmonary approach, and primary repair at a much younger age has evolved. Our study population reflects our tertiary center's practice of being proactive in treating asymptomatic patients with PR before RV dysfunction ensues as per evolving consensus criteria. Hence we cannot infer that the lack of association between PR and outcomes implies PR is not a risk factor.

Tetralogy of Fallot in neonates — primary complete repair versus staged approaches: Primary, complete repair was associated with a greater hazard of death over 2 years compared with staged repair (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.05–2.06; n = 1032 vs n = 1331), whereas pooled multicenter data comparing primary, complete repair (n = 230) versus staged repair (n = 342) showed no difference in overall hazard of mortality over 5 years (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.49–1.38). Staged strategies had a greater hazard of reintervention (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.17–2.05). Valve-sparing repair occurred in 0% after right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stent palliation versus 41% after primary, complete surgical correction before age 3 months. Across multiple institutions, length of stay was shorter after primary repair, 19 days (interquartile range [IQR], 14–30 days) versus 32 days (IQR, 22–49 days) for staged repair (P < .001), and multicenter analyses reported more total costs associated with staged repair after adjustment for confounding by indication.

### Prognostic value of preoperative absolute lymphocyte count in children with tetralogy of Fallot [^117715K7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a common congenital heart defect characterized by ventricular septal defect, pulmonary artery stenosis, overriding aortic root, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Although its birth prevalence is low, with an incidence of 3.6 per 10 000 live births globallyand 2.1 in China, it is still one of the most common congenital heart defects. Because of the advancements in surgical techniques, more children can survive, and have excellent long‐term outcomes through TOF repair. The prognosis after TOF repair is related to many factors, such as age, weight, surgical eras, concurrent genetic syndrome, previous palliative procedure, and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time; however, few studies have considered the impact of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC).

As one of the most common, easily acquired, and low‐cost preoperative indexes, ALC is closely related to the general health status and chronic inflammatory state. Previous studies of other types of cardiac surgery in adults, and children, showed that patients with a decreased ALC preoperatively tended to have adverse outcomes. However, the detailed effect of ALC on the prognosis of children with TOF remains unknown. Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to determine the prognostic value of preoperative ALC in children with TOF.

RESULTS

Study Population

Of the 1808 eligible patients enrolled in the INDICATOR database, 1552 fulfilled entry criteria, forming the main study cohort (Figure 1). Birth years ranged from 1932 to 2012. Of these 1552 patients (Table 1), a majority had TOF with pulmonary stenosis (84%), and 16% had TOF with pulmonary atresia. Nearly one third of patients had an initial palliative shunt before TOF repair. Median age at repair was 2.1 (interquartile range, 0.4–6.0) years, with 47% of patients having their TOF repair before 1986. Half of the patients had a transannular patch repair, and 14% had a right ventricle‐to‐pulmonary artery conduit repair. Over half (58%) of patients had a PVR after TOF repair. Qualifying CMR was performed at a median age of 23.4 (interquartile range, 15.6–35.6) years. Atrial arrhythmias and nonsustained VT were experienced by 8% and 12% of patients, respectively.

Several differences were found between the development and external validation cohort baseline characteristics (Table 1). Patients in the external validation group had an older age at repair and CMR, earlier repair era, longer follow‐up time, and higher body mass index (BMI) (all P < 0.001). In addition, the external validation group had a lower percentage of TOF with pulmonary atresia diagnoses (with corresponding lower major aortopulmonary collateral arteries and lower percentage of transannular patch repair), and differences in several CMR parameters.

Survival from initial diagnosis was 50% among the entire cohort of fetuses diagnosed with TOF/APV, including those for whom pregnancy termination or nonintervention was elected. Overall survival among the 78 fetuses with TOF/APV and an initial intention to treat was 64% (Figure 3). Seventy percent of liveborn babies survived. Five patients were lost to follow‐up after initial hospitalization, but among the remaining patients, there were no documented deaths after 13 months of age.

### Pathophysiologic and prognostic implications of right atrial hypertension in adults with tetralogy of Fallot [^113wh8Bs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital heart disease is an important but understudied cause of heart failure and arrhythmia, and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is one of the most common congenital heart disease diagnoses in adults. 1 Right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction frequently develops in adults with repaired TOF 2, 3 and is one of the criteria used to guide the decision for pulmonary valve replacement. 4, 5 RV systolic dysfunction in TOF is believed to be caused by cyanosis and RV pressure overload before TOF repair 6 and RV volume and/or pressure overload caused by residual or recurrent hemodynamic lesions after TOF repair. 7 RV diastolic dysfunction typically precedes systolic dysfunction, 8, 9 suggesting that this might be an earlier indicator for ventricular dysfunction, but the assessment of RV diastolic function is challenging, and there are no validated noninvasive indexes of RV diastolic function in the TOF population.

Although there are robust invasive and noninvasive hemodynamic studies of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, 8, 9 the prevalence and clinical implications of RV diastolic dysfunction based on invasive hemodynamic data have not been studied in adults with TOF. Right atrial pressure (RAP) is a composite metric of right heart function that is related to RV diastolic function, volume status, and right atrial (RA) compliance. Increased RAP is a predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure due to acquired heart disease. 10, 11 It seems likely that TOF patients might have abnormal RA and RV mechanics caused by myocardial injury and remodeling because of prior surgical and ongoing hemodynamic insult, thus causing abnormal RAP. We hypothesized that RAP, as assessed by the gold standard of invasive hemodynamic assessment, would be associated with disease severity and cardiovascular adverse events in adults with TOF.

Discussion

Our study maps the evolving strategy and results of surgical TOF management over several decades along with the consequences of chosen type of initial surgical repair. Thanks to the centralization of pediatric cardiac care in our country and the possibility of cross‐matching with national mortality and cardiovascular interventions databases we were able to perform a population‐based analysis reaching over several decades of follow‐up. While early mortality is not an issue in the current era, late morbidity and specifically the need for pulmonary valve revalvulation still presents a significant burden. Excellent early results in this and other series, allow for elective repair in mildly or asymptomatic patients between 6 and 12 months of age as reflected by the current median age of 0.8 years in this study.

Type of initial repair has shifted towards transatrial repair over time with pulmonary valvotomy and preservation of the pulmonary annulus and valve. Such approach, as expected, has increased the freedom from pulmonary revalvulation as compared with techniques not preserving the pulmonary annulus, but interestingly risk for any reintervention is slightly higher if compared with transventricular repair without pulmonary annulus incision. From our data it is unclear, whether these 2 procedures are truly comparable because of the more proactive approach to hemodynamic reinterventions in the current era in general. Historically, pulmonary revalvulation has been frequently postponed until symptoms of right heart failure whereas now indication is mainly elective based on right ventricular metrics derived from cardiac magnetic resonance and functional capacity. Other studies have shown superior or equivalent outcomes of transatrial repair compared with transventricular, however, with higher incidence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction requiring reoperation.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot — ventricular tachycardia (VT) risk markers and follow-up are summarized as follows: emphasis has "shifted away from AV block toward VT as the more common mechanism for sudden death in tetralogy patients", and multiple variables have been "linked to an elevated likelihood of VT, although the predictive accuracy for all these items remains imperfect", including long-standing palliative shunts, older age at definitive surgery, abnormal right ventricular hemodynamics, high-grade ectopy on Holter monitoring, and inducible VT at electrophysiological study. Correlation exists between VT and electrocardiographic findings, particularly "QRS duration greater than 180 ms", and "The QRS width on ECG can thus be viewed as a crude proxy for size and function of the right ventricle and can be tracked easily in any adult tetralogy patient who is not pacemaker dependent". The approach to an asymptomatic adult "is a matter of debate"; "Most clinicians rely on a yearly evaluation… supplemented every few years with Holter monitoring or exercise testing… as well as periodic echocardiograms or MRIs", and if nonsustained VT is found or right ventricular function worsens, "opinions still vary widely", with some who "would recommend electrophysiology study", some who "would advocate surgery for pulmonary valve replacement if regurgitation exists", some who "would prescribe antiarrhythmic drugs", some who "would implant a primary prevention defibrillator; and some refrain from".

### Health-related quality of life after neonatal treatment of symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot: insights from the congenital cardiac research collaborative [^113iDspu]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Advances in healthcare have resulted in significant improvement in the survival of pediatric patients with chronic medical conditions, including infants with complex congenital heart disease, CHD. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common form of cyanotic CHD. A subset of neonates with TOF are symptomatic (sTOF) due to ductal dependence or the severity of cyanosis, necessitating early intervention. Management strategies for sTOF neonates include primary repair or staged repair, which consists of an initial palliation followed by later complete repair. Previously, the Congenital Cardiac Research Collaborative (CCRC) performed a large, multicenter study of neonates with sTOF; this study demonstrated an early survival benefit with staged repair, but this difference was mitigated over medium-term follow-up.

Since the overall survival of infants with CHD has significantly improved, the assessment of long-term functional outcomes associated with survival is paramount. Neurodevelopmental outcome research in TOF highlights vulnerabilities across multiple domains, including intellectual functioning, language, visuospatial processing, and executive functioning. Higher rates of anxiety, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism are also concerning. Disease severity and associated genetic disorders lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental challenges in children with TOF. Given the resources and time required for neurodevelopmental evaluation and early intervention, research to date shows low rates of return for children with CHD generally.

Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures are an efficient and effective way to screen for the impact of a medical condition on an individual's everyday life in the areas of physical, emotional, social, and academic functioning. These standardized rating scales are completed by the patient and/or a proxy (usually their parent/guardian); thus, these tools offer valuable information about beliefs, perceptions, and discrepancies between respondents. As infants with CHD require lifelong follow-up, HRQOL measures are also a component of quality, comprehensive care to help determine the value of healthcare services. This is particularly germane in the TOF population, as repeated medical interventions are often required and could lead to changes in clinical outcomes. Yet, despite numerous studies evaluating outcomes of patients with TOF, relatively few have evaluated HRQOL, and even fewer compare HRQOL to clinical outcomes. In addition, it remains unclear how HRQOL may change over time throughout childhood. In our population of interest, sTOF, although there was no difference in mortality between treatment strategies, the overall morbidity burden favored those who underwent a primary repair.

Left ventricular (LV) size and function in adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot — LV systolic dysfunction is present in up to 20% of adults with repaired TOF and has been shown to be a strong independent predictor of death and sustained ventricular tachycardia; a CMR investigation in 100 patients with repaired TOF demonstrated a close linear correlation between the ejection fractions of the right and left ventricles. Given the clinical importance of LV dysfunction, measurements of LV size, global and regional function, and viability are integral to the CMR examination protocol.

### Impact of right ventricular pressure load after repair of tetralogy of Fallot [^116pwQ7B]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Following surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), pulmonary regurgitation (PR) frequently emerges as the predominant residual lesion causing progressive right ventricular (RV) enlargement, functional impairment, and, potentially, sudden cardiac death. Surgical management of patients after TOF repair has therefore shifted toward a pulmonary valve‐sparing repair technique with the aim of preserving RV integrity. Subsequently, some degree of residual pulmonary stenosis is typically accepted after repair and has been shown to have beneficial effects on the described adverse RV remodeling process by reducing PR and RV enlargement without compromising RV function. Furthermore, mild residual RV outflow tract (RVOT) gradients may also postpone the need for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). In contrast, recent data from several studies demonstrated elevated RV pressure as an independent predictor for adverse outcome. These apparently paradoxical findings suggest that the effect of RV pressure load on biventricular remodeling in patients with repaired TOF is not yet sufficiently characterized and that the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that link increased RV pressures with unfavorable outcomes are unclear. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to assess the hemodynamic impact and prognostic relevance of RV pressure load in a larger cohort of patients with repaired TOF.

### About tetralogy of Fallot | Congenital heart defects (CHDs)… [^117C7beF]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What it is Tetralogy of Fallot is made up of the following four defects of the heart and its blood vessels:

- In a normal heart, it only receives blood from the left ventricle. In this defect, the aortic valve sits directly on top of the VSD.
- The muscular wall of the lower right chamber of the heart is thicker than normal
- ventricular hypertrophy. Because a baby with tetralogy of Fallot may need surgery or other procedures soon after birth. This condition is considered a critical congenital heart defect. Testing and diagnosis Tetralogy of Fallot may be diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after a baby is born. During pregnancy During pregnancy, screening tests check for birth defects and other conditions. An ultrasound, a tool that creates pictures of the baby, may detect tetralogy of Fallot.

If the health care provider suspects tetralogy of Fallot from the ultrasound, they can request a fetal echocardiogram confirming the diagnosis. A fetal echocardiogram is a more detailed ultrasound of the baby's heart. This test can show problems with the structure of the heart and how the heart is working with this defect. After the baby is born Tetralogy of Fallot usually is diagnosed after a baby is born. It is often diagnosed after the infant has an episode of turning blue during crying or feeding. Findings on a physical exam may make a healthcare provider suspect a baby has tetralogy of Fallot. This may include bluish-looking skin or hearing a heart murmur. If these findings are present, the health care provider might request one or more tests to confirm the diagnosis. The most common test is an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. Tetralogy of Fallot can also be detected with newborn pulse oximetry screening.

Newborn screening using pulse oximetry can identify some infants with tetralogy of Fallot before they show any symptoms. Treatments Tetralogy of Fallot can be treated by surgery soon after the baby is born. During surgery, doctors widen or replace the pulmonary valve and enlarge the passage to the pulmonary artery. They also will place a patch over the VSD to close the hole between the two lower chambers of the heart. These actions will improve blood flow to the lungs and the rest of the body.

### Long-term outcomes of tetralogy of Fallot… [^113EreGU]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

In this cohort study of 3283 patients with tetralogy of Fallot, survival following complete repair was 98. 6%,
97. 8%, 97. 1%,
95. 5%, and 94. 5% for 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, and 25-year survival, respectively, with an early peaking hazard of mortality shortly after repair. Statistically significant associations with decreased long-term survival included staged repair, non–valve-sparing operation, repair in earlier surgical era, and presence of a genetic abnormality. Transplant-free survival following hospital discharge for TOF repair was treated as a time-dependent outcome and modeled parametrically. Parametric probability estimates for this time-dependent outcome used models based on multiple overlapping phases of risk using the PROC HAZARD function available with SAS.

The HAZARD procedure uses maximum likelihood estimates to resolve risk distribution of time to event in up to 3 phases of risk. An early steep hazard followed by a late increasing hazard was found for the primary outcome of transplant-free survival. As a result, a 2-phase survival parametrization was used to estimate survival. Therefore, early and late phase survival was defined as less than 6 years and at least 6 years following repair, respectively. The overall hazard of mortality or transplant in patients with simple TOF following repair showed an early steep hazard followed by a late, increasing hazard.

As a result, a 2-phase survival parametrization was used to estimate transplant-free survival: an early postdischarge period with high hazard that decreases rapidly before reaching a minimum at 6 years following discharge and a late period with low but steadily increasing hazard beyond 6 years following repair and with acceleration around 20 years postoperatively. Patients with repaired TOF have a biphasic hazard for mortality, an early steep hazard during the first 4 years after TOF repair, and a late hazard with a slow increase in mortality after 6 years and acceleration 20 years later. Earlier surgical eras had an inverse association with the chances of survival in the early postoperative phase, indicating higher residual postoperative morbidity, which is consistent with previous reports. 8, 9, 17, 19 In the PCCC cohort, the late-phase survival and COD have not substantially changed over time.
