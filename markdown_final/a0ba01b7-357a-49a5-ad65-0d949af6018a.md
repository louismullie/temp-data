## Question

What are outpatient treatment options for cocaine use disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outpatient treatment options for cocaine use disorder and how to structure them in practice, including pharmacologic options, psychosocial treatments, monitoring, special populations, and what to avoid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative current guidelines to anchor recommendations. Then, I should compare the strength of evidence for psychosocial versus pharmacologic interventions. Next, I will specify practical dosing and structure of care, including contingency management operations and urine testing cadence. After that, I need to consider special populations such as co-occurring opioid use disorder and ADHD. Finally, I should clarify what not to use and address implementation caveats, while self-checking any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the guideline foundation to avoid drifting into lower-quality evidence, because anchoring to standards of care is critical here; the ASAM/AAAP 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for stimulant use disorder is the current gold-standard and explicitly recommends contingency management as the primary component of treatment for cocaine use disorder, with CBT, Community Reinforcement Approach, and the Matrix Model as preferred psychosocial adjuncts, and it advises considering bupropion to promote abstinence from cocaine, all in outpatient settings where feasible [^116cWrvR] [^115fzv9S] [^111cuirm].

> Hold on, I should verify the comparative roles of psychosocial versus pharmacologic treatments, because if I overstate medication effects I could mislead the plan; high-quality reviews and the 2024 ASAM/AAAP guidance concur that psychosocial interventions, especially contingency management, are first-line and should be the backbone of outpatient care, with medications used adjunctively given that no pharmacotherapy has regulatory approval specifically for cocaine use disorder and effect sizes for drugs are generally modest and population-dependent [^116cWrvR] [^1113aEJa].

> I will now examine the pharmacotherapy starting with bupropion, since that is often the most asked-about agent; wait, I initially thought bupropion had an FDA-labeled indication for cocaine use disorder, but that is incorrect and I need to correct myself because no medication is FDA-approved for CUD, and guideline recommendations to consider bupropion are off-label and evidence-based rather than regulatory, with the ASAM/AAAP 2024 guideline suggesting it may promote abstinence and commonly used outpatient dosing being SR 150 mg twice daily for 12 to 25 weeks alongside psychosocial treatment, while I should screen for seizure risk and eating disorders and monitor blood pressure and neuropsychiatric adverse effects during titration and maintenance [^116cWrvR] [^112pYXhT] [^1113aEJa] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review other medications with mixed or limited evidence so I do not overgeneralize; disulfiram may increase abstinence versus placebo in some trials and can be considered in select, motivated patients, particularly with co-occurring alcohol use, though adherence and hepatotoxicity monitoring are essential, modafinil shows heterogeneous results overall with some signal in subgroups such as co-occurring alcohol dependence and benefit for sleep normalization during early abstinence, gabapentin evidence is limited to small open-label data and should not be first-line for CUD itself, amantadine may help if severe withdrawal symptoms predominate early in treatment, antipsychotics have not shown efficacy for cocaine outcomes, and cannabidiol and nefazodone have not demonstrated benefit for craving or relapse prevention in RCTs [^117T5CCL] [^116Z9o5q] [^116dVjVH] [^112cJdzB] [^116Xc1D2] [^114CzBzM] [^114zYKAA].

> Let me consider the psychosocial core carefully because this will drive outcomes; contingency management should be the primary component of outpatient CUD care, operationalized with immediate, escalating incentives contingent on cocaine-negative urine tests and attendance, and combined with structured psychotherapies such as CBT, the Community Reinforcement Approach, or the Matrix Model, all of which have supportive guideline endorsements and RCT evidence, including dose–response features showing higher voucher values yield longer continuous abstinence and better follow-up abstinence [^115fzv9S] [^111cuirm] [^1113aEJa] [^117KcD4L] [^112L1Kpk].

> I should double-check whether combination approaches outperform single modalities, because this affects how I write the plan; the ASAM/AAAP 2024 guidance explicitly recommends offering pharmacotherapy such as bupropion in conjunction with contingency management plus CBT or CRA or Matrix, rather than using medication or psychotherapy alone, and this integrated approach is associated with higher abstinence rates and better retention in practice settings where CM can be implemented [^116cWrvR] [^115fzv9S] [^111cuirm].

> Now, I need to translate this into a practical outpatient structure, but wait, I should verify that early treatment intensity matters; an initial 4-week phase with frequent urine testing, ideally three times weekly with immediate feedback and incentives, paired with weekly CBT or CRA sessions and rapid initiation of bupropion when appropriate, followed by a 12- to 16-week maintenance phase with weekly testing and continued CM and psychotherapy, then a continuing care phase with gradually reduced CM frequency and monthly booster sessions for at least 6 to 12 months, aligns with the evidence base and guideline-consistent practice, and I can use measurement-based care principles to track DSM-5 symptom change and functioning even though these MBC frameworks are best described in OUD literature, as the approach is generalizable to substance use care [^115fzv9S] [^111cuirm] [^1113aEJa] [^115T49BC].

> I should confirm the monitoring elements to ensure safety and fidelity; baseline assessment should include urine toxicology, cardiovascular risk review, seizure risk and medication interactions before starting bupropion, then weekly urine testing early on with incentives tied to objective results, structured craving measures, adverse effect checks, and periodic review of DSM-5 CUD criteria status to inform step-up or step-down decisions consistent with measurement-based care principles [^116cWrvR] [^1113aEJa] [^115T49BC].

> But wait, what if the patient has co-occurring opioid use disorder, which is common; I need to ensure we do not compromise MOUD, so we should prioritize evidence-based MOUD with methadone or buprenorphine per ASAM OUD guidelines and add contingency management specifically targeting stimulant abstinence, recognizing that CM improves several outcomes among patients receiving MOUD, while evidence is insufficient to recommend routinely adding agents like bupropion, desipramine, amantadine, or gabapentin to methadone or buprenorphine solely to reduce cocaine use in opioid-dependent cocaine users [^1153sBZK] [^114fTqVB] [^112bR4Qs].

> I need to check for ADHD because it meaningfully co-occurs and can complicate recovery; adults with ADHD have high lifetime prevalence of cocaine use and CUD, so concurrent assessment and treatment of ADHD is appropriate, with careful coordination of contingency management and psychotherapy intensity, and if stimulants are considered for ADHD they should be prescribed cautiously within a stable recovery framework and close monitoring for misuse or escalation should be implemented [^114myk8B] [^112kqvew].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding antipsychotics or novel agents because negative or null data exist; antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, or haloperidol have not shown significant benefits for cocaine outcomes, cannabidiol did not reduce craving or relapse in a well-conducted RCT, and nefazodone was not superior to placebo for abstinence or time to relapse, so these should not be used as primary treatments for CUD, and relying on pharmacotherapy without psychosocial treatment is not supported by the evidence [^116Xc1D2] [^114CzBzM] [^114zYKAA] [^1113aEJa].

> Next, I should review implementation caveats for contingency management because real-world barriers can derail the plan; higher-value incentive schedules produce better abstinence during treatment and predict improved follow-up outcomes, yet cost and regulatory constraints can impede access, so programs should adopt compliant incentive structures and leverage policy guidance supporting CM dissemination in community clinics while maintaining immediate, objective reinforcement contingencies to preserve efficacy [^117KcD4L] [^114fTqVB].

> In summary, I need to ensure the final outpatient plan emphasizes contingency management as the primary component, integrates CBT or CRA or the Matrix Model, and considers adding bupropion SR 150 mg twice daily for 12 to 25 weeks when clinically appropriate, with structured monitoring, and tailored adjustments for co-occurring OUD or ADHD, while avoiding ineffective or unsupported agents, acknowledging that no medications are FDA-approved for CUD and that psychosocial interventions remain the cornerstone of effective outpatient care [^115fzv9S] [^111cuirm] [^112pYXhT] [^117T5CCL] [^1113aEJa].

Outpatient treatment for cocaine use disorder should prioritize **contingency management (CM)** as the most effective intervention [^115fzv9S] [^1113aEJa], with **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** and the **community reinforcement approach (CRA)** as key adjuncts [^111cuirm] [^112L1Kpk]. No medications are **FDA-approved for CUD**, but bupropion may be considered for some patients [^117T5CCL] [^116cWrvR]. Care should be **individualized**, with regular urine testing, measurement-based care, and integration of medical and psychiatric services to address comorbidities and enhance retention [^115T49BC] [^1113aEJa] [^114yAbmP].

---

## Psychosocial interventions

### Contingency management (CM)

**Effectiveness**: CM is the most effective outpatient intervention for CUD [^1113aEJa] [^111cuirm], providing tangible rewards for cocaine-negative urine samples and significantly increasing abstinence and retention [^115fzv9S] [^117KcD4L]. **Implementation**: Use voucher- or prize-based systems with escalating rewards and reset contingencies to maximize effectiveness [^117KcD4L] [^1113aEJa].

---

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

**Effectiveness**: CBT is effective for CUD [^1113aEJa] [^112L1Kpk], targeting triggers, cravings, and relapse prevention through skill-building and cognitive restructuring [^111cuirm]. **Implementation**: Deliver CBT individually or in groups, often alongside CM for synergistic effects.

---

### Community reinforcement approach (CRA)

**Effectiveness**: CRA enhances social, vocational, and recreational reinforcement for abstinence [^1113aEJa] and is especially effective when combined with CM [^111cuirm] [^117KcD4L]. **Implementation**: Integrate CRA with CM and CBT for comprehensive care [^112L1Kpk].

---

### Matrix model

**Effectiveness**: The Matrix Model combines CBT, CM, family education, and 12-step support and is recommended for outpatient CUD care [^111cuirm]. **Implementation**: Provide structured, multicomponent care over 16–20 weeks.

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Currently, **no medications are FDA-approved for CUD**, though some may be considered in specific contexts [^117T5CCL]:

| **Medication** | **Evidence summary** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Bupropion | May promote abstinence in some patients [^116cWrvR] | Consider for patients with comorbid depression or nicotine dependence |
| Disulfiram | - Mixed evidence <br/> - May increase abstinence in some trials [^117T5CCL] | Consider for patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder |
| Modafinil | - Mixed evidence <br/> - May reduce craving in some subgroups [^116Z9o5q] | Consider for patients with severe withdrawal symptoms |
| Amantadine | May reduce use in patients with severe withdrawal [^112cJdzB] | Consider for patients with severe withdrawal symptoms |
| Gabapentin | - Limited evidence <br/> - May reduce use in psychiatric populations [^116dVjVH] | Consider for patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring and follow-up** are essential in outpatient CUD treatment:

- **Urine drug testing**: Conduct regular testing to monitor use and reinforce abstinence [^1113aEJa].

- **Measurement-based care**: Use standardized tools to track symptoms, cravings, and functioning, and adjust treatment accordingly [^115T49BC] [^115KksrA].

- **Relapse prevention**: Provide ongoing support, including booster sessions and access to peer support [^112L1Kpk].

---

## Addressing comorbidities

Comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions are common and **require integrated care** [^112L1Kpk]. **Psychiatric comorbidities** should be treated by addressing co-occurring depression, anxiety, and ADHD with appropriate pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, while **medical comorbidities** are managed through coordinated care for cardiovascular, infectious, and other medical issues [^112mLDEQ].

---

## Barriers and facilitators

Several factors influence **outpatient treatment success**. Key **barriers** include stigma, limited access, financial constraints, and lack of social support, whereas **facilitators** include a strong therapeutic alliance, family involvement, and integrated services [^114yAbmP] [^112L1Kpk].

---

## Emerging treatments

Emerging treatments show promise but **require further research**: preliminary trials of **cannabidiol (CBD)** show no significant benefit [^114CzBzM] [^112KpWeQ], and **GLP-1 receptor agonists** appear feasible in early case series but require larger trials [^115hjvoj].

---

Outpatient treatment for cocaine use disorder should **prioritize CM, CBT, and CRA**, with individualized care, regular monitoring, and integrated management of comorbidities [^115fzv9S].

### Antipsychotic medications for cocaine dependence [^116Xc1D2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a public health problem characterized by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications. Cocaine dependence remains a disorder for which no pharmacological treatment of proven efficacy exists, although considerable advances in the neurobiology of this addiction could guide future medication development.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antipsychotic medications for cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following sources: MEDLINE (1966 to October 2006), EMBASE (1980 to October 2006), CINAHL (1982 to October 2006), and the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register (October 2006). We also searched the reference lists of trials and the main electronic sources of ongoing trials, including the National Research Register, meta-Register of Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials.gov, and conference proceedings likely to contain trials relevant to the review. All searches included non-English language literature.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials focusing on the use of any antipsychotic medication for cocaine dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently evaluated the papers, extracted data, and rated methodological quality.

- **Main results**: Seven small studies were included (293 participants). The antipsychotic drugs studied were risperidone, olanzapine, and haloperidol. No significant differences were found for any of the efficacy measures comparing any antipsychotic with placebo. Risperidone was found to be superior to placebo in diminishing certain symptoms.

### Retention strategies for medications for opioid use disorder in adults: A rapid evidence review [^114yAbmP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Although medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) save lives, treatment retention remains challenging. Identification of interventions to improve MOUD retention is of interest to policymakers and researchers. On behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we conducted a rapid evidence review on interventions to improve MOUD retention.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from February 2009 through August 2019 for systematic reviews and randomized trials. The focus was on care settings, services, logistical support, contingency management, health information technology (IT), extended-release (XR) formulations, and psychosocial interventions that assessed retention for at least 3 months.

- **Results**: Two systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included; most did not focus on retention as the primary outcome. Initiating MOUD in soon-to-be-released incarcerated people improved retention following release. Contingency management may improve retention using antagonist but not agonist MOUD. Retention with interventions integrating medical, psychiatric, social services, or IT did not differ from in-person treatment-as-usual approaches. Retention was comparable with XR compared to daily buprenorphine formulations, and conflicting with XR-naltrexone monthly injection compared to daily buprenorphine. Most psychosocial interventions did not improve retention.

Consistent but sparse evidence supports criminal justice prerelease MOUD initiation and contingency management interventions for antagonist MOUD. Integrating MOUD with medical, psychiatric, and social services is crucial for improving retention.

### Prevalence of cocaine use and cocaine use disorder among adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114myk8B]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis (registered with PROSPERO CRD42020142039) of the literature to estimate the lifetime prevalence of cocaine use and cocaine use disorder among adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The literature search was performed on the electronic databases PubMed and PsychINFO without date or language restrictions. Additional studies were identified by hand searching of citations. Inclusion criteria were studies involving adult patients with ADHD and reporting cocaine use and/or cocaine use disorders. Data were pooled in the meta-analyses using a generalized linear mixed model with random effects. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test. Sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Twelve studies were included in the review: six in the meta-analysis of cocaine use and nine in the meta-analysis of cocaine use disorder. The estimated prevalence of cocaine use was 26.0% (95% CI 0.18–0.35) and the estimated prevalence of cocaine use disorder was 10.0% (95% CI 0.08–0.13). Heterogeneity in both meta-analyses was high but decreased to non-significance in the meta-analysis on cocaine use disorder after excluding the outlier study. In conclusion, one out of four adult patients with ADHD use cocaine, and one out of ten develop a lifetime cocaine use disorder. Since cocaine use can lead to more severe and complex disorders of impaired systemic functioning, adult patients with ADHD should be assessed for cocaine use disorder and promptly referred for treatment.

### Cannabidiol as a treatment for craving and relapse in individuals with cocaine use disorder: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [^112KpWeQ]. Addiction (2021). High credibility.

- **Methods**: This Phase II double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled superiority trial was conducted at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), Quebec, Canada. It followed the Tri-Council Policy Statement, the Helsinki Declaration, the Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines), the Good Manufacturing Practices, and Health Canada Division 5 guidelines. The CHUM's ethics committee approved the study, and all participants signed informed consent. The trial was divided into two phases: a 10-day inpatient detoxification (Phase I), followed by a 12-week outpatient follow-up (Phase II). Only participants who remained inpatient for all 10 days were eligible for Phase II. Participants were compensated up to $400.

- **Participants**: Recruitment occurred between 20 July 2016 and 25 June 2019. Adults aged between 18 and 65 years, diagnosed with CUD [Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for the DSM-V], and who had consumed cocaine within 2 weeks prior to admission [time-line follow-back (TLFB)] were included. Only participants speaking English or French and able to consent were eligible. We excluded participants with severe and/or unstable medical or psychiatric conditions [Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) version 7.0], immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity to cannabinoids, or under treatment with medications interacting with CBD. Participants diagnosed with another substance use disorder (except nicotine) that would require treatment were ineligible. Men with a history of fertility problems were also excluded.

### Retention strategies for medications for opioid use disorder in adults: A rapid evidence review [^112ejnCG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

It is clear that longer retention on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) reduces morbidity and mortality, but improving retention is challenging. This review summarized recent evidence on interventions to improve retention on MOUD and found limited evidence regarding which interventions are effective. We found that prerelease initiation of MOUD in incarcerated individuals with OUD and contingency management interventions using antagonist, but not agonist, forms of MOUD improved retention. Combining OUD treatment with medical, psychiatric, or social services, decreasing prescribing barriers to MOUD treatment, information technology interventions, and extended-release (XR) formulations of MOUD did not worsen retention compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) approaches, but these require further study. Few studies reported intervention-related harms, with the exception being studies of XR formulations, which reported similar rates of adverse events between groups. Fewer studies assessed whether the effectiveness of different interventions to improve MOUD retention varied by patient subpopulation.

Many interventions reviewed attempt to improve retention on MOUD by expanding access to OUD treatment in novel settings. Our findings suggest that interventions initiating MOUD in soon-to-be-released incarcerated people with OUD improved retention. Given the rates of OUD in criminal justice populations and the high overdose risk within the first few weeks of reentry into the community, these interventions have potential for high impact. Interventions initiating MOUD in hospital and emergency settings prior to discharge had comparable retention post-discharge as TAU.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^112mLDEQ]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cocaine is a stimulant that leads to the rapid accumulation of catecholamines and serotonin in the brain due to the prevention of their re-uptake into the neuron that released the neurotransmitter. Cocaine use disorders are widely accepted as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Cocaine use is associated with numerous acute and chronic medical complications, ranging from coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction, and respiratory disease to neurologic and psychiatric consequences such as cerebral hemorrhage, mood disorders, and psychosis. Additionally, cocaine use has been associated with an increased risk of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and violence.

Development of effective treatments for cocaine dependence is necessary to reduce the impact of this illness upon both the individual and society. These effective treatments need most importantly to reduce cocaine use and to have excellent compliance, which has encouraged depot and other long-lasting formulations. Currently, however, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for the treatment of this illness, and behavioral therapies alone have demonstrated limited efficacy. Our growing understanding of cocaine neurobiology has translated into numerous studies of pharmacologic agents for the treatment of cocaine dependence in both animal and human models. These models include human laboratory drug administration studies using surrogate endpoints such as craving, subjective effects, and behavioral choices between money and drugs. This article reviews findings from recent cocaine pharmacotherapy research.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^115KksrA]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Establishing a clinical diagnosis will always be an essential clinical task, but even minimal probing for additional information for each endorsed item can provide valuable insight for care planning, delivery, and adaptation as treatment progresses. Each symptom can be extensible with further probing questions as needed, including administration of a clinical instrument developed for treatment planning.

To the best of our knowledge, the DSM‐5 OUD working group selected a 3‐month point for evaluation of early remission because it has long been believed that this is the point from which clinically meaningful outcomes are observed. We think this is sensible, but we also recommend evaluation at 6 months from treatment initiation. 'Stable remission' is assigned to someone who has no OUD symptoms for at least 12 months (not including craving and discounting tolerance and withdrawal if enrolled in and fully compliant with MOUD). A specifier denotes whether the person is living in a controlled medical or custodial setting. For those patients retained in longer‐term treatment, it would seem reasonable to expect that a remission status evaluation is performed twice yearly and at exit.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116d5PFL]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically in relation to buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not delaying the transition from buprenorphine to methadone. The transition from a partial agonist to a full mu-opioid agonist does not typically result in an adverse reaction.

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 western European countries: Observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^112Cqq3h]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

It would be of value to focus on the combination of substance use and polydrug use, as cocaine as an adjunctive substance is frequently recorded in combination with the primary use of opioids [1]. In the United Kingdom, there has been a recent increase in clients starting treatment for opiate and crack problem use [27]. In Belgium, between 2015 and 2018, clients entering treatment for opiates, cannabis, and alcohol as a primary substance reported an increased consumption of cocaine as an adjunctive substance [28].

The study is subject to a range of limitations. First, TDI data provided information on clients entering drug treatment (for the first time in their life or after previous treatment) during the reporting year, meaning that data on clients who are in continuous treatment (i.e. who remain in treatment from one year to the next) were not provided. Secondly, treatment data collected by the national TDI systems did not cover all treatment demand and hence need to be interpreted with caution. Indeed, coverage of treatment services was not 100%, and the proportion differed by country. Inclusion of treatment services not currently represented may provide different results. However, data coverage of specialized outpatient and inpatient treatment facilities is good in most countries, with lower representation concentrated among other services (e.g. general practitioners, low-threshold agencies, prisons) [15]. Thirdly, not all years were available for all countries, which might also have influenced some figures. Fourthly, cocaine was only considered as the primary substance of treatment.

### Cocaine hydrochloride [^116o3Bzx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution is approved for topical single use during diagnostic procedures and surgeries, so physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms are unlikely to develop. Although Goprelto is not indicated for chronic therapy, repeated misuse or abuse of this product may lead to physical dependence.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111HCU5v]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, especially concerning methadone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend using strategies directed at relapse prevention in any plan of care for patients receiving OUD treatment or ongoing monitoring of their disorder status.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^116rGcnF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control have recently described opioid use and resultant deaths as an epidemic. At this point in time, treating this disease well with medication requires skill and time that are not generally available to primary care doctors in most practice models. Suboptimal treatment has likely contributed to the expansion of the epidemic and concerns for unethical practices. At the same time, access to competent treatment is profoundly restricted because few physicians are willing and able to provide it. This "Practice Guideline" was developed to assist in the evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder, with the hope that more physicians will be able to provide effective treatment using this tool.

Although there are existing guidelines for the treatment of opioid use disorder, none have included all of the medications used at present for its treatment. Moreover, few existing guidelines address the needs of special populations such as pregnant women, individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, individuals with pain, adolescents, or individuals involved in the criminal justice system. This Practice Guideline was developed using the RAND Corporation (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM), a process that combines scientific evidence and clinical knowledge to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures. The RAM is a deliberate approach, encompassing a review of existing guidelines, literature reviews, appropriateness ratings, necessity reviews, and document development.

### Effects of varying the monetary value of voucher-based incentives on abstinence achieved during and following treatment among cocaine-dependent outpatients [^117KcD4L]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

This study examined whether increasing the amount of abstinence achieved during outpatient treatment for cocaine dependence is an effective method for increasing longer-term cocaine abstinence. A two-condition, parallel groups, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a university-based research clinic, with a total of 100 cocaine-dependent outpatients participating in the trial. Participants were assigned randomly to receive treatment based on the community reinforcement approach (CRA) plus voucher-based incentives set at a relatively high monetary value (maximal value = $1995/12 weeks) or CRA with vouchers set at a relatively low monetary value (maximal value = $499/12 weeks). Vouchers were earned contingent on cocaine-negative urinalysis results during the initial 12 weeks of the 24-week outpatient treatment.

Outcomes were evaluated using urine-toxicology testing, questionnaires, and other self-report instruments. The findings indicated that increasing voucher value increased the duration of continuous cocaine abstinence achieved during the 24-week treatment period. Point-prevalence cocaine abstinence, assessed every 3 months throughout an 18-month follow-up period, was greater in the high- than low-value voucher conditions. The duration of abstinence achieved during treatment predicted abstinence during follow-up, although that relationship weakened over time.

In conclusion, increasing the value of abstinence-contingent incentives during the initial weeks of treatment appears to represent an effective strategy.

### Contingency management for patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1119sgDi]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis underscores the association of contingency management with the treatment of a wide range of clinical problems common among patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The results support a position that policymakers, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), should make concerted efforts to support broad dissemination of contingency management to the many community clinics throughout the United States currently struggling with the challenges of the opioid crisis, especially with concomitant psychomotor stimulant use among patients taking MOUD.

### BAP updated guidelines: Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of substance abuse, harmful use, addiction and comorbidity: Recommendations from BAP [^112bR4Qs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, more specifically concerning patients with opioid use disorder, the BAP 2012 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend adding bupropion, desipramine, amantadine, or gabapentin to methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment to reduce cocaine use in opioid-dependent cocaine users.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1153sBZK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly concerning general principles, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the setting in which treatment is provided. Methadone should only be provided in opioid treatment programs and acute care settings under limited circumstances. Buprenorphine can be prescribed by waivered clinicians in any setting, including opioid treatment programs and office-based opioid treatment. Naltrexone may be prescribed in any setting by any clinician with the authority to prescribe medication. It is important to consider the patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and risk of diversion when determining the most appropriate treatment setting.

### Examining predictors of cocaine withdrawal syndrome at the end of detoxification treatment in women with cocaine use disorder [^116YW8C7]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a major public health issue associated with poor outcomes for both patients and society. Inpatient detoxification treatment is often recommended for moderate to severe CUD, especially for individuals who regularly consume cocaine and are at high risk of severe intoxication, craving, overdose, or withdrawal. The assessment for this indication also considers co-occurring substance use disorders, mental health and emotional needs, medical and physical requirements, as well as social and environmental factors affecting patients. Inpatient treatment is also considered when individuals experience significant addiction-related issues necessitating a protected environment, when maintaining abstinence is challenging, or when minimizing exposure to cocaine-related triggers is essential.

However, the response to inpatient detoxification treatment varies among patients, as some individuals face greater challenges in managing the withdrawal syndrome than others. Therefore, an important clinical outcome measure for CUD detoxification response is the management of the severity of cocaine withdrawal syndrome, including symptoms of craving, anxiety, irritability, mood changes, physiological manifestations (e.g. fatigue, restlessness, sleepiness, appetite alterations, tremors, muscle aches, nerve pain), and even suicidal ideation. The identification of patients with severe cocaine withdrawal syndrome during early treatment stages would be helpful in clinical practice since these patients have the lo

### Characteristics of an outpatient treatment sample by primary substance of abuse [^115tdYPu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This study examines sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as a function of primary substance of abuse, among clients approached, screened, and assessed for eligibility in a 10-site effectiveness trial of a web-based psychosocial intervention for substance use disorders. Consistent with the design of effectiveness trials, eligibility criteria were broad and exclusion criteria minimal; thus, the recruited sample may be viewed as relatively representative of patients seeking treatment throughout the United States.

- **Methods**: χ tests for categorical variables and F tests for continuous variables were used to analyze demographic, substance use, physical and mental health, and sexual risk data collected at screening and baseline. Pairwise comparisons between primary substance subgroups for baseline data were conducted if the test statistic P value was 0.01 or less.

- **Results**: Few participants expressed disinterest in the study at screening because of the computer-assisted intervention. A diverse sample of substance users completed baseline and were enrolled: 22.9% marijuana; 21.7% opiates; 20.9% alcohol; 20.5% cocaine; and 13.9% stimulants users. Marijuana users demonstrated the greatest differences across primary substances: they were younger, less likely to be married or attend 12-step meetings, and more likely to be in treatment as a result of criminal justice involvement. All patients, even marijuana users, reported comparable rates of co-occurring mental health disorders and sexual risk and substantial rates of polysubstance use disorders.

### Gabapentin reduces cocaine use among addicts from a community clinic sample [^116dVjVH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Individuals with chronic psychiatric conditions display a high rate of cocaine use. Gabapentin was hypothesized to reduce cocaine use by restoring inhibitory GABAergic feedback on ascending dopaminergic projections to nucleus accumbens neurons.

- **Method**: Nine participants with DSM-IV cocaine dependence were selected from patients attending a large community psychiatric clinic. During a 24-week open-label trial of gabapentin (800–2400 mg/day), qualitative urine drug screens were collected from the participants up to three times per week. Data were collected from September 1999 to May 2001.

- **Results**: With gabapentin, the mean ± SD number of cocaine-positive urine screens decreased from 53.11 ± 13.23 to 35.22 ± 14.84 (t = 3.58, N = 9, p < .01). The number of weeks of abstinence from cocaine increased from 2.1 ± 1.5 to 8.0 ± 5.5 (t = 3.21, N = 9, p < .01).

- **Conclusion**: Gabapentin appeared to be a safe and efficacious medication to reduce cocaine usage in a community sample of psychiatric patients.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^113pvoCB]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Modafinil is a novel stimulant-like medication that promotes wakefulness and serves as a treatment for hypersomnia and narcolepsy. The mechanism of action is only partially understood at this time; however, there is evidence that this agent acts as a central alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, reduces basal cerebral GABA activity, and increases both dopamine and glutamate release in select areas of the brain. Chronic cocaine use results in a hypodopaminergic state as well as depletion of both extracellular glutamate levels and glutamatergic synaptic strength in the nucleus accumbens. These neurotransmitter systems serve as the principal targets of modafinil's effects, and promising results have been observed in human clinical trials for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

The safety of co-administration of modafinil and cocaine was established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 10) conducted by Dackis et al. Modafinil demonstrated no significant exacerbating effects on vital sign measures or electrocardiogram (EKG) findings. As a secondary measure, pretreatment with modafinil at two oral dosages (200 mg and 400 mg, respectively) demonstrated an ability to significantly attenuate euphoria from intravenously administered cocaine in one subjective measure (P = 0.02). Importantly, this early study suggested safety as well as the possibility of a cocaine-blunting effect with modafinil.

In addition to examining the impact of modafinil on the euphorigenic effects of cocaine, early research focused on the similarity of modafinil to stimulant medications in order to…

### Examining predictors of cocaine withdrawal syndrome at the end of detoxification treatment in women with cocaine use disorder [^1117d8M6]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Some studies have analyzed variables related to cocaine withdrawal syndrome and abstinence during outpatient or detoxification treatment. For instance, Ahmadi and collaborators (2009) demonstrated that the baseline treatment variables most consistently predicting patients who achieved four weeks of abstinence from cocaine, compared to those who did not, were the initial urine drug screen results, the initial CSSA scores, and initial self-reported cocaine use in the past 30 days. In contrast, cocaine craving, alcohol craving, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms did not play significant roles. Viola and collaborators (2020) found that patients with CUD and frequent recent cannabis use reported higher severity of cocaine withdrawal after three weeks of treatment, while recent alcohol or tobacco use did not show an association with increased CSSA scores. In addition to substance use variables, some studies have shown that psychosocial experiences can also influence the severity of cocaine withdrawal syndrome. For example, Francke and collaborators (2013) presented findings indicating that women with CUD and a history of childhood neglect exposure exhibited a significantly lower reduction in the severity of cocaine withdrawal symptoms during three weeks of treatment compared to those with CUD but without a history of childhood neglect.

While the aforementioned studies have examined a subset of factors individually, in the study, we comprehensively analyzed more than 250 variables collected from women with CUD who enrolled in a three-week inpatient treatment program for detoxification.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112VE33z]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for opioid use disorder, specifically in relation to psychosocial therapy, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the patient's psychosocial needs and offering or referring them to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs. This should be done in conjunction with pharmacotherapy for the treatment of, or prevention of relapse to, opioid use disorder (OUD). It is important not to preclude or delay pharmacotherapy with appropriate medication management if a patient decides to decline psychosocial treatment or if such treatment is unavailable. Consider using motivational interviewing or enhancement techniques to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services appropriate for addressing individual needs.

### Doing our best in a broken system: The urgent need for expansion of medication for opioid use disorder treatments in the United States [^115wmDJN]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In reply: In this commentary, we respond to Dr. Vogel and Dr. Dürstelar's letter to our original piece "A Plea From People Who Use Drugs to Clinicians: New Ways to Initiate Buprenorphine Are Urgently Needed in the Fentanyl Era", published in this journal in July to August 2022. We agree with much of their comment on buprenorphine initiation and point to the need for rapid expansion of medication for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatments here in the United States.

It is critical to understand the context of buprenorphine and methadone access. We point out how the treatment of OUD with agonist therapy remains limited to methadone or buprenorphine despite an increasingly toxic drug supply within our particular legal and regulatory environment. We call for urgent research and pilot programs to trial additional agonist therapies for those with opioid OUD, as well as regulatory changes to increase access to both methadone and buprenorphine.

### Novel medications to treat addictive disorders [^117REqvu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Recent discoveries about the effects of drugs of abuse on the brain and the mechanisms of their addictions, new chemical compounds including immunotherapies, and new actions of available medications are offering many opportunities for the discovery and development of novel medications to treat addictive disorders. Furthermore, advancements in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of drug addiction and the pharmacogenetics of the safety and efficacy of the medications are providing opportunities for more individualized pharmacotherapy approaches.

Although multiple medications have been investigated for treating addictions, only a handful have shown acceptable safety and efficacy and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This article reviews the medications that are medically safe and have shown promising results for treating opioid, cocaine, methamphetamine, and cannabis addictions.

### Contingency management for patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fTqVB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is efficacious; however, comorbid stimulant use and other behavioral health problems often undermine its efficacy. This systematic review aims to examine the association of contingency management, a behavioral intervention wherein patients receive material incentives contingent on objectively verified behavior change, with end-of-treatment outcomes for these comorbid behavioral problems.

A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and reference sections of articles from their inception through May 5, 2020. The following search terms were used: vouchers, contingency management, or financial incentives. The study selection focused on prospective experimental studies of monetary-based contingency management among participants receiving MOUD.

Data extraction and synthesis were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Three independent investigators extracted data from the included studies for a random-effects meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the association of contingency management at end-of-treatment assessments with six clinical problems: stimulant use, polysubstance use, illicit opioid use, cigarette smoking, therapy attendance, and medication adherence.

Random-effects meta-analysis models were employed to calculate weighted mean effect size estimates (Cohen's d) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) separately for each clinical problem. The analysis included both categories assessing abstinence outcomes and those assessing treatment adherence outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioid use disorder, particularly with respect to patients with other substance use disorders, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend prescribing benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics with caution in patients using methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of an opioid use disorder (OUD). It is advised to conduct a risk-benefit analysis when deciding whether to co-prescribe these medications.

### Amantadine in the treatment of cocaine-dependent patients with severe withdrawal symptoms [^112cJdzB]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

The study examined the effectiveness of amantadine in reducing cocaine withdrawal symptoms and improving treatment outcomes among cocaine-dependent patients in outpatient treatment.

Sixty-one cocaine-dependent subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of amantadine. Among subjects with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms at the start of treatment, those who received amantadine used significantly less cocaine during the trial than did subjects who received placebo. Compared to subjects who received placebo, subjects who received amantadine submitted significantly more benzoylecgonine-negative urine samples and used cocaine on significantly fewer days during the trial.

Amantadine may be an effective treatment for cocaine-dependent patients with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^115T49BC]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

In this Addiction Debate article, we describe the concept, clinical procedures, and probable benefits of a simple measurement-based care (MBC) approach for opioid use disorder (OUD). MBC can be applied to any treatment in the substance use disorders field. However, we focus on first-line medications delivered in primary care and specialist clinics due to the opioid crisis and the dramatic increase in fatal opioid-related poisonings in the United States, Canada, Australia, and several European countries.

- **Urgency of addressing the opioid crisis**: The crisis has led to an urgent call to increase provision in primary care and a national initiative in the United States to increase the capacity and integration of treatment in hospitals, state health departments, specialist programs, and the criminal justice system.

MBC is an evidence-based health-care practice in which disease symptoms, signs, or biomarkers are used to inform clinical actions. Feedback is provided to patients about their progress in treatment to increase engagement, adherence, and beneficial exposure to evidence-based therapies. Physical health conditions are almost always treated in this manner. For example, in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes, blood pressure and glycated haemoglobin, respectively, are primary biomarkers in clinical practice.

In mental health, many clinical decisions are guided by the presence and severity of patient-reported symptoms. For instance, the nine-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was constructed from the symptoms of major depressive disorder in DSM-IV.

### Consensus recommendations on the treatment of opioid use disorder in the emergency department [^111B1vVh]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine and methadone reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with opioid use disorder. The initiation of buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) has been associated with increased rates of outpatient treatment linkage and decreased drug use when compared to patients randomized to receive standard ED referral. As such, the ED has been increasingly recognized as a venue for the identification and initiation of treatment for opioid use disorder, but no formal American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommendations on the topic have previously been published.

The ACEP convened a group of emergency physicians with expertise in clinical research, addiction, toxicology, and administration to review literature and develop consensus recommendations on the treatment of opioid use disorder in the ED. Based on literature review, clinical experience, and expert consensus, the group recommends that emergency physicians offer to initiate opioid use disorder treatment with buprenorphine in appropriate patients and provide direct linkage to ongoing treatment for patients with untreated opioid use disorder. These consensus recommendations include strategies for opioid use disorder treatment initiation and ED program implementation. They were approved by the ACEP board of directors in January 2021.

### Features and prevalence of patients with probable adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who request treatment for cocaine use disorders [^112kqvew]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

To characterize those patients with probable adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who ask for treatment of cocaine use disorders, this study estimates the prevalence of probable adult ADHD among these patients. This is a cross-sectional and multi-center study performed at outpatient resources of 12 addiction treatment centers in Spain. Participants were treatment-seeking primary cocaine abusers, recruited consecutively at one center and through convenience sampling at the other centers.

Assessments included a semi-structured clinical interview focused on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) ADHD criteria adapted to adulthood, and the Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WURS) for screening childhood history of ADHD according to patients. Probable adult ADHD was diagnosed when patients met DSM-IV criteria of ADHD in adulthood and scored WURS > 32.

All participants were diagnosed with cocaine dependence (n = 190) or abuse (n = 15). Patients with probable adult ADHD, compared with patients having no lifetime ADHD, were more frequently male, reported higher impulsivity, and began to use nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, or cocaine earlier. Before starting the treatment, patients with probable adult ADHD also showed higher cocaine craving for the previous day, less frequent cocaine abstinence throughout the previous week, and higher use of cocaine and tobacco during the previous month.

Impulsivity and male gender were the only independent risk factors of probable adult ADHD in a logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of probable adult ADHD was identified in this study.

### Psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder [^1113aEJa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant use disorder is a continuously growing medical and social burden without approved medications available for its treatment. Psychosocial interventions could be a valid approach to help people reduce or cease stimulant consumption. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in September 2023. All searches included non-English language literature. We hand-searched the references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any psychosocial intervention with no intervention, treatment as usual (TAU), or a different intervention in adults with stimulant use disorder.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included a total of 64 RCTs (8,241 participants). Seventy-three percent of studies included participants with cocaine or crack cocaine use disorder; 3.1% included participants with amphetamine use disorder; 10.9% included participants with methamphetamine use disorder; and 12.5% included participants with any stimulant use disorder. In 18 studies, all participants were in methadone maintenance treatment.

### Antidepressants for cocaine dependence [^116nWjZe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition, which has become a substantial public health problem. The past decade has witnessed a sustained search for an effective pharmacotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cocaine dependence. While the administration of cocaine acutely increases intercellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels by blocking their presynaptic reuptake, chronic cocaine abuse leads to down-regulation of monoamine systems. Post-cocaine use depression and cocaine craving may be linked to this down-regulation. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy, by augmenting monoamine levels, may alleviate cocaine abstinence symptomatology, as well as relieving dysphoria and associated craving through general antidepressant action.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review of all RCTs on the use of antidepressants for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966–2000), EMBASE (from 1980–2000), LILACS (from 1982–2000), PsycLIT (from 1974–2000), and Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). Additional searches involved reference searching, personal communication, conference abstracts, unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry, and book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Selection criteria**: The inclusion criteria for all randomized controlled trials were that they should focus on the use of antidepressants for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Trials including patients with additional diagnoses such as opiate dependence were also eligible.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112FAJjS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The choice of available treatment options for addiction involving opioid use should be a shared decision between clinician and patient. Clinicians should consider the patient's preferences, past treatment history, and treatment setting when deciding between the use of methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use.

- **Treatment settings**: The treatment setting described as level 1 in the ASAM Criteria may be a general outpatient location such as a clinician's practice site. Level 2 may refer to an intensive outpatient treatment or partial hospitalization program housed in a specialty addiction treatment facility, a community mental health center, or another setting. The ASAM Criteria describes level 3 or level 4 treatment, respectively, as a residential addiction treatment facility or hospital.

- **Importance of venue**: The venue in which treatment is provided is as important as the specific medication selected. Opioid Treatment Programs (OTP) offer daily supervised dosing of methadone, and increasingly, of buprenorphine. In accordance with Federal law (21 CFR §1306.07), office-based opioid treatment (OBOT), which provides medication on a prescribed weekly or monthly basis, is limited to buprenorphine. Naltrexone can be prescribed in any setting by any clinician with the authority to prescribe any medication. Clinicians should consider a patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and risk of diversion when determining whether OTP or OBOT is most appropriate.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to psychotherapy, DoD/VA 2021 guidelines recommend offering one or more of the following interventions as initial treatment in patients with cocaine use disorder, considering patient preference and availability:

- **CBT**: This intervention involves structured, time-limited therapy focused on identifying and changing negative thought patterns.

- **Recovery-focused behavioral therapy**: Includes individual drug counseling and the community reinforcement approach, which emphasizes enhancing positive behavior through community support.

- **Contingency management**: Implemented in combination with another behavioral intervention, this approach involves providing tangible rewards to reinforce positive behaviors, with consideration for patient preference and availability.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^114kJRJn]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Opioid use disorder is a chronic, relapsing disease, which has significant economic, personal, and public health consequences. This "Practice Guideline" was developed to assist in the evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder. Although there are existing guidelines for the treatment of opioid use disorder, none have included all of the medications currently used for its treatment. Moreover, few of the existing guidelines address the needs of special populations such as pregnant women, individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, individuals with pain, adolescents, or individuals involved in the criminal justice system. This article serves as an overview of the guideline. It is recommended that those who wish to understand this subject in sufficient detail to prescribe carefully should read the full guideline.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^114wszyu]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

In the following sections, we describe a basic measurement-based care (MBC) approach using the example of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) delivered in primary care and specialist clinics. In these services, we will assume that patients are able to access adjunctive interventions directly or by referral. Space limitations preclude discussion of populations with complex needs (e.g. severe mental health; personality factors; neurocognitive impairment; chronic medical conditions), transfer procedures to hospital in-patient or residential programs, and system-level factors which bear heavily on access and the delivery of effective MOUD. By 'basic', we mean activities that do not unduly compete with time for direct care and have a minimal administrative burden on the patient. We do not summarize medical management to increase adherence, but note that this is an important partner procedure.

At treatment initiation and review, a focus on each opioid use disorder (OUD) symptom helps to structure discussion and assists the clinician and patient in formulating a testable hypothesis about why OUD has occurred, how biological, psychological, and social factors are linked to opioid use and harms, and the options available to capitalize or strengthen the patient's resources for recovery. There is a logic in targeting interventions on the first 6 items of OUD to address its negative consequences. Early clinical tasks, in addition to needed adjustments to MOUD dosing (i.e. to attenuate distressing cravings and achieve opioid blockade), should include education on risk reduction and/or either a watchful waiting approach for improvements in social functioning or making necessary interventions.

### Quetiapine in bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence [^112GPXe7]. Bipolar Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is associated with the highest rates of substance abuse of any psychiatric illness. Therefore, treatments that stabilize mood and decrease drug use or cravings are of great interest. Atypical antipsychotics are in widespread use in patients with bipolar disorder; however, minimal data are available on their use in bipolar patients with comorbid substance abuse.

- **Methods**: Open-label, add-on quetiapine therapy was examined for 12 weeks in 17 outpatients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence. Subjects were evaluated with a structured clinical interview; Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS), Young Mania Rating (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating (BPRS) scales; and Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ). Urine samples and self-reported drug use were also obtained. Data were analyzed using a last observation carried forward method on all subjects given medication at baseline.

- **Results**: Significant improvement from baseline to exit was observed in HDRS, YMRS, BPRS, and CCQ scores (p ≤ 0.05). Dollars spent on cocaine and days/week of cocaine use decreased non-significantly, and urine drug screens did not change significantly from baseline to exit. Quetiapine was well tolerated, with no subjects, to our knowledge, discontinuing because of side effects.

- **Conclusions**: The use of quetiapine was associated with substantial improvement in psychiatric symptoms and cocaine cravings. The findings are promising and suggest larger controlled trials of quetiapine are needed in this population.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^112Y5N1s]? Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

These factors add complexity to treatment planning and may risk discontinuation and poor outcome. The opportunity to respond here will depend on time and resources. Even if remission is elusive or is not achieved for long, MOUD may provide some symptom control and protection against opioid poisoning. Clinicians should also not be disheartened if a MOUD-resistant patient refuses an adjunctive intervention, as they may accept this offer in the future. If there is no response after continuous treatment, clinicians might consider whether to shift to another MOUD medication, as they have different pharmacological properties that might be more suitable for some patients than others. Another consideration is the timing of treatment intervention during ongoing care (early versus later). More research is needed to address the absence of evidence on which patient characteristics predict response to one MOUD versus another.

- **MBC research**: We hope that pragmatic randomized controlled trials will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of MBC for MOUD and other OUD interventions. Our proposals for MBC can guide end-point selection and analysis in clinical trials (where DSM-5 remission status is not often used in end-point evaluations). At the very least, a single-item PRO measure could be helpfully included in treatment trials as secondary outcome measures. Cohort research on MBC delivery for OUD within healthcare systems would also provide additional insights on response to specific interventions received, generating valuable real-world evidence for the system itself.

### Federal and state action needed to end the infectious complications of illicit drug use in the United States: IDSA and HIVMA's advocacy agenda [^113nLW2P]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) entails the use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs), which is now the preferred term for medication-assisted therapy. MOUDs are recognized as the most effective treatments for OUD. There are three Food and Drug Administration-approved MOUDs: methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). Methadone is a full opioid agonist, buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, and XR-NTX is an opioid antagonist. All are successful in treating OUD and in decreasing mortality. They reduce illicit opioid use, opioid craving, overdose, and HIV and HCV transmission. Additionally, buprenorphine and XR-NTX improve HIV viral suppression in people living with HIV, which is the gold standard of care in HIV treatment associated with reduced mortality and reduced transmission.

Access to methadone and buprenorphine is limited due to regulations. Prescribing these treatments requires special training outside postgraduate programs. For buprenorphine, a waiver from the Drug Enforcement Agency is needed, while methadone requires treatment in a federally certified opioid treatment program. Unfortunately, many clinical settings lack physicians trained in OUD treatment. Only about 5% of the nation's physicians have waivers to prescribe buprenorphine, and most substance use treatment programs do not have opioid treatment programs, making methadone treatment challenging to obtain. As a result, the prevailing care for these patients typically consists of withdrawal management or detoxification.

### Methadone vs. buprenorphine for in-hospital initiation: Which is better for outpatient care retention in patients with opioid use disorder [^111yaj8q]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Low credibility.

Few hospitals currently provide medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to admitted patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Data are needed to determine whether the choice of medication during hospitalization influences the probability of retention in outpatient OUD treatment.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients who received a medical toxicology consult for OUD. Medical records were reviewed to determine if patients received MOUD and were referred to Engaging Patients in Care Coordination (EPICC), a service that connects hospitalized patients with OUD to outpatient care. Patients were stratified by the last form of MOUD they received in the hospital (methadone versus buprenorphine); retention in outpatient treatment was measured at 2 weeks, 30 days, and 12 weeks. The log-rank test was used to determine the difference in probabilities of retention in the methadone and buprenorphine groups. An event was defined as drop-out from outpatient treatment.

- **Results**: Of 267 total patients with medical toxicology consults for OUD, 155 received MOUD and referral to EPICC. One hundred six patients received buprenorphine, and 46 received methadone. Three additional patients were excluded. The rate of retention in outpatient treatment for patients who received buprenorphine was 37%, 26%, and 13%, and for patients who received methadone was 43%, 39%, and 35% at 2 weeks, 30 days, and 12 weeks, respectively. Methadone was associated with a statistically significant increased probability of retention in outpatient treatment as compared to buprenorphine.

### Cannabidiol as a treatment for craving and relapse in individuals with cocaine use disorder: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^114CzBzM]. Addiction (2021). High credibility.

Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health concern for which no efficacious pharmacological interventions are available. Cannabidiol (CBD) has attracted considerable interest as a promising treatment for addiction. This study tested the efficacy of CBD for reducing craving and preventing relapse in people with CUD.

The research employed a single-site, double-blind, randomized controlled superiority trial comparing CBD with a placebo. It was conducted at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Canada, involving seventy-eight adults (14 women) with moderate to severe CUD.

Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio by stratified blocks, to receive a daily dose of 800 mg CBD (n = 40) or placebo (n = 38). They first underwent an inpatient detoxification phase lasting 10 days. Those who completed this phase entered a 12-week outpatient follow-up.

The primary outcomes measured were drug-cue-induced craving during detoxification and the time-to-cocaine relapse during subsequent outpatient treatment. During drug-cue exposure, craving scores [mean ± standard deviation (SD)] increased from baseline by 4.69 (2.89) versus 3.21 (2.78) points in CBD (n = 36) and placebo (n = 28) participants, respectively [confidence interval (CI) = −0.33 to 3.04; P = 0.069; Bayes factor = 0.498].

All but three participants relapsed to cocaine by week 12, with a similar risk for CBD (n = 34) and placebo (n = 27) participants (hazard ratio = 1.20, CI = 0.65–2.20, P = 0.51; Bayes factor = 0.152). CBD treatment was well tolerated and associated mainly with diarrhea.

### Nefazodone in out-patient treatment of inhaled cocaine dependence: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^114zYKAA]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of oral nefazodone in the treatment of cocaine dependence.

The design was a 10-week randomized double-blind clinical trial.

Methods involved 210 subjects who fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) criteria for cocaine dependence. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 300 mg/day of oral nefazodone (N) or a placebo (P). Self-reported drug use, retention interval in treatment, adherence to the prescription, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton scale.

Findings showed that abstinence from cocaine for 3 weeks or more was achieved by 49.5% of the nefazodone group and 45.7% of the placebo group (P = 0.58); however, 16.2% of the nefazodone group and 22.9% of the placebo group used other drugs during abstinence. The average interval to resumption of drug use was 33.9 days for the nefazodone group and 36.1 days for the placebo group. Adverse effects were reported by 45.8% of those on nefazodone and 29.5% on the placebo (P = 0.01). Treatment for these events was more often needed in the nefazodone group (24.0%) compared to the placebo group (9.5%) (P < 0.02).

The conclusions drawn from the study indicated that these results do not support the indication of nefazodone for out-patient treatment of inhaled cocaine dependence, with or without other associated drug dependence diagnoses.

### Feasibility of exenatide, a GLP-1R agonist, for treating cocaine use disorder: A case series study [^115hjvoj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cocaine use remains a serious public health problem associated with a marked increase in overdose deaths in the past decade. No medications have yet been proven to be effective for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CUD). Among the highly promising medications are glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) that are currently used for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus and weight management. Preclinically, GLP-1RAs have been shown to attenuate cocaine self-administration; however, this has not yet been demonstrated in a human laboratory study. The GLP-1RA extended-release exenatide is given as a once-weekly injection, which may be clinically advantageous for addressing medication nonadherence among individuals with CUD.

In this study, we assess feasibility and safety by reporting on three cases of patients with CUD who received 6 weeks of exenatide 2 mg subcutaneously once-weekly in an open-label fashion, along with standard individual drug counseling. We observed excellent attendance and compliance, along with positive end-of-study satisfaction ratings. The medication was well tolerated without unexpected or severe adverse events. Results for cocaine use and related clinical effects were more mixed, yet encouraging. Future empirical testing of exenatide for treating CUD should utilize a randomized controlled trial design and longer treatment duration.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^111BzJNp]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

These prospects in the pharmacologic management of cocaine dependence have demonstrated in human clinical trials an ability to reduce subjective reward, craving, and withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine use; however, much progress is still needed before they become viable widespread treatments. Of the dopamine agonist medications, although they have been demonstrated to decrease the euphoric effects and, in some cases, the withdrawal symptoms, concerns regarding the addictive liability of amphetamine-type medications continue to limit their widespread acceptance and use. Furthermore, findings from clinical trials of GABAergic medications have been less clear in their demonstration of significant efficacy in treating cocaine dependence. They have shown some ability to reduce cocaine craving or to improve sleep duration and quality in those recently abstaining from cocaine. Cocaine abusers with comorbid alcohol dependence may represent a subpopulation particularly responsive to the effects of GVG.

The cocaine vaccine, TA-CD, has demonstrated the ability to elicit an immunologic response capable of reducing the subjective reward of cocaine use in both animals and humans. These results make immunologic treatment of substance use disorders an exciting direction for the treatment of not only cocaine dependence but other substances as well. Finally, findings from preclinical trials for l-THP suggest this medication, which has been used for centuries as an herbal medication for other disorders, may be helpful in reducing cocaine dependence.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1175mSjp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, particularly in relation to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not using oral naltrexone for the treatment of opioid use disorder, except under very limited circumstances due to poor medication adherence. Its use should be reserved for patients able to comply with special techniques to enhance their adherence, such as observed dosing. It is recognized that extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, issues with medication adherence.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114JQqsg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

In the medical management of opioid use disorder, particularly concerning methadone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines advise ensuring that patients transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine are on low doses of methadone before making the switch. It is important to recognize that patients on low doses of methadone (≤ 30–40 mg/day) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas those on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort during the transition between medications.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^114PgT27]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control have recently described opioid use and resultant deaths as an epidemic. At this point in time, treating this disease well with medication requires skill and time that are not generally available to primary care doctors in most practice models. Suboptimal treatment has likely contributed to the expansion of the epidemic and concerns for unethical practices. At the same time, access to competent treatment is profoundly restricted because few physicians are willing and able to provide it.

This "Practice Guideline" was developed to assist in the evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder, and in the hope that, using this tool, more physicians will be able to provide effective treatment. Although there are existing guidelines for the treatment of opioid use disorder, none have included all of the medications used at present for its treatment. Moreover, few of the existing guidelines address the needs of special populations such as pregnant women, individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, individuals with pain, adolescents, or individuals involved in the criminal justice system.

This Practice Guideline was developed using the RAND Corporation (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM) – a process that combines scientific evidence and clinical knowledge to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures. The RAM is a deliberate approach encompassing review of existing guidelines, literature reviews, appropriateness ratings, necessity reviews, and document development.

### Measurement-based care using DSM-5 for opioid use disorder: Can we make opioid medication treatment more effective [^112TkRtv]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

The opioid crisis in many countries provides a pressing rationale for adopting a measurement-based care (MBC) approach to increase treatment effectiveness for opioid use disorder (OUD). We need to act quickly and effectively to address non-response to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the face of unprecedented levels of treatment need.

Implementing MBC practice principles will promote patient-centered care in the treatment of OUD within both primary and specialist care settings. MBC has the potential to stimulate the development of personalized addiction therapeutics and improve patient engagement and retention in all treatments for OUD, thereby reducing or preventing health and social harms while promoting a common metric for communicating outcomes.

It is essential for OUD remission status to be recorded at a basic minimum so that progress can be measured effectively and consistently. MBC may not fit comfortably in busy clinics if healthcare professionals perceive it as a burden that competes with time spent with the patient; however, since DSM-5 is already recorded, we advocate for the discussion of these symptoms with patients as part of care planning. This approach involves building and sustaining therapeutic engagement and adapting treatment to clinical response. Using DSM-5 for MBC should be the minimum standard for MOUD treatment.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112k1P4a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Psychosocial treatment in conjunction with medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder**: Psychosocial treatment is recommended alongside any pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder. At a minimum, psychosocial treatment should include the following: psychosocial needs assessment, supportive counseling, links to existing family supports, and referrals to community services. Treatment planning should involve collaboration with qualified behavioral healthcare providers to determine the optimal type and intensity of psychosocial treatment and to renegotiate the treatment plan when patients do not adhere to the recommended plans or referrals for psychosocial treatment. Psychosocial treatment is generally recommended for patients receiving opioid agonist treatment, such as methadone or buprenorphine. It should also be offered with oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone. The efficacy of extended-release injectable naltrexone for treating opioid use disorder has not been confirmed when used as pharmacotherapy without accompanying psychosocial treatment.

- **Special populations: pregnant women**: The first priority in evaluating pregnant women for opioid use disorder should be to identify emergent or urgent medical conditions that require immediate referral for clinical evaluation. A medical examination and psychosocial assessment are recommended when evaluating pregnant women for opioid use disorder. Obstetricians and gynecologists should be alert to signs and symptoms of opioid use disorder.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111e4Lqx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

In specific circumstances of opioid use disorder, particularly with patients who have other substance use disorders, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not to withhold or suspend treatment with methadone or buprenorphine in patients using benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics. It is important to recognize that, while the combined use of these medications increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. A risk-benefit analysis should be conducted, and greater support should be provided, including careful medication management to reduce risks.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of citicoline for cocaine dependence in bipolar I disorder [^111vX1cm]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Although drug dependence is common in patients with bipolar disorder, minimal data are available on the treatment of drug dependence in this patient population. The authors previously reported a decreased risk of relapse to cocaine use in a pilot study of citicoline in patients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence. The primary aim of the present study was to determine whether citicoline reduces cocaine use in outpatients with bipolar I disorder and cocaine dependence and active cocaine use.

A total of 130 outpatients with bipolar I disorder (depressed or mixed mood state) and cocaine dependence received citicoline or placebo add-on therapy for 12 weeks. Results of thrice-weekly urine drug screens were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model that was fitted to the binary outcome of cocaine-positive screens at each measurement occasion for 12 weeks. Mood was assessed with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale.

In the intent-to-treat sample (N = 61 in both groups), significant treatment group and group-by-time effects were observed, whether or not missing urine screens were imputed as cocaine positive. The group effect was greatest early in the study and tended to decline with time. No between-group differences in mood symptoms or side effects were observed.

Citicoline was well tolerated for treatment of cocaine dependence in patients with bipolar disorder. Cocaine use was significantly reduced with citicoline initially.

### Burden of disease due to amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and opioid use disorders in South America, 1990–2019: A systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^113FQYRz]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

Despite a decrease in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributed to cocaine use disorder in 2016–2019, the relevant burden in the region remains much higher than the global average. Cocaine use disorder burden is higher in both North and South America than globally. The burden for cocaine use was higher in South America but lower globally compared to amphetamine use disorder or cannabis use disorder. South America is the top global cocaine supplier, and the high prevalence of cocaine use can be linked to the proximity of production and the low price of the drug, especially in the form of crack and base paste. Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay contributed the most to the region's cocaine use disorder burden. Brazil and Uruguay were among the top global countries in DALYs attributable to the use of cocaine.

In South America, Brazil had the highest rates for both years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD), with high amounts of both snorted and smoked cocaine reported in studies conducted in the past two decades, making it one of the top global markets for buying cocaine. Cocaine use disorder affects individuals across several domains. A comparative study in Argentina found that people who smoke cocaine have broad vulnerability across different spheres (e.g. work, education, housing, and social), which could be important factors for increased morbidity and mortality owing to cocaine use disorder in the region. Base paste is a popular form of cocaine in South America. A retrospective naturalistic study (n = 113) conducted in Uruguay showed that this type of cocaine was significantly associated with suicidal behaviors shortly after use.

### Effect of concurrent substance use disorder on the effectiveness of single and combination antidepressant medications for the treatment of major depression: an exploratory analysis of a single-blind randomized trial [^114a94VJ]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

The co-occurrence of substance use disorder (SUD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and is often thought to impair response to antidepressant therapy. These patients are often excluded from clinical trials, resulting in a significant knowledge gap regarding optimal pharmacotherapy for the treatment of MDD with concurrent SUD.

- **Methods**: In the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes study, 665 adult outpatients with chronic and/or recurrent MDD were prospectively treated with either escitalopram monotherapy (escitalopram and placebo) or an antidepressant combination (venlafaxine-XR and mirtazapine or escitalopram and bupropion-SR). Participants with MDD and concurrent SUD (13.1%) were compared to those without SUD (86.9%) on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline and treatment response at 12- and 28-week endpoints.

- **Results**: The participants with MDD and SUD were more likely to be male, have suicidal thoughts/plans, and had a greater lifetime severity and number of suicide attempts, and a higher number of concurrent Axis I disorders, particularly concurrent anxiety disorders. There were no significant differences between the MDD with or without SUD groups in terms of dose, time in treatment, or response or remission at week 12 and 28. Furthermore, no significant differences in response or remission rates were noted between groups on the basis of the presence or absence of SUD and treatment assignment.

- **Conclusions**: Although significant baseline sociodemographic and clinical differences exist, patients with MDD and SUD showed no significant variance in treatment outcomes compared to those without SUD.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^116Z9o5q]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Recent clinical trials of modafinil in human subjects have highlighted either (1) the medication's impact upon actual cocaine use or (2) its ability to mitigate symptoms associated with cocaine abstinence. The rationale for using this medication relates to its stimulant-like properties and potential efficacy as a substitution agent that can reduce craving for cocaine.

With regard to its effect upon cocaine use, modafinil was examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 210) at two doses (200 mg and 400 mg); however, no significant differences were observed between the modafinil and placebo groups in their change in the average weekly percentage of cocaine non-use days. Of note, modafinil 200 mg demonstrated a significant reduction in craving as a secondary outcome. Interestingly, post-hoc analysis also found an increase in cocaine non-use days among those with co-morbid alcohol dependence who were treated with modafinil, suggesting a possible target subgroup among cocaine-addicted persons.

The impact of modafinil on sleep in chronic cocaine users was examined in a randomized, placebo-controlled, inpatient study (N = 20) by Morgan et al. The researchers found that modafinil 400 mg decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow-wave sleep time. Additionally, by the third week of abstinence from cocaine, the modafinil group experienced longer total sleep time and shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latency. Ultimately, modafinil demonstrated a normalizing effect on sleep, which could be particularly important during early phases of abstinence.

### Disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence [^117T5CCL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Cocaine is a psychostimulant used by approximately 0.4% of the general population worldwide. Cocaine dependence is a chronic mental disorder characterized by the inability to control cocaine use and a host of severe medical and psychosocial complications. There is no approved pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependence. Some researchers have proposed disulfiram, a medication approved to treat alcohol use disorder. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Search methods**: We updated our searches of the following databases to August 2022: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via two trials registries. We handsearched the references of topic-related systematic reviews and included studies. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated disulfiram alone or associated with psychosocial interventions versus placebo, no intervention, other pharmacological interventions, or any psychosocial intervention for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies (1191 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Disulfiram versus placebo or no treatment may increase the number of people who are abstinent.
