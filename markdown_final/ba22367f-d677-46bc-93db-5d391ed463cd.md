## Question

What is pudendal neuralgia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what pudendal neuralgia is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about a precise core definition anchored to accepted diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the anatomical substrate and common entrapment sites. Next, I will characterize the clinical syndrome and its distinguishing features. After that, I should confirm the validated diagnostic framework, especially the Nantes criteria and the role of image-guided anesthetic blocks. Then I will review etiologies, outline a pragmatic diagnostic evaluation pathway, summarize evidence-based management principles, and finally consider prognosis and special situations. I will ground this in the Nantes criteria and contemporary guideline recommendations for accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the core definition. Pudendal neuralgia is best understood as a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome localized to the sensory distribution of the pudendal nerve, with diagnosis that is essentially clinical rather than test-based, and for which pudendal nerve entrapment is a frequent but not exclusive mechanism of pathophysiology, so I should be careful not to equate all pudendal neuralgia with entrapment alone [^114VmqUh] [^112D54jD].

> I will now examine the anatomical substrate to ensure accuracy. The pudendal nerve arises from sacral roots S2–S4 and typically divides into inferior rectal, perineal, and dorsal genital branches; its mixed sensorimotor role underlies the combination of sensory pain and potential urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunction in the syndrome, with entrapment commonly described near the ischial spine between the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments or within Alcock's canal, though anatomic variation is common and clinically relevant during interventions [^116B8ANn] [^116DqVXC].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype. Classically, pain is in the pudendal territory (vulva/scrotum, perineum, anus), is characteristically worsened by sitting and relieved by standing or lying, does not awaken the patient from sleep, and on examination there is no objective sensory loss despite neuropathic descriptors like burning or electric shock; misdiagnosis is frequent, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion while confirming these pattern features [^114VmqUh] [^112Gf5cL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check the validated diagnostic framework. The Nantes criteria remain the cornerstone: pain in the pudendal territory, worse with sitting, not waking the patient at night, no objective sensory loss, and a positive anesthetic pudendal nerve block; exclusion criteria and complementary features refine specificity, and because no single test is pathognomonic, image- or nerve locator–guided blocks are favored to both aid diagnosis and predict interventional outcomes, with imaging and neurophysiology as adjuncts rather than arbiters [^114VmqUh] [^111JYYxp].

> Wait, let me verify the role and limits of testing so I do not overstate any modality. Image-guided pudendal nerve block is considered safe and useful diagnostically across modalities without clear superiority of ultrasound versus fluoroscopy, while neurophysiologic testing may assist but is not definitive, and routine pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing is not recommended in fecal incontinence populations, underscoring that electrophysiology should be selective and context-driven for pudendal neuralgia workups [^114hAf6p] [^111TgE4D].

> Let me consider etiologies so I capture the spectrum correctly. Mechanical entrapment between the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments or in Alcock's canal is well described; iatrogenic injury can follow pelvic or hip surgery, particularly perineal-post hip arthroscopy, while pelvic radiation, surgical scarring, obstetric trauma, and prolonged cycling are recognized contributors; but wait, I should clarify that not all cases have demonstrable compression, and non-entrapment pudendal neuralgia does occur and affects selection for surgery [^111jmcsN] [^1161Djgn].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic evaluation pathway. Clinically, I need a careful history focused on territory of pain, sitting provocation, nocturnal pattern, and associated urinary, bowel, and sexual symptoms, coupled with targeted pelvic examination; early referral to teams experienced in pelvic peripheral nerve pain is advised, and when suspicion is high, proceed with image-guided diagnostic pudendal block, reserving MR neurography or tractography and neurophysiologic studies as adjuncts that may help in selected cases but remain investigational or heterogeneous in performance; I should double-check that these adjuncts do not replace the clinical criteria [^113nnn9y] [^111JYYxp].

> I need to ensure management principles are methodically outlined. Start with conservative measures: activity modification and pressure-relief seating, pelvic floor physical therapy focused on down-training when hypertonic, and standard neuropathic pain pharmacotherapy per guidelines, such as gabapentin or pregabalin and other first-line agents, with gabapentin specifically suggested in women with chronic pelvic pain and suspected pudendal neuralgia; topical options like lidocaine may be considered when systemic effects are a concern, even though evidence is extrapolated from other neuropathic pain states [^1132KjmY] [^111GBKvZ].

> But wait, what if conservative therapy is insufficient? Then, I should review interventional options stepwise. Image-guided pudendal nerve blocks serve both diagnostic and therapeutic roles with variable but meaningful responses in subsets; pulsed radiofrequency and neuromodulation techniques, including sacral or pudendal-targeted stimulation, are options for refractory cases with growing albeit lower-level evidence; for carefully selected patients meeting Nantes criteria with positive diagnostic block and persistent disability, decompression surgery has supportive evidence, including randomized data favoring surgical release over non-surgical care, though technique and outcomes vary across centers and require experienced teams [^1117SK4p] [^116c7oww].

> Hold on, I should verify selection and prognostic factors before endorsing surgery. A positive response to a diagnostic anesthetic pudendal block predicts greater likelihood of postoperative improvement, whereas negative blocks portend poor surgical response; meta-analytic and contemporary series suggest approximately two-thirds of patients achieve significant pain relief after decompression, but heterogeneity is high, making preoperative selection and counseling crucial; if surgery fails or is not pursued, neuromodulation remains a salvage pathway [^1126aj6Y] [^113VRNSj].

> Finally, I will contextualize prognosis and special considerations. Misdiagnosis and delays are common and may worsen outcomes, central sensitization can coexist and should be screened with validated clinical tools to tailor multidisciplinary care, and comorbid pelvic floor or colorectal dysfunction may complicate interpretation of neurophysiologic tests, reinforcing the primacy of clinical criteria and team-based management; I should double-check that I keep follow-up iterative, reassessing response to each step to avoid premature escalation or missed opportunities for de-escalation [^112Gf5cL] [^115iJnDY].

### Diagnostic criteria for pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment (Nantes criteria) [^114VmqUh]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome is essentially clinical. While there are no pathognomonic criteria, various clinical features can be suggestive of the diagnosis. A set of criteria has been defined to aid in the diagnosis.

A working party has validated a set of simple diagnostic criteria known as the Nantes criteria. The five essential diagnostic criteria are as follows: (1) Pain in the anatomical territory of the pudendal nerve; (2) Worsened by sitting; (3) The patient is not woken at night by the pain; (4) No objective sensory loss on clinical examination; (5) Positive anesthetic pudendal nerve block. Other clinical criteria may provide additional support for the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia. Proposed exclusion criteria include purely coccygeal, gluteal, or hypogastric pain, exclusively paroxysmal pain, exclusive pruritus, and presence of imaging abnormalities able to explain the symptoms.

In conclusion, the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome remains primarily clinical. Although there are no specific clinical signs or complementary test results for this disease, a combination of criteria can be suggestive of the diagnosis.

### Surgical approaches for pudendal nerve entrapment: Insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VRNSj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) is an underdiagnosed condition affecting a spectrum of pelvic functions, primarily pain, as outlined by Nantes diagnostic criteria. Although numerous surgical decompression techniques are available for its management, consensus on efficacy and safety is lacking. This study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and complication rates of the main surgical decompression techniques.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed®, Embase®, Web of Science®, and ClinicalTrails.gov® on April 19, 2023. Initial screening involved title and abstract evaluation, followed by retrieval and assessment of full-text articles. Studies assessing pain outcomes before and after surgical release of the pudendal nerve were included. Studies without full-texts, those focusing on diagnostic methods, or those with outcomes relating solely to LUTS, digestive symptoms, or sexual dysfunction were excluded. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using the National Institute of Health (NIH) Study Quality Assessment Tool. Studies were categorized based on three surgical techniques: perineal, transgluteal, and laparoscopic transperitoneal. Random-effects meta-analysis with subgroup analysis was used. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of covariates on the observed outcomes.

- **Results**: Nineteen studies, comprising 810 patients, were included. The overall significant pain relief rate across all techniques was estimated at 0.67 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.78) with considerable heterogeneity.

### Pudendal nerve entrapment as source of intractable perineal pain [^115QR66M]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Perineal pain caused by pudendal nerve entrapment is a rarely reported entity, with only a handful of cases in the modern literature. A 25-year-old male medical student had refractory unilateral orchialgia for 32 months and concomitant proctalgia for 14 months. Pain was positional in nature, exacerbated by sitting and partially relieved when standing or recumbent. Pudendal nerve entrapment was diagnosed clinically, with computed tomography-guided nerve blocks providing temporary relief. A prolonged left pudendal nerve distal motor latency on electrodiagnostic testing later confirmed the diagnosis.

At surgery, the left pudendal nerve was found flattened in the pudendal canal of Alcock and in contact with the sharp inferior border of the sacrospinous ligament. After surgical decompression and rehabilitation, the patient experienced significant relief of pain and returned to medical school. This case suggests pudendal nerve entrapment should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic urogenital or anorectal pain, particularly if the pain is aggravated by sitting or if there is a history of bicycle riding.

### Pudendal neuralgia, a severe pain syndrome [^112Gf5cL]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to describe the clinical and electrodiagnostic findings, therapies, and outcomes of patients with pudendal neuralgia.

- **Study design**: A retrospective, descriptive study of 64 patients from March 19 to December 22, 2003.

- **Results**:
	- Clinical findings included pain along nerve distribution (64, 100%), pain aggravated by sitting (62, 97%), pain relieved by standing or lying (57, 89%), and misdiagnosis (53, 83%).
	- Neurophysiologic findings were normal (23, 35%), demyelination (17, 26%), axonal loss (5, 7.5%), and demyelination with axonal loss (21, 32%).
	- Therapies were conservative (64, 100%), nerve injection (38, 59%), neuromodulation (2, 3%), and decompression surgery (10, 15%).
	- Slight or moderate pain improvement with therapies included conservative (64, 100%), nerve injection (12, 31%), neuromodulation (2, 100%), and decompression (6, 60%).

- **Conclusion**: Pudendal neuralgia is poorly recognized and poorly treated. Improvement is gained with conservative therapy. Injections and decompression benefit one half and one third of patients, respectively. Neuromodulation needs further evaluation.

### Response to pudendal nerve block in women with pudendal neuralgia [^1117SK4p]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To examine the evolution of pain and the duration of numbness after neural blockade of the pudendal nerve in women with pudendal neuralgia, the study correlates these with clinical and historical data.

- **Design**: Prospective, single-arm, open-label study.

- **Setting**: University hospital and outpatient clinic.

- **Subjects**: Eighty-two adult female patients were recruited from November 8, 2008, to February 14, 2010. Patients were selected based on the presence of spontaneous or provoked pain in the distribution of the pudendal nerve.

- **Interventions**: Subjects underwent a standardized pudendal nerve block.

- **Outcome measures**: Visual analog pain scores and the presence of numbness were recorded before and for 64 hours after the pudendal nerve block. A complete clinical history and examination were documented.

- **Results**: Sixty-six patients completed the study. About 86.9% had a reduction in one or more pain symptoms, while 44.3% found that more than one of their pain symptoms did not return. Approximately 69.7% of patients reported numbness lasting up to 16 hours or longer. Previous gynecological surgery was recorded in 75.8%, and previous traumatic obstetric events in 47.0% of cases. A prolonged history of pain correlated with a reduced chance of a positive outcome of the pudendal nerve block.

- **Conclusion**: In patients with pudendal neuralgia, the pudendal nerve block has a variable response, but may have a beneficial effect in a subset of women. Surgical and obstetrical trauma are common historical antecedents.

### Advancing the diagnosis and management of pudendal nerve entrapment: The role of neurophysiological studies and imaging-guided infiltrations [^112BAmFt]. Neuroradiology (2025). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) diagnosis is not standardized, leading to delays in diagnosis that impact both quality of life and therapeutic outcomes. The main goal of this study is to explore the role of neurophysiological studies (NFS) and imaging-guided pudendal nerve infiltration (ImPNI) in diagnosing PNE and selecting patients for surgery.

A retrospective, multicentric study was conducted, including patients with PNE refractory to conservative treatment. Patient data, encompassing NFS results, ImPNI, and surgical outcomes, were evaluated. A visual analogue scale was applied to assess responses to interventions. Test performance metrics for NFS and ImPNI, alongside binary logistic regression, were used to determine their predictive value for postoperative improvement.

Eighty-eight patients were diagnosed with PNE. All patients underwent NFS, and ImPNI was performed in 69 patients (78.4%), with 60 patients (68.2%) showing symptom improvement. Among the 40 patients (85%) who underwent pudendal nerve decompression surgery, 75% showed improvement, while 20% did not. The combination of NFS and ImPNI displayed a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 85.7%, with a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 98% and a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 30%. Both NFS and ImPNI were significant predictors of surgical success, with p-values of 0.013 [95% CI: -23.6–19.9] and 0.003 [95% CI: -20.6–18.5], respectively. Primary limitations of the study include its retrospective design and the absence of a control group.

In conclusion, NFS and ImPNI are essential and highly reliable tools for diagnosing PNE. Additionally, ImPNI is a valuable predictor of surgical outcomes.

### Anatomical variants of the pudendal nerve observed during a transgluteal surgical approach in a population of patients with pudendal neuralgia [^116DqVXC]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Several studies have described the course and anatomical relations of the pudendal nerve. Various surgical nerve decompression techniques have been described, but only the transgluteal approach has been validated by a prospective randomized clinical trial. The purpose of this study was to describe the course of the nerve and its variants in a population of patients with pudendal neuralgia to guide the surgeon in the choice of surgical approach for pudendal nerve decompression.

- **Objectives**: In order to support the choice of the transgluteal approach used in our institution, we studied the exact topography, anatomical relations, and zones of entrapment of the pudendal nerve in a cohort of operated patients.

- **Study design**: Observational study.

- **Setting**: University hospital.

- **Methods**: One hundred patients underwent unilateral or bilateral nerve decompression performed by a single operator via a transgluteal approach. All patients satisfied the Nantes criteria for pudendal neuralgia. The operator meticulously recorded zones of entrapment, anatomical variants of the course of the nerve, and the appearance of the nerve in the operative report.

- **Results**: One hundred patients and 145 nerves were operated on consecutively. Compression of at least one segment of the pudendal nerve (infrapiriform foramen, ischial spine, and Alcock's canal) was observed in 95 patients. The zone of entrapment was situated at the ischial spine between the sacrospinous ligament (or ischial spine) and the sacrotuberous ligament in 74% of patients. Anatomical variants were observed in 13 patients.

### Hip arthroscopy and periacetabular osteotomy generally improve sexual function in patients, but have a risk of iatrogenic pudendal nerve injury that can temporarily worsen sexual function: A systematic review [^114f3nMV]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Hip arthroscopy and periacetabular osteotomy are surgical procedures often used to treat various hip disorders. These procedures generally improve sexual function in patients by alleviating pain and increasing mobility. However, they carry a risk of iatrogenic pudendal nerve injury, which can temporarily worsen sexual function.

- **Study findings**: The systematic review evaluated multiple studies to assess the effectiveness and safety of these surgical interventions. While both procedures have shown positive outcomes in terms of patient satisfaction and sexual function, a small percentage of patients experienced temporary declines due to nerve injury.

- **Implications for practice**: Clinicians should be aware of the potential risks and benefits when recommending these procedures. Patients should be informed about the possibility of nerve injury and its implications on sexual function.

Overall, while hip arthroscopy and periacetabular osteotomy are beneficial, careful consideration and patient counseling are essential to manage expectations and postoperative outcomes effectively.

### Lumbosacral plexus and pudendal nerve magnetic resonance tractography: A systematic review of the clinical applications for pudendal neuralgia [^113HTGah]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly used to establish three-dimensional mapping of white-matter bundles in the supraspinal central nervous system. DTI has also been the subject of many studies on cranial and peripheral nerves. This non-invasive imaging technique enables virtual dissection of nerves in vivo and provides specific measurements of microstructural integrity. Adverse effects on the lumbosacral plexus may be traumatic, compressive, tumoral, or malformative and thus require dedicated treatment. DTI could lead to new perspectives in pudendal neuralgia diagnosis and management.

We performed a systematic review of all articles or posters reporting results and protocols for lumbosacral plexus mapping using the DTI technique between January 2011 and December 2023. Twenty-nine articles published were included. Ten studies, with a total of 351 participants, were able to track the lumbosacral plexus in a physiological context, and 19 studies, with a total of 402 subjects, tracked the lumbosacral plexus in a pathological context.

Tractography was performed on a 1.5T or 3T MRI system. DTI applied to the lumbosacral plexus and pudendal nerve is feasible, but no microstructural normative value has been proposed for the pudendal nerve. The most frequently used tracking parameters in our review are: 3T MRI, b-value of 800 s/mm², 33 directions, 3 × 3 × 3 mm³ voxel size, AF threshold of 0.1, minimum fiber length of 10 mm, bending angle of 30°, and 3DT2 TSE anatomical resolution. Increased use of DTI could lead to new perspectives in the management of pudendal neuralgia due to entrapment syndrome.

### Decompression and transposition of the pudendal nerve in pudendal neuralgia: a randomized controlled trial and long-term evaluation [^116c7oww]. European Urology (2005). High credibility.

We assess that pudendal neuralgia is a tunnel syndrome due to a ligamentous entrapment of the pudendal nerve and have treated 400 patients surgically since 1987. We have had no major complications. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate our procedure.

- **Methods**: A sequential, randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare decompression of the pudendal nerve with non-surgical treatment. Patients aged 18–70, experiencing chronic, uni/bilateral perineal pain and a positive temporary response to blocks at the ischial spine and in Alcock's canal, were randomly assigned to surgery (n = 16) and control (n = 16) groups. The primary endpoint was improvement at 3 months following surgery or assignment to the non-surgery group. Secondary endpoints were improvement at 12 months and at 4 years following surgical intervention.

- **Results**: A significantly higher proportion of the surgery group showed improvement at 3 months. On intention-to-treat analysis, 50% of the surgery group reported improvement in pain at 3 months versus 6.2% of the non-surgery group (p = .0155); in the analysis by treatment protocol, the figures were 57.1% versus 6.7% (p = .0052). At 12 months, 71.4% of the surgery group compared with 13.3% of the non-surgery group were improved, analyzing by treatment protocol (p = .0025). Only those randomized to surgery were evaluated at 4 years; 8 remained improved at 4 years. No complications were encountered.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, we demonstrate that decompression of the pudendal nerve is an effective and safe treatment for cases of chronic pudendal neuralgia that have been unresponsive to other treatments.

### Spinal cord stimulation of the conus medullaris for refractory pudendal neuralgia: a prospective study of 27 consecutive cases [^115K9bVA]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

Thirty percent of patients with pudendal neuralgia due to pudendal nerve entrapment obtain little or no relief from nerve decompression surgery. The objective was to describe the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation of the conus medullaris in patients with refractory pudendal neuralgia.

This prospective study, conducted by two centers in the same university city, described the results obtained on perineal pain and functional disability in all patients with an implanted conus medullaris stimulation electrode for the treatment of refractory pudendal neuralgia. Twenty-seven consecutive patients were included by a multidisciplinary pelvis and perineal pain clinic between May 2011 and July 2012. The mean follow-up was 15 months. The intervention included the insertion of a stimulation electrode, followed by a test period lasting an average of 13 days before deciding on permanent electrode implantation. Maximum and average perineal pain scores and the pain-free sitting time were initially compared during the test and in the long term (paired t-test). The estimated percent improvement (EPI) was evaluated in the long term.

Twenty of the 27 patients were considered responders to spinal cord stimulation, and 100% of implanted patients remained long-term responders, with a mean tripling of sitting time and a mean EPI of 55.5%.

Spinal cord stimulation of the conus medullaris is a safe and effective technique for long-term treatment of refractory pudendal neuralgia. The routine use of this technique, which has never been previously reported in the literature, is recommended for patients experiencing this condition.

### Pudendal neuropathy involving the perforating cutaneous nerve after cystocele repair with graft [^1175Shvi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuropathy is a documented complication of sacrospinous ligament fixation; however, it is infrequently reported with other types of gynecologic surgery. A case involved a woman who developed neuropathic symptoms of the right vulva, perianal area, and gluteal fold following vaginal surgery with a graft for anterior pelvic organ prolapse. Pudendal nerve entrapment, involving the perforating cutaneous nerve, was suspected. One year after the operation, suture removal led to improved pain symptoms and enhanced sexual function.

Pudendal nerve entrapment is a potential complication of anterior vaginal repair with biologic graft. The removal of sutures, even long after surgery, can result in significant improvement in pain symptoms and sexual function in patients experiencing pudendal nerve entrapment.

### Pulsed radiofrequency ablation of pudendal nerve for treatment of a case of refractory pelvic pain [^115nvsR5]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia (PN) results from pudendal nerve entrapment or injury, also known as "Alcock syndrome". The pain that develops is often chronic and can be debilitating. If conservative measures fail, invasive treatment modalities can be considered. The goal of this case report is to contribute to the limited literature demonstrating that pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) ablation can effectively treat PN and that high-resolution MR neurography imaging can detect pudendal neuropathy.

- **Case presentation**: We present a case of a 51-year-old woman with a 5-year history of worsening right groin and vulva pain. Various medication trials provided only limited pain relief. The first diagnostic right pudendal nerve block was performed using 3 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 6 mg of betamethasone via a transgluteal technique, targeting the right ischial spine. This procedure resulted in approximately 8 hours of greater than 50% pain relief. The patient was then referred for MR neurography of the lumbosacral plexus. The study revealed increased signal of the right pudendal nerve at the ischial spine and in the pudendal canal, findings consistent with the clinical picture of PN. Six weeks after the initial block, the patient underwent a second right transgluteal pudendal nerve block, using 3 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide; this procedure achieved approximately 8 hours of 100% pain relief. Satisfied with these results, the patient decided to undergo pudendal nerve PRF ablation for possible long-term relief. For this therapeutic procedure, a right transgluteal approach was again utilized.

### Initial experience of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency ablation of the pudendal nerve for chronic recalcitrant pelvic pain [^112FfxBb]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

To evaluate the initial experience with computed tomography (CT)-guided pulsed radiofrequency ablation (pRFA) of the pudendal nerve in cases of recalcitrant neuropathic pelvic pain, this study focused on endpoints including technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy of therapy.

- **Materials and methods**: Ten patients who underwent pRFA for neuropathic pudendal nerve pain during the trial period were followed for their response to treatment over 6 months. Each patient received pRFA under CT guidance with perineural injection of anesthetic and/or corticosteroid. Pain scores were measured using a numeric rating scale at fixed intervals up to 6 months.

- **Results**: All procedures were technically successful with no immediate complications. pRFA demonstrated an improved duration of pain relief compared to the most recent perineural injection (p = 0.0195) but not compared to the initial injection (p = 0.64). Reported pain scores were lower with pRFA than with both the first and most recent injections; however, this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1094 and p = 0.7539, respectively).

- **Conclusion**: Overall, pRFA of the pudendal nerve using CT guidance can be a safe and effective therapy. The technique provides direct visualization of the nerve to maximize safety and efficacy, offering a novel form of therapy for patients with chronic, recalcitrant pelvic pain.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation for pudendal neuralgia: A technical note [^1123tmA3]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuropathy is a chronic, disabling form of perineal pain that involves the pudendal nerve, a mixed somatic and autonomic nerve originating from the sacral nerve roots. Peripheral nerve stimulation of the pudendal nerve can be useful in decreasing symptom burden in patients who have failed initial conservative treatment modalities. In this manuscript, we describe an approach to the placement of a peripheral nerve stimulator for the treatment of pudendal neuralgia. We present a case of complex pelvic neuropathy and review the factors that lead to successful placement. Technical aspects of stimulator placement and ultrasound landmarks are reviewed.

A lateral-to-medial approach with ultrasound guidance at the level of the ischial spine is likely to facilitate proper lead placement along the course of the pudendal nerve. Aftercare and adherence to post-implant activity restrictions, particularly avoiding the extremes of hip flexion and extension for four weeks, lead to the absence of lead migration. Pudendal nerve stimulation is an emerging technique for the neuromodulation of refractory pudendal neuralgia. Ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve stimulation is a viable technique for neuromodulation of pudendal neuralgia. Optimization of patient selection, ultrasound guidance, and proper adherence to post-implant activity restrictions may be helpful for long-term therapeutic success.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR)-part VII, nerves of the lower limb [^114hAf6p]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Image-guided pudendal nerve block is safe, effective, and well tolerated with few complications. A successful pudendal nerve block is crucial for the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia and provides guidance for treatment. Different studies, including two randomized controlled trials, have demonstrated the absence of complications for this procedure. Furthermore, no significant difference in terms of efficacy was demonstrated between ultrasound (US) and fluoroscopic guidance.

US-guided interventional procedures around the genitofemoral nerve are feasible and effective, but evidence is only supported by a small series. US-guided procedures around the genitofemoral nerve are usually performed in conjunction with other nerve procedures, such as those involving the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves. Consequently, in some papers, it is challenging to differentiate the outcomes of these various procedures. The results are generally reported on small series. Lee et al. reported the results of radiofrequency ablation of the genitofemoral nerve in four patients, with a reported 100% reduction of pain lasting up to 12 months.

US-guided perisciatic injection of anesthetic provides good symptom relief in patients with piriformis syndrome. However, the addition of corticosteroids to local anesthetics still has an unclear role.

### Combined decompression of pudendal and inferior cluneal nerves for entrapment neuralgias using transperitoneal robotic laparoscopy: Feasibility and our four-step technique [^111TpLqM]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a combined decompression of pudendal and inferior cluneal nerves for entrapment syndrome using a transperitoneal robotic laparoscopy.

- **Design**: Demonstration of our four-step technique with narrated video footage.

- **Setting**: Pudendal and inferior cluneal neuralgias, caused by an entrapment syndrome, are responsible for perineal pain [1]. Although precise data are lacking, these two neuralgias are frequently associated. The failure of surgical pudendal nerve decompression in the early 2000s led to the discovery of a potential entrapment syndrome of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh and its inferior cluneal branches between the ischium bone and the sacrotuberous ligament [2]. The corresponding neuralgia causes neuropathic pain to a more posterior part of the perineum and the thigh, without any neurovegetative symptoms. In cases of medical treatment failure, surgery can be proposed using an invasive open transgluteal approach as a standard treatment [3–5].

- **Interventions**: Transperitoneal robotic laparoscopy for a minimally invasive release of both pudendal and inferior cluneal nerves, following a four-step technique:
	1. Opening of the peritoneum between the external iliac vessels and the umbilical ligament.
	2. Dissection of the internal iliac and pudendal arteries up to the pudendal nerve.
	3. Section of the sacrospinous ligament and release of the pudendal nerve.
	4. Section of the sacrotuberous ligament and release of the inferior cluneal nerve.

### Successful treatment of penile numbness and erectile dysfunction resulting from pudendal nerve entrapment [^113uCRVk]. Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve decompression surgery has not been studied or reported for the treatment of penile numbness in the absence of pain. Herein, we report a case of a male patient with chronic numbness of the penis and erectile dysfunction, in the absence of pelvic pain, who was found to have pudendal nerve entrapment. This patient was treated with surgical decompression of the pudendal nerves, which resulted in the return of genital sensation and erections. Thus, we propose that pudendal nerve entrapment may be considered a cause of penile numbness and that pudendal nerve decompression surgery in these patients may be effective.

### Pudendal entrapment as an etiology of chronic perineal pain: Diagnosis and treatment [^113WwCwd]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2007). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to evaluate pudendal entrapment as an etiology of chronic pain, a diagnostic protocol for pudendal entrapment, and clinical response to surgical decompression.

- **Methods**: A case series of 58 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of pudendal entrapment, based on clinical factors, neurophysiologic studies, and response to pudendal nerve infiltrations, is described. All patients were refractory to other treatment modalities. Patients were assessed before and after surgical decompression: degree of pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) score, percent global overall improvement, and improved function and quality of life before surgery and 12 months or longer after surgery.

- **Results**: The primary presenting feature was progressive, chronic, intractable neuropathic pain in the perineum (ano-rectal and/or urogenital) that worsened with sitting. Other symptoms included urinary hesitancy, frequency, urgency, constipation/painful bowel movements, and sexual dysfunction. After surgical decompression, 35 (60%) patients were classified as responders, based on one of the following three criteria: a greater than 50% reduction in VAS score, a greater than 50% improvement in global assessment of pain, or a greater than 50% improvement in function and quality of life.

- **Conclusions**: Pudendal entrapment can be a cause of chronic, disabling perineal pain in both men and women. Since symptomatic patients seek medical care from many different medical specialists, a reliable diagnostic protocol should be established.

### Hip arthroscopy and periacetabular osteotomy generally improve sexual function in patients, but have a risk of iatrogenic pudendal nerve injury that can temporarily worsen sexual function: A systematic review [^1161Djgn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Although most studies agree that sexual function is improved after hip sports medicine orthopaedic surgeries, it is important that patients are counselled on the risk of iatrogenic nerve injuries during surgery. The use of a perineal post during hip arthroscopy is implicated in almost a quarter of all intraoperative complications with this surgery. Importantly, the pudendal nerve is at risk for injury in hip arthroscopy. The pudendal nerve is a major nerve responsible for sexual function. In female patients, the pudendal nerve may be implicated in symptoms of vulvodynia associated with femoroacetabular impingement. For male patients, damage to the pudendal nerve can contribute to erectile dysfunction after surgery.

In patients with ongoing pudendal nerve damage or entrapment, potential therapeutic measures include anaesthesia injection, decompression, or neurolysis. To avoid pudendal nerve damage intra-operatively, one study in this review conducted hip arthroscopy without a perineal post. The authors found that in a postless hip arthroscopy, 0% of patients had iatrogenic nerve injuries. Further studies comparing hip arthroscopy with and without the use of a perineal post could be conducted to verify the benefit of postless hip arthroscopy on reducing pudendal nerve injury. Other major nerves implicated in iatrogenic nerve injuries were the sciatic nerve and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. In a systematic review, deep gluteal syndrome causing sciatic nerve entrapment was iatrogenic in 30% of cases.

### Pudendal entrapment neuropathy: A rare complication of pelvic radiation therapy [^111jmcsN]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) is an uncommon cause of chronic pain. It typically occurs when the pudendal nerve is fused to nearby anatomical structures or trapped between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinalis ligaments. Various factors can cause pudendal nerve entrapment, including excessive bicycling, pregnancy, anatomical abnormalities, scarring due to surgery, or as a sequela of radiation therapy. Radiation-induced peripheral neuropathy is usually chronic, progressive, and often irreversible. Radiation-induced pudendal neuropathy is much less common than the more familiar brachial plexopathy, which occurs secondary to radiation treatment for breast cancer. The prevalence of PNE is increasing due to improved long-term cancer survival.

The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia is essentially clinical; no specific clinical signs or complementary tests are reliably confirmatory. A detailed pain history with correlative clinical examination is paramount for accurate diagnosis. Performing a pudendal nerve block can serve both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Utilizing various imaging studies, as well as conducting an electrophysiological study with pudendal nerve motor latency testing, may provide valuable evidence in support of a pudendal neuralgia diagnosis.

We present the case of a 59-year-old man with stage IV prostate cancer, referred to the pain clinic for chronic perineal and right-sided pelvic pain. His pain began insidiously approximately 2 months after undergoing radiation treatment and chemotherapy 3 years prior. He was ultimately diagnosed with a right-side pudendal nerve entrapment.

### A novel electrophysiological method in the diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy: Position-related changes in pudendal sensory evoked potentials [^112XjnWW]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the diagnostic value of pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) neuropathy. This was done by stimulating the two sides separately after provocation by a standard sitting position. Routine pudendal SEPs performed in the supine position with bilateral simultaneous stimulation may fail to show the abnormality because the complaints of PNE appear or worsen in the sitting position.

- **Methods**: Forty-nine patients with PNE and 16 controls were included. SEP recordings were performed by stimulating the dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris on either side. The recordings were performed at the initial supine position, at the beginning and end of the provocation by sitting position, and at the second supine position.

- **Results**: Amplitude loss in the SEP responses after prolonged sitting was significantly more pronounced on the symptomatic sides of the patients. Approximately 45% decrease in the SEP amplitude or an amplitude value less than 1.5µV at the end of sitting are the parameters to be used with high selectivity.

- **Conclusion**: The dynamic pudendal SEP study described herein seems to be more helpful in PNE diagnosis than in conventional SEPs.

### Role of 3 tesla MR neurography and CT-guided injections for pudendal neuralgia: Analysis of pain response [^113z29xc]. Pain Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has an increasing role in the diagnosis and management of pudendal neuralgia, a neurogenic cause of chronic pelvic pain.

- **Objective**: The objective of this research was to determine the role of MRN in predicting improved pain outcomes following computed tomography (CT)-guided perineural injections in patients with pudendal neuralgia.

- **Study design**: This study used a retrospective cross-sectional study design.

- **Setting**: The research was conducted at a large academic hospital.

- **Methods**
- **Patients**: Ninety-one patients (139 injections) who received MRN and CT-guided pudendal blocks were analyzed.
- **Intervention**: A 3 Tesla (T) scanner was used to evaluate the lumbosacral plexus for pudendal neuropathy. Prior to receiving a CT-guided pudendal perineural injection, patients were given pain logs and asked to record pain on a visual analog scale.
- **Measurement**: MRN findings for pudendal neuropathy were compared to the results of the CT-guided pudendal nerve blocks. Injection pain responses were categorized into three groups: positive block, possible positive block, and negative block.
	- **Statistical tests**: A chi-square test was used to test any association, and a Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to test any trend. The significance level was set at .05. All analyses were done in SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

- **Results**: Ninety-one patients (139 injections) who received MRN were analyzed. Of these 139 injections, 41 were considered positive (29.5%), 52 were possible positives (37.4%), and 46 were negative blocks (33.1%).

### Sacral neuromodulation as a treatment for pudendal neuralgia [^115BmwDF]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is a debilitating pain syndrome, and finding long-lasting treatment modalities has been challenging in pain management. The pudendal nerve has sensory and motor functions, and influences autonomic functions. Thus, entrapment or damage of this nerve can have multiple serious implications. The constellation of symptoms which result from injury to this nerve is commonly referred to as pudendal neuralgia. When conservative therapy does not provide adequate pain relief, and surgical procedures fail or are not viable options, central and peripheral nerve stimulation can be effective treatment modalities.

More recent approaches to treatment include the use of peripheral nerve stimulation through the use of an electrical lead placed next to the pudendal nerve in the ischioanal fossa. Additionally, epidural stimulation of the conus medullaris and pulsed radiofrequency ablation of the pudendal nerve have been shown to be effective in small patient populations.

We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who sustained pudendal nerve injury during a hysterectomy and subsequently developed intractable pelvic pain and pudendal neuralgia. Conservative treatment measures failed, but she obtained excellent results from peripheral nerve stimulator therapy. The permanent implantation consisted of four tined Interstim leads, individually placed into the bilateral S3 and S4 foramina. The patient has been followed for approximately four years since her procedure, demonstrating increased function as she is able to stand and sit for prolonged periods of time. She has returned to her usual daily activities.

### The puborectal continence reflex functions independently of the pudendal nerve [^115uw1ZY]. Colorectal Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The study examines faecal incontinence, a debilitating condition, demonstrating that the puborectal continence reflex, which involves involuntary contractions of the puborectal muscle, is functionally independent of the pudendal nerve. Identifying the precise nerve pathway might aid in preventing accidental damage to the faecal continence mechanism.

### Chronic pelvic pain: Neurogenic or non-neurogenic? Warm detection threshold testing supports a diagnosis of pudendal neuropathy [^117HEMsr]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in men is rarely considered to have a neurogenic (neuropathic) basis. The separation of neurogenic from non-neurogenic pain is achievable through clinical examination and neurophysiologic tests, allowing for a definite diagnosis of neuropathic pain.

- **Objectives**: We aim to demonstrate that definite pudendal neuropathic abnormalities can be supported by a quantitative sensory test (QST) called the warm temperature threshold detection (WDT) test in men with CPP.

- **Study design**: This is a retrospective review of 25 consecutive, unrecruited men evaluated in a private clinical practice beginning on January 1, 2010. The techniques of examination and neurophysiological testing have been standard since 2003.

- **Setting**: A private practice that serves as a referral center due to its focus on CPP of a neuropathic basis.

- **Methods**: Pinprick sensation was evaluated at six sites in the pudendal nerve territory (three branches on each side). A WDT was performed at each nerve branch using a Physitemp NTE-2C Thermoprobe and Controller, utilizing a stepping algorithm from a neutral baseline of 31.5°C. Quantitative and subjective "qualitative responses" were recorded. Our preferred symptom score to evaluate pain level at consultation is the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). The results provide a benchmark for comparison of responses following future treatments (not discussed). Whenever possible, microscopy was used to evaluate prostate secretions for inflammatory prostatitis, except in two men with CPP who had undergone previous radical prostatectomy.

### Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women [^112ftAh3]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Acute pelvic pain is defined as noncyclic, intense pain localized to the lower abdomen and/or pelvis, with a duration of less than three months. Signs and symptoms are often nonspecific. The differential diagnosis is broad, based on the patient's age, pregnancy status, and whether the etiology is gynecologic or nongynecologic. Nongynecologic etiologies include gastrointestinal, urinary, and musculoskeletal conditions. Urgent gynecologic conditions include ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, adnexal torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Approximately 40% of ectopic pregnancies are misdiagnosed at the presenting visit. Urgent nongynecologic conditions include appendicitis and pyelonephritis. Less urgent etiologies include sexually transmitted infections, pelvic floor myofascial pain, dysmenorrhea, and muscle strain. Approximately 15% of untreated chlamydia infections lead to pelvic inflammatory disease.

History and physical examination findings guide laboratory testing. Questions should focus on the type, onset, location, and radiation of pain; timing and duration of symptoms; aggravating and relieving factors; and associated symptoms. Performing a urine pregnancy test or beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an important first step for sexually active, premenopausal patients. Imaging options should be considered, with transvaginal ultrasonography first, followed by computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging can be useful if ultrasonography and computed tomography are nondiagnostic.

### Hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of fecal incontinence secondary to pudendal neuropathy [^116p6exD]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has several physiological effects on damaged nerves in animal models, leading to improvements in neurological function. Idiopathic fecal incontinence secondary to pudendal neuropathy is usually treated with biofeedback, which shows improvement in only 50 percent of patients.

Thirteen patients (12 females, aged 40–75 years) with chronic pudendal neuropathy and fecal incontinence were identified. They received 30 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen over a period of 6 weeks, with each treatment administered at 2.4 atmospheres while breathing pure oxygen for 90 minutes. Pudendal latencies were measured sequentially throughout the treatment and one and six months after its completion. Questionnaires were used to assess improvements in symptoms and quality of life, utilizing the Wexner fecal incontinence quality of life score.

All patients completed the treatment without major complications. There was a consistent improvement in latencies; initially, on the left side, it was 2.36 msec, which reduced to 2.08 msec at the 6-month follow-up. On the right side, it was 2.23 msec, and on the left, it reduced to 2.07 msec at 6 months. These improvements were statistically significant (Wilcoxon's two-tailed, asymptomatic significance, comparing pretreatment to 6-month follow-up, left 0.005, right 0.003). Incontinence scores also improved from 12.08 initially to 11.64 at the end of treatment, 10.55 at the 1-month follow-up, and 10.45 at the 6-month follow-up. Using the same test, the improvement in incontinence scores was also significant when comparing pre-end (0.05) and pre-one month (0.011), but not pre-six month (0.054).

### Evaluating the discordant relationship between Tarlov cysts and symptoms of pudendal neuralgia [^116mSjEm]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is a painful neuropathic condition involving the pudendal nerve dermatome. Tarlov cysts have been reported in the literature as another potential cause of chronic lumbosacral and pelvic pain. Notably, they are often located in the distribution of the pudendal nerve origin at the S2, S3, and S4 sacral nerve roots, and it has been postulated that they may cause symptoms similar to pudendal neuralgia. Literature has been inconsistent regarding the clinical relevance of the cysts and whether they are responsible for symptoms.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the prevalence of S2-S4 Tarlov cysts at the pudendal nerve origin (S2-S4 sacral nerve roots) in patients specifically diagnosed with pudendal neuralgia and establish the association of patient symptoms with the location of Tarlov cysts.

- **Study design**: A retrospective study was performed on 242 patients with pudendal neuralgia referred for pelvic magnetic resonance imaging from January 2010 to November 2012. Dedicated magnetic resonance imaging review evaluated the presence, level, site, and size of Tarlov cysts. Among those with demonstrable cysts, subsequent imaging data were collected and correlated with the patients' clinical site of symptoms. Statistical analysis was performed using χ², Pearson χ², and Fisher exact tests to assess significance.

- **Results**: Thirty-nine (16.1%) patients demonstrated at least one sacral Tarlov cyst; of the 38 patients with complete pain records, 31 (81.6%) had a mismatch in findings. A total of 50 Tarlov cysts were identified in the entire patient cohort.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^11669DL3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a widespread condition impacting many patients and requiring diverse treatment strategies. Non-procedural treatments play a pivotal role in managing peripheral neuropathic pain effectively.

- **Pharmacological treatments**: These include medications such as anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and topical agents, which are often first-line therapies for addressing neuropathic pain due to their effectiveness and ease of use.

- **Non-pharmacological treatments**: These encompass a range of interventions, including physical therapy, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy, which offer alternative or complementary approaches to pharmacological treatments.

The integration of these treatment modalities can enhance therapeutic outcomes and improve patient quality of life by reducing pain and associated symptoms.

### Pudendal nerve neuromodulation with neurophysiology guidance: a potential treatment option for refractory chronic pelvi-perineal pain [^114TquUb]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Refractory chronic pelvi-perineal pain (RCPPP) is a challenging condition that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Several etiologies have been proposed, including pudendal neuralgia. Although multiple treatment options exist, the reported outcomes are often sub-optimal and temporary. This article presents pudendal nerve neuromodulation with neurophysiology guidance as a treatment option for RCPPP.

This two-step procedure involves electrode implantation under neurophysiology guidance, followed by the implantation of a permanent generator following a successful trial period. We report cases of three women who underwent this procedure as a last-resort treatment option. Notably, after two years of follow-up, their symptoms showed significant improvement with no major complications occurring.

### Perineal and rectal nerve recruitment order varies during pudendal neurostimulator implant surgery [^116B8ANn]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). High credibility.

Pudendal nerve stimulation (PNS) is an off-label use of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) for targeting pelvic pain and bladder symptoms. Studies have shown that patients whose symptoms are refractory to SNM can be salvaged with PNS, leading to improvement of pelvic pain, voiding, and urinary incontinence. However, there is limited literature on the direct effects of PNS on the lower urinary tract, particularly during intraoperative placement.

The pudendal nerve originates from the S2, S3, and S4 spinal nerve roots. It typically forms a primary trunk and then splits into the inferior rectal nerve, perineal nerve, and genital nerve primary branches. The genital nerve, which is sensory only, innervates the external genitalia. The perineal nerve innervates the pelvic floor, urethra, and perineal muscles, while the rectal nerve innervates the external anal sphincter (EAS) and levator ani. Pudendal nerve anatomical structure is diverse. Near the sacrospinous ligament, one to three nerve trunks may be found with different branching points. The heterogeneity of pudendal nerve anatomy could pose potential obstacles during a PNS surgical approach and may influence the lead placement and variation in results. No study has investigated the activation patterns of the pudendal nerve among perineal and rectal motor responses during PNS implant surgery.

### Endoscopic transperineal pudendal nerve decompression: Operative pudendoscopy [^115uNvHE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve entrapment can produce a pudendal syndrome comprising perineodynia together with urinary, sexual, and anorectal symptoms. This syndrome can be treated surgically by the transperineal approach. By using an endoscope during the procedure ("operative pudendoscopy"), the surgeon has close-up visual control of each decompression step, demonstrates the different levels of entrapment, and cuts the sacrospinous ligament under visual control. The aim of this study was to describe the technical details of this new technique and its outcome in the treatment of the pudendal syndrome.

- **Methods**: A series of 113 patients with severe pudendal syndrome underwent operative pudendoscopy. A complete history, pain visual analog scale (VAS) for perineodynia, and four scores evaluating the main symptoms (ICIQ-SF, NHI-CPSI, St Mark's, and Wexner) were obtained before and at least 24 months after surgery. The three clinical signs of pudendal syndrome (abnormal pinprick sensitivity, painful skin rolling test, and painful pudendal nerve) and perineal descent were analyzed before and after surgery in 91 patients.

- **Results**: The mean operating time per side was 50.3 ± 15.2 minutes and the average hospital stay was 2.1 ± 0.4 days. Perineodynia VAS dropped from 7.2 ± 1.4 to 4.5 ± 2.9 after surgery (p < 0.0001) and the symptom scores significantly improved. Frequency of sexual arousal syndrome, dyspareunia, and cystalgia was also significantly reduced. Pathological perineal descent (≥ 1.5 cm measured with a Perineocaliper®) observed in 13 patients was reduced from 1.81 to 0.77 cm after surgery.

### Dual site pudendal nerve infiltration: More than just a diagnostic test [^116eb91J]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia (PN) is a very painful and often disabling condition in which pudendal nerve blocks play an important role in both the diagnosis and management of PN. Some previous reports have advocated the use of pudendal nerve infiltration (PNI) as a diagnostic test only.

- **Objective**: We aim to assess the outcomes of patients with typical refractory PN who underwent dual site computed tomography (CT)-guided pudendal nerve infiltration.

- **Study design**: A bicentric, retrospective cohort analysis.

- **Setting**: An academic practice.

- **Methods**: Between 2002 and 2016, 385 PNIs were performed in 195 patients in the two units. Only patients suffering from typical clinical PN were included, and only the first infiltration in each patient was considered for analysis. Therefore, 95 patients who underwent 155 procedures were assessed. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) (0–10) and self-reported estimated improvement (SRI), expressed as a percentage. Efficacy of the procedure was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after procedure follow-up, and clinical success was defined as a 50% decrease of the VAS score. All procedures were performed under CT guidance and on an outpatient basis. Dual site infiltration was performed in each case at both the ischial spine and intra-Alcock's canal sites using a mixture of fast- and slow-acting anesthetic (1 mL lidocaine hydrochloride 1% and 2 mL ropivacaine chlorhydrate) along with a half dose of 1.5 mL of cortivazol (3.75 mg).

- **Results**: Clinical success at one month post-procedure was present in 63.2% of patients (60/95) with a mean VA.

### Development and validation of a pudendal nerve block simulation-based educational intervention [^117V1aNZ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recognizes the importance of providing comprehensive pain management options and acknowledges the variability in the availability of specific modalities. Before the advent of neuraxial anesthesia, pudendal nerve block was the primary means for the provision of pain relief during the later stages of labor, delivery, and related interventions. The use of this modality steadily decreased over the second half of the 20th century to less than 10% by the 1990s, and 3% by 2016. Over the years, the number of trained physicians available to provide education on the performance of pudendal blocks has continued to decline.

Patient‐centered obstetric care should include comprehensive options for pain management at the time of labor. Pudendal nerve block in modern obstetric practice remains essential and safe in a wide range of scenarios. However, clinicians have inadvertently limited their ability to offer comprehensive pain management options and have lost practice of a skill that is of paramount importance in situations where neuraxial analgesia is not available, including low‐resource settings. In addition, the ability to administer pudendal blocks transvaginally is clinically useful in the treatment of pudendal neuralgia in non‐obstetrical populations as an alternative to the transgluteal approach used by non‐obstetrician gynecologists.

Simulation in obstetrics is a well‐established technique that improves knowledge, clinician performance, and patient outcomes. Additionally, simulation is a useful tool to teach skills.

### Pudendal neuralgia [^111Pf7mP]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is a painful, neuropathic condition involving the dermatome of the pudendal nerve. This condition is not widely known and is often unrecognized by many practitioners. The International Pudendal Neuropathy Association (tipna.org) estimates the incidence of this condition to be 1 in 100,000; however, most practitioners treating patients with this condition feel the actual rate of incidence may be significantly higher.

Currently, there is a fair paucity of medical literature and scientific evidence in the diagnosis and treatment of pudendal neuralgia. Diagnosis of this condition is based on the utilization of Nantes Criteria, in conjunction with clinical history and physical findings. CT-scan guided nerve blocks are also employed, by this author, to provide additional information. Subsequent treatment of pudendal neuralgia is both medical and surgical, with physical therapy being a key component of all aspects of treatment. The goal of this paper is to present evidence-based information, as well as personal clinical experience, in treating approximately 200 patients with pudendal neuralgia.

### Epitol [^1175zeTn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, the initial dose is 100 mg twice a day, totaling a daily dose of 200 mg. This dose may be increased by up to 200 mg per day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours, only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. Do not exceed a daily dose of 1200 mg. Maintenance of pain control can generally be achieved with a daily dose between 400 mg and 800 mg. Some patients may be adequately maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require up to 1200 mg daily. During the treatment period, the dose should be reassessed at least once every three months to attempt reducing it to the minimum effective level or consider discontinuing the drug if possible.

The tablets are available in chewable or conventional forms.

### Unilateral pudendal neuropathy is common in patients with fecal incontinence [^114CKMsW]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

The relationship between pudendal neuropathy and fecal incontinence is complex and not fully understood. The pudendal nerve plays a crucial role in innervating the external anal sphincter muscle, the skin of the anal canal, and coordinating reflex pathways. Damage to this nerve, particularly if one side is predominantly affected, may significantly influence both the cause and treatment of fecal incontinence. This study aims to determine the prevalence of pudendal neuropathy, especially unilateral neuropathy, and assess its impact on anorectal function.

A cohort of 923 patients (745 females; mean age: 52, range: 17–92 years) experiencing fecal incontinence underwent evaluations including endoanal ultrasonography, anorectal manometry, assessments of rectal sensation, and measurements of pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies.

Findings revealed that 520 patients (56 percent) exhibited pudendal neuropathy, with unilateral neuropathy present in 38 percent (351 patients; 169 right-sided, 182 left-sided). Neuropathy, whether bilateral (bilateral vs. normal; 56 cm H2O, range: 7–154 vs. 67 cm H2O, range: 5–215; P < 0.01) or unilateral (unilateral vs. normal; 61 cm H2O, range: 0–271 vs. 67 cm H2O, range: 5–215; P = 0.04), was linked to a reduction in anal resting tone. Additionally, squeeze increments were also affected (bilateral vs. normal; 34 cm H2O, range: 0–207 vs. 52 cm H2O, range: 0–378; P < 0.001, unilateral vs. normal; 41 cm H2O, range: 0–214 vs. 52 cm H2O, range: 0–378; P < 0.01). In patients with intact sphincters, unilateral neuropathy correlated with reduced squeeze increments (unilateral vs. normal; 60 (ran…

### Selection criteria for surgical treatment of pudendal neuralgia [^1126aj6Y]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is the clinical expression of a chronic compression of the pudendal nerve. The diagnosis is based on a set of five criteria, called Nantes criteria. Four of these criteria are clinical, and the last requires evaluation of the anesthetic response to CT-guided infiltration of the pudendal nerve. The aim of our study is to evaluate the relevance of the anesthetic test response in selecting patients for surgery and whether this criterion can be used to predict its success.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of 34 patients undergoing surgical treatment. Our cohort included six patients with a negative CT-guided pudendal nerve infiltration test.

- **Results**: Of the 28 patients that met all five Nantes criteria, 64% (18 patients) responded well to surgery. In contrast, 100% of the six patients with a negative anesthetic test failed to show an amelioration of symptoms after surgical treatment (P = 0.006). Our analysis found no significant difference in surgery response when comparing men and women (P = 0.387), unilateral or bilateral procedures (P = 0.562), or longer symptom durations (P = 0.412). A difference in age was observed between responders and non-responders, though it did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.216).

- **Conclusions**: The selection of candidates for surgery should always include a single diagnostic anesthetic injection of the pudendal nerve, as the fifth Nantes criterion is an effective predictor of surgical success.

### Estimate of the proportion of uncertain diagnoses of pudendal neuralgia in women with chronic pelvic-perineal pain: A systematic review with a descriptive data synthesis [^112D54jD]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Low credibility.

There is a gap between pudendal neuralgia (PN) due to pudendal entrapment syndrome and PN without pudendal entrapment syndrome. The latter could have atypical symptoms.

- **Aim**: Defining a rate of atypical PN from a clinical series of female patients with chronic pelvic-perineal pain.

- **Methods**: The atypical PN was defined as pain not meeting clinical criteria for pudendal entrapment syndrome. The effect size was the rate of atypical PN. Such a rate was expected to be found among patients screened for enrollment in clinical series on pudendal neuropathic pain. A systematic search was performed looking for clinical series on PN. Studies must report information on female patients, pelvic-perineal pain, at least a clinical criterion for diagnosing the pudendal neurogenic origin of pain, and the proportion of patients with pain not meeting the clinical criteria for diagnosing pudendal entrapment pain.

- **Results**: From 2,637 references, nine studies were included for qualitative analysis. Three of them were not suitable for data synthesis: one assessed the rate of PN after hip arthroscopy; the second enrolled miscellaneous patients; the third investigated patients with gynecological diseases. Six studies involved patients with suspicion of pudendal entrapment symptoms (205 patients observed), allowing data synthesis. One of these series was judged as being of good quality. The overall rate of atypical PN is 0.013 (95% confidence interval, 0.008–0.021), I² 0%. Further analysis suggests the risk of bias for all studies.

- **Conclusions**: Atypical PN in females is low when clinically evaluated.

### The puborectal continence reflex functions independently of the pudendal nerve [^116t8QcM]. Colorectal Disease (2019). High credibility.

In this study, anal electrosensitivity was used to assess the condition of the pudendal nerve. Indirectly, this sensory parameter gives an indication of the status of the motor pathway of the pudendal nerve. It might be argued that no relationship between involuntary contractions and the condition of the pudendal nerve was identified because only the sensory pathway was assessed. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that voluntary contractions of the puborectal muscle were diminished in patients with a high anal electrosensitivity threshold. Thus, in the case of voluntary contractions, damage to the sensory part of the pudendal nerve negatively influences the function of the motor part.

It is not our routine practice to perform pudendal motor nerve terminal latency and electromyography tests because they are very unpleasant and painful for patients. Furthermore, at least two previous studies have reported that these tests do not correspond with responses to treatment for faecal incontinence. One possible explanation for this, as suggested by the results of this study, is that the puborectal continence reflex is not regulated by the pudendal nerve.

- **Study implications**: The results require further investigation of possible nerve pathways, including the anorectal receptors belonging to such pathways. This necessitates additional research using other physiological tests, such as rapid balloon distension of the rectum and anal canal as described by Haas et al.

### Perineal and rectal nerve recruitment order varies during pudendal neurostimulator implant surgery [^1164ZNLY]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

This study showed that female participants with pelvic pain and bladder symptoms experienced positive outcomes from pudendal neuromodulation. There was no distinct correlation between the initial activation of either the perineal or rectal nerves and the change in bladder or pain symptoms. By monitoring stimulation‐driven urethral responses intraoperatively, which are often neglected in the clinical approach, we were able to explore the pudendal nerve recruitment order. This recruitment order could assist in tailoring stimulation programs and parameters to individual patient needs, thereby enhancing treatment success. Altogether, this study broadened our understanding of pudendal neuromodulation by investigating intraoperative urethral responses and nerve activation patterns.

### Clinical criteria of central sensitization in chronic pelvic and perineal pain (convergences PP criteria): Elaboration of a clinical evaluation tool based on formal expert consensus [^115iJnDY]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The evaluation of chronic pelvic and perineal pain (CPP) is often complex. The patient's description of the pain frequently appears disproportionate to the limited findings on physical examination and/or complementary investigations. The concept of central sensitization may allow better understanding and management of patients with CPP.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to elaborate a clinical evaluation tool designed to simply identify sensitization in pelvic pain.

- **Methods**: A list of 63 items was submitted to 22 international CPP experts according to the Delphi method.

- **Results**: Ten clinical criteria were adopted for the creation of a clinical evaluation tool:
	1. Pain influenced by bladder filling and/or urination
	2. Pain influenced by rectal distension and/or defecation
	3. Pain during sexual activity
	4. Perineal and/or vulvar pain in response to normally nonpainful stimulation
	5. Pelvic trigger points (e.g. in the piriformis, obturator internus, and/or levator ani muscles)
	6. Pain after urination
	7. Pain after defecation
	8. Pain after sexual activity
	9. Variable (fluctuating) pain intensity and/or variable pain distribution
	10. Migraine or tension headaches and/or fibromyalgia and/or chronic fatigue syndrome and/or post-traumatic stress disorder and/or restless legs syndrome and/or temporomandibular joint dysfunction and/or multiple chemical sensitivity

- **Conclusions**: This process resulted in the elaboration of a clinical evaluation tool designed to identify and appropriately manage patients with CPP comprising a sensitization component.

### Gralise [^113ZyNSw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Gralise for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. This study enrolled patients between the ages of 21 to 89 with postherpetic neuralgia persisting for at least six months following healing of a herpes zoster rash and a minimum baseline pain intensity score of at least 4 on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

This 11-week study compared Gralise at 1,800 mg once daily with placebo. A total of 221 and 231 patients were treated with Gralise or placebo, respectively. The study treatment, including titration for all patients, comprised a 10-week treatment period followed by 1 week of dose tapering. Double-blind treatment began with titration starting at 300 mg/day and titrated up to a total daily dose of 1,800 mg over 2 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of fixed dosing at 1,800 mg once daily, and then 1 week of dose tapering. During the 8-week stable dosing period, patients took 3 active or placebo tablets each night with the evening meal. During baseline and treatment, patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale. The mean baseline pain score was 6.6 and 6.5 for Gralise- and placebo-treated patients, respectively.

Treatment with Gralise statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain score from baseline. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 1 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement.

### Deep gluteal syndrome as a cause of posterior hip pain and sciatica-like pain [^115LxdfY]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Deep gluteal syndrome is an increasingly recognized disease entity caused by compression of the sciatic or pudendal nerve due to non-discogenic pelvic lesions. It includes piriformis syndrome, gemelli-obturator internus syndrome, ischiofemoral impingement syndrome, and proximal hamstring syndrome. The concept of deep gluteal syndrome extends our understanding of posterior hip pain due to nerve entrapment beyond the traditional model of piriformis syndrome.

There has been terminological confusion and deep gluteal syndrome has often been undiagnosed or mistaken for other conditions. Careful history-taking, a physical examination including provocation tests, an electrodiagnostic study, and imaging are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. After excluding spinal lesions, MRI scans of the pelvis are helpful in diagnosing deep gluteal syndrome and identifying pathological conditions entrapping the nerves.

It can be conservatively treated with multidisciplinary treatment including rest, the avoidance of provoking activities, medication, injections, and physiotherapy. Endoscopic or open surgical decompression is recommended in patients with persistent symptoms after conservative treatment or in those who may have masses compressing the sciatic nerve.

Many physicians remain unfamiliar with this syndrome and there is a lack of relevant literature. This comprehensive review aims to provide the latest information about the epidemiology, aetiology, pathology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Alcock canal syndrome due to obturator internus muscle fibrosis [^116mhNXc]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

Alcock canal syndrome is a rare entrapment neuropathy of the pudendal nerve. We report a case of perineal neuralgia where pudendal nerve compression was due to fibrosis of the obturator internus muscle following an injury of the muscle. After being misdiagnosed for 2 years, the patient was diagnosed only following a combined neurophysiologic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation. This case underlines the importance of performing focused neurophysiologic and neuroimaging studies in patients with neuropathic perineal pain in order to reach a correct diagnosis.

### Transsacral S2-S4 nerve block for vaginal pain due to pudendal neuralgia [^111aTNdd]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Pudendal neuralgia is a type of neuropathic pain experienced predominantly while sitting, causing a substantial decrease in quality of life for affected patients. Pudendal nerve block serves as both a diagnostic and therapeutic option for this condition. Transsacral block at S2 through S4 results in a pudendal nerve block, which can effectively relieve pain due to pudendal nerve injury. This study reports the blockade of S2 through S4 using lidocaine and methylprednisolone for successful treatment of pudendal neuralgia in two patients with severe chronic vaginal pain.

The patients, aged 44 and 58 years, were referred from the Gynecology Department to the pain clinic due to burning, stabbing, electric shock-like, unilateral pain localized to the left portion of the vagina and extending to the perineum. Their initial pain scores were 9 and 10, respectively, on a numeric rating scale. Both patients refused pudendal nerve block using classical techniques. Therefore, a diagnostic transsacral S2-S4 nerve block was performed using lidocaine 1% and repeated with lidocaine 1% and methylprednisolone 80 mg after confirming block efficiency, as demonstrated by an immediate decrease in pain scores. After one month, pain scores were 1 and 0, respectively, and both patients were free of pain at a six-month follow-up. It is suggested that blockade of S2 through S4 using lidocaine and methylprednisolone is an effective treatment option in patients with chronic pudendal neuralgia when traditional pudendal nerve block is not applicable.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for rectal foreign bodies, specifically concerning bedside transanal extraction, the AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of a pudendal nerve block, spinal anesthesia, IV conscious sedation, or general anesthesia. These measures are advised to improve the chances of successful transanal retrieval in patients with retained anorectal foreign bodies following the failure of bedside extraction.

### A novel technique for pudendal nerve block [^1169LnFy]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Pudendal nerve block is performed to confirm the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia. Many physicians and patients are hesitant to pursue diagnostic nerve blocks due to significant patient discomfort, the need for special equipment, and the risk associated with the traditionally described approach.

- **Objective**: To describe a novel technique for pudendal nerve block with minimal risk and decreased patient discomfort.

- **Description of the technique**: With the patient in the prone position, the C-arm is projected in the anteroposterior position until the pelvic inlet is visualized. Subsequently, the ischial spine is highlighted by 5 to 15 degree ipsilateral oblique angulation of the fluoroscope. A 25-gauge 3.5 cm needle is advanced to the tip of the ischial spine where the pudendal nerve transiently leaves the pelvis. The pudendal nerve block is performed at this level.

- **Conclusion**: We described a new and novel technique to safely block the pudendal nerve under fluoroscopic visualization, increasing patient comfort.

### Sacral neuromodulation as a treatment for neuropathic clitoral pain after abdominal hysterectomy [^111umFFF]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The cause of clitoral pain in this patient is unknown and likely multifactorial. Repeated minor trauma to the pelvic floor and pudendal nerve may have accumulated due to vaginal deliveries and pelvic surgery, leading to a measurable pudendal nerve lesion. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) has been shown to be beneficial in improving clitoral pain, with effects persisting for up to 6 months post-implantation. Previous studies evaluating SNM's effect on chronic idiopathic pelvic pain have reported positive outcomes. Siegel et al. found significant improvement in pain symptoms in six out of ten patients with pelvic pain, an effect that persisted following a median follow-up of 19 months. However, no previous studies have evaluated the effect of SNM treatment specifically on clitoral pain. Although SNM was used as an off-label treatment for clitoral pain in this case, the results suggest that SNM might be an effective application for patients experiencing clitoral pain.

### Pudendal neuromodulation is feasible and effective after pudendal nerve entrapment surgery [^112mdKFN]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with intractable pain in the pudendal nerve distribution may benefit from pudendal neuromodulation; however, some may have previously undergone pudendal nerve entrapment surgery (PNES), potentially altering nerve anatomy and function.

- **Aim**: We examined pudendal neuromodulation outcomes in patients with prior PNES.

- **Methods**: Patients with a history of PNES and quadripolar, tined pudendal lead placement for urogenital pain were reviewed. Symptoms and outcomes were collected from existing medical records.

- **Outcomes**: Patients with pudendal neuromodulation and prior PNES were compared to patients with no prior PNES who had pudendal lead placement.

- **Results**: Fifteen patients with a history of 1, 2, or 3 prior PNES (n = 13, 1, and 1, respectively) were evaluated. Most (10; 67%) were female, with bilateral pain (9; 60%) and symptoms of 5–26 years. After trialing the lead, bladder symptoms and pain were improved in 8 of 12 and 9 of 14 patients, respectively, and 80% of patients (12/15) underwent permanent generator implantation. When prior PNES patients were compared to those with no prior PNES (n = 43), gender (67% vs 77% female; p = 0.50) and age (median 63 vs 58 years; p = 0.80) were similar; however, BMI differed (mean 24 vs 29; p = 0.008) and a lower proportion (12/15; 80% vs 42/43; 98%; p = 0.049) had generator implantation. Importantly, median lead implant time (48 vs 50 minutes; p = 0.65) did not differ between the 2 groups.

- **Clinical implications**: Pudendal neuromodulation has the potential to provide pain relief for a very difficult-to-treat population.

### Endoscopic trans gluteal minimal-invasive approach for nerve liberation (ENTRAMI technique) in case of pudendal and/or cluneal neuralgia by entrapment: One-year follow-up [^115qg573]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). High credibility.

Chronic neuropathic perineal pain syndrome is a collective term that encompasses several diagnoses. In patients where the neuropathic pain syndrome is caused by pudendal or cluneal nerve entrapment, surgical release can be proposed if other measures have failed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients suffering from pudendal and/or cluneal nerve entrapment one year after this minimally invasive surgery, which is based on the open trans gluteal approach that has proven its efficacy compared to medical treatment in a randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: Patients eligible for inclusion had chronic perineal neuropathic pain for at least 3 months in the area served by the pudendal and/or cluneal nerve, refractory to conservative treatments. Patients met all five of the Nantes criteria.

- **Results**: Fifteen patients underwent the ENTRAMI technique. At one year after surgery, the overall reduction of the average maximal Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS-score) was from 9 (range, 7–10) at baseline to 5 (range, 0–10; P-value < 0.05). Optimal treatment response (PGIC ≥ 90%) was found in 40% of the patients (P-value < 0.05). No complications were recorded.

- **Conclusion**: This study clearly shows that the technique is feasible, with promising long-term results in a difficult to manage patient group.

### Pudendal neurolysis: 6-step laparoscopic approach [^111f2W8j]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of the laparoscopic approach for pudendal neurolysis in cases of pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome [1–3]. A video tutorial highlights the laparoscopic steps involved, with a focus on key anatomic landmarks [4,5]. This study was conducted in a tertiary care regional hospital.

The interventions were demonstrated through a video showing a 6-step approach to laparoscopic pudendal neurolysis for treating pudendal nerve entrapment between the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments [2,6–8]. The steps are as follows:

- **Step 1**: Identification of the umbilical artery.
- **Step 2**: Dissection and development of the lateral paravesical space until reaching the pelvic floor.
- **Step 3**: Identification of the arcus tendineus of the endopelvic fascia.
- **Step 4**: Identification of the ischial spine and the sacrospinous ligament covered by the coccygeus muscle.
- **Step 5**: Coagulation and sectioning of the coccygeus muscle and the sacrospinous ligament.
- **Step 6**: Medialization of the pudendal nerve until its entrance into the Alcock canal.

In conclusion, this video demonstrates that laparoscopic pudendal neurolysis in 6 steps is a safe, feasible, and reproducible method. The minimally invasive approach is adequate for treating pudendal compression up to the Alcock canal [2].

### Sacral neuromodulation to treat voiding dysfunction in patients with previous pelvic surgery for deep infiltrating endometriosis: Our centre's experience [^111c8zrA]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Only three patients were investigated before the SNM test for pudendal neuropathy using bilateral pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) and external anal sphincter electromyography (EAS EMG) studies. In PNTML evaluation, the delay between the electrical stimulation of the pudendal nerve and the EMG activity of the external anal sphincter (EAS) was recorded using a St. Mark's glove electrode©. During EAS EMG, EMG activity was recorded by an EMG needle inserted in the four quadrants of the EAS.

The SNM Interstim© staged procedure was performed using a standardized electrode placement technique. In the first stage, a permanent tine lead was implanted under local anesthesia with fluoroscopic control into the S3 sacral foramen, on the left or right side, considering the best motor and sensory response at the lowest amplitude threshold in the testing phase. In the second stage, a permanent pulse generator was implanted for the patients with significant objective relief of symptoms after 6–8 weeks of the testing period. In those with negative symptom relief, the lead and external temporary extensions were removed under local anesthesia.

VS/Ds before SNM therapy, previous DIE surgical procedures, UDS results, time between surgery and SNM test, age at the SNM test, SNM test results, and daily number of self-catheterizations (if performed) before the SNM test and after permanent implantation of the system were recorded for each patient.
