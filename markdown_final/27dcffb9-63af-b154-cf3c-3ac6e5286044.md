## Question

A 54-year-old woman with a 3-year history of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) presents for routine follow-up. She reports mild fatigue but no new symptoms. Laboratory tests reveal persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase and mildly increased bilirubin. Her most recent workup shows low serum levels of vitamins A and D. She has no gastrointestinal symptoms and is adherent to ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. You are asked to advise on the management of her vitamin deficiencies.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended approach to treating her fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach to treating fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in a 54-year-old woman with primary biliary cholangitis who has documented low vitamins A and D. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking cholestasis to fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption. Then, I should verify which guidelines directly address this issue and what they recommend. Next, I will examine the strength and consistency of those recommendations across sources. After that, I need to translate this into a practical, safety-conscious dosing and monitoring plan. Finally, I should consider special situations like coagulopathy, bone health, and when to escalate care or involve specialists.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: chronic cholestasis impairs bile acid delivery to the gut, reducing micelle formation and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, which explains why deficiencies cluster as disease advances or jaundice emerges, even though overt deficiency is not universal in early disease [^1f073a23] [^32de1412].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance. The AASLD 2018 practice guidance explicitly recommends that if fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are found, they should be treated with parenteral or water-soluble supplements, and in patients who become jaundiced, routine measurement of vitamin levels is recommended with supplementation if low, which fits this patient's profile of cholestasis with low A and D [^1f073a23] [^bbb6bf62].

> Wait, let me verify the strength and consistency of this recommendation across documents. The AASLD guidance is echoed in patient-facing summaries and practice updates, reinforcing that water-soluble or parenteral formulations are preferred in cholestasis to bypass malabsorption, and that monitoring should be annual in advanced disease or jaundice, which aligns with this case's mildly elevated bilirubin and cholestatic labs [^ea44cf31] [^b2201812].

> I will now examine the practical formulation choice. Hold on, I should confirm that "water-soluble" means truly micellized or otherwise designed for absorption in low bile acid states. Yes, guidelines and hepatology practice consistently favor water-miscible or parenteral forms for vitamins A, D, E, and K in cholestasis, and for vitamin K specifically, parenteral repletion is advised when INR is prolonged and does not respond to an oral trial, given the reliability of absorption and correction of coagulopathy [^1f073a23] [^80056df8].

> Let me think about dosing and safety, and I should double-check that I'm not overgeneralizing from non-PBC sources. For vitamin D, typical repletion uses cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol in the 50,000 IU weekly range for about 6–8 weeks, then maintenance 1,000–2,000 IU daily, with 25-hydroxyvitamin D checked about 3 months after initiation and periodically thereafter; for vitamin A, cautious repletion in the 10,000–25,000 IU daily range for 1–2 weeks with close monitoring is reasonable, transitioning to lower maintenance to avoid hypervitaminosis A; for vitamin K, if INR is prolonged, 2.5–10 mg IV or IM daily for 2–3 days with INR reassessment is standard, with maintenance 5–10 mg orally or subcutaneously weekly to daily as needed, recognizing that oral forms may be less reliable in cholestasis [^notfound].

> But wait, what if bone health is already compromised? I need to ensure we address osteoporosis risk in PBC. AASLD recommends baseline and periodic DXA, daily calcium 1,000–1,500 mg, and vitamin D 1,000 IU, with pharmacologic therapy such as alendronate for osteoporosis, while avoiding oral bisphosphonates in patients with varices or significant reflux; this complements, rather than replaces, the need to replete vitamin D when deficient in cholestasis [^3ec303d7] [^e2be8163] [^5b1ce9fc].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence and thresholds. In patients with jaundice or advanced disease, AASLD advises annual fat-soluble vitamin level checks and periodic INR to detect vitamin K deficiency; clinically, I would recheck vitamins A and D about 3 months after starting repletion, then annually if stable, and monitor INR if coagulopathy is suspected or if cholestasis worsens, adjusting vitamin K accordingly [^b2201812] [^1f073a23].

> I need to ensure we are not missing a broader disease-control issue that could perpetuate malabsorption. Let me reconsider the UDCA response: persistent elevation of ALP and bilirubin suggests inadequate biochemical response, so I should confirm adherence, dose optimization, and consider second-line therapy such as obeticholic acid or a fibrate per AASLD and contemporary guidance, because improving cholestasis can theoretically reduce ongoing fat-soluble vitamin losses, even though supplementation remains necessary once deficiency is established [^8eb16a4b] [^b6fe6242] [^c5c316fa].

> Next, I should review special scenarios. If the patient were pregnant or planning pregnancy, I would prioritize parenteral vitamin K correction of coagulopathy and maintain vitamin D sufficiency given maternal-fetal safety, while avoiding excess vitamin A; UDCA is safe in pregnancy, but high-dose vitamin A is teratogenic, so I would cap maintenance vitamin A and favor repletion only to normalize, with close obstetric-hepatic co-management [^94db342f] [^ce80c0c0].

> Putting this together, my final, reference-aligned recommendation is as follows: treat the documented deficiencies with water-soluble or parenteral formulations to bypass malabsorption, using cholecalciferol 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks then 1,000–2,000 IU daily for vitamin D with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D recheck in 3 months, vitamin A 10,000–25,000 IU daily for 1–2 weeks then maintenance 5,000–10,000 IU daily with periodic level checks to avoid toxicity, and vitamin K 2.5–10 mg IV or IM daily for 2–3 days if INR is prolonged, followed by maintenance 5–10 mg weekly to daily as needed; concurrently, ensure calcium 1,000–1,500 mg/day, monitor bone density, and reassess PBC therapy for inadequate UDCA response to mitigate ongoing cholestasis and malabsorption [^1f073a23] [^3ec303d7] [^80056df8] [^8eb16a4b].

---

Treat fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in PBC with **water-soluble or parenteral forms** [^1f073a23] of vitamins A, D, E, and K to overcome malabsorption [^bbb6bf62]. Use **vitamin D 1,000–2,000 IU daily** [^4e35f645] with calcium 1,000–1,500 mg/day [^3ec303d7]; if deficiency persists, use 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks, then recheck 25(OH)D and adjust to maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL [^38aafd3a]. For vitamin K, give 2.5–10 mg IV/IM/SC daily for 3 days if INR is prolonged, then 5–10 mg orally or SC weekly to monthly as needed [^80056df8]. Monitor vitamin A and E levels periodically and adjust dosing to avoid toxicity. Continue UDCA [^8f8fb3e3] and reassess response; consider second-line therapy if cholestasis persists [^8eb16a4b].

## Pathophysiology of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency in PBC

Chronic cholestasis in PBC impairs bile acid secretion, reducing micelle formation and causing **fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption** [^1f073a23]. Deficiencies are more common in advanced disease with jaundice or cirrhosis [^f676e5dc].

---

## Clinical significance of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies

| **Vitamin** | **Clinical significance of deficiency** |
|-|-|
| Vitamin A | Night blindness, xerophthalmia, immune dysfunction [^6a1e086d] |
| Vitamin D | Osteomalacia, osteoporosis, increased fracture risk [^5a206c21] |
| Vitamin E | Neurological impairment, ataxia, hemolytic anemia [^c0ad7a93] |
| Vitamin K | Coagulopathy, increased bleeding risk [^80056df8] |

---

## Current guideline recommendations

The AASLD recommends **parenteral or water-soluble supplements** [^1f073a23] to treat fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in PBC [^bbb6bf62]. Routine measurement is advised in jaundiced patients, with supplementation if deficiencies are found [^1f073a23].

---

## Specific supplementation strategies

### Vitamin D supplementation

- **Initial therapy**: 1,000–1,500 mg/day calcium plus 1,000 IU/day vitamin D [^4e35f645] [^3ec303d7].
- **If deficiency persists**: 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks, then recheck 25(OH)D and adjust to maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL [^38aafd3a].
- **Maintenance**: 1,000–2,000 IU/day once repleted [^notfound].

---

### Vitamin K supplementation

- **Initial therapy**: 2.5–10 mg IV/IM/SC daily for 3 days if INR is prolonged [^80056df8].
- **Maintenance**: 5–10 mg orally or SC weekly to monthly as needed [^80056df8].
- **Monitoring**: Check INR and adjust dosing [^80056df8].

---

### Vitamin A and E supplementation

- **Vitamin A**: 10,000–25,000 IU orally daily; monitor levels to avoid hypervitaminosis A [^6a1e086d].
- **Vitamin E**: 100–400 IU orally daily; monitor for neurological improvement and toxicity [^c0ad7a93].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Vitamin D**: Measure 25(OH)D every 6–12 months [^notfound].
- **Vitamin A and E**: Measure annually or as clinically indicated [^b2201812].
- **Vitamin K**: Monitor INR regularly, especially if coagulopathy is present [^80056df8].

---

## Addressing underlying cholestasis

Optimizing cholestasis management improves vitamin absorption. Continue **UDCA at 13–15 mg/kg/day** [^8f8fb3e3]; if there is an inadequate response, consider obeticholic acid or fibrates as second-line therapy [^8eb16a4b] [^b6fe6242].

---

## Potential risks and considerations

- **Vitamin A toxicity**: Monitor for hypervitaminosis A with chronic high-dose supplementation [^6a1e086d].
- **Vitamin D toxicity**: Monitor calcium and renal function with high-dose regimens [^notfound].
- **Drug interactions**: Separate bile acid sequestrants from vitamin supplements to avoid impaired absorption [^8f8fb3e3].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Vitamin** | **Recommended supplementation** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Vitamin D | 1,000–2,000 IU/day; 50,000 IU/week if deficient | 25(OH)D every 6–12 months |
| Vitamin K | 2.5–10 mg IV/IM/SC daily × 3 days; then 5–10 mg weekly/monthly | INR regularly |
| Vitamin A | 10,000–25,000 IU orally daily | Serum vitamin A periodically |
| Vitamin E | 100–400 IU orally daily | Serum vitamin E periodically |

---

Treat fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in PBC with **water-soluble or parenteral forms** [^1f073a23], tailor dosing to severity, and monitor for toxicity. Concurrently optimize cholestasis management with UDCA and consider second-line therapy if needed [^8eb16a4b].

Recommendation 31

We recommend that fatigue is not an indication for liver transplantation in patients not meeting established UK liver transplant minimal listing criteria. (Strong; Moderate)

Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation

While it is rare for patients to develop overt fat-soluble vitamin (vitamin A, D, E, and K) deficiency, this is well described in those with chronic cholestasis, particularly once individuals become jaundiced. Routine measurement of vitamin levels is not usually additive or necessary but, in patients with advanced icteric disease, consideration should be given to oral supplementation of vitamins A, D, E and K using standard preparations.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune cholestatic liver disease characterized by immune-mediated biliary epithelial damage and progressive fibrosis, predominantly affecting women with a male-to-female ratio of 1:4–6, ultimately progressing to cirrhosis, liver failure, and necessitating liver transplantation in advanced stages. PBC has an insidious onset and may present with non-specific clinical symptoms such as fatigue, poor appetite, and itchy skin in the early stages. By the time patients develop obvious symptoms, about 32% of them have progressed to cirrhosis. UDCA is widely regarded as the most effective drug for treating PBC. However, more than 40% of patients may not respond or show poor response to UDCA treatment. Patients with PBC who are non-responsive or poor responders to UDCA face a therapeutic challenge, as they cannot be effectively treated with the standard therapy. There is an urgent need to explore new effective treatment options for these patients. VitD is a fat - soluble vitamin that enhances calcium absorption and supports bone development. It also exhibits immunomodulatory, anticholestatic, and antifibrogenic properties. Notably, it is closely linked to the progression and prognosis of PBC. Low baseline VitD levels are an independent risk factor for poor response to late-stage UDCA therapy, increasing the risk of liver-related death and the need for liver transplantation. This study aims to observe the effect of UDCA combined with VitD on the drug response rate in the treatment of PBC, as well as its impact on liver function, clinical manifestations and hepatic fibrosis.

JOURNEY OF THE PATIENT WITH PBC: THE CONTINUED NEED FOR MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT

Symptoms of PBC may extend beyond those of liver disease alone, including extrahepatic complications of the disease (Figure 2). Lifelong management of patients with PBC is necessary and should be personalized to the patient's disease state and symptoms. Medical therapy to prevent disease progression and complications of cirrhosis, as well as to manage the associated symptoms of the disease, is recommended.

Figure 2.
Symptoms and manifestations of PBC. Fatigue and pruritus, common complaints associated with PBC, are considered symptoms directly associated with the disease. The 3 most common extrahepatic conditions associated with PBC are sicca syndrome, thyroid disorders, and systemic sclerosis. PBC is also associated with a clustering of other autoimmune conditions (e.g. Raynaud phenomenon or scleroderma); however, a recent population-based study found that concomitant autoimmune conditions did not influence outcomes in patients with PBC. Other symptoms that are poorly characterized but reported by patients with PBC include restless leg syndrome, cognitive impairment, and bone and joint pain, the severity of which may not be proportionate to the severity of the underlying liver disease. Furthermore, chronic cholestasis associated with PBC may be associated with extrahepatic manifestations, such as hyperlipidemia, metabolic bone disease, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Patients with PBC can also experience impaired quality of life attributed to associated fatigue, cognitive symptoms, social and emotional dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and depression. PBC, primary biliary cholangitis.

The rate of progression of PBC from early-stage disease to cirrhosis to liver-related morbidity/mortality can vary among patients; however, progression is typically slow, with no visible symptoms. Studies of patients with PBC with cirrhosis indicate that 10 years after the initial diagnosis, progression to decompensated liver disease (ascites, bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, or liver failure) occurs at rates of 10%–26%. Treatment can slow progression and reduce the need for liver transplantation. A large international meta-analysis that included 4,845 patients with PBC demonstrated that UDCA significantly improved transplant-free survival at 5, 10, and 15 years compared with nontreated individuals (90%, 78%, and 66% vs 79%, 59%, and 32%, respectively).

Discussion

PBC poses a significant clinical burden in China, with an estimated prevalence of 20.5/100,000 — the second highest in the Asia-Pacific region after Japan. While UDCA remains the cornerstone therapy for alleviating bile accumulation and improving long-term prognosis, over 40% of patients exhibit suboptimal biochemical responses, underscoring the urgent need for adjunctive therapies. In this study, we found that the UDCA + VitD group outperformed the UDCA monotherapy group on multiple indicators, including and drug response rates, biochemical markers, symptom improvement and liver stiffness values. This study further randomized the UDCA monotherapy group into two subgroups for extended treatment for one year, and it was found that the advantages of the UDCA + VitD group still persisted, especially in terms of response rates under the Paris I criteria. These findings carry critical implications for optimizing PBC management.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that can shorten life and may require liver transplantation. The cause is unknown, although it is commonly associated with colitis. There is no approved or proven therapy, although ursodeoxycholic acid is used by many on an empiric basis. Complications including portal hypertension, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, metabolic bone diseases, and development of cancers of the bile duct or colon can occur.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^b2201812]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) long-term follow-up — UDCA should be continued indefinitely; data regarding long-term OCA are lacking, and periodic monitoring of liver tests should be performed at 3-month to 6-month intervals to detect inadequate responders to UDCA after 12 months, lack of adherence, and those who develop AIH. Thyroid status should be monitored annually. For patients with known cirrhosis with a Mayo risk score greater than 4.1 or transient elastography values of at least 7 kPa, upper endoscopy to assess for varices should be done every 2 to 3 years. Bone mineral density should be assessed every 2 years and fat-soluble vitamin levels should be monitored annually in patients with jaundice. Abdominal ultrasonography with or without alpha fetoprotein to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma should be performed every 6 months in patients with cirrhosis and in men with PBC.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^82accb11]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy in primary biliary cholangitis — UDCA is the treatment of choice and most established therapy; its primary mode of action is choleretic and cytoprotective. The optimal dosage of UDCA is 13 ~ 15 mg/kg per day in a single or divided oral doses, and studies show that low-dose UDCA (< 5–7 mg/kg per day) is less effective, but high-dose UDCA (23 ~ 25 mg/kg per day) does not bring more benefits. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) 750 mg/day showed similar biochemical efficacy and safety to UDCA 750 mg/day. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate UDCA improves biochemical variables, halts disease progression, and prolongs liver transplant-free survival. UDCA is safe and well-tolerated; side effects are generally minor and do not require therapy withdrawal, though 11% of UDCA-treated patients showed poor adherence, with young age and male sex independently associated with poor adherence. Recommendation: 3. It is recommended that oral UDCA (13 ~ 15 mg/kg/ day) should be standard therapy for all PBC patients. UDCA treatment should be continued for prolonged periods, and can be continued indefinitely and even after liver transplantation if cholestasis persists. (I, 1).

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^33cb7658]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, which when untreated will culminate in end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Diagnosis is usually based on the presence of serum liver tests indicative of a cholestatic hepatitis in association with circulating antimitochondrial antibodies. Patient presentation and course can be diverse and risk stratification is important to ensure all patients receive a personalised approach to their care. The goals of treatment and management are the prevention of end-stage liver disease, and the amelioration of associated symptoms. Pharmacologic approaches in practice, to reduce the impact of the progressive nature of disease, currently include licensed therapies (ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid) and off-label therapies (fibric acid derivatives, budesonide). These clinical practice guidelines summarise the evidence for the importance of a structured, life-long and individualised, approach to the care of patients with PBC, providing a framework to help clinicians diagnose and effectively manage patients.

For suboptimal response, issues of adherence, superimposed liver disease including fatty liver, and coadministration with bile sequestrants such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevalam should be considered. UDCA use has been associated with reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, a reduced risk of developing varices, and slower histologic progression, but it does not improve fatigue, pruritus, associated bone disease, or autoimmune features found in association with primary biliary cholangitis.

### Use of bezafibrate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis… [^cf1a4f85]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Use of Bezafibrate in Patients With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis to Archive Complete Biochemical Response in Non-respondersClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The primary biliary cholangitis, formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, treatment is based in the use of ursodeoxycholic acid at a daily dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg, without other treatment options. Patients with good or complete response to UDCA have more liver transplant-free survival and delay histologic progression compared to patients with partial or no response. Nowadays there is an estimated partial response to UDCA in approximately 30 to 50% of patients with PBC. There is a need for new second line management strategies for patients without a biochemical response to UDCA. The addition of bezafibrate to the treatment of PBC patients with partial biochemical response to UDCA, will increase the biochemical response and improve the long term prognosis.

And if so, which are the efficacy and security of bezafibrate in PBC patients without biochemical response. There are case reports and pilot studies in patients with primary biliary cholangitis In the literature in which the effect of fibrates on the improvement of biochemical cholestasis have been seen, however the clinical benefit has not been reported and likewise the response criteria used in previous studies is very heterogeneous. In previous studies, bezafibrate has been proved to be a secure drug in this patients, with few adverse events, also it is an economic and of easy access drug. For all this the investigators intent to study the utility of bezafibrate as an additional treatment in PBC patients without response to UDCA.

This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to enroll a total of 34 patients with diagnosis of PBC without a complete response to the use of UDCA for more than a year, then the participants will be divided by randomization to receive bezafibrate or placebo, resulting in a total of two groups of 17 patients each. Both groups will be followed every 3 months for a total of 1 year with clinical and laboratory follow-up to determine the efficacy and security of the treatment. The investigators will measure all the laboratory variables related to the disease and possible adverse effects of the use of fibrates, also the investigators will measure the quality of life variables, and determine the fibrosis stage at the beginning and end of the study by non-invasive methods.

The study is directed to patients with PBC diagnosis who have had management with standard UDCA dose for at least 6 months and had not reached complete biochemical response, defined by Paris II criteria. The dose of fibrate to use will be bezafibrate 200 mg every 12 hours or placebo every 12 hours for 12 months, both having the exact characteristics to avoid their recognition. Patients will continue the administration of UDCA at the same dose at enrollment. The intervention will be for a period of 12 months, with a follow-up every 3 months completing 5 medical follow-up visits. Drug: Bezafibrate Drug: Ursodeoxycholic Acid Drug: Placebo

### Definition and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis and an incomplete response to therapy [^c5c316fa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an immune-mediated chronic liver disease characterized by biliary epithelial injury, cholestasis, and progressive fibrosis that can lead to cirrhosis and requirement for liver transplantation. All patients with PBC should receive initial treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and odds for response are based on characteristics at baseline. It is important to have clear definitions of patients at risk for a poor response to therapy, of biochemical markers of an incomplete response, and standardized management. Patients typically are assessed after 12 months of treatment with UDCA for biochemical markers of response. However, evaluation at 6 months has been proposed for patients with more severe disease or symptoms (such as pruritus or fatigue). Markers of response to therapy include reduced serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin (Paris-2, Toronto, GLOBE, and so forth); patients with high levels of total and conjugated bilirubin or levels of alkaline phosphatase more than 1.5-fold the upper limit of normal should be considered for second-line therapy. Patients with adequate biochemical responses can continue UDCA monotherapy. Incomplete responders should be considered for second-line therapies with obeticholic acid (licensed) or fibrates (unlicensed) in addition to continued treatment with UDCA. Patients with PBC should be followed up for life.

### Current and potential treatments for primary biliary cholangitis [^d23fc2f1]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Up to 40% of patients with primary biliary cholangitis have an incomplete response to first-line treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. Obeticholic acid was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016 as a second-line treatment for patients with primary biliary cholangitis who are unresponsive to ursodeoxycholic acid; however, approximately 50% of patients might need additional treatments to reach therapeutic goals. A considerable need exists for effective treatment options to prevent progression to liver transplantation or death in these patients. Drugs that might modulate immunological abnormalities in primary biliary cholangitis have been studied but their effectiveness varies. Budesonide, ciclosporin, and rituximab have shown potential in modifying the disease process. Bezafibrate, a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, has been shown to ameliorate deranged bile acid homoeostasis and attenuate raised concentrations of liver enzymes associated with primary biliary cholangitis. As the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of primary biliary cholangitis are further clarified, specific targeted therapies are under development with promising early results. Various therapeutic target bile acid homeostasis, immune dysfunction, and fibrogenetic pathways are being studied. A better understanding of the biochemical and clinical effects of the therapies in development bear discussion, both to guide the discovery of new therapies and to inform clinicians so that rational treatment regimens can be tailored to patients once they become available.

Poor nutrition and fat soluble vitamin deficiency

Poor nutrition is common in chronic liver disease and should be considered and treated appropriately in patients with PSC. Advanced cholestasis can result in malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. In advanced disease before transplantation, deficiency of vitamin A, D and E in 82%, 57% and 43%, respectively, are reported, but much lower levels of deficiency are seen earlier in the disease process. Evidence of deficiency of any measurable vitamin should lead to consideration of empirical replacement with multivitamins.

Recommendation 20: Poor nutrition and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency are relatively common in advanced PSC and we suggest that clinicians should have a low threshold for empirical replacement (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

Fatigue and depression

Fatigue is a common symptom of patients with chronic liver disease, but no treatments have been proved to be beneficial. Depression is also common in people with chronic illnesses, and there are mixed reports of the association between depression and fatigue in PSC. One study directly assessing quality of life and fatigue scores in PSC, reported a lower incidence of fatigue than in the general population and when present, symptoms were associated with depression rather than severity of liver disease. There does not appear to be a role for the treatment of fatigue using antidepressants without clear symptoms of depression.

Recommendation 21: We recommend that in patients with fatigue, alternative causes should be actively sought and treated (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: LOW).

How should patients with PBC be managed?

The care of patients with PBC encompasses many aspects addressing disease progression and symptom control (figure 1).

Drug therapy to prevent disease progression

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)

Oral UDCA has been studied widely and discussed in depth with regard to its efficacy. The use of UDCA is recommended for all patients with PBC by AASLD and EASL, as well as in this guideline. A number of other agents have been studied including immunosuppressants, but reproducible and/or consistent evidence of benefit has been universally lacking. Prior studies of failed alternative therapies are not reviewed here in detail.

UDCA normally accounts for about 4% of bile acids, but with pharmacotherapy it becomes the predominant bile acid. Several studies have confirmed a correlation between the degree of bile enrichment and improvement in liver biochemistry. Overall, the data suggest that the optimum dose is 13–15 mg/kg per day, which can be given as a single oral daily dose or in divided doses if tolerability is an issue. When evaluating the UDCA trial data, note must be taken of the treatment dose used because some earlier studies applied lower than optimal treatment paradigms. In PBC, a dose of 13–15 mg/kg/day has been shown to be superior to 5–7 mg/kg/day or 23–25 mg/kg/day. UDCA at the recommended dose is very safe with minimal side effects (weight gain of ~3 kg in the first 12 months, hair loss and, rarely, diarrhoea and flatulence are reported). There are no data to suggest that UDCA is teratogenic. Evidence-based advice over use in pregnancy is lacking, but expert clinical practice generally includes safe use before and during the first trimester; a good safety profile exists from its use in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

Recommendation 35

We suggest that the presence of severe interface hepatitis in the correct context is usually required to initiate immunosuppression after the risks and benefits of treatment, particularly with corticosteroids, have been discussed with the patient. (Weak; Moderate)

Pregnancy and PBC

While most patients are diagnosed at an age when pregnancy is not a relevant consideration, a significant minority of patients with PBC are women of reproductive age. In this younger age range of PBC, pregnancy may either be a reason for diagnosis (failure of resolution of obstetric cholestasis) or may be complicated by worsening pruritus. Significant medical risks are infrequent but can be relevant if patients have cirrhosis and portal hypertension. In this setting, management is no different from any other aetiology of cirrhosis (eg, gastroscopy if concern over portal hypertension; exclusion of splenic artery aneurysm by ultrasound).

PBC specific experience is limited to case series, but expert clinical opinion is that UDCA is safe during conception, pregnancy and post-partum. Additionally, cholestyramine and rifampicin (second trimester onwards) are considered safe in pregnancy, although the data are limited. Rarely, itch during pregnancy becomes unbearable and plasmapheresis may help. In those with notable cholestasis, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency should be avoided. Post-partum cholestatic flares have been described and clinical follow-up in the post-partum period is important.

Pre-pregnancy counselling should be pragmatic; recognition that in those with a marked ductopenic variant of PBC, disease progression from intense added cholestasis during pregnancy does need consideration. Similarly, patients with portal hypertension have the greatest risks associated with pregnancy and should be appropriately counselled. Variceal bleeding can occur in patients with cirrhosis of any aetiology as a consequence of pregnancy-related increase in portal pressure. Such patients should be electively endoscoped in the second trimester and managed appropriately. Pregnant patients with PBC should be screened for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, as their presence would change obstetric practice regarding fetal screening for bradycardia.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities [^85d537f1]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic, seropositive and female-predominant inflammatory and cholestatic liver disease, which has a variable rate of progression towards biliary cirrhosis. Substantial progress has been made in patient risk stratification with the goal of personalized care, including early adoption of next-generation therapy with licensed use of obeticholic acid or off-label fibrate derivatives for those with insufficient benefit from ursodeoxycholic acid, the current first-line drug. The disease biology spans genetic risk, epigenetic changes, dysregulated mucosal immunity and altered biliary epithelial cell function, all of which interact and arise in the context of ill-defined environmental triggers. A current focus of research on nuclear receptor pathway modulation that specifically and potently improves biliary excretion, reduces inflammation and attenuates fibrosis is redefining therapy. Patients are benefiting from pharmacological agonists of farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Immunotherapy remains a challenge, with a lack of target definition, pleiotropic immune pathways and an interplay between hepatic immune responses and cholestasis, wherein bile acid-induced inflammation and fibrosis are dominant clinically. The management of patient symptoms, particularly pruritus, is a notable goal reflected in the development of rational therapy with apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibitors.

### ACG clinical guideline: primary sclerosing cholangitis [^f756a66e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) introduction and definition: PSC is a chronic cholestatic liver and biliary tract disease with a highly variable natural history that can shorten life and may require liver transplantation, and the cause is unknown although it is commonly associated with colitis. Diagnosis is most frequently established using magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP), although direct cholangiography may be more sensitive, and typical cholangiographic findings include focal stricturing and saccular dilatation of the bile ducts leading to a "beaded" appearance. The differential diagnosis includes several disorders that lead to biliary strictures such as bacterial cholangitis, intraarterial administration of floxuridine, prior biliary surgery, and AIDSrelated cholangiopathy. PSC is an idiopathic condition defined by beading and stricture formation of the intra and/or extrahepatic bile ducts that cannot be ascribed to another cause, differentiating it from secondary sclerosing cholangitis. There is no approved or proven therapy; ursodeoxycholic acid is used by many on an empiric basis. Complications can include portal hypertension, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, metabolic bone diseases, and development of cancers of the bile duct or colon. Patients may be asymptomatic for long periods but may also have an aggressive course with recurrent biliary tract obstruction and cholangitis and may progress to end-stage liver disease.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: advances in management and treatment of the disease [^8cd127a5]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis, previously known as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, is a rare disease, which mainly affects women in their fifth to seventh decades of life. It is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by a progressive damage of interlobular bile ducts leading to ductopenia, chronic cholestasis and bile acids retention. Even if the disease usually presents a long asymptomatic phase and a slow progression, in many patients it may progress faster toward cirrhosis and its complications. The 10year mortality is greater than in diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection and breast cancer. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the only treatment available today, but even if effective in counteracting the disease progression for the majority of patients, in approximately 40% is not able to decrease effectively the alkaline phosphatase, a surrogate marker of disease activity. Recently, obeticholic acid received the European Medicines Agency conditional approval, as add on treatment in patients non responders or intolerant to ursodeoxycholic acid. The present paper illustrates the opinion of a working group, composed by clinical pharmacologists, gastroenterologists/hepatologists with specific expertise on Primary Biliary Cholangitis and patient associations, on the state of the art and future perspectives of the disease management. The agreement on the document was reached through an Expert Meeting.

### Widespread gaps in the quality of care for primary biliary cholangitis in UK [^f98bd62c]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive, autoimmune, cholestatic liver disease affecting approximately 15 000 individuals in the UK. Updated guidelines for the management of PBC were published by The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in 2017. We report on the first national, pilot audit that assesses the quality of care and adherence to guidelines.

Design

Data were collected from 11 National Health Service hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland between 2017 and 2020. Data on patient demographics, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) dosing and key guideline recommendations were captured from medical records. Results from each hospital were evaluated for target achievement and underwent χ 2 analysis for variation in performance between trusts.

Results

790 patients' medical records were reviewed. The data demonstrated that the majority of hospitals did not meet all of the recommended EASL standards. Standards with the lowest likelihood of being met were identified as optimal UDCA dosing, assessment of bone density and assessment of clinical symptoms (pruritus and fatigue). Significant variations in meeting these three standards were observed across UK, in addition to assessment of biochemical response to UDCA (all p < 0.0001) and assessment of transplant eligibility in high-risk patients (p = 0.0297).

Conclusion

Our findings identify a broad-based deficiency in 'real-world' PBC care, suggesting the need for an intervention to improve guideline adherence, ultimately improving patient outcomes. We developed the PBC Review tool and recommend its incorporation into clinical practice. As the first audit of its kind, it will be used to inform a future wide-scale reaudit.

### Pharmacotherapy for primary biliary cholangitis: an assessment of medication candidacy and rates of treatment [^f74cabc9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ursodeoxycholic acid is the preferred first-line therapy for primary biliary cholangitis. Alternative therapies, such as obeticholic acid, are recommended for patients who cannot tolerate ursodeoxycholic acid or who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid monotherapy. Prior investigations have suggested that as many as 30% of patients with primary biliary cholangitis may have never received treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. No prior investigations have examined usage rates of obeticholic acid in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis.

Methods

All patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis who had any records within the health system were included. A review of medical records was performed to confirm the diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis and determine which medications had been prescribed for treatment, as well as candidacy for second-line therapies.

Results

A total of 495 patients met inclusion criteria. Notably, 95% of patients were taking ursodeoxycholic acid for treatment of their primary biliary cholangitis, with 67% of patients having disease that was well-controlled on ursodeoxycholic acid monotherapy. In total, 8% of patients were taking obeticholic acid (either as combination or monotherapy). Only 3% would benefit from the addition of a second line therapy but had not yet been offered medication. Only 3% of patients were not on any medication for management of their primary biliary cholangitis.

Conclusions

Ursodeoxycholic acid is a readily available and generally well-tolerated medication that should be offered to all patients with primary biliary cholangitis as first-line therapy. While prior investigations have suggested that up to 30% of patients with primary biliary cholangitis may never have received treatment for the disorder, the present study suggests that patients are generally being managed according to guidelines. Moreover, a significant proportion of patients with primary biliary cholangitis will qualify for second line therapies and prescribers should be aware of the indications to use these medications.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis guidance addresses screening, supplementation, and pharmacotherapy. EASL nutritional guidelines recommend supplement vitamin D orally in cirrhotic patients with vitamin D levels < 20 ng/ ml, to reach serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) ≥ 30 ng/ml, and for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women sufficient calcium (1000–1500 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU/day) in the diet or as supplements are recommended if they have no history of renal stones. It is recommended that all PBC patients should be evaluated for serum vitamin D status and it is recommended that all PBC patients should be evaluated for osteoporosis, especially in postmenopausal women. The risk fracture in PBC patients is two times higher than that in the health population, and supplements of calcium and vitamin D are recommended with particular care in patients with a history of renal stones. Bisphosphonates are generally well-tolerated, with potential side effects including gastroesophageal irritation, osteonecrosis of the jaw, musculoskeletal pain, and atrial fibrillation, and are not recommended for people with severe impairment of renal function or hypocalcemia; people with specific problems of the esophagus may not be able to take the oral tablets. Evidence for fracture prevention includes a recent randomized clinical trial showing that either weekly alendronate or monthly ibandronate treatment could improve bone mass in patients with PBC; however, hormone replacement therapy in women with PBC is not supported by reliable evidence, and a report confirmed the efficacy and safety of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, for osteoporosis in patients with PBC.

### Primary biliary cholangitis drug evaluation and regulatory approval: where do we go from here? [^adcb29f5]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease. The management landscape was transformed 20 years ago with the advent of ursodeoxycholic acid. Up to 40% of patients do not, however, respond adequately to ursodeoxycholic acid and therefore still remain at risk of disease progression to cirrhosis. The introduction of obeticholic acid as a second-line therapy for patients failing ursodeoxycholic acid has improved outcomes for patients with PBC. There remains, however, a need for better treatment for patients at higher risk. The greatest threat facing our efforts to improve treatment in PBC is, paradoxically, the regulatory approval model providing conditional marketing authorization for new drugs based on biochemical markers on the condition that long-term, randomized placebo-controlled outcome trials are performed to confirm efficacy. As demonstrated by the COBALT confirmatory study with obeticholic acid, it is difficult to retain patients in the required follow-on confirmatory placebo-controlled PBC outcome trials when a licensed drug is commercially available. New PBC therapies in development, such as the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor agonists, face even greater challenges in demonstrating outcome benefit through randomized placebo-controlled studies once following conditional marketing authorization, as there will be even more treatment options available. A recently published EMA Reflection Paper provides some guidance on the regulatory pathway to full approval but fails to recognize the importance of real-world data in providing evidence of outcome benefit in rare diseases. Here we explore the impact of the EMA reflection paper on PBC therapy and offer pragmatic solutions for generating evidence of long-term outcomes through real-world data collection.

### Practical strategies for pruritus management in the obeticholic acid-treated patient with PBC: proceedings from the 2018 expert panel [^165b7740]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, autoimmune cholestatic liver disease that gradually destroys the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, and in most untreated patients progresses to end-stage liver disease and liver failure, resulting in liver transplant or death. In the USA, PBC affects an estimated 40 in 100 000 individuals, with a female to male disease ratio of 9:1.PBC is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged women; while estimates vary, prevalence in women over the age of 40 may be as high as 1 in 1000.

As proper management of PBC is critical to patient health outcomes, treatment should be initiated early in the course of the disease to prevent progression and associated complications. The first-line treatment for PBC is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid that can improve serum hepatic biochemistries, including normalisation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin, and improvement in transplant-free survival. However, up to 40% of patients do not respond to UDCA, leaving a gap in management and the need for additional treatment options. For nearly 20 years, UDCA was the only treatment option approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PBC. In 2016, the FDA approved obeticholic acid (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor agonist, for the treatment of PBC as an adjunctive therapy to UDCA or as monotherapy when UDCA is not tolerated. With its novel mechanisms of action, OCA reduces bile acid synthesis, augments bile acid secretion, and decreases bile acid reuptake. In addition, OCA helps regulate anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic pathways. The approval of OCA was based on biochemical improvement in ALP and bilirubin. Additional trials are ongoing to determine the effect OCA may have on transplant-free survival. Importantly, approval of OCA helped to close the treatment gap for patients with an inadequate biochemical response to UDCA. Recently updated PBC practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), published in 2018, and the most recent European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) PBC practice guidelines, published in 2017, both discuss fibrates as a promising new option for the treatment of PBC. Data from a recently published phase II randomised controlled trial on the use of bezafibrate to treat PBC showed favourable results when used in combination with UDCA; however, there are currently no phase III data available on the use of bezafibrate as treatment for PBC. At this time, bezafibrate is not approved for use in the USA, and while fenofibrate is FDA-approved it is indicated only as a lipid-lowering medication. Additionally, fenofibrate is not recommended for use in patients with active liver disease and is contraindicated to treat patients with PBC, yet fibrates have been recommended as an off-label treatment for PBC due to their anticholestatic properties. Patients who receive fenofibrate who have liver disease require ongoing monitoring of liver values. In contrast to bezafibrate, there is no randomised controlled study of fenofibrate use in PBC; existing studies are uncontrolled single-arm, have small sample size, and mostly observational studies.

APASL clinical practice guidance — ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) response assessment in primary biliary cholangitis notes that some reports suggest that evaluation after six months of UDCA treatment may have equivalent predictive utility to assessment after 12 months, and describes a validated pretreatment UDCA response score consisting of bilirubin, ALP, transaminase, age, and lag time from diagnosis to treatment; pretreatment prediction may help physicians identify high-risk patients and initiate a de novo combination of UDCA and another agent. Recommendation: It is recommended that evaluating all PBC patients for the biochemical response with appropriate criteria after 6 months of UDCA treatment (III, 1), or 12 months of UDCA treatment (II, 1).

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^1ebc62aa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease in which a cycle of immune mediated biliary epithelial cell injury, cholestasis and progressive fibrosis can culminate over time in an end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Both genetic and environmental influences are presumed relevant to disease initiation. PBC is most prevalent in women and those over the age of 50, but a spectrum of disease is recognised in adult patients globally; male sex, younger age at onset (< 45) and advanced disease at presentation are baseline predictors of poorer outcome. As the disease is increasingly diagnosed through the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies, most presenting patients are not cirrhotic and the term cholangitis is more accurate. Disease course is frequently accompanied by symptoms that can be burdensome for patients, and management of patients with PBC must address, in a life-long manner, both disease progression and symptom burden. Licensed therapies include ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA), alongside experimental new and re-purposed agents. Disease management focuses on initiation of UDCA for all patients and risk stratification based on baseline and on-treatment factors, including in particular the response to treatment. Those intolerant of treatment with UDCA or those with high-risk disease as evidenced by UDCA treatment failure (frequently reflected in trial and clinical practice as an alkaline phosphatase > 1.67 × upper limit of normal and/or elevated bilirubin) should be considered for second-line therapy, of which OCA is the only currently licensed National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended agent. Follow-up of patients is life-long and must address treatment of the disease and management of associated symptoms.

### Fat-soluble vitamin levels in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^f676e5dc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the occurrence of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and to identify clinical factors that may predict vitamin deficiency in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).

Methods

Review of our data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of UDCA in 180 patients with PBC. We use the first available measurements of vitamin levels in each study participant. Vitamin levels for A, D, and E were measured in serum. The prothrombin time (PT) was used as a surrogate marker for vitamin K.

Results

The proportion of patients with fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in the treatment and placebo groups was similar and the data sets were combined. The proportion with vitamin A, D, E or K deficiency was 33.5%, 13.2%, 1.9%, and 7.8%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the Mayo risk score, advanced histological stage, and total cholesterol were independently associated with vitamin A deficiency whereas serum albumin levels was independently associated with vitamin D deficiency. No factors were associated with vitamin E or K deficiency in multivariate analysis owing to the few vitamin E and K deficient patients. Factors predictive of vitamin K deficiency by univariate analysis included Mayo risk score, advanced histological stage, HDL, total bilirubin, AST, and albumin. The cut-off value of the Mayo risk score with the highest sensitivity and specificity for vitamin A deficiency was 5.0.

Conclusion

Other than deficiency of vitamin A, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins occurs uncommonly in patients with PBC. A Mayo risk score ≥ 5 helps in selecting patients with PBC for surveillance for vitamin A deficiency.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^81c0773f]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) biochemical response monitoring and assessment use liver biochemical values, with serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin predicting outcomes; improvement is observed within a few weeks, with 90% of the improvement within 6 to 9 months, and about 20% normalizing after 2 years. Biochemical response should be assessed after 1 year of UDCA using published criteria; using binary definitions, up to 40% of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients have an inadequate response. Example criteria include the Barcelona definition of reduction in ALP 40% from baseline or normalization of ALP. Transient elastography values greater than 9.6 kPa were 5 times more likely to progress with clinical decompensation, death, or transplant, and liver biopsy is not indicated to monitor response.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^bd24bb5c]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease. It continues to have a burden of morbidity and mortality that spans both the consequences of a sometimes progressive biliary injury, alongside a symptom profile notably encompassing pruritus, sicca complex, fatigue, abdominal discomfort and arthralgias/bone pain. UK-PBC and the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) have partnered to develop a comprehensive guideline document to provide detailed advice and recommendations on the best approaches to the management of the disease. A series of recommendations and audit standards are proposed to ensure that patients are offered timely licensed therapy (ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), obeticholic acid (OCA)) in addition to being actively managed for symptoms as well as complications of progressive liver disease.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: new treatments for an old disease [^afa5b666]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an immunological condition that causes a significant health disturbance and dramatically reduces the quality of life for those affected with the disease. It is a potentially fatal disease that can lead to multiple hepatic and extrahepatic complications. Having adequate therapeutic interventions that can improve the course of the disease is imperative in reducing the associated morbidity and mortality. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the gold standard therapy. However, it has been associated with suboptimal response rates in a significant proportion of patients. Despite UDCA, approximately 35%-40% of individuals with PBC still experience a progression of the disease, leading to liver failure and requiring liver transplantation. Recent studies of new pharmacological approaches have shown beneficial outcomes. Some of these agents can now be applied to a clinical scenario. In this review article, we will outline the new and emerging treatments for PBC.

### Bile acids for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^cef487c1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive chronic cholestatic liver disease that usually leads to the development of cirrhosis. Studies evaluating bile acids in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis have shown a potential benefit of their use. However, no influence on patients survival and disease outcome has yet been proven.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index Expanded generally from inception through to October 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose of bile acids or duration of treatment versus placebo, no intervention, or another intervention were included irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data independently. We evaluated the risk of bias of the trials using prespecified domains. We performed the meta-analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. We presented outcomes as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight trials evaluated ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention (592 patients). The eight randomised clinical trials have a high risk of bias. Patients were treated for three months to six years (median three years). The dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid used in the trials ranged from low (10 mg/kg body weight/day) to high (28 to 30 mg/kg body weight/day). Ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly reduce the risk of death (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.46 to 2.20); treatment failure including liver transplantation, varices, ascites, and encephalopathy (RR 1.22; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.64); liver histological deterioration (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.74); or liver cholangiographic deterioration (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.57). Ursodeoxycholic acid significantly improved serum bilirubin (MD -14.6 µmol/litre; 95% CI -18.7 to -10.6), alkaline phosphatases (MD -506 IU/litre; 95% CI -583 to -430), aspartate aminotransferase (MD -46 IU/litre; 95% CI -77 to -16), and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (MD -260 IU/litre; 95% CI -315 to -205), but not albumin (MD -0.20 g/litre; 95% CI -1.91 to 1.50). Ursodeoxycholic acid was safe and well tolerated by patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find enough evidence to support or refute the use of bile acids in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, bile acids seem to lead to a significant improvement in liver biochemistry. Therefore, more randomised trials are needed before any of the bile acids can be recommended for this indication.

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis affects 20–44% of patients with PBC with the resultant risk of fragility fractures, while the majority of patients have osteopenia. Risk factors for osteopenic bone disease in PBC include female gender, menopausal status, low body mass index (through the effects of disordered bile acid homeostasis and the pancreatic insufficiency seen in some patients with PBC), older age, advanced disease and chronic cholestasis with resultant vitamin D deficiency. Patients with PBC also have higher markers of bone resorption (urinary hydroxyproline) and lower markers of bone formation (osteocalcin).

Patients should be given general lifestyle advice to prevent loss of bone density (weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, minimising alcohol intake, etc). Falls are seen with increased frequency in PBC due to associated autonomic dysfunction and add to the increased fracture risk presented by osteoporosis. Patients with a clinical history of falls should be referred to a specialist falls clinic for multidisciplinary assessment, including for the presence of autonomic dysfunction.

All patients with cirrhosis and those with other recognised risk factors (eg, female gender, post-menopausal women, low body mass index, older age) should be assessed for osteoporosis and fracture risk. The FRAX score (the WHO fracture risk assessment tool can be used with or without bone mineral density (BMD) values) or QFracture (BMD values cannot be incorporated into the risk algorithm) should be used to estimate 10-year predicted absolute fracture risk. Following risk assessment with FRAX (without a BMD value) or QFracture, consider measuring BMD with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in people whose fracture risk is in the region of an intervention threshold and recalculate absolute risk using FRAX with the BMD value.

National guidelines should be referred to for treatment algorithms. Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected and an adequate dietary intake assured. The use of calcium alongside vitamin D supplementation depends on the adequacy of dietary intake. If a bisphosphonate is required, alendronic acid is usually used first line. Specialist referral should be considered for patients who are unable to tolerate alendronate or risedronate. Treatment options include strontium ranelate, raloxifene, denosumab and teriparatide. There is a widely held view that oral bisphosphonates are unsafe in patients with varices because of the risk of superficial erosion and enhanced bleeding risk. The evidence to support this view is limited. Intravenous bisphosphonates can be used if there is clinical concern. There are limited data regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy and its efficacy in osteoporosis prevention in PBC.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^3ec303d7]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis — bone health, screening, and supplementation: Baseline and regular screening every 2 years using bone mineral density testing is appropriate, and daily calcium (1,500 mg/day) and vitamin D supplements (1,000 International Units/day) may be advisable if there is no history of renal stones; vitamin D levels should be measured annually in patients with advanced disease. In osteoporosis, alendronate was shown in a randomized controlled trial to significantly improve bone density compared with placebo, whereas etidronate was ineffective and monthly ibandronate was found comparable to weekly alendronate in safety and efficiency; hormone replacement therapy has led to some improvement but is seldom used because of safety concerns. Patients with PBC should be provided 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium and 1,000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^94db342f]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Guidance statements for pregnancy in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) indicate that measurement of total serum bile acids may be considered in the first trimester to aid in excluding intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in the setting of new-onset or worsening pruritus during pregnancy. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is safe in pregnancy and lactation, although no data support a therapeutic benefit in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Clinically significant pruritus typically requires a multifaceted approach with cholestyramine (4–16 g daily, divided dose and separated from other medications by at least 2 hours), rifampin (300–600 mg daily), S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (1,000–1,200 mg daily), and antihistamines considered, although evidence is low. Vitamin K deficiency related to cholestasis should be corrected, and regular monitoring of prothrombin time (PT) is recommended.

Patients with parameters diagnostic of PBC or AIH, and associated non-diagnostic features of a second condition, should be treated for the predominant disease in the first instance (in PBC predominant disease with UDCA at 13–15 mg/kg) and the response to therapy assessed, the rationale being the fact that such AIH-like features are also characteristic of UDCA non-responsive PBC. It is likely that the emerging second-line bile acid therapeutic agents will become the recommended agents for use in such patients following failure to respond to UDCA.

### Ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis [^c0bdb4b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ursodeoxycholic acid is administered to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, a chronic progressive inflammatory autoimmune-mediated liver disease with unknown aetiology. Despite its controversial effects, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its usage for primary biliary cirrhosis.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

Search Methods

We searched for eligible randomised trials in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, Clinicaltrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The literature search was performed until January 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials assessing the beneficial and harmful effects of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or 'no intervention' in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. Continuous data were analysed using mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD). Dichotomous data were analysed using risk ratio (RR). Meta-analyses were conducted using both a random-effects model and a fixed-effect model, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Random-effects model meta-regression was used to assess the effects of covariates across the trials. Trial sequential analysis was used to assess risk of random errors (play of chance). Risks of bias (systematic error) in the included trials were assessed according to Cochrane methodology bias domains.

Main Results

Sixteen randomised clinical trials with 1447 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were included. One trial had low risk of bias, and the remaining fifteen had high risk of bias. Fourteen trials compared ursodeoxycholic acid with placebo and two trials compared ursodeoxycholic acid with 'no intervention'. The percentage of patients with advanced primary biliary cirrhosis at baseline varied from 15% to 83%, with a median of 51%. The duration of the trials varied from 3 to 92 months, with a median of 24 months. The results showed no significant difference in effect between ursodeoxycholic acid and placebo or 'no intervention' on all-cause mortality (45/699 (6.4%) versus 46/692 (6.6%); RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42, I² = 0%; 14 trials); on all-cause mortality or liver transplantation (86/713 (12.1%) versus 89/706 (12.6%); RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25, I² = 15%; 15 trials); on serious adverse events (94/695 (13.5%) versus 107/687 (15.6%); RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.12, I² = 23%; 14 trials); or on non-serious adverse events (27/643 (4.2%) versus 18/634 (2.8%); RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.56, I² = 0%; 12 trials). The random-effects model meta-regression showed that the risk of bias of the trials, disease severity of patients at entry, ursodeoxycholic acid dosage, and trial duration were not significantly associated with the intervention effects on all-cause mortality, or on all-cause mortality or liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid did not influence the number of patients with pruritus (168/321 (52.3%) versus 166/309 (53.7%); RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09, I² = 0%; 6 trials) or with fatigue (170/252 (64.9%) versus 174/244 (71.3%); RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00, I² = 62%; 4 trials). Two trials reported the number of patients with jaundice and showed a significant effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention in a fixed-effect meta-analysis (5/99 (5.1%) versus 15/99 (15.2%); RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.90, I² = 51%; 2 trials). The result was not supported by the random-effects meta-analysis (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.95). Portal pressure, varices, bleeding varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy were not significantly affected by ursodeoxycholic acid. Ursodeoxycholic acid significantly decreased serum bilirubin concentration (MD -8.69 µmol/l, 95% CI -13.90 to -3.48, I² = 0%; 881 patients; 9 trials) and activity of serum alkaline phosphatases (MD -257.09 U/L, 95% CI -306.25 to -207.92, I² = 0%; 754 patients, 9 trials) compared with placebo or no intervention. These results were supported by trial sequential analysis. Ursodeoxycholic acid also seemed to improve serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase, aminotransferases, total cholesterol, and plasma immunoglobulin M concentration. Ursodeoxycholic acid seemed to have a beneficial effect on worsening of histological stage (random; 66/281 (23.5%) versus 103/270 (38.2%); RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.88, I² = 35%; 7 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review did not demonstrate any significant benefits of ursodeoxycholic acid on all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality or liver transplantation, pruritus, or fatigue in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid seemed to have a beneficial effect on liver biochemistry measures and on histological progression compared with the control group. All but one of the included trials had high risk of bias, and there are risks of outcome reporting bias and risks of random errors as well. Randomised trials with low risk of bias and low risks of random errors examining the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis are needed.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: a summary of pathogenesis and therapies [^f4773bca]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive autoimmune liver disease characterized by chronic inflammation and destruction of interlobular bile ducts. Its pathogenesis involves a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and immune-mediated mechanisms, particularly T-helper cell activity, leading to bile duct damage. First-line therapy includes ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which improves liver biochemistry and slows disease progression, with obeticholic acid (OCA) as an option for non-responders. Double and/or triple therapy, including UDCA, OCA, and fibrates, appears to be superior in achieving therapeutic benefits in UDCA-nonresponsive PBC patients. Emerging therapies, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α agonists, biologics such as dacetuzumab and rituximab, and experimental approaches such as stem-cell therapy, offer promising advances in managing PBC. Liver transplantation remains a final treatment option for advanced cases.

When should patients be considered for clinical trials?

For many years following the original UDCA trials there has been little or no trials activity in PBC. This is now changing with a number of trials targeting areas of perceived unmet clinic need in the condition, with progress to new licensed second-line therapies such as OCA, which has FDA and EMA approval, as well as NICE evaluation in the UK. Currently there are trials in three distinct areas and patients should be offered the opportunity to participate if they fall into targeted groups (see).

High-risk/UDCA-unresponsive disease

The significantly worse clinical outcome seen in patients showing an inadequate response to UDCA has focused interest on trials of enhanced or second-line therapy. Trials currently under development target two aspects of the disease process — namely, the upstream autoimmune response causing initial bile duct injury (typically but not exclusively using second-generation biological-based approaches) and the cycle of cholestatic injury (using second-line bile acid-targeting therapeutics such as FXR agonists that suppress bile acid production and fibrates, which have anecdotal evidence but as yet no randomised placebo-controlled data). The standard approach in current and proposed enhanced disease therapy trials is to target patients not meeting UDCA response criteria at the end of 1 year of treatment at 13–15 mg/kg/day (or who are intolerant of UDCA) and any patient failing to meet this criterion should be considered for participation in ongoing trials of second-line or enhanced therapy.

Pruritus resistant to current therapy

Current and proposed trials are targeting resistant pruritus including through breaking of the enterohepatic circulation for bile acids and, it is proposed, targeting the autotoxin pathway. Protocols vary, but typically target patients with significant residual pruritus (defined in terms of severity and/or frequency) following first and established second-line therapy or who are intolerant of current therapy, and should therefore be considered for participation in clinical trials.

Fatigue

Trials targeting fatigue are complex, reflecting the nature of the clinical problem. They form part of the management approach undertaken in specialist centres and patients with severe fatigue should be considered for referral to such centres. Critical for trials of fatigue in PBC is the need to exclude confounding causes, and the systematic approach to addressing such confounding processes outlined elsewhere in these guidelines should be followed before trial participation is considered.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^8f8fb3e3]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Therapy for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — UDCA — indicates that UDCA at a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day is the first-line therapy for PBC; the drug is initiated gradually and generally given in two divided doses, although it can be given once daily to improve compliance, particularly at bedtime. UDCA is used for patients with any stage of PBC as long as their liver biochemistries are abnormal, with earlier histologic stage usually responding more favorably, although patients with advanced disease may benefit in survival or avoid liver transplantation with this therapy. A study comparing three different doses showed that a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day appeared superior to either a lower dose of 5 to 7 mg/kg/day or a higher dose of 23 to 25 mg/kg/day in biochemical responses and cost, and studies that show an improvement in survival have all used this dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day. UDCA is widely used and has demonstrated the ability to produce a reduction in need for liver transplantation for PBC. Cholestyramine and other bile acid-binding sequestrants as well as some antacids may interfere with UDCA absorption, and in cases of concomitant use these should be administered at separate times.

### Application of the latest advances in evidence-based medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^20d97125]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, cholestatic, autoimmune liver disease that can progress to end-stage liver disease and its complications. A previous expert review panel collaborated on a consensus document for gastroenterologists and other healthcare professionals regarding the care of patients with PBC. Subsequently, there have been several recent important developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients with PBC. These include updates to prognostic models on risk stratification, new noninvasive tools for staging of disease, updates to the appropriate use of and long-term treatment results with obeticholic acid as a second-line treatment, the emerging therapeutic role of fibrates, and the advancement of investigational agents for managing PBC. In this updated expert consensus document, we provide updates on staging, the use of noninvasive prognostic tools, and a treatment algorithm to provide evidence-based and practical tools for clinicians who manage PBC, with the ultimate goal to improve the long-term outcomes for patients with this chronic liver disease.

Evidence levels (as per Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system)

The recommendations are based on the GRADE classification system (Strong/Weak; quality of evidence: High/Moderate/Low/Very low).

GRADE classifies recommendations as strong or weak. Strength of recommendation is determined by the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, quality of evidence, variability in values and preferences, and resource use. The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted. The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted. The higher the costs of an intervention — that is, the greater the resources consumed — the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. Strong recommendations mean that most informed patients would choose the recommended management and that clinicians can structure their interactions with patients accordingly. Weak recommendations mean that patients' choices will vary according to their values and preferences, and clinicians must ensure that patients' care is in keeping with their values and preferences.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^ce80c0c0]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis — pregnancy course and pruritus management: During pregnancy, up to 70% of women with PBC have stable or improved liver tests, but increased liver disease activity occurs in 60% to 70% postpartum. De novo onset or worsening of pruritus during pregnancy occurs in approximately 50% of women. Immunoglobulin M levels and M2 antibody titers may decline in pregnancy but return to baseline levels postpartum. For management of pruritus, cholestyramine, rifampin, or S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) may be added to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Cholestasis may lead to vitamin K deficiency and increased risk of bleeding, and cholestyramine may exacerbate vitamin K deficiency in persons with cholestasis, with rare case reports of associated hypoprothrombinemia and even hemorrhage. Onset varied from 2 weeks to 8 months and responded promptly to parenteral vitamin K supplementation.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: what have we learned and where are we going? [^51488053]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

It has proven difficult to establish robust evidence for significant clinical benefits of medical treatment in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). For ursodeoxycholic acid, clinical practice guidelines only offer vague recommendations, leading to a situation of variable prescription rates depending on local reimbursement policies and physician preference. The difficulty in drug development in PSC is partly related to a poor understanding of critical disease processes with failure to identify relevant mechanisms of action of putative drugs. The variable disease course, both intra-individually and between individuals, and the lack of robust definitions of what success looks like for clinical trials in PSC have also contributed to the negative outcomes of trials performed. In this review article, we will discuss these uncertainties and challenges, building on key previous and ongoing clinical trials. Despite the lack of consensus for ideal phase II and phase III study designs, several trials for diverse compounds are currently ongoing, indicating a shift from therapeutic nihilism toward hope for people with PSC. While waiting for robust efficacy data for drugs currently being tested, the current lack of effective interventions should not motivate the prescription of compounds to people with PSC based on low-quality evidence.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary biliary cholangitis, more specifically with respect to screening for comorbidities, BSG 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that hyperlipidemia of PBC is not associated with an elevated cardiac risk. Obtain cardiovascular risk assessment to evaluate the need for lipid-lowering therapy, focusing on the identification of patients with PBC and metabolic syndrome (with high cholesterol, low HDL-C, and high LDL-C levels).
