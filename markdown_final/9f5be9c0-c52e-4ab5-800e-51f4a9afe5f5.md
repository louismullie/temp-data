## Question

Is concerta associated with stomach pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Concerta (methylphenidate) is associated with stomach pain and how confident we can be about that association. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources, namely FDA labeling, to establish whether abdominal pain is a recognized adverse reaction. Then, I should verify whether randomized, placebo-controlled trials quantify this risk and in which populations. Next, I will consider mechanistic plausibility and whether formulation-specific issues could contribute. After that, I should review severity, management, and when stomach pain might signal a more serious problem. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, useful conclusion with practical counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory labeling, because that carries the highest evidentiary weight for adverse effects. The FDA prescribing information for Concerta explicitly lists abdominal pain as a commonly observed adverse reaction in clinical trials, and in pediatric populations it specifically notes that upper abdominal pain was among the most frequent adverse reactions, which directly supports a causal association in routine clinical use [^116hC6aU] [^1128mN3Y].

> Wait, let me verify the frequency and context so I don't overstate it. In pediatric double-blind trials, upper abdominal pain was one of the most common adverse reactions, and in adults, abdominal pain appears in the adverse reactions sections as well, with the majority of gastrointestinal adverse events being mild to moderate in severity, which helps frame expectations for clinical counseling and monitoring [^1128mN3Y] [^116hC6aU].

> Hold on, I should also check whether this extends to the immediate-release methylphenidate class to ensure consistency. The FDA labeling for immediate-release methylphenidate (e.g. Ritalin) likewise lists abdominal pain as a very common adverse reaction, reinforcing that stomach pain is a class effect of methylphenidate rather than unique to the Concerta formulation, which strengthens the inference that the association is pharmacologic rather than purely formulation-related [^116u29z4].

> I need to consider mechanistic plausibility. Methylphenidate is a CNS stimulant that increases sympathetic tone and can alter gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensitivity, which can plausibly contribute to abdominal discomfort or pain. Additionally, the Concerta tablet is nondeformable and designed for controlled release, and although rare, nondeformable controlled-release tablets have been associated with obstructive symptoms in patients with preexisting GI narrowing, which could present as abdominal pain in susceptible individuals, so I should keep that caveat in mind when pain is severe or atypical [^113S7kwE].

> Next, I should review severity and clinical significance. The FDA materials emphasize that most gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including abdominal pain, are mild to moderate and often transient, but I should confirm management guidance: if adverse reactions occur, dose reduction or discontinuation is reasonable, and patients should be counseled to take the tablet whole with liquid and not chew, divide, or crush it to avoid erratic release or local GI irritation, which could theoretically worsen pain in some cases [^116hC6aU] [^notfound] [^117JW685].

> But wait, what if the stomach pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by red flags? I should double-check for warning signs that warrant further evaluation: weight loss, vomiting, blood in stool, fever, or signs of obstruction, especially in patients with known GI strictures or motility disorders. In those contexts, I need to ensure we consider alternative diagnoses and, if appropriate, reassess the suitability of a nondeformable controlled-release formulation in the setting of GI anatomy risk [^113S7kwE].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. Yes, Concerta is associated with stomach pain. Abdominal pain is a recognized and commonly observed adverse reaction in clinical trials, with upper abdominal pain particularly prominent in children and adolescents, and the signal is consistent across the methylphenidate class, supporting a true pharmacologic association. Clinically, most cases are mild to moderate and manageable with dose adjustment and proper administration technique, but persistent or severe pain deserves evaluation for alternative causes and, in patients with GI narrowing, consideration of formulation-related risks [^1128mN3Y] [^116hC6aU] [^116u29z4] [^113S7kwE].

Concerta (methylphenidate) is associated with **stomach pain** as a common side effect, especially in children and adolescents [^1128mN3Y]. The pain is typically mild to moderate and often transient, but persistent or severe pain warrants evaluation for underlying GI conditions or medication-related issues [^116hC6aU]. Risk is higher with preexisting GI narrowing or motility disorders due to the nondeformable tablet [^113S7kwE]; **swallow whole** and avoid chewing or crushing to reduce risk [^117JW685]. Management includes dose adjustment, taking with food, or switching to another stimulant if pain persists [^113uB4dN].

---

## Incidence and clinical characteristics

- **Incidence**: Abdominal pain is among the most common adverse reactions in pediatric trials (> 5%) [^1128mN3Y] and is also reported in adults, though less frequently [^116hC6aU] [^1128mN3Y].

- **Clinical characteristics**: Pain is usually mild to moderate, transient, and often occurs early in treatment or after dose increases [^116hC6aU].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms may explain **stomach pain** with Concerta:

- **Gastric irritation**: The nondeformable tablet may irritate the gastric mucosa or delay gastric emptying, causing discomfort [^113S7kwE].

- **Increased gastric acid secretion**: CNS stimulation can increase acid output, causing gastritis or ulcer-like pain.

- **Altered GI motility**: Methylphenidate may slow gastric emptying, causing bloating, nausea, and pain [^notfound].

- **Visceral hypersensitivity**: Central sensitization may heighten perception of normal GI stimuli as painful [^115qMC15].

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Certain factors increase the risk of **stomach pain** with Concerta:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Children and adolescents have higher incidence than adults [^1128mN3Y] |
| Preexisting GI conditions | - Esophageal motility disorders <br/> - Small bowel inflammatory disease <br/> - Short gut syndrome <br/> - Meckel's diverticulum <br/> - Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction [^113S7kwE] |
| Dosage | Higher doses may increase risk of GI side effects [^notfound] |
| Administration method | Chewing or crushing tablets increases risk of GI irritation or obstruction [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical management strategies

Management of **stomach pain** associated with Concerta includes:

- **Dose adjustment**: Lowering the dose or titrating more slowly may reduce GI symptoms [^notfound].

- **Administration with food**: Taking Concerta with food may lessen GI irritation [^notfound].

- **Alternative formulations**: Switching to immediate-release methylphenidate or another stimulant may help if pain persists [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize swallowing tablets whole and avoiding chewing or crushing [^117JW685].

- **Medical evaluation**: Persistent or severe pain warrants evaluation for underlying GI pathology or medication-related complications [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other stimulant medications

Stomach pain is a **class effect** of stimulants, including methylphenidate and amphetamines [^115D7pDY]. Incidence and severity vary by formulation and individual susceptibility, but overall rates are comparable across stimulants.

---

## Long-term implications and patient outcomes

Most cases resolve with dose adjustment or discontinuation, and long-term GI complications are rare. Persistent pain may affect adherence and quality of life, so **individualized management** is important [^111fULgg].

---

Concerta is associated with **stomach pain**, particularly in children and adolescents; most cases are mild and transient, but persistent or severe pain requires evaluation and management.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^111fULgg]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight current knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

Suppression of Growth

Advise patients, caregivers, and family members that CONCERTA may cause slowing of growth and weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Increased Intraocular Pressure (IOP) and Glaucoma

Advise patients that IOP and glaucoma may occur during treatment with CONCERTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette's Syndrome

Advise patients that motor and verbal tics and worsening of Tourette's Syndrome may occur during treatment with CONCERTA. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if emergence of new tics or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Administration Instructions

Patients should be informed that CONCERTA should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Tablets should not be chewed, divided, or crushed. The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell, along with insoluble core components, is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet.

3.6 Stomach pain trajectories

Analysis of the stomach pain data using LCGA identified a four cluster solution as being the optimal model (see Fig. 1 d). The largest cluster (cluster 1) had very low probability of pain throughout follow-up, and contained 79% of the sample. The next most common pain cluster had decreasing probability of pain between baseline and 3-years (cluster 2, 9%); this cluster had moderately high levels of somatization and depression (Table 2). Cluster 3 (7%) had rising probability of pain during follow-up, and had moderately high mean somatization and depression scores. The final cluster (5%) had high probability of pain throughout follow-up (cluster 4), and had the highest proportion of females, the highest mean baseline somatization and depression scores, and the lowest levels of life satisfaction.

### Assessment of relationships between frailty and chronic pain: a bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomisation study [^112AmYbC]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous observational studies have indicated a complex association between chronic pain and frailty. This study aimed to examine the bidirectional causal relationship between frailty and chronic pain and to quantify mediating effects of known modifiable risk factors.

Methods

A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was applied in this study. Summary genome-wide association statistics for frailty, as defined by both frailty index (FI) and Fried Frailty Score (FFS), pain at seven site-specific chronic pain (SSCP) (headache, facial, neck/shoulder, stomach/abdominal, back, hip and knee) and multisite chronic pain (MCP) were extracted from populations of European ancestry. Genetic instrumental variables strongly correlated with each exposure were selected. The inverse-variance-weighted method was the primary method used in the MR, supplemented by a range of sensitivity and validation analyses. Two-step MR analysis was undertaken to evaluate the mediating effects of several proposed confounders.

Results

Genetically predicted higher FI and FFS were associated with an increased risk of MCP and specific types of SSCP, including neck/shoulder pain, stomach/abdominal pain, back pain, hip pain and knee pain. In the reverse direction analysis, genetic liability to MCP was found to be associated with increased FI and FFS. These results remained consistent across sensitivity and validation assessments. Two-step MR suggested a mediating role for body mass index, smoking initiation, physical inactivity, educational attainment and depression.

Conclusions

Our research provided genetic evidence that the association between frailty and chronic pain was bidirectional where the coexistence of both conditions will exacerbate each other.

FAEs — efficacy and adverse effects include that more participants achieved PASI 75 with FAEs. Adverse effects, mainly GI disturbance and flushing, were more prevalent in patients taking FAEs compared with placebo (76% vs 16%; RR, 4.72; 95% CI, 2.45–9.0). GI complaints, including nausea, vomiting, esophageal, and stomach pain, can occur in up to two-thirds of patients. A modest lymphopenia is invariably present but does not appear to be of significant clinical concern. Increases in liver function test results, triglycerides, cholesterol, and creatinine are possible, necessitating regular laboratory monitoring. There are rare cases of renal disease that have been reported with FAEs, although this was not experienced in any randomized controlled trials and FAEs may not be the cause.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Concerta) [^113S7kwE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Potential for Gastrointestinal Obstruction

Because the CONCERTA tablet is nondeformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the GI tract, CONCERTA should not ordinarily be administered to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, "short gut" syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or Meckel's diverticulum). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations. Due to the controlled-release design of the tablet, CONCERTA should be used only in patients who are able to swallow the tablet whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.10 Hematologic Monitoring

Periodic CBC, differential, and platelet counts are advised during prolonged therapy.

5.11 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma

There have been rare reports of angle closure glaucoma associated with methylphenidate treatment.

Although the mechanism is not clear, CONCERTA-treated patients considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., patients with significant hyperopia) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.

5.12 Increased Intraocular Pressure and Glaucoma

There have been reports of an elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with methylphenidate treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.5)].

Prescribe CONCERTA to patients with open-angle glaucoma or abnormally increased IOP only if the benefit of treatment is considered to outweigh the risk. Closely monitor CONCERTA-treated patients with a history of abnormally increased IOP or open angle glaucoma.

5.13 Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette's Syndrome

CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.5)]. Worsening of Tourette's syndrome has also been reported.

Before initiating CONCERTA, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette's syndrome. Regularly monitor CONCERTA-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.

### Gastric wall abscess presenting as thoracic pain: rare presentation of an old disease [^117J9bdu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

SG is a rare bacterial infection of the submucosa and the muscularis propia of the stomach, a rare entity with approximately 500 cases reported in the literature. It is widely accepted that the stomach is relatively protected from infection due to vascular supply and the antimicrobial environment provided by gastric acidity. Acute phlegmonous gastritis can progress quickly, and can be fatal in two-thirds of patients. Two types of SG have been described in the literature: a diffuse or phlegmonous variant type of SG as opposed to a localized or intramural gastric abscess. The true prevalence of acute SG is unknown. The infection occurs primarily within the gastric submucosa and spreads horizontally. Suppuration progresses vertically into the muscularis and serosa, sparing the gastric mucosa until late in the disease. The localized abscess of the gastric wall is another variety of SG, a purulent inflammatory process involving the gastric wall that can occur in diffuse, localized, and mixed forms. A review of English language publications identified only 21 reported cases of gastric abscess. The localized form accounts for 5 to 15% of all cases. The exact pathogenetic mechanism of SG is unknown. Risk factors can be identified in nearly 60% of patient and they include increased age, mucosal injury (chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and endoscopic injury), hypoacidity (post-vagotomy and gastric resection), malnutrition and immunosuppression (alcoholism, HIV infection). The SG is secondary to an infection (local or disseminated) of the stomach wall by gram-positive cocci (mostly alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus), which are not always isolated from routine microbiological cultures. Other etiologic organisms in decreasing order of frequency are Staphylococcus spp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus, Clostridia, while mixed bacterial infections are documented in 30% of cases. The classic clinical symptoms of SG are upper abdominal pain, high fever, epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. In most cases, epigastric abdominal pain and nausea dominate the clinical picture. Unusual clinical presentations including purulent emesis and Deininger's sign (decreased abdominal pain on changing from the supine to sitting position). The symptoms may be present all day long although they may take several days to develop. SG progresses rapidly, often leading to a fatal infection unless recognized early. The SG must be differentiated from gastric carcinoma, MALT lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, leiomyoma or carcinoid tumor.

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^1146BuCZ]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In May 2022, she took a 5-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of the context of an acute COVID-19 infection, experiencing no side effects other than dysgeusia. This course led to improvements in overall functioning, such that she was no longer bedridden and other symptoms were less severe (e.g. fatigue improved, migraine improved, light and sound sensitivity reduced enough to be able to leave dark bedroom for short periods of time, shifted from needing to be fed while lying down to being able to sit up in bed to eat and drink). Concomitant medications included escitalopram, propranolol, low-dose naltrexone, pravastatin, fenofibrate, and maraviroc. In June 2022, she attempted a second 5-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, also outside of the context of an acute COVID-19 infection. She experienced severe stomach pain within 5 h of taking the first dose and discontinued the course. This stomach pain lasted 7–9 h and she had gastrointestinal issues for the next week. At the time of the second course, concomitant medications included those listed above, as well as clopidogrel and meloxicam. Suspecting that the stomach pain was due to contraindicated medications, she attempted a third, 15-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in February 2023, also outside of the context of an acute COVID-19 infection. At this time, she stopped all of her other medications except escitalopram, propranolol, and low-dose naltrexone. She again experienced severe stomach pain within 5 h of the first dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and stopped the course. As before, her stomach pain lasted 7–9 h, with gastrointestinal issues lingering for the next week.

The improvements from the initial 5-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have persisted, but she continues to experience her same Long COVID symptoms and substantial functional limitations.

### Reduction in pain: is it worth the gain? The effect of opioids on the GI tract [^1129yQQt]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

The use of opioid medications for acute and chronic pain has increased significantly in the past 20 years in the United States. Given the high density of opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, side effects are common in these patients including constipation, dysphagia, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. These side effects, which are experienced by most patients who take opioids, can lead to significant impairment in quality of life. Unlike other side effects from opioids, gastrointestinal side effects do not diminish with continued use, often leading patients to reduce or discontinue their opioid treatment to relieve these side effects. Therefore, physicians must be aware and anticipate potential side effects in patients receiving opioids to ensure appropriate pain management.

### Relationship of pain and symptoms to pubertal development in adolescents [^112xvgTZ]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain, abdominal pain, migraine and tension-type headache are more prevalent in women than in men. This study assessed the relationship of back pain, headache, abdominal pain, TMD pain, and the presence of multiple pain conditions to gender and pubertal development in a cross-sectional, population-based survey of adolescents. We also examined the association between pubertal development and depressive and somatic symptoms, factors often associated with pain in adults. We hypothesized that prevalence of all pain conditions, as well as rates of other symptoms, would increase as puberty progresses in females, but not males. Subjects (3,101 boys and girls, 11–17 years old, selected from an HMO population) reported on the presence of each pain condition in the prior 3 months and completed scales assessing pubertal development, and depressive and somatic symptoms. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. Prevalence rates were weighted for factors affecting response. Prevalence of back pain, headache and TMD pain increased significantly (odds ratios, OR = 1.4–2.0, P < 0.001) and stomach pain increased marginally with increasing pubertal development in girls. Rates of somatization, depression and probability of experiencing multiple pains also increased with pubertal development in girls (P < 0.0001). For boys, prevalence of back (OR = 1.9, P < 0.0001) and facial pain (OR = 1.5, P < 0.01) increased, stomach pain decreased somewhat and headache prevalence was virtually unchanged with increasing maturity. For both sexes, pubertal development was a better predictor of pain than was age. Thus it appears that pain, other somatic symptoms and depression increase systematically with pubertal development in girls.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

CONCERTA may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including CONCERTA include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

CONCERTA may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

### Centrally targeted pharmacotherapy for chronic abdominal pain [^114rK7oQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic abdominal pain in the context of the functional gastrointestinal disorders departs from a more traditional approach to treating gastrointestinal symptoms. Chronic abdominal pain involves a dysregulation of brain-gut modulation of afferent signaling, so treatments directed toward the gut are not usually sufficient to achieve a clinical response. Rather the methods of treatment depend on re-establishing central pain regulation.

Purpose

A conceptual model of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors is used to explain how a situation of chronic pain develops and it provides the evidence for central neuron degeneration as relevant to this chain of events. The rationale for centrally targeted medications, in particular antidepressants, is discussed with regard to effects independent of their role in treating psychiatric disorders: with regard to downregulation of afferent pain signals and their potential role in neuron proliferation. Finally, guiding examples of which drug to use and treatment combinations involving multiple drugs, augmentation treatment, are outlined and some brief clinical cases of centrally targeted pharmacotherapy.

Outcome

We selected chronic back pain, chronic stomach/abdominal pain, chronic neck/shoulder pain, chronic knee pain, chronic hip pain, chronic facial pain, chronic headache as concerned pain phenotypes. We did not include chest pain as outcome of interest since chest pain is highly mixed with cardiopulmonary disease. Each chronic pain phenotype was established by utilizing self-report answers to the specified questions: Have you had [back pains/neck or shoulder pains/ stomach/abdominal pain/ knee pain/ hip pain/ facial pain/ headache] for more than 3 months? Participants were provided with the options of responding "Yes", "No", "Don't know", or "Prefer not to answer" to these questions. Individuals who answered "Yes" to a specific question were considered cases for that particular pain phenotype. Number of cases for each GWAS were as follows: back pain (N = 80,588); neck/shoulder pain (N = 72,887); facial pain (N = 3107); hip pain (N = 40,152); knee pain (N = 76,910), headache (N = 41,719); stomach/abdominal pain (N = 21,711).

### A prognostic risk score for development and spread of chronic pain [^111NUpmJ]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Pain phenotype: NFBC

At the 46-year follow-up participants were asked whether they have had 'pain or aches in the last 12 months' (question (Q) 46) of the complimentary questionnaire), at which body sites they experienced this pain and for how long. Pain lasting longer than 3 months was considered chronic. Pain lasting less than 3 months was considered acute. Facial and stomach/abdominal pain were collected in a separate questionnaire. Participants reporting both chronic pain on the previously mentioned questionnaire and pain at the stomach/abdomen (reported in Q96 of the background, lifestyle and health survey) were defined as having chronic stomach/abdominal pain. Similarly, participants with chronic or acute facial pain were defined as participants reporting chronic or acute pain in Q46 and jaw or face pain once a week or more (Q101 of the background, lifestyle and health survey). Healthy controls were defined as those who reported no pain over the last year. Self-reported pain intensity, impact of pain, likelihood of returning to work and depressive symptoms were recorded on a 0–10 scale. Participants also reported whether they had pain-related illnesses, such as fibromyalgia, diagnosed by a doctor. PAO was defined as reporting five or more pain sites.

At an earlier visit (31-year follow-up) participants reported frequency of pain or aches over the past year at a variety of body sites as well as frequency of headaches in the past week. Although these items were unable to differentiate acute from chronic pain sufferers, we utilized this item to select participants who never experienced pain at a given site during the 31-year visit and tracked who among these participants developed pain at the next follow-up visit 15 years later.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^112tiggA]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Gastroparesis — buspirone effects and certainty: Compared with placebo, changes with buspirone were not clinically important based on predefined minimal important differences, there was possible worsening in the abdominal pain score, and there was no clinically important difference in the risk of serious adverse events between patients who received buspirone and placebo. The overall certainty of evidence was very low, and the single clinical trial comparing buspirone with placebo did not show significant improvements in nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, or overall symptom severity score; despite this, Panel Content Experts felt that buspirone could be useful in patients with gastroparesis whose predominant symptoms are early satiety and bloating, especially in the absence of any signal suggesting increased risk of serious adverse events among those treated with buspirone.

### Postprandial symptoms originating from the stomach in functional dyspepsia [^116hSMFd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is characterized by chronic epigastric symptoms. The stomach has been held responsible for the generation of symptoms, but the latest reports have pointed out that also the duodenum can be implicated in the pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to elucidate which dyspeptic symptoms originate from the stomach and/or from the small intestine after a meal.

Methods

Two hundred eighty-four FD patients underwent a gastric emptying breath test. Breath samples were taken and the intensity of six dyspeptic symptoms (fullness, bloating, belching, nausea, epigastric burning, and epigastric pain) was scored before a meal and at 15 min intervals for a period of 240 min postprandially. Time curves of each symptom were analyzed and severity scores during the gastric and the intestinal phase were compared.

Key Results

Time curves of fullness, bloating, belching, and nausea displayed a significant negative slope, while symptom severity of epigastric burning and epigastric pain did not decrease over time. Numerical analysis revealed that scores for fullness, bloating, and belching were higher during the gastric phase compared with the intestinal phase. On the other hand, intensities of nausea, epigastric burning, and epigastric pain were similar during both phases.

Conclusions & Inferences

Intensities of fullness, bloating, and belching decrease with food moving from the stomach to the small intestine indicating that the stomach plays a crucial role in the generation of these symptoms. In contrast, the symptom severity of epigastric burning and epigastric pain persists with progression of food to the small intestine.

Obesity Medicine Association Clinical Practice Statement (OMA CPS) 2022 — Bariatric surgery can help reduce body weight and improve health outcomes, with the two most common procedures being Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy, both of which can be performed laparoscopically and improve metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Gastric bypass divides the stomach into a small proximal gastric pouch attached to a "roux" limb, bypassing the gastric remnant, the duodenum, and remaining proximal jejunum. Acute gastric bypass complications include leaks or perforations leading to peritonitis with severe abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis; imaging may include soluble contrast abdominal CT or upper GI, and treatment is immediate surgical exploration. Chronic gastric bypass complications include gastro-gastric fistula with weight regain, dumping syndrome with facial flushing, lightheadedness, reactive hypoglycemia, and postprandial diarrhea, and internal hernias with intermittent postprandial abdominal pain and emesis. Sleeve gastrectomy removes a portion of the stomach, leaving less stomach and altering gastrointestinal hormones, with acute complications including intestinal obstruction and staple line leaks and chronic complications including onset or worsening of gastroesophageal reflux disease for which proton pump inhibitor therapy may be used and which may prompt consideration of conversion to gastric bypass; other complications include sleeve dilation and luminal stenosis.

Chronic pain terminology in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is defined and operationalized as follows: Chronic pain is pain that "persists or recurs for longer than 3 months", and related mechanisms include visceral hyperalgesia ("The associated increase in sensitivity to stimuli near the site of injury, infection, or inflammation"), allodynia ("An abnormal state of pain responsiveness that can be elicited by innocuous stimuli, such as food in the stomach or urge to have a bowel movement"), hyperalgesia ("An exaggerated or prolonged response to noxious stimuli, such as low-grade inflammation"), and central sensitization ("Increased sensitivity mediated by the central nervous system"). Psychosocial constructs relevant to management include pain acceptance ("The process of giving up the struggle with pain and learning to live life despite pain"), psychological flexibility ("Psychological flexibility is the ability to stay in contact with the present moment regardless of unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations, while choosing one's behaviors based on the situation and personal values"), pain catastrophizing ("Tendency to magnify or exaggerate the threat value or seriousness of pain sensations"), negative expectancy ("Paying particular attention to negative information and a tendency to interpret ambiguous information as threatening"), and probability overestimation ("Overestimating the likelihood of an event occurring and acting according to the overestimation rather than the actual likelihood").

### Trajectories of pain in adolescents: a prospective cohort study [^117EGPV5]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of different patterns of change in pain over time – trajectories – has the potential to provide new information on the course of pain. Describing trajectories among adolescents would improve understanding of how pain conditions can develop. This prospective cohort study identified distinct trajectories of pain among adolescents (11–14 years) in the general population (n = 1336). Latent class growth analysis was carried out on the self-reported frequency of back pain, headache, stomach pain and facial pain, which was collected every 3 months for 3 years. Forty four percent of adolescents had a 'painful' trajectory for at least one pain site, and 12% reported persistent pain at one or more pain site. Headache was the most common; 25% of subjects were in a 'painful' trajectory and 5% reported persistent pain. Back pain and stomach pain were also common, with 22% and 21% of subjects in painful trajectories, respectively. Facial pain was the least common, with only 10% in a painful trajectory, and 1% reporting persistent pain. Trajectory characteristics were similar at baseline across pain sites, with the more painful trajectories having significantly higher levels of depression and somatization, lower life satisfaction and more females. Trajectories did not differ significantly at baseline in physical activity levels or BMI. Agreement of trajectory membership among pain sites was moderate. In summary, reporting a painful trajectory was common among adolescents, but persistent pain was reported by a small minority, and was usually experienced at a single pain site.

4 Cluster characteristics at 3-years and change over time

For all four pain sites, absolute somatization and depression scores were the lowest at both baseline and 3-year follow-up in cluster 1, the 'no pain problem' cluster (Table 3). For the majority of clusters, there was an improvement in somatization and depression scores during follow-up. The largest improvements in depression (27–29% reduction in mean scores) were seen in back pain cluster 2, facial pain cluster 3, and stomach pain cluster 2, which all had decreasing probability of pain during follow-up. The largest improvements in somatization (42% and 42% decrease) were in back pain cluster 6 and stomach pain cluster 4; these clusters had high probability of pain during follow-up. Exceptions to this trend were back pain cluster 3, which had probability of pain rising steeply after 18 months follow-up, and headache cluster 4 which had consistently high probability of pain; both of these had increasing depression scores (16% and 8% increase), and the back pain cluster also had an increasing mean somatization score (10% increase). The highest mean 3-year depression and somatization scores were recorded for facial pain cluster 4 (1.19 and 0.88, respectively), which was a small cluster with consistently high probability of pain.

BMI increased by around 12% on average from 11–14 years, with no clear trends for any of the individual trajectories or pain sites, and no large differences between trajectories. However there were statistically significant differences in 3-year mean BMI within the facial pain and stomach pain clusters (Table 3). The 3-year mean PDS score was lower in the no pain problem cluster than the painful clusters, although the change since baseline was larger. There were no clear patterns of pubertal development between the different painful trajectories.

### Pain interference and incident medical disorders in the general population [^111ZPKGj]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the longitudinal relationship between pain interference and incident general medical conditions in a nationally representative sample.

Methods

Secondary data analysis comprising chi-square tests and binomial logistic regression analyses were performed on data obtained from the US National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions from 34,465 adult respondents who completed wave 1 (2000–2001) and wave 2 (2004–2005) data collection. Models were adjusted for multiple potentially confounding factors. Respondents were categorized at wave 1 according to past-month pain interference (i.e., no or low pain interference, moderate pain interference, severe pain interference).

Results

In multivariate analyses, moderate or severe pain interference (as compared to no or low pain interference) was associated with the incidence of any medical condition; any heart condition, including angina, tachycardia and other heart disease; any stomach condition, including stomach ulcer and gastritis; arthritis; and hypertension (all P < 0.05). Severe (but not moderate) pain interference as compared with no or low pain interference was additionally associated with new occurrences of myocardial infarction, any liver disease, other liver disease, and arteriosclerosis (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that the relationship between pain interference and general medical conditions is complex. A more complete understanding of this relationship is likely to involve further exploration of possible mechanisms, including whether it is the pain itself, the ascertainment of pain etiology, or pain treatment that is associated with incident general medical conditions.

### Efficacy and safety of paragastric neural blockade in controlling pain, nausea, and vomiting after sleeve gastrectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^112h5o4H]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity and its associated disorders have significant implications for health, resulting in heightened productivity loss and reduced life expectancy while also negatively impacting the quality of life of patients. Surgical intervention is the most effective way to achieve sustainable weight loss in patients with obesity and to alleviate the associated comorbidities.

The annual incidence of surgical treatments for obesity management is steadily rising, with approximately 580,000 individuals undergoing obesity surgery across the world each year. Despite the current availability of minimally invasive bariatric surgical treatments, postoperative pain remains a significant issue. Postoperative pain is divided into two groups: somatic pain and visceral pain. Various techniques are employed to manage postoperative somatic pain, including transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, port site injection, and erector spinae plane (ESP) block. While these methods are effective in controlling somatic pain, they have no effect on visceral pain. On the other hand, opioid-derived drugs, which are mostly used to control somatic pain, can lead to respiratory depression and constipation and adversely affect the quality of life of patients in the early postoperative period. In order for patients to have a healthier postoperative period, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols recommend reducing opioid use after bariatric surgery.

Many methods, such as celiac plexus, splanchnic nerve, superior and inferior hypogastric, and ganglion impar blocks, have been evaluated to control abdominal and pelvic pain in patients with chronic visceral pain of benign or malignant origin. The celiac plexus provides sympathetic, parasympathetic, and visceral sensory afferent fibers to the upper abdominal viscera, including the pancreas, liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, mesentery, stomach, small intestine, and the proximal part of the transverse colon. Research has demonstrated that patients' pain and opioid consumption decrease in diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, especially after the celiac plexus block procedure.

Vagal and sympathetic afferent signals originating from the gastrointestinal system stimulate the vomiting center, causing nausea and vomiting. Following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), nausea and vomiting may occur as a result of increased intraluminal pressure in the stomach due to the decreased extensibility and compliance of the postoperative gastric pouch. Therefore, any intervention that reduces intraluminal pressure can prevent nausea and vomiting.

### Gastric distention correlates with activation of multiple cortical and subcortical regions [^116FA45U]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia may involve abnormal processing of visceral stimuli at the level of the central nervous system. There is accumulating evidence that visceral and somatic pain processing in the brain share common neuronal substrates. However, the cerebral loci that process sensory information from the stomach are unknown. The aim of this study was to localize the human brain regions that are activated by gastric distention.

Methods

Brain (15)O-water positron emission tomography was performed in 15 right-handed healthy volunteers during baseline and distal gastric distentions to 10 mm Hg, 20 mm Hg, threshold pain, and moderate pain. Pain, nausea, and bloating were rated during baseline and distentions (0–5 scale). Statistical subtraction analysis of brain images was performed between distentions and baseline.

Results

Symptoms increased with distending stimulus intensity (maximum pain, 2.1 ± 0.4; nausea, 2.2 ± 0.4; bloating, 3.7 ± 0.2). Paralleling increases in distention stimulus and symptoms, progressive increases in activation (P ≤ 0.05), were observed in the thalami, insula bilaterally, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nuclei, brain stem periaqueductal gray matter, cerebellum, and occipital cortex.

Conclusions

Symptomatic gastric distention activates structures implicated in somatic pain processing, supporting the notion of a common cerebral pain network.

### Multisite chronic pain and the risk of breast cancer and its subtypes: a mendelian randomization study [^115w1jqp]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain (CP) is widespread and a major cause of disability. However, its genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as its relationship with breast cancer (BC), remain unclear. The study is the first to apply Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the causal relationship between CP and BC.

Methods

Two-sample MR and multivariable MR (MVMR) were performed using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Univariable MR assessed the effect of CP on BC, while MVMR adjusted for body mass index (BMI). The inverse variance-weighted method was used as the primary method.

Results

Univariable MR found a strong genetic link between stomach/abdominal pain and overall BC risk (OR 3.411, 95% CI 1.029–11.313, P = 0.045). Neck/shoulder pain was associated with Luminal_A breast cancer risk (OR 1.999, 95% CI 1.263–3.163, P = 0.003). Multivariable MR, adjusting for BMI, confirmed these findings for stomach/abdominal pain to overall BC (OR 4.39, 95% CI 1.48–13.06, P = 0.008) and neck/shoulder pain to Luminal_A BC (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.24–4.87, P = 0.010). No associations were found for other pain types (headache, hip pain, back pain, knee pain, facial pain) with BC subtypes.

Conclusion

Genetic evidence in this study suggests a causal link between stomach/abdominal pain and overall BC, and between neck/shoulder pain and Luminal-A BC risk in Europeans. Determining the cause of this discrepancy might shed light on the complicated link between breast cancer etiology and chronic pain genetics, emphasizing the need for further investigations and potential clinical applications to enhance breast cancer prevention and management.

### Anti-obesity medication protocols toolkit [^1127pL2f]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Anti-Obesity Medication Protocols Toolkit — Semaglutide safety counseling states that blood sugar "may be low after taking semaglutide", and if patients are taking insulin "the medical team may need to change your dose when you start semaglutide". Signs of low blood sugar include feeling lightheaded, shaky, hungry, weak, anxious, confused, or sweaty, and patients are advised, "If you notice these signs, please have something to eat or drink and give us a call so we can think together about next steps". Pancreatitis "has been rarely associated with semaglutide"; symptoms include pain in the upper stomach area that may travel to the back and be worse after eating, stomach tenderness, and vomiting, nausea and/or fever, with the directive "If you develop any of these symptoms, stop the semaglutide and contact your doctor. They will do a blood test to check for pancreatitis". The page notes "Semaglutide has been associated with thyroid cancer in animal studies", and specifies, "You should not use semaglutide if: You have a history of certain types of thyroid cancers or You have a family history of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndrome", and to "Notify your doctor if you develop a lump on your neck, hoarseness (unusual change in your voice), difficulty swallowing or breathing".

Results

Mendelian Randomization Analysis

Overview of the results

Summary information on the SNPs used as genetic instruments are shown in. Independent SNPs linked with back pain, headache, and knee pain were set at a P -value < 5×10 −8, and others were set at a P -value < 5×10 −6. A clumping strategy with a threshold of r 2 < 0.001 and kb = 10,000 was used to reduce linkage disequilibrium (LD). The F statistics of all identified SNPs were more than 10. Following a series of quality control measures, 23 SNPs with back pain, 19 SNPs with face pain, 58 SNPs with headache, 51 SNPs with hip pain, 11 SNPs with knee pain, 74 SNPs with neck/shoulder pain, and 38 SNPs with stomach/abdominal pain were classified as IVs. The causal relationships between 7 exposures and 6 outcomes were analyzed using Mendelian randomization. More specific results from the univariable MR analyses are summarized in Figures 3, 4 and Tables 2, 3; multivariable MR analysis is summarized in Figure 5. The results of sensitivity analyses are shown in Figures 6 and 7. All MR analysis results are shown in. Detailed information on each SNP is provided in.

### Association of chronic musculoskeletal pain with mortality among UK adults: a population-based cohort study with mediation analysis [^116MqPHT]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Exposure

As our study focused on musculoskeletal pain given it is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Musculoskeletal pain was defined using the options in the UK Biobank touchscreen questionnaire (Category 100,048) which includes headache, facial pain, neck or shoulder pain, back pain, stomach or abdominal pain, hip pain, knee pain and pain all over the body. Headache, facial pain, pain all over the body, and stomach or abdominal pain were not included in defining the exposure as there was insufficient evidence these were related to musculoskeletal conditions and were therefore beyond the scope of this study. Thus, chronic musculoskeletal pain was defined by responses of participants to two questions: 1. "In the last month have you experienced any of the following that interfered with your usual activities?"; 2. "Have you had neck or shoulder pains/back pains/hip pains/knee pains for more than 3 months?". Participants who answered yes to both questions were defined as participants who had chronic musculoskeletal pain. Considering the co-occurrence of chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, we have divided the exposure into two parts: 1. type of pain for those with one pain site as: neck or shoulder pain only, back pain only, hip pain only and knee pain only; 2. number of pain sites as: one, two, three, or four pain sites. As question 2 follows question 1, the comparison group was composed by those who answered 'none of the above' to question 1. This is because if participants indicated they did not experience back pain in the last month that interfered with their usual activities (question 1), they would not be asked question 2: "Have you had back pains for more than 3 months?".

### A vagus nerve dominant tetra-synaptic ascending pathway for gastric pain processing [^116uWM8J]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Gastric pain is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal symptom with a complex etiology. Functional dyspepsia, gastric ulcers, gastric cancer, and gastroparesis are associated with painful sensations in the stomach –. Patients with gastric pain have impaired food intake, leading to weight loss and low quality of life. Traditionally, it has been suggested that the occurrence of gastric pain is associated with abnormal gastric dynamics, visceral hypersensitivity, and psychosomatic factors, but the specific pathogenesis remains unclear, and there is a lack of specific therapies in the clinic. In recent years, research on visceral pain has made significant strides –. However, studies on gastric pain predominantly focus on the peripheral nervous system, with limited investigation into central nervous system mechanisms. There is a pressing clinical need for the development of novel, specific therapeutic approaches targeting gastric pain. Early studies have provided preliminary mappings of brain nuclei anatomically connected to the stomach. However, which nuclei can respond to gastric pain stimuli and how they form neural circuits to transmit gastric pain signals remain unclear.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^115LQ9z7]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

In terms of uncontrolled studies, in an open-label study of 59 patients refractory to first-line treatment, early satiation and half gastric emptying time improved with the 5-HT 1A agonist buspirone, and postprandial fullness with amitriptyline. Acotiamide in combination with a PPI improved otherwise refractory symptoms in an open-label study in 23 patients. Hypnotherapy also appears promising in refractory FD. A TCA in conjunction with a gut–brain behavioural therapy or psychiatric input may be considered in patients not responding to single modality treatment. For refractory pain in severe EPS, a combination of gut–brain neuromodulators, termed augmentation, might be considered. However, clinicians should be aware of the risk of serotonin syndrome with combined use of an SSRI and an SNRI; the risk of this is much lower with combinations involving a low dose TCA.

### CNS or classic drugs for the treatment of pain in functional dyspepsia? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature [^116X8Vs3]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Recent evidence has suggested that pain in functional dyspepsia (FD) is associated with nervous system dysfunction; indicating that therapies aimed at nervous system modulation might be associated with pain relief in FD.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the efficacy of drugs targeting the central nervous system (antidepressants and antianxiety agents - referred as "CNS drugs") and drugs targeting gastric modulation (antisecretory and prokinetic - referred as "classic drugs") for the treatment of pain in FD and, in an exploratory way, compare these 2 modalities of treatment.

Methods

MEDLINE and reference lists were examined for relevant articles. We included prospective studies that evaluated the effects of either CNS drugs or classic drugs (subdivided in prokinetic and antisecretory drugs) on the symptoms of FD.

Results

Seven studies for CNS drugs and 11 studies for gastric drugs met our inclusion criteria. The analyses of these drugs showed that the 2 groups of drugs are associated with a significant reduction in dyspeptic symptoms. The pooled effect size (standardized mean difference between pre-treatment versus post-treatment means) from the random effects model was 1.25 (95% C. I., 0.83, 1.67) for CNS; 1.63 (95% C. I., 1.28, 1.97) for prokinetic, and 0.93 (95% C. I., 0.57, 1.29) for antisecretory drugs. The exploratory comparison between classes of drugs revealed no significant difference in dyspeptic symptoms reduction between CNS and prokinetic drugs; however CNS drugs were associated with a larger reduction in symptoms as compared with antisecretory drugs.

Conclusions

The results show that both CNS and classic drugs are associated with a significant pain reduction in functional dyspepsia.

### Pain and moderate to vigorous physical activity in adolescence: an international population-based survey [^111VH3YL]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether individual types of pain (headache, stomach-ache, and backache) or multiple pains affect the odds of young people achieving the recommended 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day in a large representative sample.

Design

Multicenter cross-sectional survey.

Setting

Twenty-eight countries across Europe and North America.

Subjects

Adolescents (N = 242,103).

Methods

An analysis of data collected in two waves (2001/02 and 2005/06) of the health behavior in school-aged children (HBSC) study was performed. Survey questions included the HBSC symptoms checklist and the amount of regular physical activity. Multilevel logistic regression was used to account for clustering effect of MVPA within countries. Models investigated the relationship between pain and physical activity, adjusted for the HBSC study year. Six models were conducted separately for gender and age-group (11, 13, and 15 years) strata.

Results

In general, the presence of pain was associated with reduced physical activity. Headache alone was associated with reduced physical activity in all six strata (odd ratios 0.77–0.84), stomach-ache alone in five strata (0.77–0.92), and backache alone in four strata (0.86–0.96). In 11- and 13-year-old girls, headache, stomach-ache, and backache, individually and in combination, were associated with decreased odds of being physically active (odds ratios ranging from 0.73 to 0.91). Within the other four age and gender strata, the relationship was less consistent.

Conclusion

Pain is associated with reduced physical activity in adolescents but this association varies according to gender, age, and the type of pain experienced.

Gastric point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) during labor with epidural analgesia — prospective cohorts documented frequent 'full stomach' states around neuraxial placement and delivery, defined by cross-sectional area (CSA) cut-offs, with reported fasting times: "Bataille et al27 and Vial et al41 presented prospective cohorts of 58 and 100 spontaneous laboring parturients under epidural analgesia, respectively. Both cohorts used similar CSA cut-off values for an empty stomach (320 and 381 mm2). They observed a 'full stomach' around epidural insertion time and at full dilatation or immediately after delivery in 50% and 13% (Bataille et al27), or 65% and 48% (Vial et al41). Median fasting times were 6 and 14 hours for clear fluids and solids and 3 and almost 5 hours, respectively".

### Vagal stomach afferents inhibit somatic pain perception [^111a5LTD]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

Vagal stimulation inhibits systemic pain perception in animals, probably via the nucleus tractus solitarius and its connections with descending nuclei in the brainstem which inhibit pain. Pain-inhibiting effects of such stimulation in humans, obtained from epileptic patients treated by vagal stimulation, are controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether vagal stomach afferent activation inhibits pain perception in healthy humans. Pain thresholds, magnitude of tonic heat pain at 46 degrees C stimulation, pain temporal summation and laser pain evoked potentials were measured at the hand before and immediately after rapid drinking of 1500 mL water in 31 volunteers. We found an increase in heat pain threshold from 43.3 ± 2.6 to 44.7 ± 2.2 degrees C, P < 0.0001, a decrease of peak pain magnitude to tonic heat from 56.3 ± 26.2 to 43.7 ± 25.8 (on 0–100 VAS), P < 0.0001, a lowering of area under the curve during tonic noxious heat stimulus from 1962 ± 984 to 1411 ± 934, P < 0.001. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the peak to peak evoked potential amplitude from 19.2 microV ± 1.2 to 15.6 microV ± 1.2 (P = 0.005) together with a decrease in the estimation of mean laser induced pain from 52.28 ± 18.00 to 48.14 ± 20.18 (P = 0.025). Mechanical pain thresholds and temporal summation did not change significantly. We conclude that vagal stomach afferents exert an inhibitory effect on somatic pain perception in humans.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Concerta) [^113uB4dN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to treating patients with CONCERTA, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating CONCERTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage

CONCERTA should be administered orally once daily in the morning with or without food.

CONCERTA must be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids, and must not be chewed, divided, or crushed [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

2.3 Patients New to Methylphenidate

The recommended starting dose of CONCERTA for patients who are not currently taking methylphenidate or stimulants other than methylphenidate is 18 mg once daily for children and adolescents and 18 or 36 mg once daily for adults (see Table 1).

2.4 Patients Currently Using Methylphenidate

The recommended dose of CONCERTA for patients who are currently taking methylphenidate twice daily or three times daily at doses of 10 to 60 mg/day is provided in Table 2. Dosing recommendations are based on current dose regimen and clinical judgment. Conversion dosage should not exceed 72 mg daily.

Other methylphenidate regimens: Clinical judgment should be used when selecting the starting dose.

2.5 Dose Titration

Doses may be increased in 18 mg increments at weekly intervals for patients who have not achieved an optimal response at a lower dose. Daily dosages above 54 mg in children and 72 mg in adolescents have not been studied and are not recommended. Daily dosages above 72 mg in adults are not recommended.

A 27 mg dosage strength is available for physicians who wish to prescribe between the 18 mg and 36 mg dosages.

2.6 Dosage Reduction and Discontinuation

If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse reactions occur, reduce dosage or, if necessary, discontinue CONCERTA.

If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, discontinue CONCERTA.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Concerta) [^1128mN3Y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common adverse reaction in double-blind clinical trials (> 5%) in pediatric patients (children and adolescents) was abdominal pain upper. The most common adverse reactions in double-blind clinical trials (> 5%) in adult patients were decreased appetite, headache, dry mouth, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, weight decreased, irritability, and hyperhidrosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The most common adverse reactions associated with discontinuation (≥ 1%) from either pediatric or adult clinical trials were anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and blood pressure increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

The development program for CONCERTA included exposures in a total of 3906 participants in clinical trials. Children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD were evaluated in 6 controlled clinical studies and 11 open-label clinical studies (see Table 3). Safety was assessed by collecting adverse events, vital signs, weights, and ECGs, and by performing physical examinations and laboratory analyses.

Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. Consequently, to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology.

The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

Throughout this section, adverse reactions are reported. Adverse reactions are adverse events that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of CONCERTA based on the comprehensive assessment of the available adverse event information. A causal association for CONCERTA often cannot be reliably established in individual cases. Further, because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity.

Summary of the current evidence

PPI therapy in both uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia (FD) is widespread. Indeed, these drugs represent a key component of all the currently employed H. pylori eradication regimens. The search for and eradication of the infection is the first line therapy in the young dyspeptic patient without alarm symptoms. In those patients with persisting symptoms despite successful eradication or naïve-uninfected patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), short-term 4–8 week PPI treatment should be attempted. Finally, PPI co-therapy is indicated in patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, also with the aim of preventing GI events.

Dyspepsia is a common GI condition seen in clinical practice. It is not a single disease, but rather a complex of symptoms referable to the upper GI tract that often overlaps with other disease entities. In front of a patient with dyspeptic complaints, physicians should carefully evaluate the history and perform a physical examination in order to assume that symptoms arise from the upper GI tract. If the patient is young (< 45 years), and there are no alarm symptoms, endoscopy and/or functional investigations are usually not performed, the condition is labeled as "uninvestigated" dyspepsia and treatment is empiric. On the contrary, if endoscopy does reveal a structural abnormality, management of dyspepsia relies on treatment of the underlying disease (e.g. PU, reflux esophagitis, or malignancy). When endoscopy is negative (which is the case in more than 70% of patients with dyspeptic symptoms), FD could be considered and, provided Rome IV criteria are fulfilled, the final diagnosis can be confirmed.

FD is characterized by a continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen for which no organic cause can be determined. According to the most updated Rome IV classification, dyspepsia is subdivided into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS, including fullness, early satiety, nausea) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS, including epigastric pain or epigastric burning). However, symptom overlap with either GERD or irritable bowel syndrome is not infrequent.

FD is widely prevalent in the general population − up to 15% in Italy − so that FD patients are frequently managed in clinical practice by both general practitioners and gastroenterologists. Since the etiology of FD remains unclear and is probably heterogeneous, no definite single treatment is currently available for these patients. Indeed, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

Educate patients and their families about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction of CONCERTA, which can lead to overdose and death, and proper disposal of any unused drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2), Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients to store CONCERTA in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give CONCERTA to anyone else.

Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Advise patients that there are potential risks to patients with serious cardiac disease, including sudden death, with CONCERTA use. Instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if they develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

Advise patients that CONCERTA can cause elevations in blood pressure and heart rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Psychiatric Risks

Advise patients that CONCERTA, at recommended doses, can cause psychotic or manic symptoms, even in patients without a prior history of psychotic symptoms or mania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Priapism

Advise patients, caregivers, and family members of the possibility of painful or prolonged penile erections (priapism). Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical attention in the event of priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Circulation Problems in Fingers and Toes [Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon]

Instruct patients beginning treatment with CONCERTA about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change color from pale, to blue, to red.

Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes.

Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking CONCERTA.

Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.

### Genetic correlations between pain phenotypes and depression and neuroticism [^1177Kpw8]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Depression and eight pain phenotypes

For depressive symptoms, all pain phenotypes had significant and positive genetic correlations with depression except hip pain and knee pain. The largest genetic correlation occurred with pain all over the body (rg = 0.69, P = 1.4 × 10 −27), followed by stomach or abdominal pain (rg = 0.67, P = 5.7 × 10 −7). For hip pain and knee pain, although there were positive genetic correlations with depressive symptoms (rg = 0.34 and 0.12, correspondingly), the associations did not survive Bonferroni correction (P = 0.03 and 0.13, correspondingly). The values of the genetic correlations between other pain phenotypes and depressive symptoms were between rg = 0.33 and 0.55, and all were statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing.

For major depressive disorder, the genetic correlation results were similar to those for depressive symptoms. The largest genetic correlation was with stomach or abdominal pain (rg = 0.53, P = 0.0005), followed by pain all over the body (rg = 0.43, P = 5.6 × 10 −6). However, the rg values of hip pain and knee pain were 0.04 and −0.07, which were also statistically insignificant (P = 0.80 and 0.53, correspondingly). The values of the genetic correlations between other pain phenotypes and major depressive disorder were between rg = 0.34 and 0.40, and all were statistically significant.

Neuroticism and eight pain phenotypes

With neuroticism, stomach or abdominal pain had the largest genetic correlation (rg = 0.70, P = 2.4 × 10 −9). Headache followed next with rg = 0.50 and P = 2.2 × 10 −72. All genetic correlations with other pain phenotypes (except hip pain and knee pain) were positive and significant with rg values between 0.30 and 0.50. For hip pain and knee pain, although there were positive genetic correlations with neuroticism, the correlations were statistically insignificant.

### Therapeutic options in nonulcer dyspepsia [^116RuNxQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia, defined as pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen, affects an estimated 25% of the U.S. population each year; accounts for up to 5% of all visits to primary care physicians, and generates over $1.3 billion in prescription drug costs annually. In the majority of patients evaluated, no clear cause of symptoms can be identified, and the condition is termed functional or nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). The pathophysiology of NUD remains unclear, but disturbances in gastrointestinal motility or sensation are often found. Clinically, NUD can be subdivided into dysmotility-like (in which discomfort, fullness, bloating, early satiety, or nausea [but not pain] predominate) or ulcer-like (in which epigastric pain is predominant). In ulcer-like NUD, antisecretory therapy is useful, but in dysmotility-like NUD, acid suppression is not superior to placebo. Cisapride accelerates gastric emptying and enhances gastric accommodation but probably does not blunt perception. Although cisapride relieves symptoms of dyspepsia without the adverse central nervous system effects often associated with metoclopramide, its cardiac toxicity has led to disuse. Antidepressants are of uncertain efficacy but are widely used. New prokinetics and other enteric neuromodulating agents are being tested in NUD and are likely to find an important place in clinical practice in the future.

### Perspectives of people living with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a qualitative and quantitative study [^115U2RZG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects associated with antifibrotic treatment

Similar percents of participants taking pirfenidone (87%, Fig. 4 a) and nintedanib (92%, Fig. 4 b) reported at least one side effect from a list derived from qualitative interviews. Side effects varied in terms of the perceived burden experienced by participants. For example, 50% of participants taking pirfenidone reported fatigue as a symptom, and more than half of those participants (53%) reported it as very burdensome. On the other hand, 42% of participants on nintedanib reported stomach pain/discomfort as a symptom, while only 13% of those participants viewed it as very burdensome. When presented with a set of statements about the perceptions of their antifibrotic medications, 23% of participants taking pirfenidone and 53% of participants taking nintedanib agreed with a statement that they struggle to manage the side effects of their antifibrotic. 30% of participants taking pirfenidone and 55% of participants taking nintedanib agreed that the side effects of their antifibrotic significantly impacted their quality of life.

### Is esophagoscopy alone sufficient for patients with reflux symptoms? [^113Z5Boo]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Unsedated esophagoscopy with ultrathin endoscopes is a valuable screening modality for Barrett's esophagus, but the stomach and the duodenum cannot be examined completely with the smallest and best tolerated of these endoscopes. There are no data as to how often disease in the stomach and the duodenum would be missed when using this screening strategy. Our hypothesis is that patients with reflux symptoms, in the absence of daily abdominal pain, nausea, or history of ulcer, were unlikely to have clinically significant gastroduodenal disease.

Methods

Patients scheduled for upper endoscopy at a single outpatient endoscopy unit in a tertiary referral center were screened. The inclusion criterion was reflux symptoms as the primary indication for upper endoscopy. Patients with another valid indication were excluded. A detailed history was recorded and symptom questionnaire completed for each patient before endoscopy; these data were compared with the endoscopy findings.

Results

A total of 175 patients were included. Indications for upper endoscopy were the following: worsening symptoms (n = 74), ongoing reflux despite therapy (n = 27), and long-standing reflux (n = 74). Major esophageal findings were discovered in 95 patients. In 10 patients, major gastric or duodenal findings were detected as follows: erosive gastritis (n = 8), gastric ulcer (n = 2), duodenal ulcer (n = 2), erosive duodenitis (n = 2), and duodenal polyp (n = 1). Daily abdominal pain (p = 0.014) or possibly daily nausea (p = 0.028 unadjusted, 0.197 adjusted) was associated with major gastric/duodenal disease. Patients without daily abdominal pain, nausea, or a history of gastric/duodenal ulcer were much less likely to have major disease (0.9%) than patients with one of these predictors (13.2%, p = 0.00097).

Conclusions

Daily abdominal pain and nausea, in combination with a history of ulcer disease, are strong predictors of major gastric or duodenal disease. Patients with reflux without these predictors are highly unlikely to have a major disease involving the stomach or duodenum, and are suitable candidates for esophagoscopy alone.

### Trajectories of pain in adolescents: a prospective cohort study [^112mK2dB]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

6 Discussion

We have uncovered groups of adolescents with different trajectories of change over time for back pain, facial pain, headache and stomach pain. Overall, trajectories identified at the different pain sites were similar, and four cluster solutions with similar patterns were optimal for facial pain, headache and stomach pain. Half of the adolescents included had low probability of frequent pain at all four pain sites throughout the 3-year follow-up period, identified by 'no pain problem' trajectories. However, 44% had a 'painful' trajectory for at least one pain condition, and headache, back pain and stomach pain were common, with over 20% of subjects in a 'painful' trajectory. Headache was the most common site, with a quarter of the sample being classified into one of the 'painful' trajectories, and facial pain was the least common (10%). These figures mirror previous work, which suggests that rates of facial pain are low before 14 years whereas headache, abdominal pain and back pain are more common. The current study adds to evidence from prevalence studies which measure occurrence a single time, as it highlights a substantial proportion of adolescents with fair probability of pain between the ages of 11 and 14 years. However, only a small proportion of subjects were identified with a 'persistent pain' trajectory: 1–5% of the total depending on the pain site. Although this is a small proportion for each condition, across the four pain sites, 12% of the sample had a 'persistent pain' trajectory for at least one condition. This group was predominantly female, with the highest levels of somatization and depression at the start and end of the study period, and were the least likely to be satisfied with their life. This group represents a substantial proportion of the general adolescent population, but has never been specifically identified before.

### Association between chronic pain and risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity: a prospective cohort study [^115GgbLJ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although chronic pain was deleteriously related to single cardiometabolic diseases, the relationship between chronic pain and cardiometabolic multimorbidity remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between chronic pain with the risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity.

Methods

A prospective cohort study included 452818 participants who were free of cardiometabolic multimorbidity at baseline. Chronic pain was assessed in diverse anatomical sites including the head, face, neck/shoulder, stomach/abdominal area, back, hip and knee or 'all over the body'. Participants were classified into six groups according to the amount of chronic pain sites: no chronic pain, chronic pain at one, two, three and four or more sites, and those reporting pain 'all over the body'. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was defined as the occurrence of at least two cardiometabolic diseases, involving type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and stroke.

Results

After a median follow-up of 13.7 years, 4445 participants developed cardiometabolic multimorbidity. Compared with individuals without chronic pain, those experiencing chronic pain in four or more sites were associated with a 1.82-fold (HR: 1.82, 95%CI: 1.61, 2.06) higher risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity. Pain distributed 'all over the body' was associated with a 59% (HR: 1.59, 95%CI: 1.30, 1.93) increased risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity Additionally, individuals who had chronic pain in both the head and stomach/abdomen showed the highest risk with cardiometabolic multimorbidity (HR: 1.88, 95%CI: 1.60, 2.20).

Conclusions

Our findings suggested that there was an elevated risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity associated with an increased amount of chronic pain sites.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Concerta) [^116UTQ4z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9.1 Controlled Substance

CONCERTA contains methylphenidate, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

CONCERTA has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. CONCERTA can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of methylphenidate may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including CONCERTA, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.
