## Question

How quickly does DBS (deep brain stimulation) cure melanoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how quickly deep brain stimulation would cure melanoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what DBS is actually indicated for and whether any oncologic use exists. Then, I should verify current, guideline-based treatments for melanoma across stages, including the approach to brain metastases. Next, I will check for any epidemiologic or mechanistic links between Parkinson disease, dopaminergic therapy, DBS, and melanoma that might be causing confusion. Finally, I will address the "how quickly" part by comparing time-to-response for melanoma therapies and clarifying the irrelevance of DBS to melanoma outcomes, all while aligning with high-quality guidelines and reviews.

> Let me first confirm the scope of DBS. Deep brain stimulation is a neurosurgical therapy for select neurologic disorders, most robustly for Parkinson's disease motor complications, with established efficacy in randomized trials and consensus guidelines; it modulates dysfunctional basal ganglia–thalamocortical circuits and is not designed to eradicate malignant cells, and no oncology indication exists for DBS in melanoma or other cancers [^113fDcXm] [^114mznpE] [^113BcsLk].

> I need to check the standard of care for melanoma itself. For localized disease, wide local excision with appropriate margins is foundational; for advanced disease, systemic therapy relies on immune checkpoint inhibitors and, when appropriate, BRAF/MEK–targeted combinations, while in the setting of brain metastases, modern guidelines favor ipilimumab–nivolumab for asymptomatic patients and consider BRAF/MEK therapy for BRAF V600–mutant disease, often integrating stereotactic radiosurgery with close MRI surveillance; none of these pathways includes DBS [^113BcsLk] [^114YEQMt] [^116Ha2Ei] [^111vkmMG] [^113q7voB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any DBS–melanoma "link". What is documented is an increased risk of melanoma among people with Parkinson's disease; I should confirm whether this relates to the disease biology or to dopaminergic therapy. FDA labeling for carbidopa and tolcapone notes a roughly 2– to 6–fold elevated melanoma risk in PD with uncertainty about causality, and contemporary PD cohorts similarly observed higher-than-expected melanoma incidence; none of this implies DBS treats melanoma, but it does underscore the need for regular dermatologic screening in PD patients, including those with DBS [^115Xa8DN] [^115JzxHK] [^114NzL95] [^11687kCX].

> I will now examine why DBS cannot "cure" melanoma from a mechanistic standpoint. DBS delivers focal electrical stimulation to brain nuclei to normalize neural network activity; melanoma requires oncologic control via surgical eradication, immune-mediated tumor regression, or targeted inhibition of oncogenic signaling, and guidelines that govern melanoma therapy do not include neuromodulation of the brain as a treatment modality, which makes sense given the absence of any plausible anti-neoplastic mechanism for DBS in cutaneous or metastatic melanoma [^113JSLFS] [^113BcsLk].

> But wait, what about the "how quickly" part of the question? Since DBS does not treat melanoma, speed of effect is moot for cancer control; however, to anchor expectations, surgical excision achieves immediate local control when margins are adequate, targeted therapy in BRAF-mutant melanoma often yields clinical and radiographic responses within weeks, and immune checkpoint blockade responses are typically assessed over weeks to months, while stereotactic radiosurgery achieves local control over ensuing months with survival now meaningfully extended when combined with effective systemic therapy; by contrast, DBS's motor benefits in PD are often appreciable within days to weeks after activation and programming, but that timing is neurologic and unrelated to oncologic outcomes [^116Ha2Ei] [^113q7voB] [^113E5SfQ] [^114mznpE].

> Wait, let me verify practical considerations when melanoma care intersects with implanted DBS systems. If a patient with a DBS requires oncologic surgery or radiation, multidisciplinary planning can safely navigate device considerations; case reports and practice principles show that cranial irradiation, including whole-brain techniques, and extracranial chest-wall radiation can be delivered with precautions to minimize device dose and avoid malfunction, and dermatologic procedures such as Mohs surgery can proceed with measures to reduce electromagnetic interference, which supports coordination rather than avoidance of standard melanoma care in DBS patients [^113YjpEM] [^116w5Nen] [^113DQJiK].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message is explicit and guideline-concordant: DBS is not a melanoma therapy and cannot cure melanoma; management should follow melanoma standards, including surgery for localized disease, immunotherapy and targeted therapy for advanced disease, and SRS plus systemic therapy for brain metastases, with treatment selection individualized by stage, mutation status, symptoms, and comorbidities, and with routine dermatologic surveillance in PD populations regardless of DBS status [^113BcsLk] [^114YEQMt] [^111vkmMG] [^115Xa8DN].

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) **does not cure melanoma** [^116Ha2Ei] and is not used to treat it. DBS is a neurosurgical therapy [^113UD2cA] for neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and select psychiatric conditions [^116w5Nen]. There is **no evidence** or clinical rationale for DBS in melanoma [^113q7voB]; it has no effect on tumor growth, metastasis, or survival. Melanoma is managed with **surgery, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation** [^111vkmMG] — not DBS [^113BcsLk].

### Deep brain stimulation: Current challenges and future directions [^113UD2cA]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The clinical use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is among the most important advances in the clinical neurosciences in the past two decades. As a surgical tool, DBS can directly measure pathological brain activity and deliver adjustable stimulation for therapeutic effect in neurological and psychiatric disorders correlated with dysfunctional circuitry. The development of DBS has opened new opportunities to access and interrogate malfunctioning brain circuits and to test the therapeutic potential of regulating the output of these circuits across a broad range of disorders.

Despite the success and rapid adoption of DBS, crucial questions remain, including which brain areas should be targeted and in which patients. This review considers how DBS has facilitated advances in our understanding of how circuit malfunction can lead to brain disorders. It also outlines the key unmet challenges and future directions in the DBS field. Determining the next steps in DBS science will help define the future role of this technology in the development of novel therapeutics for the most challenging disorders affecting the human brain.

### Case report: Adjuvant breast cancer radiation therapy in a patient with an implanted deep brain stimulation device [^116w5Nen]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to treat movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. The system consists of one or more electrode leads implanted in the brain and a wire or extension connected to an implanted pulse generator (IPG). The IPG is a battery-powered neurostimulator placed subcutaneously, typically just inferior to the clavicle. Unlike pacemakers and defibrillators, there are few publications in the literature reporting the effects of irradiating DBS systems.

- **Manufacturer's recommendation**: Shield the device from direct radiation. However, this presents difficulty when the target to be treated is adjacent to the device. Borkenhagen et al. reported a case in which a patient received treatment to a target in the left lung that was within 3 mm of the device. Other authors have reported cases in which the electrode leads received a full dose and the IPG received a low dose due to scatter.

In this report, we present a case of a patient undergoing radiation therapy to her left chest wall and supraclavicular region with an implanted DBS within the target volume.

### Neuropsychological changes following deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson's disease: Comparisons of treatment at pallidal and subthalamic targets versus best medical therapy [^116ReLV2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), but questions remain regarding neuropsychological decrements sometimes associated with this treatment, including rates of statistically and clinically meaningful change, and whether there are differences in outcome related to the surgical target.

- **Methods**: Neuropsychological functioning was assessed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) at baseline and after 6 months in a prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing best medical therapy (BMT, n = 116) and bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS, n = 164) at either the subthalamic nucleus (STN, n = 84) or globus pallidus interna (GPi, n = 80), using standardized neuropsychological tests. Measures of functional outcomes were also administered.

- **Results**: Comparison of the two DBS targets revealed few significant group differences. STN DBS was associated with greater mean reductions on some measures of processing speed, only one of which was statistically significant in comparison with stimulation of GPi. GPi DBS was associated with lower mean performance on one measure of learning and memory that requires mental control and cognitive flexibility. Compared to the group receiving BMT, the combined DBS group had significantly greater mean reductions at 6-month follow-up in performance on multiple measures of processing speed and working memory. After calculating thresholds for statistically reliable change from data obtained from the BMT group, the combined DBS group also displayed higher rates of decline in neuropsychological test performance.

### Comparison of direct cortical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation in brain tumor surgery: Systematic review and meta analyses [^1121bJ2R]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Brain malignancy and central nervous system malignancy are two of the most challenging problems in oncology. Brain tumors located near or within eloquent areas can present additional challenges for neurosurgeons during treatment. Electrical stimulation, whether direct or through other methods, can be essential for mapping the eloquent areas, thus guiding proper resection. Minimal resection should ideally preserve patient neurological function and maintain quality of life.

- **Methods**: This research is a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at comparing outcomes, primarily adverse event analysis, between direct cortical stimulation (DCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

- **Results**: Fourteen studies from the interval between 2010 and 2023 were identified. While this number is sufficient, most studies were not randomized and lacked blinding. A meta-analysis was conducted as a hypothesis test, indicating that TMS is not inferior to DCS in terms of motoric and lingual outcomes, as shown subjectively by diamond location and objectively through a p-value above 0.05.

- **Conclusion**: TMS is a noninvasive imaging method for evaluating eloquent brain areas and is not inferior to the invasive gold-standard imaging method, DCS. However, its role as an adjuvant to DCS and as an alternative when awake surgery is not available must be emphasized.

### Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation evokes resonant neural activity [^114nxGfm]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a rapidly expanding treatment for neurological and psychiatric conditions; however, a target-specific biomarker is required to optimize therapy. Here, we show that DBS evokes a large-amplitude resonant neural response focally in the subthalamic nucleus. This response is greatest in the dorsal region (the clinically optimal stimulation target for Parkinson's disease), coincides with improved clinical performance, is chronically recordable, and is present under general anesthesia. These features make it a readily utilizable electrophysiological signal that could potentially be used for guiding electrode implantation surgery and tailoring DBS therapy to improve patient outcomes.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease: Executive summary [^112sJgge]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: Is bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) more, less, or as effective as bilateral globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation (GPi DBS) in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, as measured by improvements in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (UPDRS-III) scores?

	**Recommendation**: Given that bilateral STN DBS is at least as effective as bilateral GPi DBS in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (as measured by improvements in UPDRS-III scores), consideration can be given to the selection of either target in patients undergoing surgery to treat motor symptoms (Level I).

- **Question 2**: Is bilateral STN DBS more, less, or as effective as bilateral GPi DBS in allowing reduction of dopaminergic medication in Parkinson's disease?

	**Recommendation**: When the main goal of surgery is the reduction of dopaminergic medications in a patient with Parkinson's disease, then bilateral STN DBS should be performed instead of GPi DBS (Level I).

- **Question 3**: Is bilateral STN DBS more, less, or as effective as bilateral GPi DBS in treating dyskinesias associated with Parkinson's disease?

	**Recommendation**: There is insufficient evidence to make a generalizable recommendation regarding the target selection for reduction of dyskinesias. However, when the reduction of medication is not anticipated and there is a goal to reduce the severity of "on" medication dyskinesias, the GPi should be targeted (Level I).

### Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM): Decoding MRI data for a tissue magnetic biomarker [^111K16XK]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can improve visualization of the target in deep brain stimulation (DBS), which involves the surgical implementation of stimulating electrodes in the subthalamic nuclei (STN) or the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The anatomical accuracy of electrode lead placement is critical for a successful surgical outcome. Intraoperative CT, typically used to guide DBS, has poor contrast for the basal ganglia structures. MRI provides better tissue contrast than CT; however, the visualization contrast for STN and GPi remains poor in standard T2-weighted imaging. As a result, high field MRI using T2✱w imaging has been sought for DBS.

QSM can be used to remove the blurring present in T2✱w imaging and improve the contrast-to-noise ratio for the visualization of the STN. In the accompanying figure, quantitative susceptibility mapping is shown for visualizing deep brain stimulation targets. The globus pallidus interna (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), surgical targets for deep brain stimulation, are either invisible or inseparable from surrounding tissues on T2W images (with zoom) but are clearly visualized on QSM (with zoom). Other basal ganglia structures well-defined on QSM include the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) and substantia nigra (SN).

### The cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in combination with best medical therapy, versus best medical therapy alone, in advanced Parkinson's disease [^1164AR1X]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex progressive movement disorder that leads to motor and non-motor symptoms, which become increasingly debilitating as the disease advances, considerably reducing quality of life. Advanced treatment options include deep brain stimulation (DBS). While the clinical effectiveness of DBS has been demonstrated in a number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), evidence on cost-effectiveness is limited. The cost-effectiveness of DBS combined with best medical therapy (BMT), versus BMT alone, was evaluated from a UK payer perspective.

Individual patient-level data on the effect of DBS on PD symptom progression from a large 6-month RCT were used to develop a Markov model representing clinical progression and capturing treatment effect and costs. A 5-year time horizon was used, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), with uncertainty assessed in deterministic sensitivity analyses. Total discounted costs in the DBS and BMT groups over 5 years were £68,970 and £48,243, respectively, with QALYs of 2.21 and 1.21, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £20,678 per QALY gained.

Utility weights in each health state and costs of ongoing medication appear to be the key drivers of uncertainty in the model. The results suggest that DBS is a cost-effective intervention in patients with advanced PD who are eligible for surgery, providing good value for money to health care payers.

Communicating this level of information is complex and requires experience by a neurologist who has a comprehensive understanding of all therapies, including their advantages, possible disadvantages, and practical problems. It is important to take into account the limited comparative evidence available. Although it can be time-consuming, it is vital to enable patients and caregivers to make an informed decision regarding the most appropriate therapy to meet their specific requirements.

### Patient-reported outcome measures and validation data used in melanoma research and routine practice: A systematic review [^116QvKYP]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used in melanoma research and to guide clinical practice; however, the validation of these PROMs for use in melanoma populations is unknown.

- **Objective**: To conduct a systematic review and construct an evidence gap map to identify PROMs that have been used in melanoma research and clinical practice and related melanoma-specific validation data.

- **Evidence review**: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Index Medicus, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsychINFO were searched in January 2025, including any studies that used a PROM to evaluate outcomes of patients with melanoma published from January 1, 2010, onward, to identify instruments relevant to the era of melanoma diagnosis and treatment.

- **Findings**: Of 30,895 abstracts screened, 136 articles detailing 124 studies were included in this review; a total of 32,784 participants were included. There were 52 cross-sectional studies (41%), 31 randomized clinical trials (25%), 23 longitudinal studies (19%), 8 pre-post studies (6%), 6 cohort studies (5%), 1 retrospective analysis (1%), 1 phase 4 trial (1%), 1 protocol (1%), and 1 quasi-experimental trial (1%). A total of 61 studies (49%) included a melanoma treatment, with immunotherapy being the most common (24 [39%]), followed by surgery (7 [11%]) and chemotherapy (7 [11%]). These 124 studies used 110 unique PROMs, with patient emotional/psychological well-being (28 [25%]), health-related quality of life (21 [19%]), and patient self-functioning, efficacy, and coping strategies (20%).

### Treatment for brain metastases: ASCO-SNO-ASTRO guideline [^113q7voB]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for brain metastasis, more specifically with respect to systemic therapy for melanoma, the ASCO/ASTRO/SNO 2022 guidelines recommend considering offering ipilimumab plus nivolumab to all patients with asymptomatic brain metastases from melanoma, regardless of BRAF status. They suggest offering dabrafenib plus trametinib to patients with asymptomatic brain metastases from melanoma with a BRAF-V600E mutation. Additionally, it is recommended to consider delaying local therapy until there is evidence of intracranial progression if these agents are used.

### Overdiagnosis in malignant melanoma: A scoping review [^112JfGmf]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

We aimed to systematically identify and scrutinize published empirical evidence about overdiagnosis in malignant melanoma and examine how frequent overdiagnosis of melanoma is and whether this is related to different types of interventions or diagnostic technologies.

- **Design and setting**: Empirical studies that discussed overdiagnosis in malignant melanoma were eligible, including qualitative and quantitative studies in any type of population, age group, and geographical location. We excluded studies that did not include empirical data, studies that only mentioned 'overdiagnosis' without addressing it further, and studies that used the term overdiagnosis for cases of misdiagnosis or false positives. We developed the search strategy in cooperation with an information specialist. We searched five databases on 21 April 2022: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. This scoping review adheres to the JBI methodology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts for inclusion and extracted data from the included studies. The data extracted include study characteristics, population details, research question, context, and the study's main results.

- **Results**: Our search resulted in 1134 potentially relevant studies. Thirty-five studies were included: 29 register studies, 3 cohort studies, 1 case-control study, 1 survey study, and 1 randomized controlled trial. Most register studies examined trends in melanoma incidence and/or mortality.

### Malignant melanoma in early-treated Parkinson's disease: the NET-PD trial [^114NzL95]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The risk for malignant melanoma is higher than expected in Parkinson's disease (PD). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Exploratory Trials in PD (NET-PD) Long-term Study 1 (LS-1) trial is a contemporary phase 3 study of subjects with early, treated PD. The objective of this work was to assess the incidence of malignant melanoma in a PD cohort.

- **Methods**: Incident melanoma cases were identified from the adverse events log. The expected number of cases was calculated using the expected incidence rates and the number of person-years.

- **Results**: A total of 618 females and 1119 males were followed for 6452 person-years; 19 new melanoma cases were observed. The expected number was 5.29. The standardized event ratio compared to the general population was 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.2–5.6).

- **Conclusions**: The risk for developing melanoma was higher than expected in the NET-PD LS-1 cohort and was similar to the risk reported in earlier comparable clinical trial cohorts. Dermatologic screening may be useful in Parkinson's disease to identify melanoma at an early stage.

### Significant survival improvements for patients with melanoma brain metastases: Can we reach cure in the current era [^113E5SfQ]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). High credibility.

New therapies for melanoma have been associated with increasing survival expectations, as opposed to the dismal outcomes of only a decade ago. Using a prospective registry, we aimed to define survival goals for melanoma patients with brain metastases (BM), based on state-of-the-art multimodality care.

We reviewed 171 melanoma patients with BM receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) who were followed with point-of-care data collection between 2012 and 2020. Clinical, molecular, and imaging data were collected, including systemic treatment and radiosurgical parameters. The mean age was 63 ± 15 years, with 39% being female, and 29% had BRAF-mutated tumors. Median overall survival after radiosurgery was 15.7 months (95% Confidence Interval 11.4–27.7) and 25 months in patients managed since 2015. Thirty-two patients survived at least 5 years from their initial SRS. BRAF mutation-targeted therapies showed a survival advantage in comparison to chemotherapy (p = 0.009), but not to immunotherapy (p = 0.09). In a multivariable analysis, both immunotherapy and the number of metastases at the first SRS were predictors of long-term survival (5 years) from initial SRS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.018, respectively). Five patients (16%) of the long-term survivors required no active treatment for at least 5 years.

Long-term survival in patients with melanoma BM is achievable in the era of SRS combined with immunotherapies. For those alive at least 5 years after the first SRS, 16% had also been off systemic or local therapies.

### Melanoma brain metastases: An unmet challenge in the era of active therapy [^113pZ4p6]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Metastatic disease to the brain is a frequent manifestation of melanoma and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and poor prognosis. Surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery provide local control but less frequently affect the overall outcome of melanoma brain metastases (MBM). The role of systemic therapies for active brain lesions has been largely underinvestigated, and patients with active brain lesions are excluded from the vast majority of clinical trials.

The advent of active systemic therapy has revolutionized the care of melanoma patients, but this benefit has not been systematically translated into intracranial activity. In this article, we review the biology and clinical outcomes of patients with MBM, and the evidence supporting the use of radiation, surgery, and systemic therapy in MBM. Prospective studies that included patients with active MBM have shown clinical intracranial activity that parallels systemic activity and support the inclusion of patients with active MBM in clinical trials involving novel agents and combination therapies.

### Bilateral deep brain stimulation vs best medical therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson disease: a randomized controlled trial [^114mznpE]. JAMA (2009). High credibility.

Deep brain stimulation is an accepted treatment for advanced Parkinson disease (PD), although there are few randomized trials comparing treatments, and most studies exclude older patients.

- **Objective**: To compare 6-month outcomes for patients with PD who received deep brain stimulation or best medical therapy.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: Randomized controlled trial of patients who received either deep brain stimulation or best medical therapy, stratified by study site and patient age (≥ 70 years) at seven Veterans Affairs and six university hospitals between May 2002 and October 2005. A total of 255 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage ≥ 2 while not taking medications) were enrolled; 25% were aged 70 years or older. The final 6-month follow-up visit occurred in May 2006.

- **Intervention**: Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (n = 60) or globus pallidus (n = 61). Patients receiving best medical therapy (n = 134) were actively managed by movement disorder neurologists.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was time spent in the "on" state (good motor control with unimpeded motor function) without troubling dyskinesia, using motor diaries. Other outcomes included motor function, quality of life, neurocognitive function, and adverse events.

- **Results**: Patients who received deep brain stimulation gained a mean of 4.6 hours per day of on time without troubling dyskinesia compared with 0 hours per day for patients who received best medical therapy (between group mean difference, 4.5 hours per day [95% CI, 3.7–5.4 hours per day]; P < .001). Motor function improved.

### Spinal cord stimulation and deep brain stimulation for disorders of consciousness: a systematic review and individual patient data analysis of 608 cases [^112iQUrY]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). High credibility.

The application of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) for disorders of consciousness (DoC) has been increasingly reported. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine how effective and safe SCS and DBS are for DoC due to various methodological limitations. We conducted a systematic review to elucidate the safety and efficacy of SCS and DBS for DoC by systematically reviewing related literature by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane Library. Twenty eligible studies, with a total of 608 patients, were included in this study.

- **Efficacy of spinal cord stimulation (SCS)**:
	- Ten studies with 508 patients reported the efficacy of SCS for DoC, with an estimated overall effectiveness rate of 37%.
	- Five studies with 343 patients reported the efficacy of SCS for vegetative state (VS), with an estimated effectiveness rate of 30%.
	- Three studies with 53 patients noted the efficacy of SCS for minimally conscious state (MCS), with an estimated effectiveness rate of 63%.

- **Efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS)**:
	- Five studies with 92 patients reported the efficacy of DBS for DoC, with an estimated overall effectiveness rate of 40%.
	- Four studies with 63 patients documented the efficacy of DBS for VS, with an estimated effectiveness rate of 26%.
	- Three studies with 19 patients demonstrated the efficacy of DBS for MCS, with an estimated effectiveness rate of 74%.

The adverse event rate was 8.1% after SCS and 18.2% after DBS. These results suggest that SCS and DBS can be considered reasonable treatments for DoC, displaying considerable efficacy and safety.

### The global burden of melanoma: Results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 [^113xC9Ak]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Regarding national melanoma treatment guidelines, a review article comparing the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand found that the Australian Cancer Network (ACN), responsible for guideline generation in Australia and New Zealand, produced the strictest follow-up recommendations for patients with melanoma of any stage, including the use of ultrasound in the surveillance of lymph node recurrence. While the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) does not issue a consensus on routine melanoma screening, the ACN has recommended against population-based screening. The ACN and NCCN generally share recommendations regarding biopsy and excisions guidelines.

The GBD relies on the premise that estimates based on high-quality analyses and prediction models, while imperfect, are better than no data at all. Estimations for areas lacking cancer data are dependent on covariate selection and regional patterns. This highlights the importance of a global effort to improve vital registration systems and cancer registries. There are a number of limitations to the use of the DALY in regard to melanoma. As mentioned above, because the stage of diagnosis is not incorporated, melanoma DALYs may change with time, as increased early detection leads to a higher proportion of detected melanomas at an early stage. Similarly, with recent progress in advanced melanoma treatment and prognosis, the disability from melanoma is likely to change over time, making temporal DALY comparisons difficult.

A recent report investigated DALYs from melanoma by stage among a large cohort of patients.

### Deep brain stimulation of the internal capsule enhances human cognitive control and prefrontal cortex function [^115NhqCK]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

A popular theory of DBS' mechanism of action suggests that this deep brain intervention acts primarily on the cortex by stimulating cortical projections to the implant site. Our results support this theory, finding oscillatory changes in multiple regions whose thalamic projections traverse the VCVS. The effect is only seen in task-related theta, suggesting that DBS specifically modulates functional ensembles that activate during effortful cognitive control. The correlation between that theta modulation and clinical outcomes suggests a potential physiologically informed approach to psychiatric DBS.

The present practice of adjusting stimulation based on patients' subjective report of immediate mood changes leads to clinician/patient frustration, adverse clinical outcomes, and missed clinical trial endpoints. In future studies, stimulation parameters might directly be titrated to change a theta biomarker, rather than relying on ad hoc clinician opinion. For instance, patients might continuously perform tasks requiring effortful cognitive control, with continuous monitoring of the trial-to-trial induced oscillations. Stimulation parameters such as intensity and location along the dorso-ventral axis of the internal capsule could then be adjusted, either manually by a programming clinician or under computer control.

Next-generation DBS hardware is already capable of self-titrating stimulation to achieve an electrophysiologic response, and we have described early examples of frameworks for this type of task-driven programming. We have also demonstrated methods for f

### Deep brain stimulation: A mechanistic and clinical update [^113ZmnD4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS), the practice of placing electrodes deep into the brain to stimulate subcortical structures with electrical current, has been increasing as a neurosurgical procedure over the past 15 years. Originally a treatment for essential tremor, DBS is now used and under investigation across a wide spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In addition to applying electrical stimulation for clinical symptomatic relief, the electrodes implanted can also be used to record local electrical activity in the brain, making DBS a useful research tool. Human single-neuron recordings and local field potentials are now often recorded intraoperatively as electrodes are implanted. Thus, the increasing scope of DBS clinical applications is being matched by an increase in investigational use, leading to a rapidly evolving understanding of cortical and subcortical neurocircuitry.

In this review, the authors discuss recent innovations in the clinical use of DBS, both in approved indications and in indications under investigation. Deep brain stimulation as an investigational tool is also reviewed, paying special attention to evolving models of basal ganglia and cortical function in health and disease. Finally, the authors look to the future across several indications, highlighting gaps in knowledge and possible future directions of DBS treatment.

### A randomized trial of deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease [^113fDcXm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Neurostimulation of the subthalamic nucleus reduces levodopa-related motor complications in advanced Parkinson's disease. We compared this treatment plus medication with medical management.

- **Methods**: In this randomized-pairs trial, we enrolled 156 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and severe motor symptoms. The primary end points were the changes from baseline to six months in the quality of life, as assessed by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and the severity of symptoms without medication, according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (UPDRS-III).

- **Results**: Pairwise comparisons showed that neurostimulation, as compared with medication alone, caused greater improvements from baseline to six months in the PDQ-39 (50 of 78 pairs, P = 0.02) and the UPDRS-III (55 of 78, P < 0.001), with mean improvements of 9.5 and 19.6 points, respectively. Neurostimulation resulted in improvements of 24 to 38 percent in the PDQ-39 subscales for mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, and bodily discomfort. Serious adverse events were more common with neurostimulation than with medication alone (13 percent vs. 4 percent, P < 0.04) and included a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage. The overall frequency of adverse events was higher in the medication group (64 percent vs. 50 percent, P = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: In this six-month study of patients under 75 years of age with severe motor complications of Parkinson's disease, neurostimulation of the subthalamic nucleus was more effective than medical management alone.

### Evolving treatment landscape: 18 years of managing melanoma in a single patient [^113QaHwg]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

This case demonstrates the rapid pace at which the melanoma treatment landscape has advanced, particularly during the last decade. With 5-year and 10-year survival rates increasing, metastatic melanoma is becoming a chronic disease rather than a death sentence, so awareness of the increasing treatment options at our disposal is all the more important.

When our patient was first diagnosed, surgery was the only treatment for melanoma known to improve survival. Adjuvant interferon was approved for use in the United States, but with uncertain benefits alongside significant toxicity. Dacarbazine was used to treat metastatic disease, offering only a modest response rate. The median overall survival of patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma was around 8 months. In the early 21st century, significant progress in our understanding of cancer at the molecular level led to a revolution in the development of mechanism-driven anticancer therapies. This approach has been particularly successful in melanoma, with two major new forms of systemic therapy established as standard care:

- **Immune checkpoint inhibitor antibodies**: Examples include pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab.

- **Small molecule inhibitors of the BRAF-MEK signalling pathway**: Examples include vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib for those 50% of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma.

Modern systemic therapy has extended the median overall survival of metastatic melanoma to beyond 3 years, with many patients entering long-term remission, some of whom may yet be considered cured.

With new treatments come new challenges, including how best to se

### Integrating direct electrical brain stimulation with the human connectome [^1154RW4B]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

Recent methodological developments have enabled linking lesions in different brain locations to a common neuroanatomical substrate using the human connectome, a detailed representation of how brain regions communicate to form large-scale functional networks. In the present report, we seek to integrate the largest direct electrical stimulation (DES) dataset ever collected in glioma patients with functional connectome mapping performed on a large normative population of 1,000 healthy individuals. By leveraging network hubs, we aim to build a multivariate normative model capable of quantifying single subject deviation from a reference population. In doing so, we propose to extend DES mapping toward the exploration of its network manifestation at the whole brain level and with single subject resolution. This approach provides a viable solution to the need for causally driven brain maps for neuromodulation therapies and a wide spectrum of clinical and surgical applications.

### Update on treatments for Parkinson's disease motor fluctuations - An international Parkinson and movement disorder society evidence-based medicine review [^1142tG37]. Movement Disorders (2025). High credibility.

High‐quality evidence indicates that subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is efficacious in improving motor impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who experience motor fluctuations on oral levodopa therapy. Additionally, STN DBS is efficacious in improving disability, as measured by activities of daily living in the off-medication state, and in enhancing health-related quality of life (HR-QoL).

- **Efficacy conclusion**: Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the efficacy of STN DBS in treating motor fluctuations in patients with PD, comparing it to best medical therapy (BMT) or delayed stimulation. Seven studies reported improvement in motor impairment, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) in the off-medication state, with an average improvement of 18.6 points in the STN DBS group. One sham (subtherapeutic stimulation) controlled trial showed a difference in the increase in ON-time without troublesome dyskinesia of 3.0 hours (P < 0.0001). Three studies reported the effect of DBS on the number of hours spent in the on-medication state, with an average difference between the STN DBS group and control of 2.6 hours.

- **Summary**: Four studies assessed the effect of STN DBS on disability, as measured by activities of daily living in the off-medication state, showing moderate evidence for improvement ranging from 4.5 to 8.8 points on the UPDRS-II. Four studies evaluated the effect of STN DBS on quality of life, indicating that STN DBS improves quality of life, with improvement ranging between 6.5 and 10.0 points on the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) summary index. Considering the surgical nature of the intervention, the procedure shows promise in addressing motor fluctuations and related disabilities in PD patients.

### Neurophysiological mechanisms of deep brain stimulation across spatiotemporal resolutions [^113W8FZb]. Brain (2023). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation is a neuromodulatory treatment for managing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Electrodes are chronically implanted in disease-relevant brain regions, and pulsatile electrical stimulation delivery is intended to restore neurocircuit function. However, the widespread interest in the application and expansion of this clinical therapy has preceded an overarching understanding of the neurocircuit alterations invoked by deep brain stimulation. Over the years, various forms of neurophysiological evidence have emerged demonstrating changes to brain activity across spatiotemporal resolutions; from single neuron, to local field potential, to brain-wide cortical network effects. Though fruitful, such studies have often led to debate about a singular putative mechanism.

In this update, we aim to produce an integrative account of complementary, instead of mutually exclusive, neurophysiological effects to derive a generalizable concept of the mechanisms of deep brain stimulation. In particular, we offer a critical review of the most common historical competing theories, an updated discussion on recent literature from animal and human neurophysiological studies, and a synthesis of synaptic and network effects of deep brain stimulation across scales of observation, including micro-, meso-, and macroscale circuit alterations.

Regarding the medical management of cutaneous melanoma, particularly in managing advanced/metastatic disease and first-line therapy, ESMO 2025 guidelines recommend offering BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy (dabrafenib-trametinib, vemurafenib-cobimetinib, or binimetinib-encorafenib) as a first-line option in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma if anti-PD-1-based therapy is unavailable or patients are ineligible.

Consider offering BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy for 8–12 weeks followed by ipilimumab-nivolumab as another option, especially for patients with high LDH levels and/or liver metastases. Consider offering encorafenib as monotherapy if the decision to treat with targeted therapy has been made but the patient cannot receive a MEK inhibitor due to cardiovascular comorbidities, a recent brain metastasis bleeding event, history of retinal detachment, or other ophthalmological contraindications.

### Optimized, minimal specific absorption rate MRI for high-resolution imaging in patients with implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes [^111MMjbT]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Obtaining high-resolution brain MR imaging in patients with a previously implanted deep brain stimulator has been challenging and avoided by many centers due to safety concerns relating to implantable devices. We present our experience with a practical clinical protocol at 1.5T using two magnet systems capable of achieving presurgical quality imaging in patients undergoing bilateral, staged deep brain stimulator insertion.

- **Materials and methods**: Protocol optimization was performed to minimize the specific absorption rate while providing the image quality necessary for adequate surgical planning of the second electrode placement. We reviewed MR imaging studies performed with a minimal specific absorption rate protocol in patients with a deep brain stimulator between February 1, 2012, and August 1, 2015. Images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist and a functional neurosurgeon. Image quality was qualitatively graded, and the presence of artifacts was noted.

- **Results**: Twenty-nine patients (22 with Parkinson's disease, 6 with dystonia, and 1 with essential tremor) were imaged with at least one neuromodulation implant in situ. All patients were imaged under general anesthesia. There were 25 subthalamic and 4 globus pallidus implants. Nineteen patients were preoperative for the second stage of bilateral deep brain stimulator placement; 10 patients had bilateral electrodes in situ and were being imaged for other neurologic indications, including lead positioning. No adverse events occurred during or after imaging. Mild device-related local artifacts were noted, but they did not impair the imaging of the surrounding brain structures.

### Reoperation for suboptimal outcomes after deep brain stimulation surgery [^115Viqq4]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

To examine a case series of reoperations for deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads, clinical scenarios that revealed suboptimal outcomes from a previous operation were assessed. Suboptimally placed DBS leads are a potential reason for unsatisfactory results after surgery for Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor (ET), or dystonia. In a previous study, 19 of 41 patients who experienced suboptimal results had misplaced leads. Similarly, another report noted that lead placement beyond a 2- to 3-mm window resulted in inadequate clinical benefit, and in one patient, revision improved the outcome. The goal of the study was to perform an unblinded retrospective chart review of DBS patients with unsatisfactory outcomes who presented for reoperation.

- **Methods**: Patients who had DBS lead replacements after reoperation were assessed using a retrospective review of an institutional review board-approved movement disorders database. Cases of reoperation for suboptimal clinical benefit were included, while cases of replacement of DBS leads due to infection or hardware malfunction were excluded. Data points studied included age, disease duration, diagnosis, motor outcomes (the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III in PD, the Tremor Rating Scale in ET, and the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale in dystonia), quality of life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 in PD), and the Clinician Global Impression scale. The data from before and after reoperation were examined to determine the estimated impact of repeat surgery.

### Deep brain stimulation plus best medical therapy versus best medical therapy alone for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD SURG trial): a randomised, open-label trial [^113XkLUx]. The Lancet Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

In the medical therapy group, 12 patients underwent surgery between the baseline and 1-year mark (figure 1), with three of these surgeries occurring between 10 and 12 months after random allocation, although these patients completed their 1-year assessments before surgery. A total of 118 patients randomly allocated to medical therapy underwent surgery at or after 1 year.

The mean change between baseline and 1 year on the PDQ-39 summary index was −5.0 points in the surgery group and −0.3 points in the medical therapy group (difference −4.7 points, 95% CI −7.6 to −1.8, p = 0.001). The mean change in the PDQ-39 summary index between baseline and 1 year ranged from less than −30 to more than 30 (figure 2). The difference in the mean change in score between baseline and 1 year was −8.9 for the PDQ-39 domain of mobility (95% CI −13.8 to −4.0; p = 0.0004), −12.4 for activities of daily living (−17.3 to −7.5; p < 0.0001), −7.5 for bodily discomfort (−12.6 to −2.4; p = 0.004), and −5.2 for stigma (−10.4 to 0.03; p = 0.05).

### Report of whole-brain radiation therapy in a patient with an implanted deep brain stimulator: Important neurosurgical considerations and radiotherapy practice principles [^113YjpEM]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with implanted neuromodulation devices present potential challenges for radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery. Although guidelines exist regarding the irradiation of cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, fewer data and less clinical experience exist regarding the effects of radiation therapy on less frequently used devices, such as deep brain stimulators. A 79-year-old woman with a history of coarse tremors effectively managed with deep brain stimulation presented with multiple intracranial metastases from a newly diagnosed lung cancer and was referred for whole-brain radiation therapy.

She was treated with a German helmet technique to a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions using 6 MV photons via opposed lateral fields with the neurostimulator turned off prior to delivery of each fraction. The patient tolerated the treatment well, with no acute complications and no apparent change in the functionality of her neurostimulator device or effect on her underlying neuromuscular disorder.

This represents the first reported case of the safe delivery of whole-brain radiation therapy in a patient with an implanted neurostimulator device. In cases such as this, neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists should have discussions with patients about the risks of brain injury, device malfunction or failure of the device, and plans for rigorous testing of the device before and after radiation therapy.

### Evolving treatment options for melanoma brain metastases [^111CuAPY]. The Lancet Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Melanoma is a leading cause of lost productivity due to premature cancer mortality. It frequently spreads to the brain and is associated with rapid deterioration in quality and quantity of life. Until now, treatment options have been restricted to surgery and radiotherapy, although neither modality has been well studied in clinical trials.

However, the new immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecularly targeted agents introduced for the treatment of metastatic melanoma are active against brain metastases and offer new opportunities to improve disease outcomes. New challenges arise, including how to integrate or sequence multiple treatment modalities, and practice varies widely.

In this review, we summarize evidence for the treatment of melanoma brain metastases and discuss the rationale and evidence for combination modalities, highlighting areas for future research.

### Deep brain stimulator electrodes used for lesioning: Proof of principle [^112tPnuK]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with chronically implanted deep brain stimulator (DBS) electrodes can encounter complications requiring hardware removal. We assessed the safety and efficacy of using implanted DBS electrodes to create a therapeutic lesion before their removal.

- **Methods**: Revision or removal of the DBS electrodes was required in two patients who had previously undergone DBS implantation. We conducted a series of in vitro experiments to confirm that the DBS electrodes could be used to generate radiofrequency lesions and to assess the relationship between radiofrequency parameters and lesion size. With this information, and with the approval of the hospital ethical review board, implanted electrodes were used to create incremental radiofrequency lesions in the thalamus in one patient and in the subthalamic nucleus in another. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia with contiguous contacts of the DBS lead connected to the active and reference sites of the RF generator to create a bipolar lesion.

- **Results**: A 51-year-old man with essential tremor and a thalamic DBS required repeated battery changes due to tolerance and high voltage demands. Rather than replacing the battery, a radiofrequency thalamotomy was performed using the existing left DBS electrode. At the 6-month follow-up examination, successful lesioning provided near complete tremor control. A second patient, a 50-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who had undergone bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation, developed skin erosion over the DBS hardware. A subthalamic nucleus lesion was made.

### The return of the lesion for localization and therapy [^116Gjyrx]. Brain (2023). Low credibility.

Historically, pathological brain lesions provided the foundation for the localization of symptoms, and therapeutic lesions were used as a treatment for brain diseases. New medications, functional neuroimaging, and deep brain stimulation have led to a decline in the use of lesions in the past few decades. However, recent advances have improved our ability to localize lesion-induced symptoms, including localization to brain circuits rather than individual brain regions. Improved localization can lead to more precise treatment targets, which may mitigate traditional advantages of deep brain stimulation over lesions, such as reversibility and tunability.

New tools for creating therapeutic brain lesions, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound, allow for lesions to be placed without a skin incision and are already in clinical use for tremor. Although there are limitations and caution is warranted, improvements in lesion-based localization are refining our therapeutic targets, and improved technology is providing new ways to create therapeutic lesions, which together may facilitate the return of the lesion.

### The cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in combination with best medical therapy, versus best medical therapy alone, in advanced Parkinson's disease [^11318UJC]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

To validate the prediction of long-term outcomes for patients in the model, we compared the predicted H&Y mix for DBS patients against 2-year data reported in a previous study. Our model predicted a mean H&Y stage of 2.91 among surviving DBS patients at 2 years (from a baseline of 3.62), compared with 3.0 from the 2-year study (from a baseline value of 3.4). Additional follow-up data from the PD SURG study will be important in further validation of our model.

A comparison of the mortality rates predicted by our model against existing literature on survival for patients with PD suggests that our model may overestimate survival times. Several clinical studies have shown significantly higher mortality rates than those predicted by the model, with 8–10-year mortality ranging from 38 to 92%. Much of this difference can be accounted for by comparing the age profile of patients in these studies (mean age at baseline 70–75 years) with the baseline age of patients in our model (60.5 years, based on the key clinical study). By modifying the baseline age of patients in the model to 75 years, the predicted mortality estimates correlated more closely with the clinical evidence.

### Shared pathway-specific network mechanisms of dopamine and deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease [^115USBm9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Deep brain stimulation is a brain circuit intervention that can modulate distinct neural pathways for the alleviation of neurological symptoms in patients with brain disorders. In Parkinson's disease, subthalamic deep brain stimulation clinically mimics the effect of dopaminergic drug treatment, but the shared pathway mechanisms on cortex–basal ganglia networks are unknown. To address this critical knowledge gap, we combined fully invasive neural multisite recordings in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery with normative MRI-based whole-brain connectomics. Our findings demonstrate that dopamine and stimulation exert distinct mesoscale effects through modulation of local neural population activity. In contrast, at the macroscale, stimulation mimics dopamine in its suppression of excessive interregional network synchrony associated with indirect and hyperdirect cortex–basal ganglia pathways. Our results provide a better understanding of the circuit mechanisms of dopamine and deep brain stimulation, laying the foundation for advanced closed-loop neurostimulation therapies.

### Long-term outcomes of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson disease [^1124CcDj]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD) is well established for up to 1 or 2 years, but long-term outcome data are still limited. In this review, we critically discuss the evidence on the long-term outcomes of DBS and consider the clinical implications. Although many patients are lost to follow-up, the evidence indicates that subthalamic nucleus DBS improves motor function for up to 10 years, although the magnitude of improvement tends to decline over time.

Functional scores recorded during on-medication periods worsen more quickly than those recorded in off periods, consistent with the degeneration of non-dopaminergic pathways. Dyskinesia, motor fluctuations, and activities of daily living in off periods remain improved at 5 years, but quality-of-life scores have usually fallen below preoperative levels. The incidence and severity of dementia among patients receiving DBS are comparable to those among patients who receive medical treatment. Severe adverse events are rare, but adverse events such as dysarthria are common and probably under-reported. Long-term data on the outcomes of globus pallidus interna DBS are limited and mostly confirm the efficacy for dyskinesia.

A trend towards offering DBS in the earlier stages of PD creates a need to identify factors that predict long-term outcomes and to discuss realistic expectations with patients preoperatively.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease: Executive summary [^116XACqp]. Neurosurgery (2018). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Parkinson's disease, specifically concerning deep brain stimulation, the AANS/CNS 2018 guidelines recommend considering globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation rather than subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation if there is significant concern about cognitive decline. This is particularly relevant with respect to processing speed and working memory in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation, while also taking other surgical goals into consideration.

### Malignant melanoma in early Parkinson's disease: the DATATOP trial [^11687kCX]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The available epidemiological data on the incidence of malignant melanoma in Parkinson's disease are contradictory. The role of levodopa therapy in this context has been debated. We identified all known cases of malignant melanoma (N = 5) in the DATATOP clinical trial cohort and compared that to published expected values (N = 1.5) for a standard healthy population. The standardized event ratio was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–7.8), indicating that the incidence of malignant melanoma was higher than expected. We found no association between levodopa therapy and the incidence of melanoma.

### Lodosyn [^115Xa8DN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk — approximately 2- to 6-fold higher — of developing melanoma compared to the general population. It remains unclear whether this increased risk is due to Parkinson's disease itself or other factors, such as the drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease.

For these reasons, patients and healthcare providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and regularly when using Lodosyn tablets for Parkinson's disease. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be conducted by appropriately qualified individuals, such as dermatologists.

### Selecting deep brain stimulation or infusion therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: An evidence-based review [^112aHv6e]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

For STN–DBS, strong evidence supports a favorable impact on mild to moderate depression and anxiety after 6 to 12 months, while weaker evidence suggests possible deleterious effects on apathy, psychosis, impulsivity, and emotional processing. Conflicting data exist regarding the effects of STN–DBS in patients with impulse control disorders or dopa dysregulation syndrome. Favorable outcomes may require the withdrawal of dopaminergic medication. Ongoing psychotic or severe depressive episodes (with or without suicidal ideation) are DBS contraindications, but these may be treated and DBS performed after remission. Fewer reports exist of neuropsychiatric complications with GPi–DBS, possibly reflecting publication bias.

Based on limited evidence, apomorphine may improve mood and anxiety but is associated with a risk of psychosis, confusion, and disinhibited behavior. Clinical experience suggests caution in patients with impulse control disorders. The available data for DLI do not allow firm conclusions on neuropsychiatric safety, but open-label data suggest it may be best tolerated of all three options in patients with a history of psychosis. No evidence exists to comment on ongoing psychosis or impulse control disorders. It is recommended that neuropsychiatric assessment is carried out before any device-aided therapy and that patients with previous psychiatric history receive post-treatment neuropsychiatric surveillance.

- **Medical co-morbidities**: Little evidence relates to medical co-morbidities, mainly because studies exclude such cases.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines update for the role of emerging therapies in the management of patients with metastatic brain tumors [^117D4gNJ]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for brain metastasis, specifically with respect to systemic therapy, the CNS 2025 guidelines recommend considering the addition of immunotherapy to the treatment regimen. This addition aims to enhance CNS control and, to a lesser extent, improve survival in patients with brain metastases secondary to BRAF-altered melanoma, for whom BRAF inhibitors are indicated, provided there are no contraindications from other underlying medical conditions.

### Opdivo [^1133j88i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

CheckMate-067 (NCT01844505) was a multicenter, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind trial involving 945 patients with previously untreated, unresectable, or metastatic melanoma. Participants were assigned to one of the following treatment arms: Opdivo and ipilimumab, Opdivo alone, or ipilimumab alone. Eligible patients were required to complete adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment at least 6 weeks prior to randomization and have no history of treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, active brain metastasis, ocular melanoma, autoimmune disease, or medical conditions necessitating systemic immunosuppression.

Patients were randomized to receive:

- **Opdivo and ipilimumab arm**: Opdivo 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by Opdivo as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks.
- **Opdivo arm**: Opdivo 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks.
- **Ipilimumab arm**: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by placebo every 2 weeks.

Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥ 5% vs. < 5% tumor cell membrane expression), as determined by a clinical trial assay, BRAF V600 mutation status, and M stage per the AJCC staging system (M0, M1a, M1b vs. M1c). Tumor assessments were carried out 12 weeks after randomization, then every 6 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy outcome measures included confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response.

### Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease [^115dzFLj]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022).

The initial tentative use of electrostimulation of deep brain structures in the 1950s and 1960s was for the treatment of chronic pain and psychiatric illnesses, whereby the brain target would be stimulated chronically through implanted electrodes instead of being destroyed by heating. Similarly, during the early era of stereotactic lesional surgery in Parkinson's disease, there were some attempts at using deep brain stimulation instead of making lesions. However, the technology at that time was crude, and the hardware too complicated and cumbersome to use.

The introduction of implantable cardiac pacemakers prompted the development of implantable 'brain pacemakers', facilitating the application of the method of chronic stimulation of subcortical brain areas. Hence, the term 'deep' brain stimulation, as opposed to superficial cortical brain stimulation, came into use. The label 'DBS' was trademarked by Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA) for the first commercially marketed devices introduced in the mid-1970s. These devices were mainly used to treat chronic pain by electric stimulation through electrodes implanted in central pain pathways such as the lemniscus bundle in the brainstem and the sensory nuclei of the thalamus.

### Deep brain stimulation for obesity: Past, present, and future targets [^112cR9WV]. Neurosurgical Focus (2015). Low credibility.

The authors review the history of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients for treating obesity, describe DBS targets in the brain, and discuss potential DBS targets and nontraditional stimulation parameters that may improve the effectiveness of DBS for ameliorating obesity. Deep brain stimulation for treating obesity has been performed both in animals and in humans with intriguing preliminary results. The brain is an attractive target for addressing obesity because modulating brain activity may permit influencing both sides of the energy equation — caloric intake and energy expenditure.

### Tasmar [^115JzxHK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk, approximately 2- to 6-fold higher, of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.

For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using Tasmar for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals, such as dermatologists.

### Mohs micrographic surgery in a patient with a deep brain stimulator: A review of the literature on implantable electrical devices [^113DQJiK]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Implantable electrical devices are becoming increasingly common in the patient population presenting for Mohs micrographic surgery. In addition to understanding the potential intraoperative complications with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and pacemakers, the Mohs surgeon needs to be aware of the relatively new treatment of movement disorders using implanted deep brain stimulators.

- **Objective**: We present only the second reported case of Mohs surgery in a patient with a deep brain stimulator. In an attempt to help minimize adverse events during a procedure, we review the more commonly encountered electrical devices as well as the newer deep brain stimulators. We provide guidelines for the avoidance of electromagnetic interference during an electrosurgical procedure.

- **Methods**: This 76-year-old patient with Parkinson's disease and an implanted deep brain stimulator underwent Mohs surgery for excision of a squamous cell carcinoma on the ear. In an attempt to minimize electromagnetic interference with his implanted device, hemostasis was obtained with the aid of a battery-operated heat-generating handheld electrocautery device.

- **Results**: The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications or reports of discomfort.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with implanted electrical devices are subject to electromagnetic interference during an electrosurgical procedure. Care must be taken in this expanding patient population during a Mohs surgical procedure.

### Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation evokes resonant neural activity [^114iuKXB]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a rapidly expanding treatment for neurological and psychiatric conditions; however, a target-specific biomarker is required to optimize therapy. Here, we show that DBS evokes a large-amplitude resonant neural response focally in the subthalamic nucleus. This response is greatest in the dorsal region, the clinically optimal stimulation target for Parkinson's disease, coincides with improved clinical performance, is chronically recordable, and is present under general anesthesia. These features make it a readily utilizable electrophysiological signal that could potentially be used for guiding electrode implantation surgery and tailoring DBS therapy to improve patient outcomes.

### Development of the knee quality of life (KQoL-26) 26-item questionnaire: Data quality, reliability, validity and responsiveness [^117SeaKf]. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2008). High credibility.

The Knee Quality of Life (KQoL-26) is a 26-item questionnaire designed to assess the quality of life in patients with knee conditions. This tool is applicable to patients suffering from various knee disorders, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-traumatic knee injuries. The KQoL-26 provides a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's physical function, mental health, social interaction, and general health status related to their knee condition. It is a valuable tool for clinicians to monitor disease progression, evaluate the effectiveness of treatment interventions, and guide decision-making in clinical practice. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it may not be suitable for patients with cognitive impairments or language barriers that prevent them from understanding or accurately completing the questionnaire.

The questionnaire assesses how knee-related issues affect an individual's day-to-day activities and emotional well-being. The 26 items cover various physical tasks and emotional states, where respondents rate their experiences in dealing with their knee condition.

Each of the 26 items follows a scoring system that translates responses into numerical scores, representing the impact level of knee issues. For physical activity-related questions such as "Lifting heavy objects", "Running", and "Walking on uneven surfaces", respondents indicate the difficulty or discomfort experienced.
