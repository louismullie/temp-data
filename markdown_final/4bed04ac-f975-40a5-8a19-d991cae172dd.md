## Question

What hormonal changes contribute to period variation in young women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the hormonal changes that drive menstrual cycle variation in young women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core HPG-axis physiology and the canonical hormone patterns across follicular, ovulatory, and luteal phases. Then, I should verify how much individual variability exists around those means and whether "normal" cycles still deviate from textbook templates. Next, I will examine modifiers of variability, including age, BMI, ethnicity, and contraception. After that, I should review downstream physiological consequences that mirror hormonal fluctuations, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurobiological effects. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary and double-check that my claims align with contemporary guidelines and large-scale datasets.

> Let me first confirm the foundational physiology. The menstrual cycle is governed by the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, with GnRH pulses driving FSH and LH, which in turn coordinate ovarian estradiol and progesterone production across follicular, ovulatory, and luteal phases, producing predictable peaks and nadirs that orchestrate folliculogenesis, ovulation, and endometrial changes [^11611Ehq] [^113Ym9a9]. Wait, I should verify the canonical timing: estradiol rises through the follicular phase and peaks just before ovulation, LH and FSH surge at ovulation, and progesterone dominates the luteal phase while estradiol remains moderately elevated, which is consistent with dense-sampling neuroimaging cohorts and endocrine reviews [^113Ym9a9] [^11611Ehq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "normal" meaning uniform. I need to check how much individual cycles deviate from mean profiles. Prospective urine studies show that while mean curves look ovulatory, most individual cycles differ from the mean, with prolonged or double estradiol peaks, variable LH surge morphology, and fluctuating progesterone rises, underscoring substantial within-person variability even in healthy women [^114iGGfc]. Let me verify population-level cycle metrics: large app-based datasets indicate an average cycle length around 29 days with follicular and luteal means near 17 and 12 days, respectively, but with wide inter-individual ranges and notable intra-individual variability, reinforcing that "normal" spans a broad distribution rather than a fixed 28-day template [^1143QQHx].

> I should confirm the magnitude of hormonal fluctuation. Estradiol and progesterone vary roughly 5- to 50-fold across the cycle in reproductive-age women, which provides the physiological substrate for phase-dependent differences in multiple systems; this scale of change is consistent with endocrine summaries and helps explain why modest phase effects can be biologically meaningful even when average performance differences are small [^115wrDNf]. But wait, what if I'm overstating uniformity? Even with large mean changes, individual hormone trajectories can differ markedly in timing and amplitude, which is why phase verification by biomarkers is often necessary in research and clinical contexts [^113emXm8].

> Next, I should review modifiers of variability. Age exerts a U-shaped effect on cycle variability: adolescents and those approaching menopause show greater irregularity, whereas variability tends to be lowest in the mid-reproductive years; large digital cohorts quantify higher variability under age 20 and again after 45, aligning with clinical experience of pubertal maturation and perimenopausal transition [^117XgB92] [^111NAagR]. I need to ensure I capture BMI effects: obesity is associated with longer cycles and greater variability, plausibly via altered gonadotropin dynamics and anovulation risk, though some large datasets show modest effect sizes and heterogeneity, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize [^117XgB92] [^111PEzor]. Ethnic differences of about 1–2 days in mean cycle length have been observed, with Asian and Hispanic participants reporting slightly longer cycles than non-Hispanic White participants, which is clinically small but epidemiologically relevant for counseling and research design [^117XgB92]. Let me also consider contraception: combined oral contraceptives suppress endogenous estradiol and progesterone and blunt cycle-related physiological fluctuations, including cardiovascular amplitude, which can mask or attenuate phase-dependent changes seen in naturally cycling women [^1158gXVh] [^112LgMYW].

> I will now examine downstream physiological consequences that track with hormonal fluctuations. Cardiovascular metrics such as resting heart rate and heart rate variability show a reproducible pattern across the cycle, with lower RHR and higher RMSSD early in the cycle and the opposite in the late luteal phase; these patterns are attenuated with age, higher BMI, and hormonal contraception, supporting a mechanistic link to progesterone's thermogenic and autonomic effects [^112LgMYW] [^111WsZYt]. Wait, let me verify metabolic effects: continuous glucose monitoring demonstrates a biphasic pattern with higher median glucose in the luteal phase and lower in the late follicular phase, consistent with progesterone-mediated reductions in insulin sensitivity and increased energy intake in the luteal phase, although effect sizes are modest and individual responses vary [^115L1YQ4] [^116bz2oX]. Neurobiologically, dense-sampling MRI studies show that estradiol, progesterone, LH, and FSH track with widespread changes in white matter microstructure, cortical thickness, and tissue/CSF volumes across the brain, indicating structural brain dynamics that co-fluctuate with HPG-axis hormones beyond classic limbic regions [^115bpP9Q] [^113Ym9a9].

> But wait, what if clinical symptoms attributed to "hormones" are actually driven by other factors? I should double-check performance and mood data. Several well-controlled studies in eumenorrheic women show that small phase-related performance differences correlate more strongly with pain, motivation, and well-being than with instantaneous estradiol, progesterone, or testosterone concentrations, suggesting that symptom burden and psychological state mediate perceived or actual performance changes across the cycle [^115qDYp7] [^1169y7x9]. Similarly, weight preoccupation and emotional eating fluctuate premenstrually, but within-person changes are better predicted by emotional eating than by ovarian hormone levels, highlighting behavioral and affective pathways that intersect with hormonal rhythms [^114Hu5wA]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that estradiol directly acutely enhances strength in cycling women; however, studies in eumenorrheic participants generally fail to show direct hormone–performance correlations, likely because baseline estradiol is already sufficient and acute effects are small relative to other determinants of performance [^112LoAVS].

> Let me reconsider adolescent and early reproductive years specifically. In the first 1–2 years after menarche, anovulatory cycles are common and cycle length can vary widely, often extending well beyond adult norms; ovulatory function and cycle regularity typically consolidate over several years, so I should avoid overdiagnosing pathology in early adolescence while maintaining vigilance for persistent abnormalities [^112bFyuF] [^11611Ehq]. I should confirm that contemporary guidance endorses using the menstrual cycle as a vital sign in adolescents to detect deviations early and contextualize them within developmental trajectories and modifiable factors such as energy availability and stress [^114TNqk9].

> Next, I should review methodological caveats that can distort inference. Many studies historically relied on calendar-based phase assignment without biochemical confirmation, risking misclassification of ovulatory status and luteal adequacy; best practice is to combine calendar dating with LH testing and serum estradiol/progesterone thresholds to verify phase, and to exclude participants with luteal phase deficiency or anovulation when phase-dependent effects are the target of inference [^113emXm8]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach improves signal detection: studies implementing strict luteal verification report clearer phase-related patterns and fewer false negatives, supporting the need for rigorous phase confirmation in both research and clinical assessments [^113emXm8].

> Synthesis: In young women, menstrual cycle variation arises from the interplay of robust mean hormonal patterns and substantial individual deviations around those means, shaped by age, BMI, ethnicity, and contraceptive use; these hormonal rhythms propagate into measurable changes in cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurobiological systems, while symptom expression often reflects the convergence of hormonal milieu with pain, mood, and behavior rather than direct acute effects of isolated hormone concentrations [^1143QQHx] [^112LgMYW] [^115L1YQ4] [^115bpP9Q] [^115qDYp7]. I need to ensure my clinical framing remains reference-aligned: normal adult cycle length spans roughly 21–35 days, with up to about 7–9 days of intra-individual variability depending on age, and evaluation should consider the cycle as a vital sign while applying phase-aware methodology when hormonal effects are suspected or being studied [^113BUa6H] [^112bFyuF] [^114TNqk9] [^113emXm8].

Period variation in young women is driven by **estrogen and progesterone fluctuations** across the menstrual cycle, with estrogen rising in the follicular phase and progesterone dominating the luteal phase [^113Ym9a9]. These hormonal shifts cause changes in cycle length, flow, and symptoms such as mood, energy, and pain [^112ZxpUD]. Early cycles after menarche are often **anovulatory and irregular** due to immature feedback, and cycles tend to shorten and become more regular with age until perimenopause [^112VpRXV] [^113jy9F8]. Stress, weight changes, and hormonal contraception can further alter cycle regularity and symptoms [^117RAbLt].

## Hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle

The menstrual cycle is governed by the **hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis**, with coordinated fluctuations in estrogen, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) [^11611Ehq].

| **Phase** | **Key hormonal changes** | **Physiological effects** |
|-|-|-|
| Follicular phase (days 1–14) | - Estrogen rises as follicles mature <br/> - FSH stimulates follicular growth <br/> - LH surges just before ovulation | - Endometrial proliferation <br/> - Increased energy and mood <br/> - Mid-cycle ovulation |
| Luteal phase (days 15–28) | - Progesterone rises after ovulation <br/> - Estrogen remains elevated <br/> - FSH and LH decline | - Endometrial secretory changes <br/> - Increased body temperature <br/> - Mood and appetite changes |

---

These hormonal fluctuations drive **predictable changes** in cycle length, flow, and symptoms, including mood, energy, and pain [^112ZxpUD].

---

## Individual variability in hormonal patterns

Young women exhibit **significant individual variability** in hormonal patterns, leading to differences in cycle regularity and symptom severity [^114iGGfc]. Factors contributing to this variability include:

- **Genetic differences**: Variations in genes regulating hormone synthesis, metabolism, and receptor sensitivity [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Stress, diet, physical activity, and sleep patterns influence hormonal balance [^111KWbrj].
- **Environmental factors**: Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and other environmental stressors [^114bW2Cj].

---

## Impact of hormonal fluctuations on menstrual symptoms

Hormonal fluctuations significantly affect **menstrual symptoms** in young women:

- **Mood and emotional well-being**: Estrogen and progesterone influence neurotransmitter systems, affecting mood, anxiety, and emotional stability [^1158WcyQ].
- **Physical symptoms**: Hormonal changes contribute to breast tenderness, bloating, headaches, and fatigue [^114wkXoy].
- **Pain perception**: Estrogen and progesterone modulate pain sensitivity, influencing menstrual cramps and discomfort [^notfound].

---

## Influence of hormonal contraception

Hormonal contraception **alters natural hormonal fluctuations**, often reducing cycle variability and symptoms. Combined oral contraceptives suppress ovulation, stabilizing estrogen and progesterone levels and reducing menstrual flow and cramps, whereas progestin-only methods may cause irregular bleeding initially, but over time cycles often become lighter and more regular.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Understanding hormonal fluctuations is essential for **clinical management** of menstrual irregularities and symptoms in young women. Clinicians should:

- **Educate patients**: Provide information on normal menstrual variability and symptom management strategies [^114TNqk9].
- **Monitor menstrual health**: Use menstrual tracking tools to identify patterns and irregularities [^1151EtPJ].
- **Individualize treatment**: Tailor management strategies based on individual hormonal profiles and symptom severity [^114c6oAn].

---

Period variation in young women is primarily driven by **estrogen and progesterone fluctuations**, with significant individual variability influenced by genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. These hormonal changes affect menstrual symptoms and cycle regularity, and understanding them is crucial for effective clinical management.

In conclusion, women experience remarkable physiological variations in sex hormone exposure throughout their lifespan that exert profound, clinically significant effects on glucose regulation and metabolic homeostasis. The bidirectional relationship between reproductive endocrinology and glucose metabolism creates complex pathophysiological interactions, where dysfunction in either system propagates through both central neural circuits and peripheral target tissues. Despite these fundamental connections, current research paradigms remain disproportionately focused on pregnancy‐related physiology, while other critical hormonal states — including pubertal transitions, menstrual cycle dynamics, contraceptive use, assisted reproduction, menopausal changes and endocrine cancer therapies — have been systematically understudied. Given the substantial clinical consequences of these interactions, advancing our understanding of women's sex hormone physiology across all these contexts must become an urgent priority.

Perimenopause is characterized by wide hormone fluctuations and irregular menstrual cycles for 5 or more years preceding menopause and lasts until 12 months of amenorrhea have been achieved. It represents a period of reproductive transition with a decline in fertility. However, unintended pregnancies do occur, with a high risk for poor outcomes and maternal complications. All women transitioning through perimenopause should be adequately counseled. There are many hormone and nonhormone contraceptive methods that are highly effective and suited to the personal and medical needs of the perimenopausal woman. Contraception should continue until menopause is confirmed.

Menstrual cycle and athletic performance — although hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle can alter physiological responses in some females, the average effect on performance is likely small relative to the large differences in athletic performance between males and females, and the menstrual cycle should not be used as an excuse to not include females in studies on acute exercise, exercise training, and the effects on athletic performance; rather, the menstrual cycle in women presents as another opportunity for high-impact studies to provide a rationale for inclusion of females into exercise science and sports-based studies.

The menstrual cycle

At the broadest level, the menstrual cycle is made up of the follicular and luteal phases. The average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days, with most cycles ranging from 22 to 36 days. Variations in the operational definition of the phases can be seen across studies; Namely, with the inclusion or exclusion of menses in the follicular phase and the premenstrual phase in the luteal phase. The follicular phase typically ranges between 7–22 days, with an average duration of 14 days. It begins on the first day of menstruation and ends with ovulation. Menstruation, or menses, is the discharge of blood from the uterine lining on a cyclical basis, and is regulated by hormone levels including estrogen, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone. Menses is estimated to last between 3–7 days in healthy women, and bleeding lasting more than 7 days is considered a menstrual abnormality. Various studies have reported the luteal phase on a 14–16-day range. Thus, there has been significant variation in operationally defining each phase of the menstrual cycle across studies.

Fluctuations of pain, cognitive, affective, and physical symptoms according to the phases of the menstrual cycle have been described across studies. However, findings regarding the specific patterns of symptom changes through the phases of the menstrual cycle are inconclusive. In general, the premenstrual phase is associated with increased somatic symptoms, fluid retention, negative affect, weight gain, depression, painful breasts, and lower overall health. During menses, somatic symptoms, pain, autonomic reaction, and fluid retention increase significantly. Furthermore, the follicular phase is associated with lower pain.

### A new metric to understand the association between heart rate variability and menstrual regularity [^117ELuPW]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for women. Compared to men, women receive lower quality care in relation to cardiovascular concerns and are consistently underrepresented in cardiovascular research –. Accordingly, current understanding of the impacts of the menstrual cycle on female cardiovascular health remains limited. For example, women experiencing irregular menstrual cycles have a higher risk of coronary heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis, yet the causes of these associations are unclear –. An important contributor to this knowledge gap is a limited understanding of the biological differences between women and men surrounding how CVD manifests itself in puberty, pregnancy and menopause. Addressing heart health at every life stage can improve a woman's overall health and quality of life. Expanding women's CVD research by 2040 could lead to at least 1.6 million years of higher-quality life and boost the US economy by $28 billion annually. More importantly, researching and caring for cardiovascular health should be a priority across a woman's lifespan, not just at older ages when acute symptoms are most prevalent and most expected by women themselves.

Thus far, multidisciplinary approaches and remote monitoring are being implemented to improve women's cardiovascular care and outcomes. One such recent approach is demonstrated by Jasinski et al. in their study titled "A Novel method for quantifying fluctuations in wearable derived daily cardiovascular parameters across the menstrual cycle". Citing existing research, Jasinski et al. first establish that heart rate variability (a measure of the fluctuation of time between each heartbeat) varies across the menstrual cycle. Jasinski et al. aim to describe the significance of these variations using a novel metric, cardiovascular amplitude. Cardiovascular amplitude is a metric that quantifies that magnitude of heart rate variability and can be routinely measured by wearable technology (wearables). Since heart rate variability is a standard feature in most wearables, abstracting the cardiac amplitude is feasible. The authors propose that cardiovascular amplitude may mirror hormonal fluctuations across the female menstrual cycle. They found that cardiovascular amplitude follows a predictable pattern across the menstrual cycle, and they hypothesize that significant fluctuations in cardiovascular amplitude in naturally cycling participants may be due to progesterone increases in the late luteal phase, which are attenuated in individuals who are older or on hormonal birth control. The paper's results are consistent with existing studies that have shown in anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome, heart rate variability fluctuation is different from normovulatory women throughout the ovulation induction cycles.

Women undergo developmental and cyclic changes in hormonal exposures that affect brain function and mental health. Some women are more vulnerable to the effects of these hormonal exposures, for reasons that remain to be determined. Evidence to date indicates that anxiety and mood disorders are the most sensitive to hormonal fluctuations in women but there is also growing evidence for a protective effect of female reproductive hormones on schizophrenia. The hormonal exposures of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, lactation, and menopause are quite different and may be associated with at least partially distinct symptom profiles.

Influence of hormone variations during the MC on performance

The findings of the present study are based on data collected from young eumenorrheic women, who ovulated during the test period and fulfilled the criteria for a normal sex hormone profile. Despite this, the individual hormone profiles varied markedly between the participants during MC (Supplemental Fig. S3, Supplemental Digital Content 3, Individual variation in sex hormone levels during the MC,), even though the average sex hormone fluctuations corresponded to a normal profile. For instance, the maximal individual estrogen/progesterone ratio ranged from 13 to 675, and the maximal individual concentration of estradiol varied from 100 to 2400 pmol·L⁻¹. Therefore, we found it mechanistically interesting to perform an analysis of variation in physical performance based on the individual fluctuations in sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, estrogen/progesterone ratio, testosterone, and testosterone/SHBG ratio) instead of only focusing on predefined MC phases.

We hypothesized that strength performance would be greatest when estrogen peaks and progesterone is still low, because estrogen is suggested to have a positive influence on muscle strength, and progesterone is suggested to have antagonistic effects to estrogen. To investigate this in detail, we increased the number of testing sessions on the days around ovulation, when the hormone variations are most marked and the greatest estrogen/progesterone ratio is expected. However, we did not find that the fluctuations in estrogen, estrogen/SHBG ratio, progesterone, testosterone, testosterone/SHBG ratio, and estrogen/progesterone ratio correlated with the individual variation in physical performance outcome parameters. Thereby, our initial hypothesis was rejected. Nevertheless, the theory that estrogen should have a positive effect on strength performance is based on estrogen-deficient models where ovariectomized rodents or postmenopausal women are supplemented with estrogen and improvements in power and strength are observed. Eumenorrheic women are not estrogen deficient, and although the sex hormone levels fluctuate during the MC, the estrogen level in the EF is still well above that of ovariectomized animals and postmenopausal women. The latter may explain why we did not observe a direct link between the variation in circulating levels of sex hormones during the MC and the variation in muscle strength and power performance. Furthermore, the reported positive effect of estrogen administration on strength parameters in ovariectomized animals and postmenopausal women may be the result of more long-term effects of estrogen administration on skeletal muscle rather than an acute effect.

### Menstrual cycle hormone changes associated with reproductive aging and how they may relate to symptoms [^114wkXoy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Key cycle changes occur as women transition from reproductive life to menopause, and they can be roughly linked to menopausal staging. It is important to understand the types of studies that inform the current knowledge. Patterns of symptoms within menstrual cycles (sleep, headache) generally favor worsening in association with the perimenstrual phase of the cycle, and patterns of chronic symptoms, such as hot flashes and adverse mood, appear to be worse when hormones are more variable.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^117SKcns]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Menstrual cycle — hormonal fluctuations and exercise performance — has direct effects on performance that are difficult to assess, highly variable, and dependent on how the cycle is determined; studies indicate physiological factors that can impact performance, including estradiol-associated increases in free fatty acid use, glycogen sparing, and muscle glycogen storage capacity, while progesterone is associated with increases in heart rate, body temperature, sweating, and set points for sweating and vasodilation. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported conflicting results, and a recent large meta-analysis indicates that effects of menstrual phase on actual sports performance are small and unlikely to overcome more powerful competition-day factors such as environmental temperature, type of exercise, training status, or pain.

### Menstrual cycle length variation by demographic characteristics from the apple women's health study [^113jy9F8]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Menstrual cycle characteristics, including cycle length and regularity (i.e. the variability of cycle length within an individual), have been recognized to be an important vital sign. Accumulating evidence has also documented associations of long and/or irregular menstrual cycles with higher risk of infertility, cardiometabolic disease, and death –.

It has been shown that menstrual cycle length varies considerably within an individual throughout the reproductive life span –. Several studies using menstrual diary data from small numbers of individuals reported decreasing length and variability of menstrual cycle with increasing age from late adolescence/early adulthood until late reproductive age (i.e. age 40–45) –. Reports on menstrual characteristics were limited for women above age 45, and current evidence suggested menstrual cycles were increasingly longer and more varied in this age group. Obesity has been linked with longer and less regular menstrual cycles, however, the results were not consistent. The recent emergence of menstrual cycle tracking applications (apps) in smart phones allows large epidemiologic studies to confirm previous findings in small population samples and generate new evidence on factors of menstrual health –. Two studies using the app data reported similar changes of menstrual patterns by age as observed previously but results for body mass index (BMI) were still inconsistent. In addition, adjustment for confounding, such as age, ethnicity, diet, and physical activity, was limited in these studies.

Earlier evidence on menstrual characteristics was mainly from studies among white women and has been used to establish the normal range of menstrual cycle length for clinical practice. Separate observations among individuals in Japan, China, and India reported approximately 1–2 days longer cycle lengths compared to those observed in the white population, indicating a possibility that the suggested cycle pattern parameters may not be applicable in individuals with different ethnic backgrounds –. Other studies also found ethnic differences in hormones related to menstruation –. However, studies directly examining ethnic differences in menstrual patterns were limited and included small groups of individuals. Therefore, evidence from a larger population is warranted.

In this study, we used menstrual cycle tracking data and survey information to confirm the associations between age and BMI with menstrual cycle length and cycle variability, and to examine possible differences of menstrual characteristics by ethnicity in a nationwide digital cohort of women within the United States (US).

### Impact of the menstrual cycle on determinants of energy balance: a putative role in weight loss attempts [^115gVNc7]. International Journal of Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Women's weight and body composition is significantly influenced by the female sex-steroid hormones. Levels of these hormones fluctuate in a defined manner throughout the menstrual cycle and interact to modulate energy homeostasis. This paper reviews the scientific literature on the relationship between hormonal changes across the menstrual cycle and components of energy balance, with the aim of clarifying whether this influences weight loss in women. In the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle it appears that women's energy intake and energy expenditure are increased and they experience more frequent cravings for foods, particularly those high in carbohydrate and fat, than during the follicular phase. This suggests that the potential of the underlying physiology related to each phase of the menstrual cycle may be worth considering as an element in strategies to optimize weight loss. Studies are needed to assess the weight loss outcome of tailoring dietary recommendations and the degree of energy restriction to each menstrual phase throughout a weight management program, taking these preliminary findings into account.

### Immunology and the menstrual cycle [^111YPDxP]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Sex and gender differences in disease prevalence, pathogenesis and modulation have been frequently reported. The menstrual cycle represents the opportunity to study the physiological effect of hormonal fluctuations in vivo on the immune function and chronic disease modulation. Reports on the effect of the cycle on immune cell numbers and activity fluctuations are scarce, but recent publications demonstrate an increasing interest in the subject. The menstrual cycle might affect immune cell numbers and modulate their activity throughout the 4-week cycle, as demonstrated in the case of regulatory T cells. The implications of these fluctuations are particularly relevant in the field of chronic diseases affecting women of reproductive age. In fact, baseline inflammation and immune cell activation in association with other mechanisms, such as regulation of receptor expression, modulation of muscular contraction and behavioral aspects might explain the menstrual-associated fluctuations described in chronic and acute diseases. In the following review the current knowledge about the modulatory effects of the menstrual cycle on both immune cells and systemic diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, asthma, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia and schizophrenia, is reported. Most of these diseases display worsening of symptoms premenstrually or during menses due to physiologic effects on the target tissue mediated by progesterone and estrogen fluctuations and, thus, display paradigmatic changes potentially relevant to numerous other conditions.

### Hormonal milieu influences whole-brain structural dynamics across the menstrual cycle using dense sampling in multiple individuals [^115ZUtd3]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

Gonadal hormone receptors are widely distributed across the brain, yet their influence on brain structure remains understudied. Here, using precision imaging, we examined four females, including one with endometriosis and one using oral contraceptives (OC), across a monthly period. Whole-brain analyses revealed spatiotemporal patterns of brain volume changes, with substantial variations across the monthly period. In typical cycles, spatiotemporal patterns were associated with serum progesterone levels, while in cycles with endometriosis and during OC intake, patterns were associated with serum estradiol levels. The volume changes were widely distributed rather than region-specific, suggesting a widespread but coordinated influence of hormonal fluctuations. These findings underscore the importance of considering diverse hormonal milieus beyond typical menstrual cycles in understanding structural brain dynamics and suggest that hormonal rhythms may drive widespread structural brain changes.

### Committee opinion no. 651 summary: menstruation in girls and adolescents: using the menstrual cycle as a vital sign [^114TNqk9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite variations worldwide and within the U.S. population, median age at menarche has remained relatively stable-between 12 years and 13 years-across well-nourished populations in developed countries. Environmental factors, including socioeconomic conditions, nutrition, and access to preventive health care, may influence the timing and progression of puberty. A number of medical conditions can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, characterized by unpredictable timing and variable amount of flow. Clinicians should educate girls and their caretakers (eg, parents or guardians) about what to expect of a first menstrual period and the range for normal cycle length of subsequent menses. Identification of abnormal menstrual patterns in adolescence may improve early identification of potential health concerns for adulthood. It is important for clinicians to have an understanding of the menstrual patterns of adolescent girls, the ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal menstruation, and the skill to know how to evaluate the adolescent girl patient. By including an evaluation of the menstrual cycle as an additional vital sign, clinicians reinforce its importance in assessing overall health status for patients and caretakers.

### Effects of sex hormones on bronchial reactivity during the menstrual cycle [^1124ZxDZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our data provide evidence that variations in testosterone levels during the menstrual cycle may contribute to fluctuations of PC 20 FEV₁.₀ during the menstrual cycle of premenopausal women. Obviously, this is a biologic phenomenon that might not even have automatically clinical implication, as demonstrated by absence of perimenstrual asthma in our population during the study. Our results suggest that additional studies are needed to assess whether targeting testosterone and/or cAMP in asthmatic patients have potential to improve the management of the worsening of asthma during the menstrual cycle.

### Menstrual cycle length variation by demographic characteristics from the apple women's health study [^115FbAWA]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This study quantified and examined menstrual cycle length and variability by age, ethnicity, and BMI using data collected from mobile apps in a large, diverse population in the US. Our work confirmed previous findings on changes of menstrual pattern across reproductive life span and provided new evidence for women's health clinical practitioners to understand the extent to which menstrual patterns may vary across key characteristics. The average menstrual cycle length and variability across ethnicity and BMI groups were within the normal range and changes of cycle characteristics by age groups aligned with the natural ovarian aging process. Our findings on demographic variations have significance for epidemiologic and clinical research. More specifically, our results provided evidence on factors of menstrual cycles to inform consideration of potential confounders and/or effect modifiers for future research. As for clinical care, although the observed ethnic differences in menstrual cycle length and variability were not large enough to be clinically impactful, knowing the magnitude of such difference is important for healthcare practitioners to better provide care and consultation on menstrual health.

In addition, our analysis showed participants who were Asian or Hispanic and who had higher BMI had higher odds of menstrual irregularity, which may indicate an underlying susceptibility of gynecological disorder. Future studies should explore the underlying determinants of the variation in menstrual characteristics.

1 INTRODUCTION

On average, people who menstruate experience about 450 menstrual cycles throughout the lifespan (Chavez‐MacGregor et al.). Driving these cycles are rhythmic fluctuations in hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG‐axis) hormones such as sex steroids (17β‐estradiol and progesterone) and pituitary gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle‐stimulating hormone [FSH]). The cycle begins with menses, signaling the start of the follicular phase and the gradual rise of 17β‐estradiol concentrations stimulated by FSH (Baird). Just before ovulation (release of a mature egg), three "ovulatory" hormones (17β‐estradiol, LH, and FSH) reach peak values; post‐ovulation, the luteal phase begins, during which progesterone peaks and 17β‐estradiol remains high (Stricker et al.). Fluctuations in concentrations of these hormones have been found to coincide with variation in functional brain activation, such as within the anterior cingulate cortex during reinforcement learning or within the default mode network at rest (Beltz & Moser). In addition, fluctuations of these hormones can induce or exacerbate neurological and psychiatric symptomatology (Handy et al.). Due to the widespread presence of gonadal hormone receptors in the mammalian brain (Barth et al.), HPG‐axis hormones exhibit powerful neuromodulatory effects that influence synaptic plasticity (Haraguchi et al.) and dendritic spine density (Woolley & McEwen). Yet, despite the functional and cellular importance of these hormones, neuroimaging research dedicated to our understanding of the human brain as an endocrine organ makes up a very small percentage of all neuroimaging studies (Taylor et al.).

### Passing on the exercise baton: what can endocrine patients learn from elite athletes? [^115g6E3r]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

5 THE FEMALE ATHLETE

Regular menstrual periods are the barometer of a healthy hormonal milieu for all women of reproductive age. This is normal physiology, regardless of how much physical activity is being taken. Given that a responsive, healthy endocrine network is essential for driving beneficial adaptative changes to exercise, then regular fluctuation in menstrual cycle hormones is essential not only for health but also for exercise performance (Figure 2). Note that the average age of menopause is 45–55 years.

Figure 2
Differential diagnosis of amenorrhoea. FHA, functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea; FSH, follicle‐stimulating hormone; LH, luteinising hormone; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome; POI, premature ovarian insufficiency

Yet, there is surprisingly limited research assessing the impact of the menstrual cycle on exercise performance, and female athletes are sometimes uncertain of effective strategies to put in place to optimize performance throughout the menstrual cycle. Although the ovarian hormones follow a well‐documented variation through the follicular and luteal phases, there are individual differences in timing, hormone concentrations, and tissue responses. This uncertainty in assessing the exact phase of the cycle for an individual was the underlying reason why a recent review concluded that no significant impact of menstrual cycle phase on performance was found. Nevertheless, marginal gains in sport can be important for the podium. This has led to recommendations on standardizing assessment of menstrual cycle timing when conducting research in this field. Machine learning in healthcare could also be of value in endocrine networks where feedback loops and biochronometers render mathematical modelling of these biological systems possible. This approach could also be of value for nonathlete females where female hormones are usually measured on Day 3 of the cycle and so gives time‐limited information on menstrual cycle female hormone health.

### Monitoring reproductive aging in a 5-year prospective study: aggregate and individual changes in steroid hormones and menstrual cycle lengths with age [^114c6oAn]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We describe a 5-year prospective study of reproductive aging, and present analyses of steroid hormone and menstrual cycle changes with age.

Design

Participants were college-educated white women, primarily of northern European ancestry, recruited from the Tremin Research Program on Women's Health (n = 156, 25–58 years). In each of 5 consecutive years, they collected daily urine specimens for 6 months and recorded menstrual bleeds for all months. Urine specimens were assayed for estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G) and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PDG), urinary metabolites of estradiol and progesterone. Using multilevel models, we estimated hormone and cycle-length trajectories for individual women and within- and between-woman variance by age.

Results

At the aggregate level, PDG declined beginning in the 30s, E1G increased into the 40s before declining, and cycle length became more variable with age. Individual-level models revealed substantial hormonal variation across women, in both absolute levels and rates of change. Most women showed declining E1G by the late 40s, declining PDG in the 30s, and increasing mean cycle length in the 40s. Hormonal variation decreased with age; cycle length variation decreased and then increased. Within individual women, cycle lengths were highly variable while hormone levels were more stable. Women differed more from each other in hormone levels than for cycle lengths.

Conclusions

Aggregate-level analyses show general changes in steroid hormones and cycle length but cannot show variation within and across women. Individuals' cycle lengths were too variable to predict hormone levels. Clinicians should obtain more data on individual women's hormonal patterns when determining fertility or menopause treatments.

### Catamenial epilepsy: the menstrual cycle as a clue to predict future refractory seizures [^115FHTB5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Catamenial epilepsy is defined as an increase in the frequency of seizures during a particular phase of the menstrual cycle. The increased seizure frequency is attributed to the cyclic variation and neuroactive properties of endogenous steroid hormones. It is estimated that more than one-third of women with epilepsy experience catamenial seizure exacerbation.

Case Report

We present the case of a young female patient who presented to the emergency department with an increase in seizure frequency that coincided with her menstrual cycle, despite complete medication compliance. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? It is important for the emergency physician to consider catamenial epilepsy in the differential diagnosis for secondary causes of seizure to ensure appropriate follow-up, as well as improve the quality of life of patients suffering from uncontrolled seizures.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^117B48cc]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

HPG‐axis hormones (17β‐estradiol, progesterone, LH, FSH) were associated with significant modulations of WM microstructure and CT. Naturally cycling young women experience widespread brain structural changes in concert with HPG‐axis hormone fluctuations. While modulation of the MTL is more established, structural and functional networks across the brain should be considered in HPG‐axis hormone research. Investigation of brain–hormone relationships across networks is necessary to understand human nervous system functioning on a daily basis, during hormone transition periods, and across the human lifespan.

### Development of ovulatory menstrual cycles in adolescent girls [^112VpRXV]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Irregular menstrual cycles due to anovulation are well described in the first few years after menarche, but the normal developmental trajectory from anovulatory to mature ovulatory cycles during adolescence remains undefined. In this article we review the very limited understanding of this final stage of female reproductive axis development and discuss why additional research in this area is critical to the health of women.

### A novel method for quantifying fluctuations in wearable derived daily cardiovascular parameters across the menstrual cycle [^117YL6Sf]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings should be interpreted in the context of our study's strengths and limitations. First, we restricted our sample to include only regularly menstruating females. Thus, the generalizability of our findings to females with irregular menstrual cycles is unclear. Second, we relied on self-reported data concerning menstruation status and birth control methods, which can be subject to human error. Third, we did not have access to relevant sociocultural variables such as race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status that may influence reproductive physiology and cardiovascular function. Additionally, our study would have benefited from direct hormonal measurements as well as a more thorough characterization of our cohort, inclusive of information regarding potential reproductive and/or cardiovascular health conditions as well as more detailed information regarding the use of hormonal contraception (e.g. duration of use, dose, brand, etc.), all of which may influence cycle-related physiology. These weaknesses are balanced by the size of our dataset: over a million days of data and nearly 50,000 cycles from more than 10,000 regularly menstruating females, making our analysis among the largest to appear in the scientific literature to date. Additionally, our data collection featured state-of-the-art wearable technology that has been validated against gold-standard electrocardiogram and polysomnography measures and has been found to have a low degree of bias and low precision errors.

In conclusion, we present cardiovascular amplitude as a novel method for quantifying the magnitude of cardiovascular fluctuations across the menstrual cycle in a large cohort of free-living menstruating individuals. Cardiovascular amplitude measures were tempered by increasing age, BMI, and birth control use. These findings add to a small but growing body of literature in support of changes in cardiovascular function across the menstrual cycle that mirror and may be causally related to fluctuations in reproductive hormones. Though further research is needed, the novel cardiovascular amplitude metric, derived through wearable technology, demonstrates an accessible and objective indicator of changes in female physiology within and across menstrual cycles, with the potential to inform upon underlying health.

### A novel method for quantifying fluctuations in wearable derived daily cardiovascular parameters across the menstrual cycle [^112LgMYW]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine the magnitude of the fluctuations in RHR and RMSSD across the menstrual cycle, which led to the derivation of a novel metric based on the cardiovascular amplitude of RHR and RMSSD. Secondarily, we sought to determine whether individual factors known to influence cycle-related variability in reproductive hormones (i.e. age, BMI, and birth control) may also be associated with variability in cardiovascular function. Our primary findings are that cardiovascular amplitude fluctuated in a regular and predictable pattern across the menstrual cycle and that fluctuations for RHR and RMSSD were tempered by increased age, hormonal birth control use, and increased BMI.

Consistent with our hypothesis, RHR and RMSSD fluctuated substantially and with consistent patterns across the menstrual cycle, both at the population and individual levels. More specifically, in this large cohort of naturally cycling and regularly menstruating females, the lowest RHR and highest RMSSD values were observed at the end of menstruation (i.e. days 3–7), and the highest RHR and lowest RMSSD values were observed in the late luteal phase and conclusion of the menstrual cycle (i.e. days 25–27). This pattern of menstrual cycle-related fluctuation in RHR and RMSSD metrics is comparable to previous studies from our group, and others, and is likely explained by cycle-related fluctuations in reproductive hormones. Notably, there is an expanding market for objective, home-based cycle tracking methods such as urine and saliva testing to measure hormone levels. Unfortunately, these tests can be costly, burdensome, and are not always accurate. Our findings in a large cohort of free-living individuals add to the existing literature in highlighting the possible value of considering wearable-derived cardiovascular metrics as an easily accessible and reliable indicator of female reproductive hormones across the menstrual cycle.

### Exacerbation of psychosis during the perimenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1167owAb]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Further Research

Future research should take advantage of widely used and scientifically validated menstrual tracking Smartphone apps. These offer more detailed assessment of menstrual cycles which do not rely simply upon self-report of last menstrual period. This could be done in conjunction with validated Smartphone measures of psychotic symptomsto provide standardized phases of the menstrual cycle. Larger sample sizes, of women who are early in their illness, either antipsychotic naïve or minimally treated would further reduce the effect of confounding factors associated with chronic psychosis. The impact of premenstrual tension symptoms should be considered as well as individual variation in sex hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Not only would this allow for a more sensitive measure of menstrual exacerbation at a greater temporal resolution that does not rely on standardization to a 28-day cycle, but individual correlations for each participant could also be used to identify women prone to menstrual exacerbation of psychosis. This subgroup may thus be more prepared to self-manage monthly exacerbations in their illness and could benefit from slight increases in antipsychotic doses during times of increased vulnerability. They may also be suitable for trials of novel targeted hormonal therapy, utilizing emerging estrogen treatments in schizophrenia. A similar strategy has already been employed for women whose epilepsy has been shown to be menstrually exacerbated. Furthermore, identifying whether women whose psychotic illness is vulnerable to menstrual fluctuations are subsequently at increased risk of relapse postpartum and postmenopausal (times of declining estrogen levels) could provide impetus for novel preventative treatments.

### Muscle performance during the menstrual cycle correlates with psychological well-being, but not fluctuations in sex hormones [^115qDYp7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Purpose

We aimed to study variations in strength and power performance during the menstrual cycle (MC) in eumenorrheic young women and during the pill cycle in oral contraceptives (OC) users.

Methods

Forty healthy, normal-weight women between 18 and 35 yr (n = 30 eumenorrheic women; n = 10 OC users) completed this prospective cohort study. Seven to nine times during the MC/pill-cycle, the participants completed a physical performance test series, a questionnaire about psychological well-being, blood sampling, and determination of body mass. The physical tests included isometric handgrip strength, elbow flexor strength, countermovement jump (CMJ) height, and a 10-s Wingate bike test.

Results

No direct correlation was observed between the variations in sex hormones and physical performance parameters. However, positive correlations were observed between physical performance outcomes and self-reported motivation, perception of own physical performance level, pleasure level, and arousal level. CMJ was 6% lower in the late luteal phase (LL) compared with the midluteal phase (ML) (P = 0.04). Wingate peak power was 3% lower in early follicular (EF) compared with the ML (P = 0.04). Furthermore, Wingate average power was 2%–5% lower in LL compared with all other MC phases. In line with these observations, physical pain was higher in EF and LL, and the pleasure level was lower in EF compared with the other MC phases. In OC users, we observed no variation in performance and self-reported parameters between the placebo-pill phase and the OC-pill phase.

Conclusions

Impairments in CMJ and Wingate performance were observed at the end and start of MC compared with other MC phases, which were associated with lower psychological well-being, but not the sex hormone fluctuations.

### The effects of ovarian hormones and emotional eating on changes in weight preoccupation across the menstrual cycle [^114Hu5wA]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous research has shown that fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., estradiol and progesterone) predict the changes in binge eating and emotional eating across the menstrual cycle. However, the extent to which other eating disorder symptoms fluctuate across the menstrual cycle and are influenced by ovarian hormones remains largely unknown. This study sought to examine whether the levels of weight preoccupation vary across the menstrual cycle and whether the changes in ovarian hormones and/or other factors (i.e., emotional eating and negative affect) account for menstrual cycle fluctuations in this eating disorder phenotype.

Method

For 45 consecutive days, 352 women (age, 15–25 years) provided daily ratings of weight preoccupation, negative affect, and emotional eating. Saliva samples were also collected on a daily basis and assayed for levels of estradiol and progesterone using enzyme immunoassay techniques.

Results

Weight preoccupation varied significantly across the menstrual cycle, with the highest levels in the premenstrual and menstrual phases. However, ovarian hormones did not account for within-person changes in weight preoccupation across the menstrual cycle. Instead, the most significant predictor of menstrual cycle changes in weight preoccupation was the change in emotional eating.

Discussion

Fluctuations in weight preoccupation across the menstrual cycle appear to be influenced primarily by emotional eating rather than ovarian hormones. Future research should continue to examine the relationships among ovarian hormones, weight preoccupation, emotional eating, and other core eating disorder symptoms (e.g., body dissatisfaction, compensatory behaviors) in an effort to more fully understand the role of these biological and behavioral factors for the full spectrum of eating pathology.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^112NBVjd]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, a third aim of this study is to assess HPG‐axis hormone‐associated changes in brain volume. No study, to our knowledge, has investigated whether hormone‐related changes in WM microstructure and CT coincide with HPG‐axis hormone‐related changes in estimates of total brain volume. A previous study identified peak GM volume and decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at ovulation (Hagemann et al.); yet, the dynamic relationships between total brain volume, tissue volume, and CSF volume across the menstrual cycle are largely unknown and can provide insight into the potential mechanisms behind short‐term WM and GM structural changes.

The current study addresses documented methodological concerns in the field of menstrual cycle neuroimaging by achieving direct hormone assay, whole brain analyses, and a robust sample size (Dubol et al.). We extend previous work by assaying concentrations of four HPG‐axis hormones (17β‐estradiol, progesterone, LH, and FSH) and recording multidimensional diffusion and T 1 ‐magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) anatomical images from a group of 30 naturally cycling young women. In order to capture significant variation in hormone concentrations, we obtained data for each participant during three estimated menstrual cycle time‐points: menses, ovulation, and the mid‐luteal phase. We then employed a Bayesian framework to test if concentrations of each hormone would credibly associate with within‐individual WM and GM architecture, both at the whole brain and predefined region levels. Finally, we examined whether these hormones are associated with changes in whole brain, tissue, and CSF volume. We hypothesized that we would observe a directly proportional relationship between hormones known to peak at ovulation (17β‐estradiol, LH, FSH) and μFA, as well as an inversely proportional relationship between these hormones and MD. We also predicted that CT would be tied to changes in 17β‐estradiol and progesterone concentrations.

### Menstrual cycle length variation by demographic characteristics from the apple women's health study [^113FbDhA]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Among the 742,747 cycles within 10–90 days from 49,238 AWHS participants under age 50, a total of 29,174 cycles from 18,043 participants were identified as artifacts, which corresponds to an average of 1.62 cycles per individual. This average is comparable to the average of 1.59 cycles per user with artifacts in the previous study. The distribution of median cycle length was largely unchanged before and after the exclusion, suggesting our approach only identified and excluded outliers for each individual (Supplementary Table 11). As shown in Supplementary Figure 3, there was a density peak for cycles that were approximately 21–32 days longer than median cycle length in the raw data, suggesting a possibility of cycle artifacts. After excluding these cycles, this atypical density peak disappeared. In addition, the long right tail in the histogram after exclusion suggested the natural variability of menstrual cycle length was preserved. Supplementary Figure 4 compares the distribution of menstrual cycle length among cycles that were identified as artifacts and those that were not. Most cycles identified as artifacts were within 50–60 days long, which is approximately twice the length of a typical menstrual cycle. These atypically long cycles may be artificially created when a participant missed logging a bleeding period in this interval.

For menstrual cycles tracked after enrollment, we only included those that have been confirmed with no hormone use, pregnancy, or lactation in the monthly surveys. For cycles tracked prior to enrollment, we only included those from participants who confirmed none of these events in the previous 2 years.

### Normative range of various serum hormonal parameters among Indian women of reproductive age: ICMR-PCOS task force study outcome [^114f7PpB]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Women's health requirements are dynamic and pulsatile not only to their growing age but to their sexual and reproductive functions as well. The reproductive phase is the most critical period in a woman's life that alters the physiology of the body, and wherein any dysregulation can lead to serious health consequences. Menstruation-related illnesses and uterine or ovarian diseases are the specific physiological alterations in women throughout this stage of development. Although, the physiological changes that take place during the reproductive phase usually follow a uniform order, the pace of these changes varies depending on external factors (e.g. food habits, lifestyle, etc). The clinical significance of female reproductive physiology is relevant for a variety of clinical problems, including menopause, pregnancy, infertility, and adolescent entrance into childbearing years.

A panel of blood tests including biochemical and hormonal profiles, routinely prescribed by healthcare professionals, are critical in representing the normal functioning of the body. Of late, with the recent advances in quantitative estimation approaches, hormone profiling is in a critical transition period. While the precision in estimation has significantly increased in the recent past, the accuracy of biological reference intervals employed, not only depends upon the assay type but on other indicators as well. Moreover, the hormonal parameters fluctuate significantly depending upon the individual's age, physiological state of the body, gender, ethnicity, nutritional status, lifestyle, and use of medications. Among these factors, age and gender are two pivotal drivers of variations in hormonal parameters. Besides, the biological reference intervals of ready-to-use kits provided by different vendors lack comprehensive information on such issues.

### Mean versus individual hormonal profiles in the menstrual cycle [^114iGGfc]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate hormonal profiles of normal menstrual cycles.

Design

Prospective, descriptive study of a case series.

Setting

University-based natural family planning center.

Patient(S)

Twenty-five natural family planning users for three or more cycles (n = 78). These women were healthy, contraception-free, parous, with regular ovulatory cycles.

Intervention(S)

Immunoassays for estrone glucuronide, LH, and pregnanediol glucuronide were done in daily timed and measured samples of early morning urine.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Estrone glucuronide, LH, and pregnanediol glucuronide levels were measured during the menstrual cycle.

Result(S)

All cycles showed an ovulatory pattern configuring classic hormonal mean curves. Most (77%) differed from the mean curve pattern. All had estrone glucuronide peaks, LH peaks, and pregnanediol glucuronide increases. Estrone glucuronide and LH peaks were not always clear; some lasted more than 1 day (long peak: estrone glucuronide 19%, LH 9%) or fluctuated (double peak: estrone glucuronide 4%, LH 6%; small LH peak: 19%). There were also prepeak estrone glucuronide surges, and pre- and postpeak LH surges. Pregnanediol glucuronide increased more clearly (6% fluctuated 1 day). Some women had repeated cycles with long estrone glucuronide peaks (16%) and fluctuations in LH surge (44%).

Conclusion(S)

Normal menstrual cycle hormonal profiles generally differ from mean curves, which are usually considered standard.

### A novel method for quantifying fluctuations in wearable derived daily cardiovascular parameters across the menstrual cycle [^115Uwq6E]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The present study examined the magnitude of variation in RHR and RMSSD across the menstrual cycle in a large, free-living cohort using a wrist-worn device with motion and photoplethysmography (PPG) capabilities. To investigate the significance and degree of cardiovascular fluctuations across the menstrual cycle, we derived a novel "cardiovascular amplitude" metric, which we subsequently leveraged to explore the influence of individual factors on fluctuations in cardiovascular metrics. We hypothesized that cardiovascular function would fluctuate in a regular and predictable pattern across the menstrual cycle, and that age, BMI, and hormonal birth control would influence the magnitude of cardiovascular amplitude. If validated, monitoring of cardiovascular dynamics via wearable devices could serve as an easily accessible and objective indicator of female physiology with the potential to improve our ability to track cycle health beyond standard journal-based methods.

### Menstruation and the menopausal transition [^116Hidtd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

This paper characterizes changes in menstrual bleeding during perimenopause, including bleeding changes that represent markers of the menopausal transition. Recent results from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation and other cohort studies are reviewed. Emerging data describing subpopulation differences in the transition experience are highlighted. When treating women in the midlife, clinicians should pay careful attention to medical factors, including both conditions and treatments, that may increase menstrual blood loss or alter menstrual cycle characteristics sufficiently to obscure the onset of the menopausal transition or the final menstrual period.

### A novel method for quantifying fluctuations in wearable derived daily cardiovascular parameters across the menstrual cycle [^111WsZYt]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, knowledge of changes in cardiovascular function across the menstrual cycle and how these changes may inform upon underlying health is limited. Utilizing wrist-worn biometric data we developed a novel measure to quantify and investigate the cardiovascular fluctuation (i.e. cardiovascular amplitude) within resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (RMSSD) across 11,590 participants and 45,811 menstrual cycles. Within participants, RHR and RMSSD fluctuated in a regular pattern throughout the menstrual cycle, with population RHR min and RMSSD max at cycle day 5, RHR max at day 26, and RMSSD min at day 27. Cardiovascular amplitude was attenuated (p < 0.05) in older participants and participants using birth control, suggesting the novel metric may mirror differences in hormonal fluctuations in these cohorts. Longitudinal tracking of cardiovascular amplitude may offer accessible non-invasive monitoring of female physiology and underlying health across the menstrual cycle.

### Understanding women's sex hormone physiology – A priority in diabetes care [^115wrDNf]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Women experience profound, dynamic changes in sex hormone exposure throughout their lifespan that directly influence diabetes pathophysiology and management. In the pre‐pubertal period, sex hormone levels remain consistently low, but with the onset of puberty, women begin experiencing the remarkable fluctuations characteristic of reproductive biology. The menstrual cycle alone produces 5‐ to 50‐fold variations in oestradiol and progesterone, while hormonal contraceptives, except for local intrauterine devices, alter these patterns. Pregnancy elevates oestradiol 100‐ to 200‐fold and progesterone 15‐fold, with assisted reproduction achieving even higher levels. The menopausal transition then precipitates a sharp decline in oestradiol exposure to levels that actually fall below those of age‐matched men. While menopausal hormone therapy can restore sex hormone concentrations approximating premenopausal follicular phase levels, the achieved exposure shows substantial variability depending on formulation specifics, dosage and administration route. Additionally, body weight changes represent another important modifier of oestrogen exposure, with weight loss consistently associated with decreased oestrogen levels.

Beyond their reproduction functions, female sex hormones, particularly oestradiol, interact extensively with glucose and energy metabolism pathways. Oestradiol enhances insulin sensitivity, increases insulin secretion, improves β‐cell viability, delays gastric emptying and promotes favourable adipose tissue distribution — all collectively promoting glucose homeostasis. These metabolic advantages are further amplified by oestradiol's critical role in modulating energy expenditure and promoting satiety. While many mechanistic insights originate from preclinical models, human evidence from studies of the impact of menopause and anti‐oestrogenic cancer therapies on diabetes incidence, and investigations on the glycaemic effect of oestradiol replacement (including menopausal hormone therapy) generally corroborate the glycaemic benefits of oestradiol. In contrast to oestradiol's beneficial effects, progesterone demonstrates a less well‐characterized and predominantly unfavourable metabolic profile, with its characteristic mid‐luteal phase surge consistently linked to decreased insulin sensitivity. Similarly, both androgenic progestins (frequently utilized in hormonal contraceptives) and states of hyperandrogenism, as clinically seen in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), have been associated with impaired insulin sensitivity.

### Association between menstrual cycle phase and metabolites in healthy, regularly menstruating women in UK biobank, and effect modification by inflammatory markers and risk factors for metabolic disease [^112Xa8o6]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of impaired metabolic control is increasing in pre-menopausal women. Impaired metabolic control is typically characterised by decreased insulin sensitivity, fasting hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia. Additionally, recent evidence indicates that glycaemic and lipidemic variability are integral components of metabolic control. Dysregulation in parameters of metabolic control contributes to the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders, such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Therefore, it is crucial to examine factors that affect metabolic control in pre-menopausal women.

The menstrual cycle is a fundamental biological rhythm governing female physiology in pre-menopausal women. Regulated across an approximately 4-weekly duration, the menstrual cycle is characterised by cyclical fluctuations in pituitary hormones (luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) and ovarian hormones (estradiol and progesterone). Ovarian hormones exert regulatory roles within lipid and glucose homeostasis. Correspondingly, previous research has reported cyclical variation in parameters of metabolic control across the menstrual cycle, in association with fluctuations in ovarian hormone profiles. However, findings are inconsistent; other studies report no effect of the menstrual cycle phase on parameters of metabolic control. These inconsistencies may be caused by the small sample sizes and heterogenous female populations recruited in these studies. Recent research demonstrates that variation in metabolic control across the menstrual cycle differs by categories of adiposity, cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity. However, further research is required to elucidate the role of these factors in the relationship between menstrual cycle phase and metabolites.

One mechanism which may contribute to the variation in metabolic control across the menstrual cycle is low-grade inflammation. Several inflammatory cytokines undergo rhythmic fluctuation across the menstrual cycle, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-4 (IL-4), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and tumour necrosis alpha (TNF-a). Low-grade inflammation is positively associated with impaired metabolic control, including insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia. Together, these are suggestive of inflammation being a potential mediator of the variation in metabolic control across the menstrual cycle; however, further research is needed to elucidate this role.

This study aimed to investigate the association between the menstrual cycle phase and metabolite concentrations. Following this, we aimed to explore whether adiposity, fitness, physical activity and inflammatory markers mediate and/or moderate these associations.

### Variability in the hormonally estimated fertile phase of the menstrual cycle [^114n75oi]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the variability in length of the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle with 140 participants who produced 1,060 cycles with an electronic hormonal fertility monitor. The length of the fertile phase, as defined by the first day with a threshold level of urinary E3G and ending with a second day above a threshold of LH, varied from < 1 to > 7 days, with the most frequent length being 3 days.

### Methodological recommendations for menstrual cycle research in sports and exercise [^113emXm8]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this review is to provide methodological recommendations for menstrual cycle research in exercise science and sports medicine based on a review of recent literature. Research in this area is growing but often reports conflicting results, and it is proposed that some of this may be explained by methodological issues.

Methods

This review examined the menstrual cycle verification methods used in recent literature on exercise performance over the menstrual cycle identified through a literature search of PubMed and SportDiscus from 2008 until 2018.

Results

Potential changes over the menstrual cycle are likely related to hormone fluctuations; however, only 44% of the selected studies measured the actual concentrations of the female steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone. It was shown that the likely inclusion of participants with anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles in combination with small participant numbers has affected results in recent menstrual cycle research and, consequently, our understanding of this area.

Conclusion

To improve the quality of future menstrual cycle research, it is recommended that a combination of three methods is used to verify menstrual cycle phase: the calendar-based counting method combined with urinary luteinizing hormone surge testing and the measurement of serum estrogen and progesterone concentrations at the time of testing. A strict luteal phase verification limit of > 16 nmol·L for progesterone should be set. It is also recommended that future research should focus on the inclusion of the late follicular estrogen peak. It is envisaged that these methodological recommendations will assist in clarifying some of the disagreement around the effects of the menstrual cycle on exercise performance and other aspects of exercise science and sports medicine.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^113YFedW]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

2.7 Statistical analyses

All analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.7.10). We first aimed to verify that our session timing successfully captured group‐level natural variation in gonadal steroid hormones (17β‐estradiol, progesterone) and pituitary gonadotropins (LH, FSH) consistent with known typical menstrual cycle‐related hormone fluctuations for young, naturally cycling women (Stricker et al.). To do this, one‐way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) using the Pingouin (0.5.3) package were conducted that examined the effect of session type (menses, ovulation, mid‐luteal) on HPG‐axis hormone concentration. Then, to determine specific session‐level differences in HPG‐axis concentrations, we conducted post hoc paired‐sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests (statannot 0.2.3), which controlled for the non‐normality of underlying HPG‐axis hormone concentration distributions. Differences were considered significant if they met a Bonferroni‐adjusted p ‐value of p < .0167 (p = .05/3 sessions).

### The influence of hormonal fluctuation on inflammatory bowel disease symptom severity – A cross-sectional cohort study [^112MZQhJ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report changes in symptoms in association with hormonal changes during menses, pregnancy, and hormonal contraceptive use, suggesting a hormonal influence on disease activity. We aimed to identify and characterize IBD symptom fluctuations in women during times of hormonal variation.

Methods

From June 2012 through September 2012, women enrolled in Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners, an online Internet cohort of patients with IBD, were invited to participate in this study. Using a 5-point Likert scale, participants were asked to rate symptom changes during their menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and after menopause. Clinical and demographic differences were assessed using univariate and multivariable methods.

Results

A total of 1,203 female patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) participated (64% CD, 34% UC). Over half of the women with IBD reported worsening symptoms during menses. Symptom changes were similar between women with CD vs UC, except in pregnancy, where symptom worsening during pregnancy was more commonly seen in UC than CD (P = 0.02). Overall, women reporting symptom worsening were younger at the time of IBD diagnosis (P < 0.01), had lower quality of life (SIBDQ) scores (P < 0.01), and had a higher BMI (25 vs 24) than women without symptom worsening.

Conclusions

Women with IBD report changes in symptom severity during times of hormone fluctuation. Further clarification of the role of hormones in IBD is warranted in order to understand these relationships and to identify potential management strategies for women with IBD and hormonally sensitive gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Menstrual cycle length variation by demographic characteristics from the apple women's health study [^117XgB92]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Menstrual characteristics are important signs of women's health. Here we examine the variation of menstrual cycle length by age, ethnicity, and body weight using 165,668 cycles from 12,608 participants in the US using mobile menstrual tracking apps. After adjusting for all covariates, mean menstrual cycle length is shorter with older age across all age groups until age 50 and then became longer for those age 50 and older. Menstrual cycles are on average 1.6 (95%CI: 1.2, 2.0) days longer for Asian and 0.7 (95%CI: 0.4, 1.0) days longer for Hispanic participants compared to white non-Hispanic participants. Participants with BMI ≥ 40kg/m² have 1.5 (95%CI: 1.2, 1.8) days longer cycles compared to those with BMI between 18.5 and 25kg/m². Cycle variability is the lowest among participants aged 35–39 but are considerably higher by 46% (95%CI: 43%, 48%) and 45% (95%CI: 41%, 49%) among those aged under 20 and between 45–49. Cycle variability increase by 200% (95%CI: 191%, 210%) among those aged above 50 compared to those in the 35–39 age group. Compared to white participants, those who are Asian and Hispanic have larger cycle variability. Participants with obesity also have higher cycle variability. Here we confirm previous observations of changes in menstrual cycle pattern with age across reproductive life span and report new evidence on the differences of menstrual variation by ethnicity and obesity status. Future studies should explore the underlying determinants of the variation in menstrual characteristics.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^114heY3G]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 ‐axis hormone concentrations

In the first step of our analyses, we verified that HPG‐axis hormone concentrations varied across the three experimental sessions coinciding with estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, and mid‐luteal). For our study population, group mean participant cycle length (average across all tracked cycles for a given participant) was 31.20 days (range = 24.44–43.82). A summary of median HPG‐axis hormone concentration values by estimated phase can be found in Table 1. We confirmed that, across estimated cycle phases, HPG‐axis hormone concentrations significantly (p < .05) varied: 17β‐estradiol (F = 40.20, p < .001, η² = .47), progesterone (F = 65.93, p < .001, η² = .61), LH (F = 38.65, p < .001, η² = .47), and FSH (F = 47.69, p < .001, η² = .48).

### Original salivary sex hormone data of naturally menstruating athletes and hormonal contraceptive users [^114nCKvc]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Female sex hormonal variations can characterise, in terms of timing and amplitude, the nature of the menstrual cycle. These hormones, including oestrogen and progesterone, fluctuate throughout the natural menstrual cycle (MC) or are downregulated during hormonal contraception (HC). The eumenorrhoeic cycle begins in menses when levels of oestrogen and progesterone are low. During the follicular phase (FP, lasting from day 1 to ovulation), oestrogens rise until they peak just before ovulation and decrease shortly after. During the luteal phase (LP, from ovulation to the next menses), progesterone is more abundantly produced: it peaks in the middle of the LP and drops at the end when, at the same time, oestrogens rise and fall again. Hormonal dysfunctions can occur during menstrual cycles, as especially exercising women show a high prevalence of menstrual disturbances.

Not only do oestrogens and progesterone fluctuate, but also testosterone fluctuates and is produced in the ovaries. It is mainly bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Only a small fraction (1–2%) circulates as nonprotein-bound free testosterone. Free testosterone only enters cells and exerts androgen activity. Several studies have described changes in free testosterone concentrations during MC. For Cook et al, testosterone concentrations rise from the LP to the ovulatory phase and fall during LP. Other authors found serum levels of total and free testosterone similar in FP and LP, with a slight pre-ovulatory increaseconcomitantly with 17β-estradiol fluctuations (ie, the most abundant oestrogen) in women with normal menses. Oestrogen and testosterone have anabolic action on the body, which could be linked to similar fluctuations in MC phases. Studies of testosterone levels have provided inconclusive and mixed results regarding systematic changes in testosterone throughout the cycle. Although methods and study designs differed between studies, sample sizes appeared small, and some studies used rough estimates to determine the cycle phase. Knowledge about free testosterone variations during MC seems insufficient.

### The effects of female sex hormones on the human cornea across a woman's life cycle [^112chY4K]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Variations in hormonal levels

The follicular phase begins on day one of the menstrual cycle and is characterized by the onset of menstruation and continues until ovulation. Estrogen is produced by ovarian follicles activated by the rising levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Most active follicles undergo atresia, typically leaving just one to mature. Once estrogen levels reach a critical point, positive-feedback modulation leads to an LH surge, which allows the mature follicle to rupture and, in the process, release an egg from the ovary for possible fertilization. This process, known as ovulation, typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day cycle. The luteal phase, typically spanning from day 14 to 28, begins with the development of the corpus luteum from the ovarian follicle and ends with pregnancy or the abolition of the corpus luteum. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum becomes the corpus albicans, and levels of progesterone and estrogen fall, thus stimulating FSH to recruit follicles for the next follicular phase. Estrogen and progesterone levels differ significantly during the follicular, ovulatory, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Estrogen levels are lowest at the follicular phase and highest at ovulation. Progesterone levels are lowest at the follicular phase and most elevated at the luteal phase.

Intraocular pressure

IOP is both a risk factor for the development of glaucoma and a biomarker utilized in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Age, race, gender, and sex hormones are among the factors that govern the levels of IOP. These factors may influence the rate of aqueous production, the function of outflow pathways through the trabecular meshwork, related structures, and episcleral venous system, and corneal curvature and thickness. Notably, fluctuations in female sex hormones have been linked to changes in IOP. In a study by Goldich et al. that included 22 women, IOP measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry increased at ovulation compared with the end of the menstrual cycle, with a difference of around 1 mmHg (p = 0.05). Although these changes may be associated with the fluctuations in female sex hormones, Mishra et al. suggested that the concurrent surge in systemic antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels produced by the pituitary gland around ovulation might also contribute to the thickness of the cornea by increasing tissue hydration.

### Design and methods of the apple women's health study: a digital longitudinal cohort study [^117RAbLt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple factors influence the menstrual cycle length, duration of flow, and cyclicity. Common factors include stress, nutrition and body weight, physical activity, and combination lifestyle factors. Furthermore, menstrual cycle function is an indicator of health and longevity. For example, bone density is built and maintained in the presence of cyclic ovarian function. Fertility, terminal breast differentiation, and aspects of cognition and memory are also influenced by menstrual status and function. – The endocrine pathways involved in menstrual cycle physiology include the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and a healthy functioning of the thyroid and adrenal glands; the anatomic structures necessary include the uterus, endometrium, and ovaries.

Furthermore, irregular patterns or the absence of menstrual cycles can serve as indicators of underlying health problems. The presence of irregular menstrual cycles may indicate hormonal disturbances, including thyroid disorders, prolactinomas, systemic illness (including cancers), anatomic pathology such as uterine fibroids, polyps, or adenomyosis; it has also has been linked to an increase in all-cause mortality. Abnormalities in the bleeding length and amount affect up to 30% of those who menstruate. The existing data on the menstrual cycle characteristics, including the normal distributions of the cycle length and bleeding days, are based on prior and well-designed but demographically-limited cohorts. Little is known about how these conditions vary across subpopulations or how they relate to future health conditions. An understanding of population-based variation in menstrual cycle characteristics is lacking.

The objectives of this study are to (1) advance the understanding of the menstrual cycle, including how it relates to exercise, sleep, environmental, behavioral, and other physiological processes, and (2) inform screening and risk assessment for gynecologic health conditions using menstrual cycle, reproductive, health, and sensor data. We present here the design of the Apple Women's Health Study (AWHS) and the characteristics of the first 10,000 participants enrolled in the study, including their follow-up after 6 months of participation.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^111BFmt2]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The menstrual cycle is a complex physiological process involving hormonal changes and interactions across multiple body systems. One notable pattern that has been reported in clinical literature is the biphasic fluctuation of resting-state body temperature, with temperatures higher post-ovulation than pre-ovulation. This fluctuation is influenced by the interplay of hormones such as estrogen, which lowers temperature, and progesterone, which has a thermogenic effect throughout the menstrual cycle. These hormonal dynamics regulate the release of luteinizing hormone (LH). Estrogen provides positive feedback in the late follicular phase to trigger the mid-cycle LH peaks, and progesterone inhibits LH release during the luteal phase while counteracting the positive feedback effect of elevated estrogen on LH.

This biphasic fluctuation pattern has led to the development of algorithms that rely on periodic changes in body temperature for purposes such as menstrual cycle tracking, pregnancy preparation, and contraception. Previous research has typically relied on resting-state temperature measured at internal body sites like the esophagus or rectum because these sites closely reflect the thermal characteristics of central arterial or mixed venous blood. However, measuring temperature at these sites can be inconvenient due to their invasiveness. Recent work has been done using peripheral body temperature (PBT) obtained from self-monitoring consumer devices like smartwatches and rings –, yet little has been done to explore either the relationship between PBT and hormone variations or the effectiveness of PBT in capturing anticipated patterns across the menstrual cycle.

### The underlying mechanisms of comorbid anxiety and depression among young women: evidence from brain structure and hormone [^1163XQet]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

Further, due to research needs, saliva samples from women are collected for hormone level analysis. However, hormone levels are not only influenced by emotions but also by the menstrual cycle of women. Therefore, in order to eliminate the interference of the cycle on women, we selected women with regular periods and collected saliva uniformly during their premenstrual phase (expected within a week before menstruation). A regular menstrual cycle was defined as lasting 21–35 days, with fluctuations within 7 days, and bleeding lasting 3–7 days.

This study was approved by the Ethical Evaluation of Research Projects at the Department of Psychology in the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Nanjing University. All participants provided written informed consent, and each was paid 150 yuan for participation. All procedures contributing to this work were performed following the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 2008.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^1143QQHx]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The use of apps that record detailed menstrual cycle data presents a new opportunity to study the menstrual cycle. The aim of this study is to describe menstrual cycle characteristics observed from a large database of cycles collected through an app and investigate associations of menstrual cycle characteristics with cycle length, age and body mass index (BMI). Menstrual cycle parameters, including menstruation, basal body temperature (BBT) and luteinising hormone (LH) tests as well as age and BMI were collected anonymously from real-world users of the Natural Cycles app. We analysed 612,613 ovulatory cycles with a mean length of 29.3 days from 124,648 users. The mean follicular phase length was 16.9 days (95% CI: 10–30) and mean luteal phase length was 12.4 days (95% CI: 7–17). Mean cycle length decreased by 0.18 days (95% CI: 0.17–0.18, R² = 0.99) and mean follicular phase length decreased by 0.19 days (95% CI: 0.19–0.20, R² = 0.99) per year of age from 25 to 45 years. Mean variation of cycle length per woman was 0.4 days or 14% higher in women with a BMI of over 35 relative to women with a BMI of 18.5–25. This analysis details variations in menstrual cycle characteristics that are not widely known yet have significant implications for health and well-being. Clinically, women who wish to plan a pregnancy need to have intercourse on their fertile days. In order to identify the fertile period it is important to track physiological parameters such as basal body temperature and not just cycle length.

### Relationship between insulin sensitivity and menstrual cycle is modified by BMI, fitness, and physical activity in NHANES [^113bwPxm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The onset and severity of insulin resistance are associated with a range of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, including, sex, age, adiposity, physical inactivity, and cardiovascular fitness. Women exhibit lower fasting plasma glucose levels, but greater impairment in glucose tolerance compared to men. Within adipose tissue, women have greater insulin-stimulated glucose and fatty acid uptake compared to men. While body mass index (BMI) and age are positively associated with insulin resistance, in women insulin resistance typically occurs at a higher BMI and higher age compared with men. Moreover, low fitness has a greater association with insulin resistance in overweight women compared with overweight men.

Reports have demonstrated a clear mechanistic role of sex hormones underpinning sexual dimorphism in insulin resistance. Insulin sensitivity has been positively associated with estradiol and negatively associated with progesterone in rats. This suggests that hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle in humans may play a role in insulin sensitivity. However, strategies targeting the prevention and treatment of reduced insulin sensitivity rarely consider sex and none consider the role of the menstrual cycle.

The menstrual cycle is a fundamental biological rhythmic cycle occurring in females of reproductive age, composed of the ovarian and uterine cycles. The ovarian cycle, consisting of follicular, ovulatory, and luteal phases, is concerned with oocyte maturation and release, while the uterine cycle, consisting of menstruation, proliferative, and secretory phases, is concerned with preparing the uterine lining for possible oocyte implantation in the event of fertilization. The ovarian cycle and uterine cycle occur in a coordinated and concurrent manner; herein we will refer to menstrual cycle phase in terms of the follicular and luteal phases. The average cycle length is 29 days, although this varies between individuals, with cycle lengths of 24 to 35 days considered normal and healthy. Within an individual, typical cycle length declines as age increases. The menstrual cycle is governed by rhythmic fluctuations of hormones within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis; gonadotropin-releasing hormone, pituitary hormones (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]), and ovarian hormones (estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone). However, the effect of the menstrual cycle on physiology is underresearched and in fact is frequently cited as a barrier toward the inclusion of women in research projects.

### Lifelong menstrual histories are typically erratic and trending: a taxonomy [^117RsYrb]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Menstrual cycles are composites of complex events; the data describing them are correspondingly rich. We seek to quantitatively represent menstrual histories from menarche to menopause and to evaluate the clinical belief that regular and stable cycle lengths are the most normative histories.

Design

Using prospective data from the Tremin Trust, we classified the menstrual histories of 628 women as very stable (type I), stable but with greater variability in cycle lengths (type II), oscillating and erratic with a downward trend in cycle length (type III), oscillating and erratic with no downward trend in cycle length (type IV), or highly erratic and variable (type V). Classification criteria were created by examining basic summary statistics of menstrual cycle lengths. Specifically, we identified key features describing variability of median cycle length, the mean of the interquartile range, the consistency of the interquartile range, the slope of median cycle lengths, and the number of stable 5-year intervals between ages 15 and 45+.

Results

We present the first characterization of full menstrual histories. Our taxonomy captures the essential features of menstrual bleeding patterns for a heterogeneous population. Persistently stable histories (types I and II) were seen in only 28% of the women; erratic histories (types III through V) characterized 72%. When examining all participants, significant differences were seen in age at menarche (P < 0.05), age at menopause (P < 0.01), and number of births (P < 0.01) between these stable and erratic groups.

Conclusions

Although clinicians have traditionally thought of "normal" menstrual histories as being regular and stable, the distribution of women in our five categories suggest that variable histories are most common. Clinically, these results may suggest the need for a paradigm shift in what gynecologists view as normal and abnormal menstrual cycle histories.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone and inhibin B variability during normal menstrual cycles [^115Fezti]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) variation across normal menstrual cycles.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Academic environment.

Patient(S)

Twenty regularly menstruating women.

Intervention(S)

Serum AMH and inhibin B assayed daily during one normal menstrual cycle.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Intracycle variability of AMH and inhibin B.

Result(S)

Data were classified into quartiles of AMH area-under-the-curve (AUCs). Mean AMH AUC was 15.7 ng/mL for quartile 1 versus 43.5, 80.9 and 144.9 ng/mL for quartiles 2, 3, and 4. Mean AMH levels (ng/mL) were 0.67, 1.71, 3.02, and 5.33, respectively. There was no variation in quartile 1 AMH rate of change from stochastic modeling, but in quartiles 2 to 4, there were increased rates of change in days 2 to 7. Women in quartile 1 had the lowest mean inhibin B (24.2 pg/mL vs. 44.3, 43.2, and 42.2 pg/mL), and had shorter menstrual cycles (24.6 days) than women in quartiles 3 and 4 (28.2 and 28.4 days).

Conclusion(S)

There were two menstrual cycle patterns of AMH. The "aging ovary" pattern included low AMH levels with little variation, lower inhibin B, and shorter cycle lengths. The "younger ovary" pattern included higher AMH levels with significant variation days 2 to 7, suggesting that for women with AMH > 1 ng/mL, the interpretation of AMH levels is contingent upon the day of the menstrual cycle on which the specimen is obtained.

### Serum antimüllerian hormone levels remain stable throughout the menstrual cycle and after oral or vaginal administration of synthetic sex steroids [^114AeSdN]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether oral or vaginal administration of contraceptive hormones might affect antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels.

Design

Prospective trial with women recruited by advertisement. Women who wished contraception were randomized between oral or vaginal estroprogestative contraception, and those who did not choose contraception were included in the control group.

Setting

Fertility clinic of a tertiary university hospital.

Patient(S)

Twenty-four young, healthy volunteer women with regular cycles who had received no hormonal contraception for at least 3 months before the study.

Intervention(S)

Oral or vaginal estroprogestative contraception from day 5 to 25 of a menstrual cycle versus no contraception.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Intercycle and intracycle variations of serum AMH levels in normally ovulating volunteers and following the initiation of oral or vaginal estroprogestative contraception.

Result(S)

Fluctuations of AMH levels observed during the menstrual cycle remained within cycle-to-cycle variability in cycling controls and in women receiving oral or vaginal contraception.

Conclusion(S)

Our findings confirm that AMH levels remain steady during the menstrual cycle and indicate that they are unaffected by exogenous sex steroids used for contraception whether administered orally or vaginally.

### Fluctuations in metabolites and bone markers across the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic women and oral contraceptive users [^112SKxYr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Little is known about changes in circulating metabolites during the menstrual cycle and how use of oral contraceptives (OCs) affects these changes.

Objectives

To study fluctuations in circulating metabolite and bone marker levels during the menstrual/pill cycle in eumenorrheic women and OC users.

Methods

Plasma samples were collected from 28 eumenorrheic women and 10 OC users at 7 to 9 time points across a menstrual/pill cycle. Longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses were performed to examine the cycle- and OC-induced variations in the plasma metabolite and bone turnover marker levels.

Results

In eumenorrheic women, plasma levels of alanine, glutamine, threonine, and tyrosine varied significantly across the menstrual cycle, and all dropped to the lowest level around day 21 of the menstrual cycle. These amino acid concentrations were negatively correlated with fluctuations in progesterone and/or estrogen levels. A between-group analysis showed that plasma levels of alanine, glutamine, glycine, proline, and tyrosine were lower in OC users than in nonusers. Concomitantly, plasma C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) levels were lower in OC users. Intriguingly, when all data were pooled, variations in CTX and PINP levels were positively correlated with fluctuations in proline and glycine concentrations (r > 0.5 or 0.3 < r < 0.5, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The menstrual cycle and the use of OCs alter plasma levels of metabolites and bone turnover markers in young women. While the impact of these findings remains to be established, the lower glycine level among OC users and the accompanying lower CTX level supports that the use of OCs lowers collagen turnover in young women and may thereby have long-term implications for bone health among OC users.

### What pre-clinical rat models can tell Us about anxiety across the menstrual cycle in healthy and clinically anxious humans [^112VUcNW]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Other methodological considerations include the importance of measuring for hormonal contraceptive use, like the oral contraceptive pill, which introduces high and relatively steady levels of synthetic oestradiol and progestins. The oral contraceptive pill chronically suppresses ovulation and inhibits ovarian production of oestradiol and progesterone. Several studies did not assess hormonal contraceptive use (e.g.), which significantly compromises the internal validity of the study because changes in anxiety symptoms observed over a monthly timeframe in people taking hormonal contraceptives cannot be attributed to the impact of the menstrual cycle. Moreover, an underutilised but possibly useful approach is to compare changes in anxiety symptoms between cycling people and those taking the oral contraceptive pill. Such a design would enable hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of menstrual-related symptom change to be assessed. For example, if cyclic changes in hormones mediate symptom change, then the magnitude of symptom variance over time should be reduced in those taking the oral contraceptive pill (who have steady levels of hormones) relative to cycling people. A conceptually similar idea is to compare symptom change in cycling people during ovulatory versus anovulatory cycles, which differ in their hormonal profiles (e.g. anovulatory cycles have lower progesterone) and thus provide a comparison condition to enable the assessment of hypotheses regarding mechanisms of menstrual fluctuations in anxiety. For example, a within-person analysis in a longitudinal study revealed a greater peri-menstrual increase in self-reported anxiety for ovulatory versus anovulatory cycles. Data from anovulatory cycles could easily be examined via within-person analyses over multiple cycles or between-person analyses over a single cycle.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^115bpP9Q]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Cyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T 1 -weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, and mid-luteal) to investigate whether HPG-axis hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17β-estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (μFA; 17β-estradiol: β₁ = 0.145, highest density interval (HDI) = [0.211, 0.4]; LH: β₁ = 0.111, HDI = [0.157, 0.364]), while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to CT (β₁ = 0.162, HDI = [0.115, 0.678]). Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing relationships with mean diffusivity (D iso) and CT. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Finally, progesterone was associated with increased tissue (β₁ = 0.66, HDI = [0.607, 15.845]) and decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; β₁ = -0.749, HDI = [-11.604, -0.903]) volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human WM microstructure and CT coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms. Effects were observed in both classically known HPG-axis receptor-dense regions (medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex) and in other regions located across frontal, occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. Our results suggest that HPG-axis hormone fluctuations may have significant structural impacts across the entire brain.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^112bFyuF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Most, but certainly not all, ovulatory disorders are suggested by the presence of symptoms of AUB, ranging from complete absence (amenorrhea) to infrequent or irregular onset of menstrual blood flow. Secondary amenorrhea is generally defined as the cessation of menstruation for 6 months consecutively after at least one previous spontaneous menstrual bleed. Using data from extensive epidemiological studies, FIGO has previously determined that for those aged 18–45 years, and using the 5%–95% percentiles from large‐scale population studies, the normal frequency of menses is 24–38 days. Those with a cycle length of fewer than 24 days are deemed "frequent" while those whose cycle length is more than 38 days "infrequent", a term designed to replace oligomenorrhea. Even in this category, regularity varies by age; for those aged either 18–25 or 42–45 years, the difference between the shortest and longest cycle should be 9 days or less, while for those aged 26–41 years, it is 7 days or less. Regardless, those with infrequent or irregular menstrual bleeding should be considered to have an ovulatory disorder.

Diagnosing the presence of an ovulatory disorder at the extremes of reproductive age can be challenging, depending on the perception of what is normal. For postmenarcheal girls aged under 18 years, infrequent menstrual bleeding or irregular menstrual cycles suggesting ovulatory dysfunction are common, with available evidence suggesting that the individual's "normal" cycle length may not be established until the sixth year after menarche. During this pubertal transition, ovulatory dysfunction impacts about 50% of adolescent girls in the first year after menarche with a cycle length that is typically in the range of 21–45 days, but sometimes is as short as 20 days or may even exceed 60 days. In the years after menarche, these variations change such that 6 years later, the range is similar to those of adults. These issues can be explored in detail elsewhere. However, it should be remembered that while common, and even "normal", the individual's experience with this transition can be disruptive at a vulnerable time in their social, psychological, and physical development.

### NAMS 2019 pre-meeting symposium, September 2019, Chicago Illinois: the perimenopause [^112ckXh4]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

The North American Menopause Society held the 2019 Pre-Meeting Symposium on September 25, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois, to review the current state of the science related to the physiology of the perimenopause and to address management of the most prevalent and pressing clinical issues. The perimenopause, as defined by the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop + 10, encompasses the menopause transition as well as the first year following menopause, the final menstrual period. This phase in the continuum of women's reproductive lives had been one of the least well understood. Fortunately, contributions from a number of prospective, longitudinal, decades-long studies have provided a better understanding of the perimenopause, whereas posing important new questions related to symptom interaction and linkages between symptoms and long-term health. There is now added clarity to distinguish the effects of reproductive hormonal changes from aging. The variation in symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, among women over time including differences in experiences by ethnicity and race, provides paradigm shifts in clinical perspective. Refinements in understanding the character, timing, and potential predictive markers for menstrual cycles during the transition have emerged. From the perspective of myriad clinical management challenges, significant progress in recommendations for evaluation and therapeutic approaches has been achieved. Finally, recognizing the menopause transition as an opportunity to initiate positive lifestyle changes to enhance future health was emphasized.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^111G1EaZ]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cyclic fluctuations in hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG‐axis) hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system. Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain. In a study of 30 naturally cycling women, we employed multidimensional diffusion and T 1 ‐weighted imaging during three estimated menstrual cycle phases (menses, ovulation, and mid‐luteal) to investigate whether HPG‐axis hormone concentrations co‐fluctuate with alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure, cortical thickness (CT), and brain volume. Across the whole brain, 17β‐estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were directly proportional to diffusion anisotropy (μFA; 17β‐estradiol: β₁ = 0.145, highest density interval (HDI) = [0.211, 0.4]; LH: β₁ = 0.111, HDI = [0.157, 0.364]), while follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) was directly proportional to CT (β₁ = 0.162, HDI = [0.115, 0.678]). Within several individual regions, FSH and progesterone demonstrated opposing relationships with mean diffusivity (D iso) and CT. These regions mainly reside within the temporal and occipital lobes, with functional implications for the limbic and visual systems. Finally, progesterone was associated with increased tissue (β₁ = 0.66, HDI = [0.607, 15.845]) and decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; β₁ = −0.749, HDI = [−11.604, −0.903]) volumes, with total brain volume remaining unchanged. These results are the first to report simultaneous brain‐wide changes in human WM microstructure and CT coinciding with menstrual cycle‐driven hormone rhythms. Effects were observed in both classically known HPG‐axis receptor‐dense regions (medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex) and in other regions located across frontal, occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. Our results suggest that HPG‐axis hormone fluctuations may have significant structural impacts across the entire brain.

### Symptom fluctuation in bulimia nervosa: relation to menstrual-cycle phase and cortisol levels [^117H29qs]. Psychological Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals with bulimia nervosa report significant symptom fluctuation, and some studies have suggested a premenstrual exacerbation of binge frequency. The purpose of this study is to explore the hormonal correlates of symptom fluctuation in bulimia nervosa.

Method

For five consecutive weeks (one full menstrual cycle), eight women with bulimia nervosa and eight non-eating-disordered control women collected morning saliva samples and recorded several mood characteristics; the bulimic women also recorded binge and purge episodes. Subsequently, salivary cortisol and androgen levels were determined by radioimmunoassay.

Results

Bulimic symptoms were exacerbated in both the mid-luteal and premenstrual phases, when compared with the follicular and ovulatory phases (F(3,21) = 3.76, P = 0.026; contrast analysis t(7) = 3.47, P < 0.01). Fluctuation in cortisol was closely correlated with fluctuation of bulimic symptoms, with elevatedcortisol secretion following symptom exacerbation (r(24) = 0.64, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Bulimic symptom fluctuation appears to be related to two hormonal phenomena — phase of the menstrual cycle and cortisol secretion — with menstrual-cycle phase influencing bulimic symptom severity, and bulimic symptom severity effecting increases in cortisol secretion. Improved understanding of the hormonal causes and consequences of symptom fluctuation may lead to improved psychological and pharmacological treatments for bulimia nervosa.

### The normal menstrual cycle [^11611Ehq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The normal ovulatory menstrual cycle requires the presence of a mature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and highly coordinated hormonal feedback loops. Consisting of three phases (follicular, ovulatory, and luteal), the normal menstrual cycle results in the formation of a mature follicle and release of an oocyte during each cycle, with menses occurring in the absence of fertilization. While adolescents may initially experience anovulatory cycles following menarche, the vast majority of cycles will be fairly regular, lasting 21 to 45 days in length with an average of three to seven days of bleeding. Absence of menarche by age 15, absence of menses for three consecutive months, and menses lasting eight days or longer with or without associated heavy bleeding are among the menstrual abnormalities that warrant further evaluation. Obtaining the menstrual history in adolescents with the knowledge of expected menstrual patterns allows the pediatric practitioner to provide appropriate counseling and education to adolescents and their families, and to identify menstrual abnormalities when they arise. Treating the menstrual cycle as a "vital sign" highlights the importance of normal menses as an indicator of an individual's overall health and enables timely identification of any concerning findings.

### The normal variabilities of the menstrual cycle [^111LkzwW]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To address conflicts in the normal variabilities of the menstrual cycle using the newest generation test methods and to establish normal ranges for use in clinical practice.

Design

Daily urine samples were collected from 167 women eager to achieve pregnancy. Samples were tested prospectively for LH and total hCG. A total of 458 nongestational and 111 gestational menstrual cycles were evaluated.

Setting

Division of Women's Health Research, University of New Mexico.

Patient(S)

One hundred sixty-seven women desiring pregnancy.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Levels of hCG and LH.

Result(S)

Menstrual cycles were 27.7 ± 2.4 days in length. The LH peak indicated the onset of the presumed ovulatory window, which occurs at 14.7 ± 2.4 days. Implantation (first day of sensitive detection of hCG) occurred in gestational menstrual cycles at 24.6 ± 3.1 days, or 4.3 ± 2.2 days before missing the expected onset of menses.

Conclusion(S)

Our data confirm epidemiological studies on menstrual cycle length and variability and hormonal studies on timing of the ovulatory window and its variability. They dispute, however, the published data on the timing and variance of implantation. As shown, implantation is limited to a 10-day interval culminating in the day of the expected onset of menses. Reference range data provide guidelines for differentiating normal and problem menstrual cycles.

### Psychobiological risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescence: a consideration of the role of puberty [^112G2N7M]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Ovarian hormones (estradiol and progesterone)

Estradiol, progesterone, and their neurosteroid metabolites all increase and begin to fluctuate cyclically in girls during puberty. Consequently, the vast majority of research in this area has focused on females (for reviews, see). To provide a context for understanding the effects of estradiol and progesterone administration on behaviors relevant to suicide risk, we will first briefly review studies that controlled hormone conditions in women with affective symptoms and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), for whom suicide risk is elevated compared to the general population.

Decades of research have shown that there are no differences between women with and without PMDD in ovarian hormone levels or related neurosteroids (e.g. allopregnanolone) but that suppressing ovarian hormones reduces or eliminates symptoms of PMDD (for a review, see). A recent study that controlled for ovarian hormone secretion and exposure in women with PMDD has helped to clarify these two seemingly opposing findings. In that study, women with PMDD who responded to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment were given placebo for one month before being administered continuous estradiol/progesterone for three months; researchers found that changes from low to high levels of ovarian hormones, but not absolute levels of ovarian hormones, were associated with increases in negative affect. Together, these data suggest that neurobiological sensitivity to hormone changes is an important factor that may explain certain clinical phenomena, such as PMDD and suicide risk. Indeed, a recent review has covered this topic extensively in adult women, demonstrating that cyclical hormone changes may play an important role in "acute risk for daily suicidal ideation, planning, and intent" in individuals with sensitivity to hormone changes. We have extended this theoretical model to adolescents, proposing that in those who possess a neurobiological sensitivity to hormonal changes, the normative fluctuations during this transitional period, coupled with adolescent-typical experiences of greater exposure to life stressors, may exacerbate the effects of these processes on emotion regulatory and impulse control circuits. Indeed, results from studies that have investigated suicide risk in adult women across the menstrual cycle have been inconsistent. These studies have typically assessed levels of estradiol and progesterone during different phases of the menstrual cycle, and in women with low levels of estradiol and progesterone (e.g. amenorrhea or menopause). While some investigators have reported that a higher risk of suicide attempts and more severe suicidal thoughts and intentions are associated with relatively low or declining levels of estradiol and progesterone (i.e. during the early follicular/menstrual or pre-menstrual phases), other researchers have not found differences in estradiol or progesterone between depressed women with and without STBs or effects of the menstrual cycle on suicide attempts in women with PMDD.

### Macular, choroidal and disc associations across women's reproductive life stages: a scoping review from menarche to post-menopause [^113DwJ4e]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Oestrogen and progesterone fluctuate cyclically in women throughout their adult lives. Although these hormones cross the blood-retinal barrier and bind to intraocular receptors, their effects remain unclear. We present the first review to date on associations between posterior pole structures-specifically the macula, choroid, and optic disc-and both the menstrual cycle and post-menopausal period, utilising multimodal imaging techniques in healthy adult non-pregnant women. We excluded studies on contraception and hormonal replacement therapy, focusing solely on physiological associations. Despite the comprehensive scope of our review, limited data and inconsistent reporting among studies prevented the establishment of meaningful trends. Across menstrual cycle phases, choroidal thickness (CHT) was the most consistently reported parameter, with thinning during the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase. Conversely, no significant differences were observed in macular or disc morphology across the cycle, likely reflecting a preserved structure despite potential fluctuations in blood flow and perfusion. Studies comparing pre- and post-menopausal associations, after adjusting for age or body mass index (BMI), failed to reveal meaningful trends, highlighting the difficulty in separating the effect of age from hormonal declines in older women. Understanding how hormonal cycles impact the posterior pole in women is crucial for addressing sex differences in various ocular pathologies. Research on female-specific factors is still sparse, and interestingly, the majority of affiliations in the reviewed articles did not originate from regions with the highest biomedical research funding and publication rates. We encourage further studies focusing on female-specific variables and provide recommendations for future designs.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^111PEzor]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Strong linear correlations between menstrual cycle length and follicular phase length with increasing age are demonstrated. Although it is known that cycle length is likely to decrease with age, the linear correlation outlined in our analysis has never been described in such detail. The mean cycle length dropped by 3.2 days from age 25 to 45 and the mean follicular phase length dropped by 3.4 days in the same period. Above 40 the variation increased dramatically. These results are in alignment with those of reference studies. The mean bleed length of 4.0 ± 1.5 days, and its decline by 0.5 days from 4.2 ± 1.4 days in women aged 18–24 to 3.7 ± 1.5 days in women aged 40–45, is in agreement with Harlow.

It is well-established that obesity is related to menstrual disorders, infertility, miscarriage, obstetric complications, live birth rate and can affect the success of assisted reproductive technology. – In our study, we were not able to demonstate significant effects of BMI on ovulatory menstrual cycle characteristics. This is likely due to underrepresentation of women with high BMI within the study population. The strongest effect seen was an increase of per-woman cycle length variation of 14% in women with BMI of 35–50 relative to women with normal BMI. This effect is expected because pre-existing medical condition (PCOS) is associated with obesity and causes erratic menstrual cycles. Future research may investigate the effect of BMI on cycle characteristics in greater depth.

### UEFA consensus statement on menstrual cycle tracking in women's football [^1151EtPJ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Which menstrual cycle measures are meaningful in tracking player performance and health?

A hierarchy of metrics was established to identify meaningful menstrual cycle measures about player performance and health. These include (a) regularity and characteristics of bleeding, (b) type, intensity and frequency of cyclical symptoms, (c) ovulation and (d) ovarian hormone levels. For tracking to be deemed meaningful, data should initially cover at least three consecutive cycles, with subsequent single-cycle assessments employed when needed (eg, if a player's cycle length changes outside of their normal range or to randomly test that the documented cycle characteristics from the initial assessment are still valid).

Regularity and characteristics of bleeding

Monitoring the regularity, duration and volume of menstrual bleeding gives players insights into their cycle length and patterns without needing ovulation or ovarian hormone assessment. Tracking menstrual cycle length (ie, the time from the first day of bleeding to the start of the next bleed, which should be between 21 and 35 days) can help identify conditions, such as abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)-frequent (ie, polymenorrhea, < 21 days), AUB-infrequent (ie, oligomenorrhea, > 35 days) or secondary amenorrhoea (> 90 days). Variations in menstrual cycle length (ie, deviations exceeding 7 days or 1 SD from the player's individual norm) may indicate menstrual disturbances, low energy availability or stress-related adaptations. Sudden or gradual changes in cycle length can also signify increased physical or psychological stress. Monitoring the duration and volume of blood loss can help identify menorrhagia (ie, heavy menstrual bleeding), which is linked to iron deficiency and fatigue, and anovulatory cycles, which are often characterised by prolonged or heavy menstruation.

Type, intensity and duration of cyclical symptoms

Cyclical symptoms (ie, those occurring predictably in specific phases) offer valuable insights when tracking their type, intensity and duration. This tracking allows players to determine if their experiences are typical, develop symptom-management strategies and seek medical advice for recurrent, debilitating symptoms, which may indicate underlying clinical disorders. Common symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, mood fluctuations, appetite changes, breast pain and sleep disturbances, have been described in other sports to influence perceived and actual performance and physical capacities. Monitoring these wellness metrics may empower players to anticipate patterns and optimise their training and recovery through effective symptom management strategies.

### Resting energy expenditure, metabolic and sex hormones in two phases of the menstrual and hormonal contraceptive cycles [^114BeiC2]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Resting energy expenditure (REE) may fluctuate during the menstrual cycle (MC), due to the physiological effects of estradiol (E2) and progesterone. This study examined changes in REE and metabolic hormones (leptin, ghrelin, thyroid hormones), and dietary intake in two hormonally distinct groups, naturally menstruating women (NoOC) and women using monophasic combined oral contraceptives (COC).

Methods

Measurements included REE by indirect calorimetry, body composition by bioimpedance, and blood samples for hormone analysis in the early follicular and midluteal phases of the MC in the NoOC group (n = 38) or the active and inactive phases of the COC cycle (COC; n = 19). Participants recorded their food intake for 3 d after measurements. A secondary analysis was completed for the NoOC group without REE outliers (difference between measurements > 1.5 × interquartile range, n = 4).

Results

In the NoOC group, luteal phase REE was 40 kcal higher than follicular phase REE (95% confidence interval (CI), -2 to 82 kcal·d⁻¹, d = 0.20, P = 0.061). Leptin (d = 0.35, P < 0.001), triiodothyronine (T3; d = 0.26, P = 0.05), and fat intake (d = 0.48, P = 0.027) were higher, and thyroxine (d = 0.21, P = 0.041) was lower in the luteal phase. After excluding outliers, REE was 44 kcal higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (95% CI, 12–76 kcal·d⁻¹, d = 0.22, P = 0.007). In the COC group, the mean difference in REE was -2 kcal (95% CI, -82 to 79 kcal·d⁻¹) between active and inactive phases, whereas T3 was higher in the inactive phase (d = 0.01, P = 0.037).

Conclusions

REE increases only slightly from the follicular to the luteal phase but remains unchanged between COC phases. Increases in T3, leptin, and fat intake during the luteal phase might echo metabolic fluctuations that parallel female sex hormones during the MC.

### Menstrual cycle hormone changes in women traversing menopause: study of women's health across the nation [^116EEq3s]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Menstrual cycle hormone patterns in women approaching menopause are inadequately studied.

Objective

To describe day-to-day menstrual cycle hormones in women as they approach menopause from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Daily Hormone Study (DHS).

Design

DHS enrollees collected daily urine for one entire menstrual cycle or up to 50 days, whichever came first, annually, up to the final menstrual period (FMP) or for up to 10 years.

Setting

Seven sites across the United States.

Participants

A total of 511 premenopausal or early perimenopausal women at enrollment, within 10 years before menopause.

Intervention

Time-to-FMP measurement.

Main Outcome Measures

Evidence of luteal activity (ELA), determined using objective algorithms. Menstrual cycle/segment length; whole cycle, and segment integrated urinary luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estrone conjugates, and pregnanediol glucuronide (Pdg) for each year, organized around the FMP.

Results

Mean menstrual cycle length was remarkably preserved at 26 to 27 days in ELA cycles; non-ELA cycles had greater variability. The percentage of cycles that were ELA remained high until 5 years before the FMP (87.9%); only 22.8% of cycles within 1 year of the FMP were ELA. Whole cycle hormones remained relatively stable up to 3 years before the FMP, when gonadotropins began to increase. Pdg excretion declined slowly with progress to the FMP, but Pdg patterns of ELA cycles remained distinguishable from non-ELA.

Conclusions

Menstrual cycle hormone patterns in perimenopausal women resemble those of midreproductive-aged women until 5 years before menopause, and presumably ovulatory cycles retain a potentially fertile pattern up to the end of reproductive life.

### Menstrual cycle length variation by demographic characteristics from the apple women's health study [^111LAcWg]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Analysis of cycle length variability and irregularity

Considering women with few cycles may not effectively contribute information on cycle variability, we restricted this analysis to participants with at least three menstrual cycles. In the linear mixed model framework, within-individual variability in cycle length, which represents the degree of cycle irregularity, can be estimated by the standard deviations (SDs) of the model residuals after accounting for the systematic variability across subgroups in the fixed effect terms and between individual variability in random intercepts. To quantify and examine the associations of age, ethnicity, and BMI with within-individual cycle variability, we constructed log-linear models for residual variance in the fully adjusted LME models. We first considered univariable models to estimate within-individual cycle variability (in days) by each factor. Then we fitted a multivariable model with all three variables included to obtain the adjusted estimates for the associations of age, ethnicity, and BMI with within-individual cycle variability. Coefficients from the multivariable model were computed as the percentage change in within-individual variability in cycle length compared to the referent for the factors of interest.

We further identified cycle irregularity as participants whose mean difference in lengths of adjacent menstrual cycles ≥ 7 daysand examined the associations of age, ethnicity, and BMI with cycle irregularity using logistic regression models with iterative reweighted least squares, adjusted for all covariates. We repeated the analysis using alternative criteria of irregularity as the median difference in lengths of adjacent menstrual cycles ≥ 9 days, the standard deviation of menstrual cycle length ≥ 7 days, and the difference between the shortest and longest cycle ≥ 7 days.

Data management, processing, and statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 3.6.0) and Python (version 3.6). All statistical tests were two-sided.

### 28 days later: a prospective daily study on psychological well-being across the menstrual cycle and the effects of hormones and oral contraceptives [^1161zZd5]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Associations between hormones and psychological well-being throughout the menstrual cycle in naturally cycling participants

To account for the highly inter-individual changes in menstrual cycle patterns, we used individually defined cycle phases as the backbone for further analysis in the NC group. This increases specificity as well as complexity, as the variation in cycle length between individuals leads to different lengths of the cycle phases. Linear mixed models were also used to assess cycle phase effects within participants on well-being domains and hormone levels, including a random intercept for every participant and menstrual cycle day as a random factor.

For the hormone levels, we calculated person-centered means and person-centered change scores. Change scores were calculated by subtracting each individual's mean score from their daily scores. They are useful for understanding intra-individual variability, i.e. how each person's psychological well-being and hormones fluctuate relative to their own baseline. These change scores help identify patterns and trends in an individual's psychological well-being over time, independent of other individuals' mood patterns.

To estimate the effect of hormones on each of the psychological well-being aspects we ran linear mixed models with cycle phase (5 levels), a random intercept for each individual, and NC day as a random factor. To examine whether the level of hormones or the change in hormones were related to the psychological well-being aspects, we conducted time-varying models separately for each hormone (estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone) using person-centered mean levels of hormones and person-centered change of hormones as fixed factors, resulting in a total of 9 psychological aspects * 3 types of hormones analyses. For each analysis, we also added interaction terms between cycle phase and both person-centered mean and person-centered change in hormone levels, to test whether the associations with hormones differed over cycle phases. In case of significant interactions, we stratified the dataset on cycle phase and reran the linear mixed model with person-centered hormone levels predicting psychological well-being variables.

In addition, network analyses were estimated in the NC group to examine the underlying associations between all psychological well-being aspects and hormonal levels (e.g. 12 nodes). Analyses were similar to the network models described above, but here, hormone levels were also added to the model. As an additional exploratory step, network analyses were estimated for each menstrual cycle phase, but these were not part of the main analyses due to small sample sizes and therefore included in the.

### Muscle performance during the menstrual cycle correlates with psychological well-being, but not fluctuations in sex hormones [^1169y7x9]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Influence of the MC phases on physical performance

In the present study, power performance in the CMJ test and Wingate bike test was impaired in LL and EF, respectively, whereas we observed no statistical significant variation over the MC in the strength tests (handgrip and isometric elbow flexor strength). The literature reports conflicting results on strength and power performance between specific menstrual phases Phillips et al. reported a greater adductor pollicis strength (~10%) in the LF compared with the EF, and Sarwar et al. testing 10 women five times during an MC, observed a markedly greater (+11%) quadriceps and handgrip strength at midcycle compared with the EF and luteal phases. Similarly, Bambaeichi et al. tested eight women four times during two MC and reported a greater isometric contraction of knee flexors (+10%) and a greater isokinetic peak torque of the knee flexors (+10%) and extensors (+5%) in the LF compared with the EF. However, in all three studies, the number of participants was low, and verification of MC phases by blood sampling was not performed or performed for a limited number of the participants. Pallavi et al. tested 100 young (~18 yr old) women three times in each of two MC, with menstrual phases roughly estimated without blood analysis. They observed a remarkably higher handgrip strength (+46%) in the estimated LF phase compared with the EF phase. Even though this is a noteworthy study based on the number of test days (six times for each of the 100 women), it does not seem physiologically plausible that hormone fluctuations could have such a marked impact on strength performance in women in general. Elite athletes, in particular, would notice such a variation in strength performance. In support, when 186 female elite athletes in an online survey were asked whether they felt that their performance was positively influenced by the MC in specific MC phases, only 6% of the eumenorrheic athletes reported that they felt that their physical performance capacity was improved during their MC and it was not related to any specific MC phase.

### A new metric to understand the association between heart rate variability and menstrual regularity [^1132GM8J]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated in women compared to men. Wearable technologies (wearables) help shed light on women's cardiovascular by collecting continuous cardiovascular data and correlating it with hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. In this context, Jasinski et al. propose that the new metric, cardiovascular amplitude, enables non-invasive monitoring of female physiology and health across the menstrual cycle.

### Muscle performance during the menstrual cycle correlates with psychological well-being, but not fluctuations in sex hormones [^116r8KuD]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Methodical considerations

The strengths of the present study are a) verifying the menstrual phases using ovulation kits and blood analyses, b) testing seven to nine times during an MC, and c) including 30 eumenorrheic women, d) who were relatively untrained, such that the test results were not confounded by previous training sessions.

Several of the earlier small studies, which did not find a difference in performance during the MC (,–), also used hormone analysis to define the MC phases. This is suggested to be the most valid method to categorize the phases. In addition, we used a cutoff minimum limit for the progesterone level in the luteal phase (16 pmol·L⁻¹) to reduce the risk of including participants with either luteal deficiency or an anovulatory cycle. Only a few studies, other than our current study, have used this exclusion criterion. In the present study, two participants were excluded because of low progesterone levels in the luteal phase. Because one of these two participants experienced a positive ovulation test, it is important to apply several methods to establish the different phases and thereby ensure that women with irregular ovulatory cycles and hormone profiles are excluded. If women with luteal deficiency or an anovulatory cycle are included in a study designed to elucidate variation in performance between menstrual phases, their results will reduce the possibility for detecting a potential difference as a consequence of MC-related hormone fluctuations.

In the current investigation, we chose to include relatively untrained women because well-trained women more often experience problems with amenorrhea, lower levels of sex hormones, and menstrual disturbances. Another disadvantage of including trained women is that it is likely that the testing of performance frequently during an MC is biased by variation in performance related to the trained women's training schedule. In line with this, a majority of studies reporting no significant variation in performance between the MC phases have tested trained women. We cannot exclude that untrained women may experience a learning or training effect with repeated testing. However, our data did not show a statistically significant effect of repeated testing (order effect). The latter may be explained by the fact that we performed 3 familiarization test days before the MC testing period was initiated.

### Within-person changes in daily ovarian hormone levels influence genetic effects on emotional eating in women [^1154iQjb]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ovarian hormones (i.e., estradiol, progesterone) show robust phenotypic associations with binge eating and related behaviors (e.g., emotional eating) in females. Recent research suggests these associations may be due to ovarian hormone effects on genetic and environmental influences on dysregulated eating. However, no research has yet examined how within-person fluctuations in hormone levels impact genetic/environmental influences on day-to-day changes in dysregulated eating from an individual's own mean. This omission is critical because phenotypic associations between ovarian hormones and dysregulated eating are strongest at a within-person level in adult women, suggesting potentially unique and important within-person effects.

Method

Participants from same-sex female twin pairs (N = 468) from the MSU Twin Registry provided measures of ovarian hormones and emotional eating daily for 49 consecutive days. We used continuous twin moderation models to examine how within-person centered estradiol and progesterone impacted genetic/environmental influences on within-person shifts in emotional eating.

Results

Within-person fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone significantly moderated genetic influences on within-person changes in emotional eating. Stronger genetic influences were observed when the ratio of within-person estradiol to progesterone was in the moderate range.

Conclusion

Cyclic, within-person changes in ovarian hormones may contribute to phenotypic changes in dysregulated eating across the menstrual cycle by dynamically regulating expression of underlying genetic risk. Genetic influences may be particularly pronounced under the hormonal conditions characteristic of the mid-luteal phase (i.e., moderate estradiol and progesterone).

### Menstrual cycle-related changes in circulating androgens in healthy women with self-reported normal sexual function [^115VsaBs]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is currently neither a clinically useful, reliable and inexpensive assay to measure circulating levels of free testosterone (T) in the range observed in women, nor is there agreement on the serum free T threshold defining hypoandrogenism that is associated with female-impaired sexual function.

Aim

Following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, we generated clinically applicable ranges for circulating androgens during specific phases of the menstrual cycle in a convenience sample of 120 reproductive-aged, regularly cycling healthy European Caucasian women with self-reported normal sexual function.

Methods

All participants were asked to complete a semistructured interview and fill out a set of validated questionnaires, including the Female Sexual Function Index, the Female Sexual Distress Scale, and the 21-item Beck's Inventory for Depression. Between 8 am and 10 am, a venous blood sample was drawn from each participant during the midfollicular (day 5 to 8), the ovulatory (day 13 to 15), and the midluteal phase (day 19 to 22) of the same menstrual cycle.

Main Outcome Measures

Serum levels of total and free testosterone, Delta(4)-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and sex hormone-binding globulin during the midfollicular, ovulatory and midluteal phase of the same menstrual cycle.

Results

Total and free T levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the ovulatory phase. No significant variation during the menstrual cycle were observed for Delta(4)-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. Despite the careful selection of participants that yielded an homogeneous group of women without sexual disorders, we observed a wide range of distribution for each of the circulating androgens measured in this study.

Conclusions

This report provides clinically applicable ranges for androgens throughout the menstrual cycle in reproductive-aged, regularly cycling, young healthy Caucasian European women with self-reported normal sexual function.

### Association between menstrual cycle length and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination: a U.S. cohort [^1128m3HT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Concerns about a possible association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination and abnormal menstrual cycles may lead to vaccine hesitancy. Unfortunately, clinical trials of the current COVID-19 vaccines did not collect menstrual cycle outcomes postvaccine. – VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) does not actively collect information regarding menstrual cycles, and, by May 2021, only a small number of individuals (fewer than 200) had self-reported a menstrual-related issue to VAERS. Social media reports suggest menstrual disturbances are much more common but that these disturbances appear to be temporary. The lack of population-level, prospective evidence about the relationship of COVID-19 vaccination and menstrual cycles limits our ability to sufficiently address these concerns and to counsel individuals who menstruate about what to expect with vaccination.

Menstrual cyclicity is an overt sign of health and fertility. Menstrual characteristics are not static, and variability exists month to month across an individual's lifespan. – The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classifies a variation in cycle length as normal if less than 8 days. Regularly menstruating individuals can also experience sporadic or stress-induced ovulation perturbances, which may result in a skipped cycle or a temporary change in cycle length. – This normal variability may be perceived as concerning, especially in conjunction with a new exposure such as COVID-19 vaccination.

Here, we present an analysis of prospectively collected menstrual cycle tracking data from U.S. individuals using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration–cleared digital fertility-awareness application "Natural Cycles" to assess whether COVID-19 vaccination is associated with changes in cycle or menses length during the menstrual cycles when vaccine doses are received.

### How regular is regular? An analysis of menstrual cycle regularity [^113T4aCq]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective analysis to ascertain how accurately women who believe that they have regular menstrual cycles estimate the length of their actual cycles. Data were extracted from a chart review of subjects from three different studies of barrier contraceptives. Subjects were between 18 and 40 years of age and reported "regular" prestudy menstrual cycles with a consistent cycle length between 21 and 35 days. Participants prospectively recorded their menses for the up to 30 weeks. Each subject's estimated cycle length was compared to the average of her actual cycle lengths and the range and variability in each individual's cycle length was calculated. A total of 786 cycles from 130 women who recorded 4 or more cycles were analyzed. The averages of the participants' estimated cycle lengths was similar to the prospective averages of their actual cycle lengths (29.0 ± 2.7 days vs. 29.1 ± 3.5 days, respectively, p = 0.8). Forty-six percent of all subjects had a cycle range of 7 days or more, and 20% had a cycle range of 14 days or more. The average length of menses was 5.2 ± 1.0 days. When evaluating only women with cycle lengths from 21 to 35 days, the average length of menses was positively associated with the average actual cycle length (p = 0.04). Although the average of a woman's menstrual cycles compares favorably to her impression of her cycle length, the variability in menstrual cycle lengths is significant. This variation may have clinical impact on contraceptive practice, contraceptive research studies and pregnancy-related care.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^113BUa6H]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Menstrual history to assess ovulation — In most ovulatory women, menstrual cycles are regular and predictable and generally occur at intervals of 21–35 days. In a study of more than 1,000 cycles, variations in intermenstrual interval > 5 days were observed in 56% of patients within 6 months and in 75% of those observed for 1 year; however, sporadic anovulatory cycles in regularly menstruating women are relatively rare at 10%–14%. Based on a normal menstrual history in noninfertile women, the prevalence of ovulatory cycles is as high as 99.5%, whereas the prevalence of regular ovulation in eumenorrheic women with hirsutism decreases to 60%, and in these women, luteal progesterone levels should be considered to confirm ovulation. A history of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea is clinically sufficient to establish anovulation and warrants further investigation, and the additional tests discussed below are not required to confirm ovulation but may be used to augment fertility evaluation when the menstrual history is indeterminant.

### Daily estradiol and progesterone levels moderate genetic and environmental influences on emotional eating across 45 consecutive days in female twins [^115B9ifB]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the promise of these initial results, large gaps remain in our understanding of hormone effects on etiologic risk. Most notably, it remains unclear how daily changes in ovarian hormones impact genetic/environmental influences on emotional eating. Our study of menstrual cycle phase (Klump et al.) did not examine ovarian hormone levels, making it impossible to confirm that differences in genetic/environmental influences across cycle phase were driven by ovarian hormones. Conversely, our analyses of mean hormone levels (Klump et al.) focused on trait-levels that provide information about who exhibits stronger genetic (e.g. women with higher trait progesterone) v. shared environmental influences (i.e. women with higher trait estradiol), but were unable to determine how daily changes in hormones impact day-to-day changes in BE etiologic risk. Ovarian hormones change dynamically across days and the menstrual cycle, and it is these daily changes that most substantially impact phenotypic risk for BE (rather than mean hormone levels; Klump et al.). It is therefore critical to determine whether daily fluctuations in ovarian hormones are associated with changes in genetic/environmental influences on BE.

### The utility of menstrual cycle length as an indicator of cumulative hormonal exposure [^113QpvYC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Associations between menstrual cycle length and chronic diseases are hypothesized to be due to differences in underlying hormonal patterns.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between menstrual cycle length and the hormonal profile and anovulation.

Design and Setting

We conducted a prospective cohort study at the University at Buffalo from 2005 to 2007.

Participants

We recruited 259 healthy, regularly menstruating women aged 18–44 yr.

Main Outcome Measures

Cycle length was observed for up to two cycles. Serum estradiol, progesterone, LH, and FSH were measured up to eight times per cycle for up to two cycles.

Results

Women with short cycles (< 26 d) had higher FSH concentrations during menses and in the late luteal phase, higher follicular estradiol concentrations, and lower LH concentrations across the cycle. Among women with longer cycles (> 35 d), estradiol and LH peaks occurred on average about 3 d later, and FSH peaks about 1 d later compared to women with normal-length cycles. Both short and long cycles, compared with normal-length cycles, had an increased probability of anovulation. In general, per-cycle exposure to hormones was less in short cycles based on the area under the curve, although over time the cumulative exposure to estradiol would be greater for women with short cycles.

Conclusions

Short ovulatory cycles were associated with higher follicular phase estradiol, an earlier rise in FSH, and an increased risk of anovulation. These results suggest that menstrual cycle length may be a relevant indicator of estradiol exposure and risk of anovulation among regularly cycling women.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^1153tv4V]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

A larger corpus of work has probed the effect of menstrual cycle stage on regional and global GM volume. GM morphology appears to be sensitive to hormonal transition periods, including puberty, oral contraceptive use, and pregnancy (Herting et al; Hoekzema et al; Lisofsky et al.). Only a small body of studies has investigated time‐varying changes in GM morphology across a natural menstrual cycle. GM morphology tends to change in concert with ovulation and/or 17β‐estradiol (Barth et al; De Bondt et al; De Bondt, Jacquemyn, et al; Franke et al; Hagemann et al; Petersen et al.), although GM morphological alterations are also observed more broadly when comparing luteal and follicular cycle phases (Lisofsky et al; Meeker et al; Ossewaarde et al; Pletzer et al; Protopopescu et al.) and tied to circulating progesterone concentrations (Pletzer et al; Taylor et al.). A recent dense‐sampling study by Zsido et al. conducted ultra‐high field imaging of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and found significant volumetric changes corresponding with 17β‐estradiol and progesterone concentrations, as well as their interaction (Zsido et al.).

Statistical analysis

We estimated the distribution of menstrual cycle length in our study population using a Gaussian kernel density function with weights equal to the inverse of the total number of cycles contributed by that participant to avoid bias by the varying numbers of menstrual cycles per participant.

3.2 ‐axis hormone andmicrostructure relationships

Next, we tested if HPG‐axis hormone concentrations (17β‐estradiol, progesterone, LH, FSH) are associated with six WM multidimensional diffusion parameters that describe aspects of diffusion tensor size (mean isotropic diffusivity size [D iso], variation in isotropic diffusivity size [V ison]), shape (mean squared anisotropy [D² anison], μFA, FA), and orientation (OP). Note that tables report unadjusted regression coefficients (β weights), while relationships were only considered credible (positive or negative) if an estimate of effect size (i.e. shrinkage‐adjusted coefficients) for whole brain (D) or region‐specific relationships (d r) exceeded defined regions of practical equivalence (ROPEs; D: [−0.06 to 0.06], d r: [−0.35 to 0.35]; see Section 2.7).

### Characterizing physiological and symptomatic variation in menstrual cycles using self-tracked mobile-health data [^113qAE17]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data overview

We leverage a deidentified version of the Clue data warehouse, a dataset of 117,014,597 self-tracking events for 378,694 users in our cohort of interest. Clue app users input overall personal information at sign up, such as age and hormonal birth control (HBC) type. The dataset contains information from 2015 to 2018 for users worldwide, covering countries within North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa (see Supplementary Information for a detailed count of cohort users per country). Users can self-track symptoms over time across the 20 available categories (see Table 3 for symptom list) and can preselect which categories they wish to track when they sign up — all users do not track all categories.

Clue app users track an event by selecting a category and then choosing an associated symptom. Each row in the primitive dataset represents a tracked event e, with relevant fields being (i) the user u that tracked the event e u, (ii) the reported symptom s in that event e u = s, and (iii) the user-specific cycle c e in which the event takes place. A menstrual cycle is defined as the span of days from the first day of a period through to and including the day before the first day of the next period. A period consists of sequential days of bleeding (greater than spotting and within 10 days after the first greater-than-spotting bleeding event) unbroken by no more than one day on which only spotting or no bleeding occurred. Note that Clue considers a menses duration longer than 10 days as an outlier, as it would exceed mean period length plus 3 standard deviations for any studied population. In addition, a user has the opportunity to specify whether a cycle should be excluded from their Clue history — for instance, if the user feels that the cycle is not representative of their typical menstrual behavior due to a medical procedure or changes in birth control.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^111mwrMA]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

4.6 Limitations and future considerations

While this study has significant strengths due to its within‐subject design and reliable brain measures, several limitations exist. Data were only sampled at three time points/participant, providing sparse sampling to our regression model and leaving out associations that occur during the other days of the menstrual cycle. We estimated scheduling of the ovulation and luteal sessions through at‐home ovulation tests, which can be positive across multiple days, or, for some individuals, never reach the "positive" threshold as defined by the test manufacturer. Because of this, ovulation and mid‐luteal sessions may not have captured the exact ovulation or mid‐luteal day for all participants. Despite this, significant fluctuations in HPG‐axis hormones were captured, allowing us to achieve the primary aim of associating brain measures with HPG‐axis hormone concentrations (as opposed to cycle phase). Future dense‐sampling studies are needed to fill these information gaps. The correlational nature of this work means that true causality between HPG‐axis hormones and brain structure could not be established. Other HPG‐axis hormones not considered here may influence brain structural changes across the menstrual cycle. Examples include testosterone, which has been found to increase during the ovulatory phase but have day‐to‐day variability that exceeds cycle‐related variability, and dehydroepiandrosterone‐sulfate, which has been found to decrease during the mid‐luteal phase (Bui et al; Hamidovic et al.). Future analyses of these hormones and their relationships to brain structure are needed. Alterations in brain structural measures may also be due to nonhormone factors that coincide with menstrual cycle rhythms. While this study aimed to address this by assessing brain‐HPG‐axis hormone (as opposed to cycle phase) relationships, future population studies with pharmacological hormone suppression are needed to establish causality. Additionally, while the current work has a larger sample size than many previous menstrual cycle studies, larger consortium studies are warranted to truly establish brain–hormone associations at the population level. All participants were adults under the age of 30 at time of study, but menstrual cycle‐driven brain–hormone associations may evolve throughout the lifespan. Further study in younger and older age groups is needed to better understand this relationship. The CT changes described here are based on standard T 1 ‐MPRAGE images, which may miss more localized/subregional changes that we are not able to detect. Further study of brain–hormone relationships at the subregion level is warranted. Finally, an analysis consisting of 40 separate Bayesian models may pose a risk for susceptibility to Type 1 error. However, our imposition of a ROPE based on null‐generative models serves as a conservative protection for multiple comparisons.

### Blood glucose variance measured by continuous glucose monitors across the menstrual cycle [^115L1YQ4]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Past studies on how blood glucose levels vary across the menstrual cycle have largely shown inconsistent results based on limited blood draws. In this study, 49 individuals wore a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor and a Fitbit Sense smartwatch while measuring their menstrual hormones and self-reporting characteristics of their menstrual cycles daily. The average duration of participation was 79.3 ± 21.2 days, leading to a total of 149 cycles and 554 phases in our dataset. We use periodic restricted cubic splines to evaluate the relationship between blood glucose and the menstrual cycle, after which we assess phase-based changes in daily median glucose level and associated physiological parameters using mixed-effects models. Results indicate that daily median glucose levels increase and decrease in a biphasic pattern, with maximum levels occurring during the luteal phase and minimum levels occurring during the late-follicular phase. These trends are robust to adjustments for participant characteristics (e.g., age, BMI, weight) and self-reported menstrual experiences (e.g., food cravings, bloating, fatigue). We identify negative associations between each of daily estrogen level, step count, and low degrees of fatigue with higher median glucose levels. Conversely, we find positive associations between higher food cravings and higher median glucose levels. This study suggests that blood glucose could be an important parameter for understanding menstrual health, prompting further investigation into how the menstrual cycle influences glucose fluctuation.

### Menstrual cycle-driven hormone concentrations co-fluctuate with white and gray matter architecture changes across the whole brain [^116Y2LUJ]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Median values of group serum HPG‐axis hormone concentrations by session type.

Post‐hoc paired Wilcoxon signed‐rank tests found that within‐subject group‐level differences in HPG‐axis hormone concentration levels were consistent with known patterns of HPG‐axis hormone fluctuations across a typical menstrual cycle in young, naturally cycling women (Stricker et al.). Significance was defined according to a Bonferroni‐adjusted p ‐value of p < .0167 (p = .05/3 sessions). Overall, we observed a group‐level pattern of moderate levels of FSH and relatively low concentrations of 17β‐estradiol, progesterone, and LH during menses sessions, relatively high concentrations of 17β‐estradiol, LH, and FSH during ovulation sessions, and relatively high concentrations of progesterone/moderate concentrations of 17β‐estradiol during mid‐luteal sessions. Specifically, 17β‐estradiol concentrations (Figure 3a) were significantly greater during the ovulation and mid‐luteal sessions when compared with menses (p < .0001), while the difference between ovulation and mid‐luteal sessions did not pass the Bonferroni‐adjusted p ‐value (p = .028). Progesterone concentrations (Figure 3b) were significantly greater during the mid‐luteal session when compared with ovulation and menses, as well as during the ovulation session when compared with menses (p < .0001). LH concentrations (Figure 3c) were greater during the ovulation session when compared with both menses and mid‐luteal sessions (p < .0001); menses and mid‐luteal sessions did not significantly differ (p = .62). Similarly, FSH concentrations (Figure 3d) were greater during the ovulation session when compared with both menses (p < .001) and mid‐luteal (p < .0001) sessions, while menses was found to have greater concentrations when compared with the mid‐luteal session (p < .0001).

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^111NAagR]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study design

The 'normal' menstrual cycle is conventionally classified as 21–35 days in length, frequent menstrual bleeding (polymenorrheic) cycles as being under 21 (very short cycles) and infrequent menstrual bleeding (oligomenorrheic cycles) as being over 35 days (very long cycles). In this study bleed length was defined as the number of consecutive days on which bleeding — not spotting — was recorded. Spotting is defined as very light bleeding (a few drops of blood) or brown/pink fluids. Users are instructed not to log very light bleeding just before the period as bleeding but to wait until the flow increases. The follicular phase was defined as the first day of recorded menstruation to the EDO. Luteal phase length was defined as the day after the EDO to the day before the next day of recorded menstruation. The per-user cycle length variation was defined as one standard deviation of a user's cycle lengths.

We calculated mean cycle length, duration of bleeding (bleed length), follicular phase length and luteal phase length in ovulatory cycles. The following cohort splits by cycle length were defined: very short cycles (15–20 days), short cycles (21–24 days), medium cycles (25–30 days), long cycles (31–35 days) and very long cycles (36–50 days). We calculated the same statistics as well as per-user cycle length variation for cohorts of ovulatory cycles by user age at registration (18–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39 and 40–45 years) and BMI (15–18.5, 18.5–25, 25–30, 30–35 and 35–50). We also calculated the mean proportion of ovulatory cycles as a fraction of all cycles recorded by the user in each of the age and BMI cohorts.

Owing to the very large sample sizes in this study, P values were not calculated since they can be very small even if differences between cohorts are of no clinical significance. Instead, effect size between two cohorts was estimated as a mean difference with a 95% confidence interval calculated from 200 bootstrapped cohort-sized randomly selected samples with replacement. Mean differences are also given as a percentage of the mean in the combined cohorts. Where linear regression is used, we quote the coefficient of the slope with a 95% confidence interval and R² value.

### Association between menstrual cycle length and COVID-19 vaccination: global, retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data [^1155TLjX]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

Strengths of our study include robust study design and analytical methodology, the inclusion of an unvaccinated comparison group, and prospectively tracked menstrual cycle data. These items altogether mean that our outcomes are not affected by recall bias, either due to cross-sectional documentation of vaccine dosage and outcomes or the natural variation in menstrual outcomes. Our sample size is sufficiently large to identify small differences, which is critically important to public stakeholders. However, this study has some important limitations. Our data include individuals not using hormonal contraception with regular menstrual cycles prevaccine between 18 and 45 years old. This decision was purposeful in order to assess the effects related to the vaccine. We recognise that many individuals who menstruate might not be represented in these analyses and people with greater baseline menstrual disturbances, including those at age and body mass index extremes, gynaecological disorders, or hormonal contraceptive users, might have a different experience. Our dataset is limited in its number of cycles postvaccine to assess resolution of cycle length changes among individuals receiving two doses per cycle. We are also unable to account for the potential effect of covid-19 infections that both unvaccinated and vaccinated participants might have contracted during the study on menstrual cycle outcomes. Our deidentified data are self-reported, however, this method is the gold standard for menstrual cycle data. Our study design does not permit us to verify vaccine status or dates but this information is readily available for most individuals. Finally, although we implemented a rigorous study design and analytical method, the possibility of residual confounding and bias exists.

Conclusions

Our findings from this large international cohort of individuals continue to be reassuring and can be used to counsel individuals about what to expect with a covid-19 vaccination and how to make an informed decision about vaccination versus continuing to be at risk for covid-19 disease and its related morbidity and mortality. Although we do find menstrual changes after covid-19 vaccination, these changes are small compared with normal variation and resolve in the cycle after vaccination, except in people who received both doses in one menstrual cycle. Future work should assess other aspects of changes to menstrual cycles, such as unexpected vaginal bleeding, menstrual flow and pain, and define the mechanism by which the postvaccination menstrual changes described here occur.

### Menstrual patterns leading to the final menstrual period [^116vteH7]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize premenopausal menstrual regularity and the patterns of divergence from regularity associated with the approach of the final menstrual period.

Design

Two samples of individual cycle length sequences contributed by participants in a population-based longitudinal study of the menopausal transition were examined. The first sample, of "early" sequences, is used to characterize menstrual regularity. The second shows how cycle length patterns change as the final menstrual period (FMP) is approached. Regression slopes are used to measure trend in cycle length, and changes in cycle length variability are registered by a simply calculated measure, the "running range".

Results

Sequences in the early cycles sample rarely varied outside the 21–35 day range and did not show a rising or falling trend. In contrast, pre-FMP sequences generally became increasingly variable in length, while rising above 35 days in mean during the last 10 cycles. The variability measure remained below 40 days throughout the early sequences, but characteristically rose above 42 days during sequences including the last 20 pre-FMP cycles. In early sequences, but not in pre-FMP sequences, long and short cycles tended to alternate.

Conclusions

Increased variability is the dominant feature of cycle length pattern for most women as their final menstrual period approaches. Underlying this is a steady trend toward mean cycle lengths above 35 days. An indicator of the approach of menopause is a rise in running range of cycle lengths to 42 days.

### Short-term effects of a progestational contraceptive drug on food intake, resting energy expenditure, and body weight in young women [^116bz2oX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Studies showed that hormonal fluctuations that occur over the human menstrual cycle affect energy intake and expenditure. However, little is known about the possible effects on body weight regulation that may arise when these cyclic changes are suppressed with hormonal contraceptives.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine how a progestational contraceptive drug (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) affects food intake, resting energy expenditure (REE), and body weight in young women.

Design

Twenty normal-weight women were tested in a single-blind, placebo-controlled experiment. Body weight, REE, and 3-d food intake (food provided) were measured in the follicular and luteal phases of 2 menstrual cycles before a single injection of depot medroxyprogesterone or saline solution was administered. Measurements were also taken 4 times after injection: in the luteal and follicular phases of 2 cycles in the placebo group and 2 wk apart (to mimic timing of the menstrual phases) in the drug group.

Results

Before injection, the phase of the menstrual cycle affected both energy intake and REE. The study participants consumed more energy (4.3%; P = 0.02) and expended more energy at rest (4.3%; P = 0.0002) in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. Comparison of pre- and postinjection means showed that treatment with the contraceptive drug had no significant effects on energy intake, REE, or body weight.

Conclusions

This study showed that, although phases of the menstrual cycle affected energy intake and REE, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate did not alter energy intake or expenditure or cause weight gain in young women.

### A novel method for quantifying fluctuations in wearable derived daily cardiovascular parameters across the menstrual cycle [^1158gXVh]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We observed significantly lower RHR amp and RMSSD amp in females reporting birth control pill use compared to those naturally cycling. Notably, the typical offsets from baseline during menstruation were relatively similar for participants naturally cycling and taking birth control but diverged significantly during the second half of the menstrual cycle (i.e. late luteal phase). We hypothesize that the significant fluctuations in cardiovascular parameters in naturally cycling participants may be due to progesterone increases in the late luteal phase, which are dampened in individuals on hormonal birth control. This observation is consistent with previous findings from our group in females using combined oral contraceptives. Taken together, these findings demonstrate significant attenuation of menstrual cycle-related cardiovascular variation by birth control, and highlight a major difference in cardiovascular physiology across the menstrual cycle in females who are naturally cycling compared with birth control users.

Reduced cardiovascular amplitude was also observed in females with higher body mass index and of older age. This reduction in cardiovascular amplitude in older females is consistent with findings demonstrating a gradual decline in anti-müllerian hormone, progesterone, and estrogen (i.e. reproductive hormones) among females throughout their reproductive life and approaching their last menstrual period. With respect to body mass, individuals with abnormal BMI at either extrema are more likely to have anovulatory cycles, irregular menses, and hormonal imbalances. Research has shown that premenopausal females with an elevated BMI exhibit reduced levels of estrogen and anti- müllerian hormone. It is possible that the attenuated RMSSD amp and RHR amp in participants with abnormal BMI is connected to these underlying differences in hormonal health. Further research is warranted to better understand the association between the novel cardiovascular amplitude values derived in this study and direct measures of hormonal health.

### Variation in antimüllerian hormone concentration during the menstrual cycle may change the clinical classification of the ovarian response [^111LKbHq]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the variability of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations in women with "adequate ovarian reserve" during unstimulated menstrual cycles and to determine the impact on clinical classifications.

Design

Pilot cohort study.

Setting

Private fertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Twelve consecutive women (aged 29 to 43 years) referred to a fertility service, with AMH measurements repeated throughout unstimulated cycle, and who had at least one AMH measurement indicating "adequate ovarian reserve".

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

AMH concentrations assessed in 82 serum samples from 12 women compared against the published cutoffs for reduced ovarian reserve and for risk of excessive response to ovarian stimulation.

Result(S)

Over half the women (7 of 12) were reclassified as a result of testing AMH concentrations at different phases of the menstrual cycle. Over one-third (4 or 5 of 12) crossed a cutoff for reduced ovarian reserve; 2 of 12 crossed cutoffs predicting hyperstimulation. There was a statistically significant change in AMH concentration according to the day of the cycle, with a negative trend of the median AMH concentration from the follicular to luteal phase. The maximum change in median AMH concentration over cycle was 7.9 pmol/L, and the mean difference between the maximum and minimum AMH was 6.7 pmol/L.

Conclusion(S)

In this pilot study, the AMH concentration varied during menstrual cycle, and the clinical classification of the ovarian response was altered.

### Chronic disease, physiologic… [^111KWbrj]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis and Management OUTFLOW TRACT ABNORMALITIES Outflow tract abnormalities are generally associated with 46, XX chromosomal patterns and normal pubertal progression. Müllerian agenesis occurs in approximately one in 5, 000 females and in 15% of females diagnosed with primary amenorrhea. HYPOTHALAMIC AND PITUITARY CAUSES Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a disorder of chronic anovulation caused by suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis from body weight loss, excessive exercise, or stress and may result in infertility or bone density loss. 2, 44–46 The pathology is similar to the female athlete triad; both are characterized by menstrual dysfunction, low energy availability, and decreased bone mineral density. OTHER ENDOCRINE CAUSES Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. PCOS is a multifactorial endocrine disorder characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, biochemical or clinical androgen access, and polycystic ovaries.

6, 8, 12, 49 The Rotterdam Consensus Criteria require two of the aforementioned features for diagnosis; the Androgen Excess Society requires hyperandrogenism and another feature. 8, 12, 49 Pelvic ultrasonography is not required for diagnosis. 8, 49, 50 Diagnostic accuracy in adolescence is challenging because anovulation and polycystic ovarian morphology can be physiologic; therefore, hyperandrogenism and persistent oligomenorrhea are key to diagnosis. 8, 49 Benefits of early management may outweigh risks of delay for diagnostic certainty. 8, 49. Thyroid and Adrenal Disease. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism may cause amenorrhea. 2, 6, 12 Late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a common cause of hyperandrogenic amenorrhea; an elevated serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level should be followed by confirmatory adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing.

Chronic Disease, Physiologic, and Induced Causes Patients with chronic disease may experience amenorrhea; however, these conditions are often recognized by individual signs and symptoms. Menopause should be considered in patients older than 40 years. 15, 16, 54 Pregnancy, lactation, hormonal contraceptives, and exogenous androgens may also cause amenorrhea. 2, 3, 6.

### Menstruation as the next vital sign… [^114bW2Cj]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The authors argue that obesity may explain the decreasing trend in age at menarche. Although body mass index explains 46% of the decreasing age at menarche in their analysis, 1 there is a growing body of literature that pinpoints growth trajectories during different windows as important. Moreover, growth and obesity are not the only factors responsible for decreases in menarche age. The authors note that decreases occurred before the population increase in obesity rates, indicating that the common narrative that obesity is the driving factor is too simplistic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when stay-at-home mandates forced children to be less physically active and social media memes of baking bread at home suggested possible shifts in diet to more comforting caloric-dense foods, the media returned to concerns about decreasing ages of puberty for children coming of age during the pandemic.

7 Simultaneously, anecdotal reports of menstrual cycle disruption led to investigations into the possible links among COVID-19, vaccination, and changes to menstrual characteristics. The mind-body connection when it comes to menstrual health is inherent, as the menstrual cycle is regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, which has cross-talk with the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Estrogens and cortisol, in addition to androgens, which are gendered as male hormones, are all steroids, derived from cholesterol, and associated with pubertal timing as well as menstrual cycle regularity. It is very likely that BMI and stress interact to accelerate age at menarche and prolong cycle regularity. My working hypothesis is that more stress increases the pool of androgens and more adipose tissue converts the abundance of androgens into estrogens, leading to earlier puberty.

9 Despite the biology, there is little research that simultaneously investigates mental and physical drivers of menarche and menstrual cycle regularity. We also need research that considers structural drivers, such as socioeconomic and environmental factors. Menarche and menstrual cycle regularity are largely considered unmodifiable reproductive factors, a framing that prevents exploration of the ways structural factors interfere with menstrual health. 10 Structural factors, such as access to healthy food, barriers to physical activity, and disproportionate exposure to environmental toxicants, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals, metals, or air pollutants, shape individual-level factors associated with menarche.
