## Question

Orthostatic rehabilitation definition

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the definition of orthostatic rehabilitation and how to structure it across different conditions and settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality sources that explicitly mention orthostatic rehabilitation. Then, I should verify the core components embedded in those statements. Next, I will consider how these components map onto broader rehabilitation principles and condition-specific contexts like POTS and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. After that, I should synthesize a working definition and double-check it against guideline-backed nonpharmacologic measures. Finally, I will outline practical implementation and acknowledge evidence gaps and uncertainties, making sure I don't overstate what is known.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources that actually use the term "orthostatic rehabilitation". The most explicit and authoritative mentions come from the 2023 Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension consensus, which recommends considering orthostatic rehabilitation for bedbound patients with orthostatic intolerance or pre-existing POTS/hypermobility, and specifies addressing skeletal muscle and autonomic postural response deconditioning, which anchors the construct in both neuromuscular and autonomic domains [^113ze6DC] [^111qX9xD].

> Wait, let me verify the core components embedded in that recommendation. The SIH guidance frames orthostatic rehabilitation as a program that simultaneously targets skeletal muscle deconditioning and autonomic postural response deconditioning, implying a dual-pathway approach that rebuilds peripheral capacity and retrains baroreflex-mediated vascular responses to upright posture, which is consistent with contemporary nonpharmacologic strategies for orthostatic syndromes [^113ze6DC] [^114nQSqq].

> I need to check how this maps onto broader rehabilitation principles so I don't overfit the definition to a single condition. The Cochrane-led rehabilitation definition emphasizes multimodal, goal-directed care that integrates multiple interventions and is delivered by rehabilitation professionals, which fits the SIH framing of a structured program rather than a single maneuver or exercise, and supports the idea that orthostatic rehabilitation is a coordinated, progressive intervention set rather than an isolated tactic [^113Zy2bP].

> Next, I should review condition-specific contexts to ensure the definition generalizes appropriately. For POTS, guidelines recommend semirecumbent or progressive exercise, volume expansion with salt and water, and compression, all of which align with rebuilding skeletal muscle capacity and enhancing autonomic postural responses. Similarly, for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, expert consensus supports graded, non-gravitationally challenging exercise, counterpressure maneuvers, and salt/fluid optimization, reinforcing the same dual-target logic even when the hemodynamic phenotype differs from POTS [^1145XuDa] [^117X4PUn] [^115Tgk7t] [^1147PuKt] [^116DhPtB] [^117BWmPw].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating orthostatic rehabilitation with generic exercise prescriptions. The SIH statement's emphasis on "rehabilitation programme" signals a structured, progressive, and supervised approach that escalates orthostatic loading as tolerated, which is distinct from ad hoc exercise advice and aligns with the multimodal, longitudinal nature of rehabilitation as defined for research and clinical delivery [^113ze6DC] [^113Zy2bP].

> Let me synthesize a working definition, and then I will sanity-check it against the sources. Orthostatic rehabilitation is a structured, progressive, multimodal rehabilitation program designed to restore upright tolerance by concurrently addressing skeletal muscle deconditioning and autonomic postural response deconditioning, using graded exercise and orthostatic exposure, volume expansion, and counterpressure strategies, delivered by rehabilitation professionals and individualized to the underlying orthostatic syndrome and patient capacity [^113ze6DC] [^113Zy2bP] [^1145XuDa] [^116DhPtB] [^117BWmPw].

> I should confirm the practical elements that make this clinically actionable. Implementation typically begins with semirecumbent or pool-based aerobic and resistance training to mitigate gravitational intolerance, then advances to upright endurance and functional tasks as tolerated. Education on hydration and salt intake is paired with training in physical counter-maneuvers and, when appropriate, compression garments. Progression is symptom-guided with objective monitoring of orthostatic vitals to titrate load and ensure safety, which mirrors POTS and OH nonpharmacologic protocols and the SIH emphasis on dual deconditioning targets [^1145XuDa] [^116DhPtB] [^113oZczM] [^117BWmPw] [^113ze6DC].

> But wait, what about evidence strength and scope of indication. I need to ensure I don't overstate certainty. The clearest endorsement for orthostatic rehabilitation as a named intervention is in SIH for bedbound patients with orthostatic intolerance or POTS/hypermobility, while in POTS and OH the evidence base for exercise, salt/water, and compression is supportive but heterogeneous and often of low-to-moderate quality; thus, the concept is coherent and guideline-concordant, but high-quality trials specifically testing "orthostatic rehabilitation" as a bundled program remain limited, warranting careful patient selection and outcome tracking [^113ze6DC] [^112XpwD7] [^114GXsgh].

> Final check and conclusion: orthostatic rehabilitation is best understood as a rehabilitation-program approach that deliberately targets both skeletal muscle and autonomic postural deconditioning to improve upright tolerance across orthostatic syndromes, with the most explicit definition and indication currently in SIH, and with transferable principles supported by POTS and OH guidelines for nonpharmacologic care. It is multimodal, progressive, and clinician-supervised, and should be individualized while acknowledging current evidence gaps and the need for ongoing evaluation of efficacy and safety [^113ze6DC] [^1145XuDa] [^117BWmPw] [^113Zy2bP].

Orthostatic rehabilitation is a **structured, progressive program** to improve upright tolerance and reduce symptoms in orthostatic intolerance syndromes (OH, POTS, nOH) [^notfound] by targeting deconditioning and autonomic dysfunction [^113ze6DC]. It combines **graded exercise** (starting supine/semi-recumbent, advancing upright) [^1145XuDa] [^117X4PUn], **counterpressure maneuvers** (leg crossing, squatting, abdominal binders, compression stockings) [^117BWmPw] [^114GXsgh], and **volume expansion** (≥ 2–3 L/day fluids, 8–10 g/day salt) [^113oZczM] [^1147PuKt], with education on trigger avoidance and energy conservation [^113612CJ]. Goals are to **restore function**, lessen dizziness/syncope, and improve quality of life, with evidence of benefit in POTS [^1174Q1Qb] and supportive data in OH/nOH [^114GXsgh] [^116YG3GK].

## Core components of orthostatic rehabilitation

Orthostatic rehabilitation is **multimodal**, integrating physical, educational, and lifestyle interventions:

| **Component** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Graded exercise training | - Start supine/semi-recumbent (e.g. recumbent bike, swimming) [^1145XuDa] <br/> - Progress to upright activities (e.g. walking, treadmill) [^117APADY] <br/> - Emphasizes aerobic and resistance training to improve cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength [^117APADY] |
| Counterpressure maneuvers | - Leg crossing <br/> - Squatting <br/> - Abdominal binders <br/> - Compression stockings [^117BWmPw] <br/> - Reduce venous pooling and stabilize BP during standing [^115Tgk7t] |
| Volume expansion | - Increased fluid intake (≥ 2–3 L/day) [^1147PuKt] <br/> - Salt intake (8–10 g/day) [^113oZczM] <br/> - Expand plasma volume and improve orthostatic tolerance [^113oZczM] |
| Education and lifestyle modification | - Trigger avoidance <br/> - Energy conservation <br/> - Head-up tilt sleeping [^114pcDYL] <br/> - Medication timing adjustments [^notfound] <br/> - Empower self-management and adherence [^117DNKRi] |

## Clinical conditions benefiting from orthostatic rehabilitation

Orthostatic rehabilitation is beneficial across **orthostatic intolerance syndromes**:

- **Orthostatic hypotension (OH)**: Characterized by a sustained drop in BP upon standing, causing dizziness, syncope, and falls [^113612CJ]. Nonpharmacologic measures, including exercise and counterpressure maneuvers, are first-line [^114nQSqq] [^114GXsgh].

- **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**: Marked by excessive HR increase without OH, causing palpitations, dizziness, and fatigue [^113Xrjzq]. Exercise training is a cornerstone of management [^1145XuDa] [^1174Q1Qb].

- **Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH)**: Due to autonomic failure, often with supine hypertension [^116axeU7]. Rehabilitation plus volume expansion and counterpressure maneuvers improve symptoms and quality of life [^117BWmPw] [^116axeU7] [^113oZczM].

---

## Evidence supporting orthostatic rehabilitation

Evidence supports **orthostatic rehabilitation** in POTS, with randomized and pragmatic trials showing improved symptoms, HR responses, and quality of life with structured exercise [^1174Q1Qb] [^117HqT1S]. In OH/nOH, systematic reviews and guidelines endorse nonpharmacologic measures — exercise, counterpressure, and volume expansion — as first-line to reduce symptoms and improve function [^114GXsgh] [^114nQSqq] [^117BWmPw].

---

## Patient selection criteria and contraindications

Patient selection should be **individualized**, with careful screening for:

- **Indications**: Symptomatic OH, POTS, or nOH with functional impairment; willingness to engage in exercise and lifestyle change [^1145XuDa].

- **Contraindications**: Severe cardiovascular instability, uncontrolled arrhythmias, acute illness, or inability to tolerate exercise [^notfound].

- **Precautions**: Monitor for supine hypertension, edema, or heart failure exacerbation during volume expansion [^116DhPtB].

---

## Outcome measures and assessment tools

Outcomes are tracked with **standardized measures**:

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Supine and standing BP/HR, head-up tilt testing, and beat-to-beat monitoring [^111jn2Ym] [^113YcZq6].

- **Symptom assessment**: Orthostatic Grading Scale, Composite Autonomic Symptom Score, and patient-reported symptom diaries [^notfound].

- **Functional outcomes**: 6-minute walk test, Timed Up-and-Go, and quality-of-life questionnaires (e.g. EQ-5D) [^1174Q1Qb].

---

## Multidisciplinary team involvement

Effective orthostatic rehabilitation requires **coordinated care**:

- **Cardiology**: Diagnosis, risk stratification, and medical management of cardiovascular comorbidities [^113VYy4o].

- **Neurology**: Evaluation of autonomic dysfunction and neurogenic causes [^114nQSqq].

- **Physical therapy**: Design and supervision of graded exercise and counterpressure training [^117BWmPw].

- **Occupational therapy**: Energy conservation, adaptive strategies, and home modifications [^notfound].

- **Dietetics**: Guidance on fluid and salt intake, nutritional support [^113oZczM].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Key challenges include **limited high-quality RCTs** in OH/nOH, variable adherence to exercise and compression, and the need for sustained motivation and caregiver support [^1128JS1i] [^113Ymp6o]. Individualized programming and close follow-up help address these barriers [^114nQSqq].

---

Orthostatic rehabilitation is a **structured, progressive program** that improves upright tolerance and quality of life in orthostatic intolerance syndromes through exercise, counterpressure, volume expansion, and education, with multidisciplinary support and evidence strongest in POTS and growing in OH/nOH [^1145XuDa] [^114nQSqq].

### The evidence for treatments for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a systematic review of randomized trials [^112XpwD7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined as the presence of chronic symptoms of orthostatic intolerance accompanied by an increase in heart rate greater than 30 beats per minute within 10 minutes of assuming an upright posture in the absences of orthostatic hypotension. It is a condition which lacks a definitive treatment strategy, with weak evidence and clinical expertise to support the available guidelines from the Heart Rhythm Society in 2015 and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society in 2020. The limited systematic reviews evaluating the treatment for POTS only reported three or fewer trials when many more trials have been published. In this systematic review, we evaluate the evidence for different treatments for POTS from 21 randomized clinical trials with 750 patients that took place between 2000 and 2023. This review summarizes the available evidence from trials on propranolol, midodrine, pyridostigmine and ivabradine as well as less commonly used medications such as desmopressin, melatonin, atomoxetine, modafinil, sertraline and intravenous immunoglobulins. Moreover, the trial evidence for non-pharmacological treatments is described including increase intake of dietary sodium, exercise training, compression and devices. We conclude that many small trials have evaluated different treatments for POTS. Large randomized trials are needed to determine if mainstay treatments beta-blockers, midodrine, and pyridostigmine should be used as first line treatment(s).

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies, and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (eg, counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Sleep posture and hydration: simple lifestyle interventions with therapeutic cardiovascular health potential? [^114QP6Mi]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular implications of fluid regulation have been extensively debated. In the late 19th century, the neurologist Sir William Gowers systematically described orthostatic hypotension as a clinical phenomenon involving a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing. In 1940, Maclean and Allen published the concept of positional therapy, including head-up-tilt, as a treatment for orthostatic intolerance. Prior studies have primarily centered on hydration in acute or exercise contexts, leaving a gap in the understanding of medium- to long-term impacts of systematic fluid intake increases. Moreover, head-up sleep (HUS) — a modification of nocturnal posture — has traditionally been explored in patients with orthostatic intolerance but not in the general population.

Guo et al's informative study on the "Medium-Term Effects of Increased Water Intake and Head-Up Sleep on Cardiovascular Health" provides a novel perspective on elementary lifestyle interventions targeting cardiovascular health, addressing some of these gaps. Thus, aligning with a growing interest in the role of everyday lifestyle adaptations in enhancing cardiovascular resilience. The study evaluates and compares the effects of solitary increased fluid intake (IFI), against its combination with HUS (IFI + HUS) on cardiac structure, function, and aerobic capacity in healthy adults. Importantly, the study contributes to the broader understanding of nonpharmacological strategies aimed at optimizing cardiac function, with implications for both clinical practice and future research directions.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of OH/nOH when compared to the normal population.

For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when the symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals. A more complete list of questions to use when screening patients for OH/nOH is presented in Table 1. If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the questions listed in Table 1, they should be considered as being at risk for OH/nOH and a more complete evaluation including orthostatic vital signs needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH. From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of question 10 "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 min of standing and get better when you sit or lay down?" Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing that they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.

* Any positive response should prompt further investigation with orthostatic blood pressure measurements

### Orthostatic hypotension: a practical approach [^113612CJ]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more systolic or 10 mm Hg or more diastolic within three minutes of standing from the supine position or on assuming a head-up position of at least 60 degrees during tilt table testing. Symptoms are due to inadequate physiologic compensation and organ hypoperfusion and include headache, lightheadedness, shoulder and neck pain (coat hanger syndrome), visual disturbances, dyspnea, and chest pain. Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in the community setting is 20% in older adults and 5% in middle-aged adults. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus increase the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in all age groups. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular risk and falls, and up to a 50% increase in relative risk of all-cause mortality. Diagnosis is confirmed by performing a bedside simplified Schellong test, which consists of blood pressure and heart rate measurements after five minutes in the supine position and three minutes after moving to a standing position. If the patient is unable to stand safely or the clinical suspicion for orthostatic hypotension is high despite normal findings on the bedside test, head-up tilt table testing is recommended. Orthostatic hypotension is classified as neurogenic or nonneurogenic, depending on etiology and heart rate response. Treatment goals for orthostatic hypotension are reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Initial treatment focuses on the underlying cause and adjusting potentially causative medications. Nonpharmacologic strategies include dietary modifications, compression garments, physical maneuvers, and avoiding environments that exacerbate symptoms. First-line medications include midodrine and droxidopa. Although fludrocortisone improves symptoms, it has concerning long-term effects.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^111DfMcy]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance — pathophysiology and symptoms — are characterized by autonomic nervous failure (ANF) with chronically impaired sympathetic efferent activity and deficient vasoconstriction, leading upon standing to a fall in BP with syncope or pre-syncope. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as an abnormal decrease in systolic BP upon standing. Although pathophysiologically there is no overlap between reflex syncope and ANF, their clinical manifestations frequently overlap. Orthostatic intolerance refers to symptoms and signs in the upright position due to a circulatory abnormality, where syncope is one symptom along with dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness or fatigue, palpitations and sweating, visual and hearing disturbances, and pain in the neck, low back, or precordial region.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^115dLWq1]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can seriously impair patients' quality of life and is associated with increased morbidity, especially in the elderly. In several neurological diseases associated with autonomic failure, NOH is a major contributor to disease burden and reduced quality of life. A structured approach is important in the management of patients with NOH. Non-pharmacological interventions should be the first line of therapy. If the symptoms persist and the patients are severely affected, pharmacological interventions are required.

Introduction

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a prevalent disorder. Clinicians from a variety of specialties need to be well informed about diagnosis and management of nOH as it carries a significant burden of morbidity and has also been associated with increased mortality. Clinicians should, therefore, familiarize themselves with this condition and evolving management options, which offer substantial symptomatic improvement. This communication will focus primarily on nOH, while recognizing that orthostatic symptoms are often multifactorial: i.e. patients with nOH may have their symptoms worsened by medications, hypovolemia, intrinsic cardiovascular disease, and other factors.

The literature on nOH is fraught with inconsistencies in the definition and methods of diagnosis, and suffers from a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practice'. As nOH is a subset of orthostatic hypotension (OH), it should be noted that patients with nOH and OH may experience the same symptoms but for different reasons. The following consensus definition of OH was devised by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, and endorsed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies and the World Federation of Neurology: OH is "… a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg, or both, within 3 min of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table". In addition to meeting the definition for OH, patients with nOH have impairment of the autonomic nervous system that is characterized by failure to provide adequate autonomic postural responses, most prominently systemic vasoconstriction and a compensatory increase in heart rate sufficient to maintain blood pressure. This deficit is, in large part, attributed to insufficient norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. In addition, many patients with nOH also suffer from supine hypertension, which further confounds therapy because pharmacologic treatments to normalize standing blood pressure may worsen supine hypertension. Differences in study designs and endpoints, as well as a paucity of data, preclude achieving definitive evidence-based treatment regimens through a systematic review of trials. To move forward in an effective and safe manner, consensus is required on the basics of screening, diagnosing, and treating patients with nOH. Thus, an expert opinion statement to these basic approaches is needed.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113VYy4o]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To address this issue, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH and associated supine hypertension. Results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants are presented here along with recommendations in each of the topic areas. Whereas most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists, the first point of contact and potential for identification of nOH is with the primary care clinicians. Hence, the following consensus commentary is meant to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and/or ultimately manage nOH.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical review [^111MraR4]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome was defined in adult patients as an increase > 30 beats per minute in heart rate of a symptomatic patient when moving from supine to upright position. Clinical signs may include postural tachycardia, headache, abdominal discomfort, dizziness/presyncope, nausea, and fatigue. The most common adolescent presentation involves teenagers within 1–3 years of their growth spurt who, after a period of inactivity from illness or injury, cannot return to normal activity levels because of symptoms induced by upright posture. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is complex and likely has numerous, concurrent pathophysiologic etiologies, presenting along a wide spectrum of potential symptoms. Nonpharmacologic treatment includes (1) increasing aerobic exercise, (2) lower-extremity strengthening, (3) increasing fluid/salt intake, (4) psychophysiologic training for management of pain/anxiety, and (5) family education. Pharmacologic treatment is recommended on a case-by-case basis, and can include beta-blocking agents to blunt orthostatic increases in heart rate, alpha-adrenergic agents to increase peripheral vascular resistance, mineralocorticoid agents to increase blood volume, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. An interdisciplinary research approach may determine mechanistic root causes of symptoms, and is investigating novel management plans for affected patients.

Q19. How should post-treatment rebound headache be identified and managed?

Before an EBP, fibrin sealant patch or surgical repair of spinal CSF leak, patients should be informed about the entity of post-treatment rebound headache.

When rebound headache after treatment of SIH occurs, patients need to be evaluated for secondary intracranial hypertension. If very severe or worsening continues after 1–2 weeks further clinical review may be indicated. The development of rebound headache after treatment for SIH may indicate postprocedural intracranial hypertension which is self-limiting in most individuals and can often be managed without medical treatment.

There is anecdotal use of acetazolamide, topiramate and diuretics for rebound intracranial hypertension but these agents are not well tolerated and recommended treatment duration is not well defined in SIH treatment-related rebound headache.

Q20. How should neurological symptoms other than headache in patients with SIH be identified and managed?

Treatment of non-headache symptoms in SIH should focus primarily on management of the CSF leak, in tandem with best symptomatic management, for example, antiemetics for nausea and vomiting and encouragement of adequate hydration. Symptomatic management and advice on ways of coping with symptoms should be discussed with patients, while attempting treatment for CSF leak, but the evidence base for their use is lacking.

Q21. Is there a role for 'orthostatic rehabilitation' in the long-term management of orthostatic intolerance in patients with SIH?

Orthostatic rehabilitation should be considered for patients who have been bedbound, in particular those who have developed symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and patients with pre-existing PoTS and/or hypermobility syndromes. The rehabilitation programme should address both deconditioning affecting skeletal muscle and deconditioning affecting autonomic postural responses.

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^114rWEdn]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical management

There is no evidence that individuals with an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response and blood pressure within the normal range require antihypertensive therapy. It may be prudent to follow up these patients' blood pressure given the increased risk for progression to arterial hypertension. In patients with isolated orthostatic hypertension in whom blood pressure is only in the hypertensive range while standing, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may have utility in gauging the overall blood pressure load during the day and detecting abnormalities in diurnal blood pressure patterns, such as extreme blood pressure dipping during the night or masked morning hypertension. Patients fulfilling orthostatic hypertension criteria have not been specifically sought for or excluded from blood pressure trials. It appears reasonable prescribing antihypertensive therapies according to current hypertension guidelines. There is no evidence that patients with orthostatic hypertension benefit from a particular drug class in terms of cardiovascular risk protection. Whether diuretics, which could further increase neurohumoral activation while standing should be avoided in patients with orthostatic hypertension is unclear given the known benefits of such drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Overall, there is a need for additional research to guide clinical decision making in patients with an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response and orthostatic hypertension. We hope that a uniform definition will support this endeavor.

Diagnosis of nOH in individuals who screen positive for OH

After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for OH, an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendation. A stepwise approach is recommended for diagnosis of nOH, specifically starting with measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Stepwise approach to the diagnosis of nOH

Diagnostic tests for nOH

Blood pressure testing

The hallmark test for OH is measurement of change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 min of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt [HUT]). Current guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

A practical stepwise approach to orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate testing

In-clinic monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate

The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 min and then stand for 3 min, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1 and 3 min of standing. However, in facilities in which this method is impractical, a seated-to-standing blood pressure can be performed as an acceptable alternative. In the alternative method, patients sit for at least 5 min and then stand for 3 min, with blood pressure measured just prior to standing and at 1 and 3 min of standing. If the test is positive (i.e. ≥ 20/10 mmHg decline in blood pressure with standing), the subject has OH. However, if the test is negative but symptoms are strongly suggestive of OH, a supine-to-standing blood pressure test (or HUT) should be considered. As some individuals with OH are at risk for falls when standing suddenly, testing staff should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions.

Orthostatic syndromes — definitions and hemodynamic criteria — are specified as follows: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is "a drop in systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture"; initial (immediate) OH is "a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope"; classic OH is "a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 min of assuming upright posture"; delayed OH is "a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop"; orthostatic tachycardia is "a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age)"; orthostatic intolerance symptoms "can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, OH, or syncope", and individuals have " ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture"; neurogenic OH is a subtype "due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system" rather than environmental triggers.

### Rehabilitation definition for research purposes: a global stakeholders' initiative by cochrane rehabilitation [^113Zy2bP]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Suppose some articles report treatments like manipulation, exercises, and orthosis as single interventions. At the same time, in the clinical reality of these studies, they were multimodal rehabilitation because they combined with others (e.g. counseling, education, cognitive-behavioral component). Their results would lead manipulation therapists or trainers to apply these treatments without adding the other elements, that is, providing single interventions and not rehabilitation. Consequently, the results could be completely different from the expectations. Failure to recognize what was performed in the primary studies (single intervention or rehabilitation?) because of poor study conduct, reporting, or (even worse, but probably also common) understanding can significantly impact the clinical end users. This negative effect multiplies in the case of secondary evidence synthesis. The risks are that the results of primary studies with highly different interventions are pooled together because they are erroneously judged to be similar interventions. Consequently, evidence syntheses may fail to identify effective treatments, generating low certainty results, generally limited by high heterogeneity. The broad audience and influence of evidence syntheses, for example, informing recommendations within clinical guidelines, make this a potentially serious problem that may impact the delivery of effective rehabilitation. The current rehabilitation definition can help (1) primary researchers to correctly define what they are doing when they study "rehabilitation interventions" or "rehabilitation", and, particularly important, (2) evidence synthesis producers when they bring together and combine studies produced in different settings and test a variety of interventions.

Implementing this new rehabilitation definition for research purposes is a crucial part of this process. Cochrane Rehabilitation initiated the project and will work with the Cochrane Review and Method Groups to add the definition to their Cochrane SRs quality check. The project involved the Chief Editors of some major rehabilitation scientific journals, many of whom have agreed to promote the definition by either publishing this article or an editorial/letter/commentary.

We recognize that this rehabilitation definition for scientific purposes is the first edition. In the following years, we expect new studies to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this definition and consequently lead to future refinements that further improve it.

Orthostatic intolerance — definition and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) features are described as frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing and are relieved by sitting or lying, most commonly including lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. One condition of note is POTS, in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm; although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS. Treatments that improve symptoms of POTS might decrease the occurrence of syncope, although this is unknown.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^115tvNb9]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia — definitions and haemodynamic patterns — are detailed as follows: Classical orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 20 mmHg and in diastolic BP ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing; initial OH is a BP decrease immediately on standing of > 40 mmHg with rapid recovery such that the period of hypotension is short (< 30 s), and tracings show the nadir at 7–10 s followed by recovery; in autonomic failure (ANF), BP may fall immediately after standing to very low levels after 1 min upright with little heart rate (HR) increase; delayed (progressive) OH is not uncommon in elderly persons, is attributed to age-related impairment of compensatory reflexes and stiffer hearts, is characterized by a slow progressive decrease in systolic BP on assuming erect posture, is differentiated by the absence of a bradycardic reflex but may be followed by reflex bradycardia with a less steep fall in BP in the elderly than in the young; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) occurs in some patients, mostly young women, with severe orthostatic intolerance but not syncope and very marked HR increases [> 30 beats per minute (b.p.m.) or to > 120 b.p.m.], is frequently associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, and its underlying pathophysiology remains to be determined.

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^112L8LiY]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Standing imposes a major hemodynamic burden on the cardiovascular system. In healthy persons, neurohumoral reflex mechanisms, particularly the arterial baroreflex, maintain blood pressure with standing. However, the counterregulatory response overshoots in some people such that blood pressure increases with standing. This orthostatic pressor response may result in hypertensive blood pressure levels only when standing or further exacerbate arterial hypertension. The condition is often referred to as orthostatic hypertension and appears to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Yet, a uniform definition and diagnostic cutoff values of orthostatic hypertension have not been established. In fact, current hypertension guidelines do not cover orthostatic hypertension. Moreover, diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypertension vary from study to study. Therefore, data regarding the prevalence, cardiovascular risk, and management of orthostatic hypertension is difficult to interpret. We propose a new classification distinguishing between an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response and orthostatic hypertension to facilitate research in this area.

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^113gBUb7]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

We propose a consensus definition of "an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response" in subjects in whom systolic blood pressure increases ≥ 20mmHg when going from the supine to standing posture. This definition can be extended for seated to standing measurements. We reserve the term "orthostatic hypertension" if this pressor response leads to an upright systolic blood pressure ≥ 140mmHg. We believe this consensus definition will help in the study of the pathophysiology, clinical impact, and potential treatment of these entities, and the identification of patients that are at greater cardiovascular risk.

Reflex syncope and orthostatic intolerance — lifestyle management: The goal of therapy is primarily prevention of recurrence and associated injuries, and improvement in quality of life, but not to prolong survival. Since the 2004 guidelines, the greatest advances in treatment lie in the field of lifestyle measures, stemming from basic physiological knowledge and controlled trials. The cornerstone of the non-pharmacological management of patients with reflex syncope is education and reassurance regarding the benign nature of the condition, and initial treatment comprises education regarding awareness and possible avoidance of triggers, early recognition of prodromal symptoms, and performing manoeuvres to abort the episode such as supine posture and physical counterpressure manoeuvres (PCMs).

### Space flight rehabilitation [^113At3Jh]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

The weightless environment of space imposes specific physiologic adaptations on healthy astronauts. On return to Earth, these adaptations manifest as physical impairments that necessitate a period of rehabilitation. Physiologic changes result from unloading in microgravity and highly correlate with those seen in relatively immobile terrestrial patient populations such as spinal cord, geriatric, or deconditioned bed-rest patients. Major postflight impairments requiring rehabilitation intervention include orthostatic intolerance, bone demineralization, muscular atrophy, and neurovestibular symptoms. Space agencies are preparing for extended-duration missions, including colonization of the moon and interplanetary exploration of Mars. These longer-duration flights will result in more severe and more prolonged disability, potentially beyond the point of safe return to Earth. This paper will review and discuss existing space rehabilitation plans for major postflight impairments. Evidence-based rehabilitation interventions are imperative not only to facilitate return to Earth but also to extend the safe duration of exposure to a physiologically hostile microgravity environment.

### Continuous noninvasive orthostatic blood pressure measurements and their relationship with orthostatic intolerance, falls, and frailty in older people [^114VJSy5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify morphological orthostatic blood pressure (BP) phenotypes in older people and assess their correlation with orthostatic intolerance (OI), falls, and frailty and to compare the discriminatory performance of a morphological classification with two established orthostatic hypotension (OH) definitions: consensus (COH) and initial (IOH).

Design

Cross-sectional.

Setting

Geriatric research clinic.

Participants

Four hundred forty-two participants (mean age 72, 72% female) without dementia or risk factors for autonomic neuropathy.

Measurements

Active lying-to-standing test monitored using a continuous noninvasive BP monitor. For the morphological classification, four orthostatic systolic BP variables were extracted (delta (baseline - nadir) and maximum percentage of baseline recovered by 30 seconds and 1 and 2 minutes) using the 5-second averages method and entered in K-means cluster analysis (three clusters). Main outcomes were OI, falls (≥ 1 in past 6 months), and frailty (modified Fried criteria).

Results

The morphological clusters were small drop, fast overrecovery (n = 112); medium drop, slow recovery (n = 238); and large drop, nonrecovery (n = 92). Their characterization revealed an increasing OI gradient (17.9%, 27.5%, and 44.6% respectively, P < .001) but no significant gradients in falls or frailty. The COH definition failed to reveal clinical differences between COH+ (n = 416) and COH- (n = 26) participants. The IOH definition resulted in a clinically meaningful separation between IOH+ (n = 85) and IOH- (n = 357) subgroups, as assessed according to OI (100% vs 11.5%, P < .001), falls (24.7% vs 10.4%, P < .001), and frailty (14.1% vs 5.4%, P = 0.005).

Conclusion

It is recommended that the IOH definition be applied when taking continuous noninvasive orthostatic BP measurements in older people.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: a hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogenous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical and delayed OH as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms. Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Successful rehabilitation after surgical repair of hip fracture has been associated with handgrip strength but not with orthostatic hypotension in patients 65 yrs of age and above [^116WVu9U]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The identification of factors associated with successful rehabilitation after hip fractures enables more successful planning of the rehabilitation process and discharge from the hospital. Orthostatic hypotension and handgrip strength have been evaluated in previous studies as potential predictors of rehabilitation outcomes, with inconsistent results.

Design

A retrospective study of patients 65 yrs of age and above who underwent rehabilitation after surgical repair of hip fracture in the geriatric department between July 2020 and October 2023. Handgrip strength was measured during the first 3 days of hospitalization using a digital dynamometer. Orthostatic hypotension was measured a week after admission to the ward by the tilt table test. Successful rehabilitation was defined as a Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score Revised above 50%.

Results

Data were collected for 253 patients. The mean age was 80.5 ± 7.7 and 32.4% were males. The mean handgrip strength was 17.2 ± 6.6 kg. Orthostatic hypotension was diagnosed in 32.8%. One hundred ninety-three patients (76.3%) reached the goal of Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score Revised ≥ 50 at the end of the rehabilitation. In a logistic regression analysis, handgrip strength, cognitive state, and sex were associated with successful rehabilitation.

Conclusions

Measuring handgrip strength, but not orthostatic hypotension, can predict successful rehabilitation.

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^115FjaCu]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Our goal was to arrive at a pragmatic definition that could be utilized in the setting of mechanism-oriented studies, epidemiological surveys, and clinical trials. We are aware that the suggested definitions are based on clinical reasoning and normative data rather than cardiovascular risk estimates and that the definitions as well as blood pressure cutoff values may have to be refined in the future. While orthostatic hypertension may be associated with cardiovascular risk as outlined in the sections below, more data is required to allow for a risk-based definition.

In the Malmö Preventive Project, blood pressure measurements after 10 min in the supine position and after one-minute standing were measured in 33,346 persons aged 45.7 ± 7.4 years. On average, systolic blood pressure decreased 1.2 mmHg with a standard deviation of 8.8 mmHg. In the follow-up study to the Malmö Preventive Project, the Malmö Offspring Study, among 4019 participants aged 41.9 ± 14.5 years, systolic blood pressure increased by 1.4 ± 8.6 mmHg after 3 min of standing corroborating Malmö Preventive Project observations. Thus, 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure cutoff value for an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response corresponds to approximately two standard deviations above the population mean.

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^117APADY]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Challenge II: Lack Of Standardized Approaches To Physical Rehabilitation And Psychopharmacology

Physical Rehabilitation Approaches

The use of guided and progressive exercise and rehabilitation strategies has been shown to reduce signs and symptoms of POTS in adults and adolescents, even to the point of full recovery. Since more thorough exercise-based research in youth with POTS is lacking, clinical guidelines and protocols based on adult research have been created for youth. These include progressively working towards completing one or more hours of moderate to vigorous exercises daily plus strength training 3x/week. Due to intolerance of upright positions, it is often recommended patients start with reclined exercises (e.g. recumbent biking, swimming) and work towards upright activities (e.g. walking, running). Others have recommended progressive cardiovascular exercise programs targeted at maintaining a 60–70% maximum suggested heart rate for up to 30 mins.

The use of progressive exercise (i.e. aerobic exercise and resistance training) and exposure to orthostatic symptoms has been implemented in both adult and pediatric POTS to improve functional mobility and upright tolerance. Exercise and normalization of functional activities are major components in the treatment of POTS, and it is recommended that patients utilize a rehabilitation specialist (e.g. physical or occupational therapist) for implementation and progression. Self-guided progressive exercising training (with physician implementation) has been reported in adults in programs such as the Dallas Program, which is a progressive exercise program focusing on targeting various heart rate zones and increasing the amount of time a patient can tolerate cardiovascular exercise and upright conditions. Patients often start the program in a more recumbent or seated position in order to reduce excessive symptom provocation. In a recent study, 71% of 103 adults who completed the Dallas Program reported a significant and persistent reduction in POTS symptoms (decrease in heart rate elevation during supine to stand and increased quality of life). Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has modified the Dallas Program for youth. There is a discussion on whether patients with POTS should monitor their own heart rates or use perceived exertion as a guide for exercise tolerance. Patients with POTS often have somatic hypervigilance which may limit their ability to progress toward improved functioning. As such, it is important for the rehabilitation clinician to strike a balance between sign/symptom monitoring and potentially progress-limiting introspection.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^115GNJWY]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Blood pressure regulation is an automatic, moment-by-moment buffering of the blood pressure in response to physiological changes such as orthostasis, exercise and haemorrhage. This finely orchestrated reflex is called the baroreflex. It is a regulated arc of afferent, central and efferent arms. Multiple physiological changes occur with ageing that can disrupt this reflex, making blood pressure regulation less effective. In addition, multiple changes can occur with ageing-related diseases such as neurodegeneration, atherosclerosis, deconditioning and polypharmacy. These changes commonly result in orthostatic hypotension, hypertension or both, and are consistently associated with multiple adverse outcomes. In this article, we discuss the healthy baroreflex, and physiological and pathophysiological reasons for impaired baroreflex function in older people. We discuss why the common clinical manifestations of orthostatic hypotension and concomitant supine hypertension occur, and strategies for balancing these conflicting priorities. Finally, we discuss strategies for treating them, outlining our practice alongside consensus and expert guidance.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^113ze6DC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, more specifically with respect to orthostatic rehabilitation, SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering orthostatic rehabilitation addressing both deconditioning affecting skeletal muscle and deconditioning affecting autonomic postural responses in patients who have been bedbound, especially with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance or pre-existing postural tachycardia syndrome and/or hypermobility syndromes.

### The efficacy of nonpharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension associated with aging [^113oq6n9]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a disabling condition, resulting from a sustained reduction in blood pressure (BP; ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic) within 3 minutes of standing. Aging is one of the most common causes of neurogenic OH, affecting 7% to 30% of community-dwelling older people. Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacologic therapy as first-line treatment in OH, but older people are typically excluded from research, creating a great deal of clinical uncertainty. Because the older population is expanding rapidly, we can expect a growing demand for evidence in this area.

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111vKauN]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

The following variables were extracted independently by two reviewers (J.T. S.L.H.): first author, year of publication, population, study design, study setting, number of participants, % of valid blood pressure measurements, % female, mean or median age, initial OH definition, resting period (min), standing period (min), type of postural change (active stand, passive stand, active supine-to-sit or passive supine-to-sit), blood pressure measurement (continuous or intermittent) and types of devices used to measure initial OH. Active stand was defined as activation of lower limb muscles upon standing up, whereas passive stand or supine-to-sit was defined as immobility or inactivation of lower limb muscles during the transition from supine to standing or sitting. The prevalence of initial OH was extracted for the total population and, if given, for subpopulations. If initial OH prevalence was reported at more than one time point, the first point in time with the highest reported number of participants was included.

Study quality

The quality and risk of bias of individual articles were assessed by two independent reviewers (J.T. S.L.H.) using the nine-point Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) adapted for cross-sectional studies. Articles with an NOS score between 0–3, 4–6 and 7–9 points were defined as low, moderate and high quality, respectively. The specified NOS is provided in Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary data are available in Age and Ageing online.

Meta-analysis

Analyses were stratified by method of blood pressure measurement (continuously and intermittently), initial OH definition (with symptoms and without symptoms) and study population (categorised as general population, geriatric outpatients, institutionalised or mixed population). Additional analyses were performed excluding studies using passive postural changes to test for initial OH. The pooled prevalence of initial OH was presented as a percentage and 95% confidence interval (CI). A random effects model was used to account for heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 -test (< 25% low; 25–75% moderate and > 75% high). P -values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version3.3; Biostat Inc. EnglewoodNK).

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^1123ZpcS]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Youth diagnosed with POTS+pain have difficulties not only with orthostatic intolerance and sympathetic nervous system overactivation but also with physical, academic, psychological, and social functioning and coping skills. We believe an IIPRP structure that acknowledges the biopsychosocial model and incorporates the Dallas Protocol for physical functioning, CBT and ACT components for mental health and pain management skills, family psychoeducation, and medication management (when needed), should be the standard treatment recommendation for pediatric POTS+pain among youth who have moderate to severe disability if collaborative outpatient services are not successful. For a list of IIPRPs who treat pediatric chronic pain and who may be a resource for POTS+pain, please see Table 1. To the best of our knowledge, these are the IIPRPs in the United States that treat youth with POTS+pain. However, there may be programs we are not aware of at this time and we are hopeful there will be additional programs in the future. Programs of this nature have shown improvements in parent- and patient-rated functioning and pain. The Mayo Clinic program, in particular, has shown improvement in functioning, psychological adjustment, and pain intensity among youth with POTS+pain. However, no IIPRPs have published data on POTS-specific improvements (e.g. orthostatic intolerance) following participation in the rehabilitative approach. In other words, they report on improvement in pain and functioning but not change or improvement in POTS symptoms.

### Incidence and outcome of orthostatic hypotension in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation [^117LtRmR]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To document the incidence and outcome of orthostatic hypotension in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation and to determine clinical variables associated with it.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Inpatient setting of a tertiary rehabilitation center.

Participants

Seventy-one stroke patients (41 men, 30 women; mean age, 58.4 ± 10.7 y) with a first clinical stroke, admitted for rehabilitation within 4 weeks of the stroke.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Patients' blood pressure was measured in supine position and on tilting at 90 degrees within 3 days of admission. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 20 mmHg or more.

Results

Orthostatic hypotension was present in 37 (52.1%) patients, of whom 13 had severe hypotension (standing SBP, ≤ 100 mmHg). Twelve (32.4%) patients with orthostatic hypotension were positive for hypotensive symptoms and signs, with 2 patients experiencing near syncope. Orthostatic hypotension was significantly associated with older patients, a lower admission functional status (as measured on the Modified Barthel Index), and more severe hemiparesis. It was, however, not related with the site of stroke or the use of antihypertensives. On discharge, orthostatic hypotension had resolved in 23 patients. The presence of orthostatic hypotension did not influence functional outcome or the length of stay in rehabilitation.

Conclusion

Orthostatic hypotension was common in stroke patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. It should be suspected in older patients who have more severe hemiparesis and a lower functional status.

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gYGnY]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Meta-analysis: prevalence of initial OH

Initial OH prevalence ranged between 0.0 and 72.5% (Table 2). Pooled prevalence of continuously measured initial OH was 29.0% (95% CI: 22.1–36.9%, I² = 94.6%); 27.8% (95% CI: 17.9–40.5%, I² = 96.1%) in the general population; 35.2% (95% CI: 24.2–48.1%, I² = 95.3%) in geriatric outpatients; 10.0% (95% CI: 2.4–33.1%, I² = 0%) in institutionalised individuals and 21.4% (95% CI: 7.0–49.6, I² = 0%) in mixed populations (Figure 2a). Excluding studies using passive postural change resulted in a slightly higher pooled prevalence of continuously measured initial OH of 29.8% (95% CI: 22.3–38.6%, I² = 95.2%) (Supplemental Figure S1a, Supplementary data are available in Age and Ageing online). When studies were stratified by initial OH definition, pooled prevalence of continuously measured initial OH was 31.4% (95% CI: 21.0–44.0%, I² = 95.2%) without symptoms and 29.4% (95% CI: 27.8–31.1%, I² = 94.2%) with symptoms in the definition. Prevalence of continuously measured initial OH without symptoms was 26.7% (95% CI: 13.5–45.9%, I² = 96.3%) in the general population, 47.2% (95% CI: 27.5–67.9%, I² = 90.3%) in geriatric outpatients, 10.0% (95% CI: 1.7–41.6%, I² = 0%) in institutionalised individuals and 21.4% (95% CI: 4.8–59.6%, I² = 0%) in mixed populations (Figure 2b). Excluding studies using passive postural change resulted in a slightly higher pooled prevalence of continuously measured initial OH without symptoms in the definition of 33.5% (95% CI: 21.1–48.7%, I² = 96.0%) (Supplemental Figure S1b, Supplementary data are available in Age and Ageing online). Prevalence of continuously measured initial OH with symptoms was 31.4% (95% CI: 29.6–33.3%, I² = 0%) in the general population and 18.7% (95% CI: 15.7–22.2%, I² = 0%) in geriatric outpatients (Figure 2c). Pooled prevalence of intermittently measured initial OH was 5.6% (95% CI: 1.5–18.9%, I² = 81.1%). Prevalence of intermittently measured initial OH was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.0–23.9%, I² = 0%) in the general population and 7.7% in geriatric outpatients (95% CI: 1.8–27.0%, I² = 86.7%) (Figure 2d).

Diagnosing orthostatic hypertension

When diagnosing an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response or orthostatic hypertension, blood pressure measurements with a brachial cuff suffice. Pulse rate should also be recorded. Preferably, measurements should be conducted in a quiet surrounding to limit confounding of orthostatic blood pressure responses by external stimuli. Supine blood pressure and heart rate should be measured after five minutes of rest in the supine position. Then, patients should stand up actively. Upright blood pressure and heart rate should be measured after 1, 3, and 5 min, at least, to confirm the persistent character of the blood pressure change. We suggest that the measurements after 3 and 5 min be averaged to determine standing systolic blood pressure. For screening purposes, a single measurement after 3 min may be sufficient.

Beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate recordings can be applied in selected patients but are not widely available.

We recommend that repeated orthostatic testing should be conducted on a different day to confirm the diagnosis.

Because supine and upright blood pressure measurements may be difficult to conduct in all patients, seated to upright measurements may be considered for screening purposes. Since hemodynamic changes when standing up from the seated standing position are less compared with standing up from the supine position, the orthostatic pressor response may be less pronounced such that the sensitivity in detecting orthostatic hypertension may decrease. Similar limitations have been observed when using seated to standing measurements when diagnosing orthostatic hypotension. Therefore, we suggest that confirmatory testing be considered with supine to standing measurements.

Head-up tilt testing may be considered for persons unable to undergo an active standing test.

Orthostatic syndromes and orthostatic hypotension (OH) classifications — diagnostic thresholds: Orthostatic intolerance is a constellation of standing-provoked symptoms and individuals have ≥ 1 symptom associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture; orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from recumbent to quiet standing, or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age; OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg on assuming upright posture, with subtypes including initial OH with a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, classic OH with a sustained BP reduction within 3 min of assuming upright posture, and delayed OH that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop; neurogenic OH is due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system rather than environmental triggers.

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^114XHcLa]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

An increase in diastolic blood pressure on standing can be normal. Moreover, in individuals with excessive orthostatic heart rate increases, cardiac stroke volume may decrease such that pulse pressure is narrowed. The resulting spurious diastolic blood pressure increase is difficult to interpret. The panel, therefore, suggests that systolic blood pressure may be more practical when diagnosing orthostatic hypertension.

A recent publication by an expert group suggested that a systolic blood pressure increase while standing by at least 20 mmHg or above 140 mmHg in otherwise normotensive persons could serve as criteria for orthostatic hypertension. The limitation of this broad definition is that individuals with upright blood pressure in the normotensive range could be labeled as being "hypertensive". Even though we cannot exclude that orthostatic blood pressure surges even within the normotensive range can have negative influences on the cardiovascular system, it appears likely that an absolute standing blood pressure in the upright posture is more relevant to cardiovascular risk. Therefore, we propose to distinguish between an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response, which may result in normotensive or hypertensive blood pressure while standing, and factual orthostatic hypertension. Among persons with orthostatic hypertension, some may exhibit isolated orthostatic hypertension, which is an orthostatic pressor with hypertensive blood pressure values only while standing. Others may also be hypertensive while supine or seated with further worsening of blood pressure when standing. Possibly, these subgroups may require a different diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

### Defining rehabilitation: an exploration of why it is attempted, and why it will always fail [^111NaWK1]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

The problem:

Over 187 definitions of rehabilitation exist, none widely agreed or used. Why?

The word:

Words represent a core concept, with a penumbra of associated meanings. A word means what is agreed among those who use it. The precise meaning will vary between different groups. Words evolve, the meaning changing with use. Other words may capture some of the concepts or meanings.

A definition:

A definition is used to control the unstable, nebulous meaning of a word. It delineates, creating a boundary. A non-binary spectrum of meaning is transformed into binary categories: rehabilitation, or not rehabilitation. In clinical terms, it is a diagnostic test to identify rehabilitation. There are many different reasons for categorising something as rehabilitation. Each will need its own definition.

Categorisation:

The ability of a definition to distinguish cases accurately must be validated by comparison with 'the truth'. If there were an external 'true' test to identify rehabilitation, a definition would not be needed. As with most concepts, the only truth is agreement by people familiar with the required distinction. Any definition will generate misclassification. People familiar with the required distinction will also need to resolve mis-categorisation.

Description:

An alternative is a 'descriptive definition', listing features over several domains which must be present. This fails logically. Rehabilitation is an emergent concept, more than the sum of its parts.

Conclusion:

A useful definition cannot be achieved because no definition will cover all needs, and a specific definition for a purpose will misclassify some cases.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^116DhPtB]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Salt intake

Another non-pharmacologic treatment is to monitor and adjust as needed the amount of salt that the patient is ingesting. Because salt is typically seen as a negative dietary component, patients may try to remove or at least reduce salt from their diet. However, many patients who suffer orthostatic symptoms have an inadequate intake of salt. This can be verified by checking the 24-h urinary sodium (in patients who are not taking diuretics or fludrocortisone, urinary sodium > 100 mEq/24 h indicates salt repletion). For the patient with nOH, it is recommended that they add up to 1–2 teaspoons (2.3–4.6 g) of salt per day to their normal diet. Patients at risk for heart failure or severe peripheral edema must be closely monitored for worsening symptoms and salt intake adjusted downward accordingly. The long-term risks associated with greater salt intake (e.g. increased intravascular volume, worsening edema, worsening heart failure, increased blood pressure) need to be weighed against the short-term risks of nOH resulting in fall injury and the negative impact on activities of daily living. The long-term risks of high sodium diets in individuals with orthostatic hypotension have not been well studied.

Physical conditioning

Lower body strength training and moderate, non-strenuous activities may be incorporated into standard treatment for patients with nOH. Deconditioning occurs very quickly in bed bound or hospitalized patients and will exacerbate the magnitude of the blood pressure drop in patients with nOH. We advocate the use of exercise that is not gravitationally challenging, such as a stationary recumbent bicycle, rowing machine, or water-based activities. Upright exercise, such as treadmill walking or running, should be avoided in some patients because of the risk of falls due to nOH. Patients should be cautioned that strenuous activity may temporarily exacerbate symptoms of nOH due to increased core body temperature and peripheral vasodilation as described below. To help mitigate against this occurring, patients should be well hydrated prior to exercise and should be careful when standing after an exercise session.

### Nonpharmacologic management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review [^114GXsgh]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the literature on nonpharmacologic treatment of orthostatic hypotension.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SPORTDiscus were searched for human studies written in the English language between January 1980 and April 2013. Reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed for citations to expand the data set.

Study Selection

Prospective experimental studies assessing nonpharmacologic interventions for management of orthostatic drop in blood pressure in various patient populations were included. All studies identified through the literature search were reviewed independently in duplicate. Of the 642 studies, 23 met the selection criteria.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data for analysis, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and orthostatic symptoms in response to postural challenge before and after the intervention. All 23 studies were assessed in duplicate for risk of bias using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for randomized controlled trials and the Downs and Black tool for nonrandomized trials.

Data Synthesis

There were 8 identified nonpharmacologic interventions for management of orthostatic hypotension under 2 general categories: physical modalities (exercise, functional electrical stimulation, compression, physical countermaneuvers, compression with physical countermaneuvers, sleeping with head up) and dietary measures (water intake, meals). Owing to the clinically diverse nature of the studies, statistical comparison (meta-analysis) was deemed inappropriate. Instead, descriptive comparisons were drawn. Levels of evidence were assigned.

Conclusions

Strong levels of evidence were found for 4 of the 8 interventions: functional electrical stimulation in spinal cord injury, compression of the legs and/or abdomen, physical countermaneuvers in various patient populations, and eating smaller and more frequent meals in chronic autonomic failure. However, this conclusion is based on a limited number of studies with small sample sizes. Further research into all interventions is warranted.

### Endurance exercise training in orthostatic intolerance: a randomized, controlled trial [^117HqT1S]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome characterized by chronic orthostatic symptoms of light-headedness, fatigue, nausea, orthostatic tachycardia, and aggravated norepinephrine levels while standing. The aim of this study was to assess the protective effect of exercise endurance training on orthostatic symptoms and to examine its usefulness in the treatment of orthostatic intolerance. 2768 military recruits were screened for orthostatic intolerance by questionnaire. Tilt-table testing identified 36 cases of orthostatic intolerance out of the 2768 soldiers. Subsequently, 31 of these subjects with orthostatic intolerance entered a randomized, controlled trial. The patients were allocated randomly to either a "training" (3 months jogging) or a "control" group. The influence of exercise training on orthostatic intolerance was assessed by determination of questionnaire scores and tilt-table testing before and after intervention. After training, only 6 individuals of 16 still had orthostatic intolerance compared with 10 of 11 in the control group. The Fisher exact test showed a highly significant difference in diagnosis between the 2 groups (P = 0.008) at the end of the study. Analysis of the questionnaire-score showed significant interaction between time and group (P = 0.001). The trained subjects showed an improvement in the average symptom score from 1.79 ± 0.4 to 1.04 ± 0.4, whereas the control subjects showed no significant change in average symptom score (2.09 ± 0.6 and 2.14 ± 0.5, respectively). Our data demonstrate that endurance exercise training leads to an improvement of symptoms in the majority of patients with orthostatic intolerance. Therefore, we suggest that endurance training should be considered in the treatment of orthostatic intolerance patients.

### Public and patient research priorities for orthostatic hypotension [^117DNKRi]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

With a rapidly expanding older population and increased survival of older people with chronic disease, we can expect to see increasing numbers of people with orthostatic hypotension (OH). Unfortunately the evidence base for people with OH, with particular relevance to older people, has not kept up and has resulted in a real lack of progress and little good evidence. There are several areas of research that could potentially benefit patients but establishing which ones are priority areas requires public and patient involvement (PPI). This process includes people/patients in the research team to maximise the relevance, success and translation of the research. This brief report describes the early involvement of older people in prioritising the research question, methods to improve adherence during a trial and the preferred methods to disseminate research output. The individuals' priority was to research non-pharmacological treatment strategies and to improve the education of patients about their condition. Education was felt to be the best strategy to promote adherence during a trial, with change in symptoms and quality of life felt to be the most important outcome measures as opposed to blood pressure. This report offers guidance for academics that are undertaking OH-related research and how they can improve its relevance and increase its translation into clinical practice.

### Orthostatic hypertension: critical appraisal of an overlooked condition [^114gfSDW]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypertension, which appears to be mediated through excess neurohumoral activation while standing, is a common blood pressure trait among patients with and without arterial hypertension. However, lack of consensus regarding the definition of orthostatic hypertension makes it difficult to assess the true prevalence of this condition. Orthostatic hypertension appears to predict the risk for progression to arterial hypertension in younger and risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in older persons. Yet, the risk may differ between populations. Whether orthostatic hypertension indicates a generally increased risk of death, constitutes an intermediate variable in the causal pathway of cardiovascular risk factors, a simple measure of disease severity, or an independently acting mechanism is not known. Since both orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic hypertension herald increased risk of cardiovascular disease, it appears reasonable to screen the patients for abnormal orthostatic blood pressure responses using simple orthostatic testing. However, how presence of orthostatic hypertension may affect clinical management decisions such as the choice of antihypertensive drugs is currently difficult to ascertain. Clearly, this issue deserves more attention.

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^1163SjD3]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

We propose a consensus definition of "an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response" in subjects in whom systolic blood pressure increases ≥ 20 mmHg when going from the supine to standing posture. This definition can be extended for seated to standing measurements. We reserve the term "orthostatic hypertension" if this pressor response leads to an upright systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg. We believe this consensus definition will help in the study of the pathophysiology, clinical impact, and potential treatment of these entities, and the identification of patients that are at greater cardiovascular risk.

### Combination non-pharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension in older people: a phase 2 study [^116YG3GK]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a disabling condition characterised by a significant drop in blood pressure (BP) upon standing upright. It is particularly common in older people, but this group is usually excluded from research, leading to clinical uncertainty around its management.

Non-pharmacologic therapies are recommended as first-line treatment for OH. Bolus water drinking, abdominal compression and physical counter-manoeuvres (PCM) are efficacious for the treatment of OH associated with ageing, whereas lower limb compression is not. Compression garments are also largely unacceptable to older people with OH, whereas bolus-water drinking and PCMs are well tolerated. It is unknown whether there is any additional benefit to be gained by combining non-pharmacologic interventions.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — clinical criteria: POTS is a clinical syndrome usually characterized by all of the following — frequent symptoms that occur with standing (e.g., lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue), an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm during a positional change from supine to standing or ≥ 40 bpm in those 12–19 y of age, the absence of OH, and a standing heart rate that is often ≥ 120 bpm; symptoms can include standing-related complaints and systemic features such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, and migraine headaches.

### Orthostatic hypertension: a newcomer among the hypertension phenotypes [^111r6uvW]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of OHT

Most studies used only ERTS to identify OHT while only a minority of studies included absolute values of standing BP in the definition. The abovementioned consensus defined OHT as an orthostatic SBP increase ≥ 20 mm Hg associated with an SBP of at least 140 mm Hg while standing. This definition seems to be suitable especially for its potential impact in clinical practice. It avoids that a person with ERTS without high orthostatic BP may be considered as a hypertensive patient.

### Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SJYoy]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Initial OH is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years or older, particularly when measured continuously, highlighting the need to screen and diagnose initial OH. Future research should investigate whether the inclusion of symptoms in the definition of initial OH is clinically relevant. Furthermore, there is a need to establish a consensus on the diagnosis of initial OH using continuous blood pressure devices to consistently identify participants with initial OH.

### Why we need an internationally shared rehabilitation definition for clinical research purposes [^1156pfQi]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Responding to a recent editorial arguing against defining rehabilitation, we discuss the reasons for developing a classification of rehabilitation for research purposes, its philosophical background and some of the possible risks.

Why Define

Science requires the definition and classification of phenomena to allow replication of experiments and studies, and to allow interpretation and use of the findings. As understanding increases, the definitions can be refined. Defining rehabilitation does run the risk of excluding some interventions or practices that are either considered rehabilitation (perhaps wrongly) or are rehabilitation interventions; when identified, these errors in definition can be remedied. Defining rehabilitation for research purposes should not inhibit but could (possibly) orient research.

Risk Of Not

Without a definition, rehabilitation will remain in a permanent limbo. Experts will (apparently) know what it is, while others are left guessing or failing to comprehend or recognise it. This uncertainty may reassure some people, because all possible interventions are included; we argue that it downgrades the understanding of our field because interventions that are not rehabilitation are, nonetheless, called rehabilitation. In an era of international collaboration, and of undertaking systematic reviews with metanalysis, we need a shared definition.

Conclusion

Terminology is often controversial, but definition enables progress in understanding such that terms themselves can evolve over time.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^114pcDYL]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance syndromes — education, volume expansion, and physical measures: Education regarding the nature of the condition with lifestyle advice can improve symptoms even when the rise in blood pressure is relatively small (10–15 mmHg). In the absence of hypertension, patients should be instructed to take sufficient salt and water intake, targeting 2–3 L of fluids per day and 10 g of NaCl. Sleeping with the head elevated (10°) prevents nocturnal polyuria, maintains a more favourable distribution of body fluids, and ameliorates nocturnal hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure recordings may be helpful in identifying abnormal diurnal patterns and may also help identify supine or nocturnal hypertension. Rapid cold water ingestion is reported to be effective in combating orthostatic intolerance and post-prandial hypotension. Gravitational venous pooling in older patients can be treated with abdominal binders or compression stockings, and PCMs such as leg crossing and squatting should be encouraged in patients with warning symptoms able to perform them.

### A prospective study of the association between orthostatic hypotension and falls: definition matters [^114rjyz3]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Background

falls are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in older people. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is considered an important risk factor for falls, but longitudinal studies have failed to show a clear association. This disparity may be because conventional methods of measuring blood pressure (BP) changes are too imprecise and/or the diagnostic criteria for OH are inappropriate. Over recent years, beat-to-beat BP monitoring techniques, which enabled accurate measurement of vasodepression, have become widely used and in 2011 the American Academy of Neurology produced revised diagnostic criteria for OH.

Objective

to use beat-to-beat monitoring to compare the prevalence of OH using the standard and revised diagnostic criteria and to establish which criteria are most valuable in predicting future falls.

Design

two hundred and ninety-seven community-dwelling older people aged ≥ 65 years underwent assessment. Active stand using digital photoplethysmography was used to record postural change in BP. One hundred participants were asked to complete prospective weekly falls diaries for 12 months.

Results

OH, defined according to the revised American Academy of Neurology diagnostic criteria, affected 25% of participants and was an independent predictor of falls (odds ratio 10.299, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.703–61.43, P = 0.011) and time to first fall (hazard ratio 3.017, 95% CI: 1.291–7.050, P = 0.011). OH, defined according to standard criteria, affected 80% of the population and was not associated with falls.

Conclusion

OH, defined according to 2011 criteria, is associated with falls and time to first fall. These findings indicate that beat-to-beat monitoring and the 2011 criteria for OH are valuable in the clinical assessment of older fallers.

Key Messages

- The i-PERFORM RCT will determine whether early targeted rehabilitation will achieve a higher functional level and an improved quality of life in patients with sepsis.

- Participants in the intervention arm will receive early, targeted, individualised rehabilitation program comprising of passive, active and resisted exercises, electrical stimulation to major lower limb muscles, sitting out of bed with exercises and tilt-tabling to improve orthostatic reflexes, ergometry exercises for upper and lower limbs and ambulation.

- Physical functional capacity, quality of life, psychological wellbeing, inflammatory biomarkers, oxidative stress markers, illness severity, muscle oxygenation and microcirculation will be assessed using standard instruments at specific times before, during and after exercise sessions.

- Short-term systemic findings from early rehabilitation in sepsis will be novel and will translate better understanding of the acute effects of early exercise in critical illness.

### Non-pharmacological management of orthostatic hypotension after spinal cord injury: a critical review of the literature [^114YoGsq]. Spinal Cord (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review.

Objectives

Identify and describe the body of literature pertaining to non-pharmacological management of orthostatic hypotension (OH) during the early rehabilitation of persons with a spinal cord injury (SCI).

Setting

Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

Search Strategy

a comprehensive search of electronic databases and cited references was undertaken.

Selection Criteria

case studies, parallel group trials and crossover designs using random or quasi-random assignments were considered. Participants with any level or degree of completeness of SCI and any time elapsed since injury were included. Interventions must have measured at least systolic blood pressure (BP), and have induced orthostatic stress in a controlled manner and have attempted to control OH during an orthostatic challenge.

Data Collection and Analysis

studies were selected, assessed and described qualitatively. Meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate.

Results

Four distinct non-pharmacological interventions for OH were identified: application of compression and pressure to the abdominal region and/or legs, upper body exercise, functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to the legs and biofeedback. Methodological quality varied dramatically between studies. Compression/pressure, upper body exercise and biofeedback therapies have proven inconclusive in their ability to control OH. During orthostatic challenge, FES consistently attenuates the fall in BP; however, its clinical application is less well established.

Conclusions

The clinical usefulness of compression/pressure, upper body exercise and biofeedback for treating OH has not been proven. FES of the legs holds the most promise.

### Orthostatic hypertension: when pressor reflexes overcompensate [^112R38se]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypertension — a rise in blood pressure upon assuming upright posture-is an underappreciated and understudied clinical phenomenon. There is currently no widely agreed-upon definition of clinical orthostatic hypertension, the current definitions being operational within the context of particular studies. The underlying pathophysiology is thought to involve activation of the sympathetic nervous system, but the actual etiology is poorly understood. Orthostatic hypertension is observed in association with a variety of other clinical conditions, including essential hypertension, dysautonomias, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Orthostatic hypertension has been associated with increased occurrence of silent cerebrovascular ischemia and possibly with neuropathy in type 2 diabetes. So, appreciation of the true incidence of orthostatic hypertension, elucidation of the underlying pathophysiology, and an understanding of potentially effective treatment approaches and their associated risks and benefits might all have major clinical significance. Orthostatic hypertension is an aspect of hypertension that is in need of further focused investigation.

ACC/AHA/HRS orthostatic tachycardia and hypotension definitions — orthostatic tachycardia is "A sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age)". Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is "A drop in systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture". Initial (immediate) OH is "A transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope". Classic OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 min of assuming upright posture". Delayed OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop", and "The fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold". Neurogenic OH is "A subtype of OH that is due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and not solely due to environmental triggers (such as dehydration or drugs)".

Orthostatic hypotension

Symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) occur on standing and include light headedness, weakness, giddiness and syncope. OH is defined as a blood pressure fall on standing > 20/10 mmHg (> 30/15 mmHg in those with BP > 150/90 mmHg) without an increase in heart rate (< 15 beats per minute). Treatment of OH involves fluid and salt repletion and encouragement of physical activity and exercise to avoid deconditioning. Fludrocortisone is used but is not FDA approved for OH, and there are concerns over supine hypertension, hypokalaemia, congestive cardiac failure and peripheral oedema. Both midodrine and droxidopa are approved by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic OH.

### Orthostatic hypotension and symptoms in the AASK trial [^117TB98J]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple definitions are used to characterize orthostatic hypotension (OH), but the degree to which these definitions correspond with orthostatic symptoms is unknown.

Methods

We analyzed data from African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), a randomized trial of African Americans with hypertension and kidney disease, to characterize the relationship between OH definitions and self-reported syncope, dizziness, or light-headedness. Orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), or heart rate (HR) were determined each visit after standing 2:45 minutes. OH was defined using the consensus definition (a drop in SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 10 mm Hg) or an often used clinical substitute based on HR (an increase ≥ 20 bpm).

Results

Among 1,094 participants (mean age 54.5 ± 10.7 years, 38.9% female), there were 52,636 visits (mean 48/person). Mean resting SBP, DBP, and HR at baseline were 147.7 ± 22.3 mm Hg, 92.2 ± 13.4 mm Hg, and 71.1 ± 11.7 bpm, respectively. While the OH consensus definition was associated with syncope (odds ratio 2.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.13, 5.51), dizziness (1.89; 1.53, 2.33), and light-headedness (1.84; 1.52, 2.23), the clinical HR definition was only associated with dizziness (1.28; 1.07, 1.52). None of the OH components (SBP, DBP, or HR) reflected a natural threshold in the prevalence of symptoms; definitions using each of the 3 components were highly specific (≥ 96%) with low sensitivity (1–5%).

Conclusions

While the consensus definition was more strongly associated with symptoms, OH definitions did not reflect natural thresholds in symptoms and were insensitive. This implies that the absence of OH using either consensus or clinical definitions does not exclude orthostatic symptoms, which has implications for evaluating clinical events like falls.

### Interventions for preventing falls and fall-related fractures in community-dwelling older adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113pcxUH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Protocol

The protocol for this SR and NMA was registered online with PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019137466) and was developed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) statement.

Study identification

We updated Tricco et al.'sSR and NMA of fall prevention interventions in older adults. We applied the same search terms as used in the original Tricco et al.'s review and updated the search from December 1, 2015, until February 27, 2019. The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (OVID), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search strategies with limitations are included in Appendix S11. The electronic search was supplemented with manual searches for additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs), by reviewing the reference lists of previous reviews, a recommendations statement, and NMA. We extended Tricco et al.'s search by searching for additional interventions (management of urinary incontinence, management of orthostatic hypotension, walking aids, and chiropractic care) from database inception to February 2019. As a NMA is time‐consuming, new papers might be published after the search period. To check whether the findings of the current NMA are consistent with most recent literature, the outcomes from two large RCTs published after the search date, were incorporated into a post hoc analysis.

Eligibility criteria

We included (cluster) randomized and quasi‐RCTs published in any language that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions for preventing falls in community‐dwelling persons aged ≥ 65 years. For details of the eligible study population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes, as well as the exclusion criteria, see Table S11. We excluded studies on specific conditions (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease), where the effects of the interventions cannot be generalized to most community‐dwelling older people.

Study selection

Two authors each reviewed half of the study titles and abstracts that resulted from the search, and then both independently reviewed the full text of all studies that were retained. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author. To ensure consistency of the eligibility criteria applied, the authors performed a pilot‐test screening beforehand.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^1114Ts7Z]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Autonomic/exertional tolerance impairments — physical therapists should test for orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysfunction by evaluating heart rate and blood pressure in supine, sitting, and standing positions, and should conduct a symptom-guided, graded exertional tolerance test for patients reporting exertional intolerance, dizziness, headache, and/or a desire to return to high-level exertional activities, tailoring timing, modality, and protocol to optimize safety; for patients highly symptomatic at rest, the test should be delayed until symptoms are stable and more tolerable at rest, and clinicians may postpone testing if other symptoms and impairments are of higher priority; testing modality and protocol should be based on clinical judgment, patient comfort, and equipment availability, with heart rate and blood pressure monitored periodically throughout and afterward with symptom and rating-of-perceived-exertion responses; if vestibulo-oculomotor or cervical spine impairments or symptoms are present, a stationary bicycle should be used to reduce the risk of exacerbating impairments or compromising validity; clinicians may use orthostatic/autonomic assessments and symptom-guided graded exertional tolerance tests even when exertional intolerance is not reported to help determine contributions of autonomic dysfunction, deconditioning, or fitness to symptoms, and may conduct exertional tests in such patients to rule out subtle autonomic dysfunction, establish initial postconcussion performance level, and identify exertional targets for aerobic exercise training that may promote brain health and healing.

### Cardiovascular exercise as a treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a pragmatic treatment trial [^1174Q1Qb]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous disorder of orthostatic intolerance with few proven treatments.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of an unsupervised at-home training regimen for the treatment of POTS.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records including autonomic function testing, symptom scores, and activities of daily living in individuals with POTS who were invited to participate in a 6-month outpatient cardiovascular exercise program.

Results

Seventy-seven individuals were invited (invited group), 48 of 77 (62%) participated (treated group) and 43 of 77 (56%) of those completed. Twenty-nine of 77 (38%) did not participate (control group). After 6 months, 11 of 48 (23%) individuals in the treated group met heart rate criteria for POTS compared with 27 of 29 (93%) in the control group (χ 2 test, P < .0001). Supine heart rate (68 ± 8 beats/min vs 77 ± 10 beats/min; P < .001) and standing heart rate (95 ± 11 beats/min vs 115 ± 10 beats/min; P < .001) decreased in the treated group compared with the control group. The frequency of syncope decreased in the treated group (P < .001). An improvement in the EuroQol perceived quality of life scale score was detected in the treated group (61 ± 15 vs 71 ± 12 after 6 months, P < .001) compared with the control group (64 ± 9 vs 66 ± 8 after 6 months; p = 0.52).

Conclusion

In this study, we report a successful pragmatic clinical trial of an outpatient exercise protocol in a tertiary care referral population that significantly improved cardiovascular function and quality of life in patients with POTS.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and individual participant-based meta-analysis [^113fpocK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment reduces risk for cardiovascular disease, there are concerns that it might cause orthostatic hypotension (OH).

Purpose

To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing.

Data Extraction

2 investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

5 trials examined BP treatment goals, and 4 examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18 466 participants with 127 882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included 4 additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged.

Limitations

Assessments of OH were done while participants were seated (not supine) and did not include the first minute after standing. Data on falls and syncope were not available.

Conclusion

Intensive BP-lowering treatment decreases risk for OH. Orthostatic hypotension, before or in the setting of more intensive BP treatment, should not be viewed as a reason to avoid or de-escalate treatment for hypertension.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS): a critical assessment [^1142on9W]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Although diagnostic criteria have been developed characterizing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), no single set of criteria is universally accepted. Furthermore, there are gaps in the present criteria used to identify individuals who have this condition. The reproducibility of the physiological findings, the relationship of symptoms to physiological findings, the presence of symptoms alone without any physiological findings and the response to various interventions confuse rather than clarify this condition. As many disease entities can be confused with POTS, it becomes critical to identify what this syndrome is. What appears to be POTS may be an underlying condition that requires specific therapy. POTS is not simply orthostatic intolerance and symptoms or intermittent orthostatic tachycardia but the syndrome needs to be characterized over time and with reproducibility. Here we address critical issues regarding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of POTS in an attempt to arrive at a rational approach to categorize the syndrome with the hope that it may help both better identify individuals and better understand approaches to therapy.

### Orthostatic hypotension in the elderly: are the diagnostic criteria adequate? [^113rdhAP]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common finding in the elderly. OH is defined as a fall of at least 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (BP) and/or 10 mmHg in diastolic BP upon assuming an upright posture. Some patients exhibit a fall in BP of less than the defined OH upon standing. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of BP changes not defined as OH among elderly in-patients and to assess the relationship between these changes in the morning and the occurrence of OH during the day. Postural BP measurements were performed in 502 in-patients; in the morning, early afternoon, and in the evening. We defined intermediate postural drop (ID) in BP as a decrease of 10–19 mmHg in systolic BP and/or of 5–9 mmHg in diastolic BP. We observed that OH and ID occurred in 39.2 and 18.5% of the measurements in the morning, respectively. The prevalence of OH and ID was lower in the evening than in the morning (P < 0.05) and afternoon (P < 0.005). Postural BP changes in the morning correlated with those occurring later in the day. Patients who had ID in the morning had a 57% probability of having OH later during the day. In conclusions, ID is prevalent in elderly in-patients. ID in the morning predicts OH later in the day. Thus, postural BP drops below the OH range may be an important finding in the geriatric population.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: clinical presentation, aetiology and management [^112i64BX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a variant of cardiovascular autonomic disorder characterized by an excessive heart rate increase on standing and orthostatic intolerance. POTS affects younger individuals 15–45 years old with a distinct female predominance (≈80%). The prevalence ranges between 0.2% and 1.0% in developed countries. The onset of POTS is typically precipitated by immunological stressors such as viral infection, vaccination, trauma, pregnancy, surgery or psychosocial stress. The most common complaints are dizziness, weakness, rapid heartbeat and palpitation on standing. Moreover, patients often report physical deconditioning and reduced exercise capacity as well as headache, 'brain fog', dyspnoea, gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal pain. The aetiology of POTS is largely unknown and three main hypotheses include an autoimmune disorder, abnormally increased sympathetic activity and catecholamine excess, and sympathetic denervation leading to central hypovolaemia and reflex tachycardia. The golden standard for POTS diagnosis is head-up tilt test with a non-invasive beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring. Although long-term prognosis of POTS is poorly explored, around 50% of patients spontaneously recover within 1–3 years. After the diagnosis has been established, patient should be thoroughly educated about non-pharmacological measures alleviating the symptoms. Exercise training may be very effective and counteract deconditioning. In more symptomatic patients, different drugs directed at controlling heart rate, increasing peripheral vasoconstriction and intravascular volume can be tested. However, the overall effects of pharmacological therapy are modest and the most affected patients remain handicapped. Future efforts should focus on better understanding of POTS pathophysiology and designing randomized controlled trials for selection of more effective therapy.

### Cardiovascular responses to orthostasis and their association with falls in older adults [^11127RJU]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) refers to a marked decline in blood pressure when upright. OH has a high incidence and prevalence in older adults and represents a potential intrinsic risk factor for falls in these individuals. Previous studies have not included more recent definitions for blood pressure responses to orthostasis, including initial, delayed, and recovery blood pressure responses. Furthermore, there is little research examining the relationships between cerebrovascular functioning and falling risk. Therefore, we aimed to: (i) test the association between different blood pressure responses to orthostatic stress and retrospective falling history and; (ii) test the association between cerebrovascular responses to orthostatic stress and falling history.

Methods

We tested 59 elderly residents in long term care facilities who underwent a passive seated orthostatic stress test. Beat-to-beat blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) responses were assessed throughout testing. Risk factors for falls and falling history were collected from facility records. Cardiovascular responses to orthostasis were compared between retrospective fallers (≥ 1 fall in the previous year) and non-fallers.

Results

Retrospective fallers had larger delayed declines in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) compared to non-fallers (p = 0.015). Fallers also showed poorer early (2 min) and late (15 min) recovery of SAP. Fallers had a greater decline in systolic CBFV.

Conclusions

Older adults with a positive falling history have impaired orthostatic control of blood pressure and CBFV. With better identification and understanding of orthostatic blood pressure impairments earlier intervention and management can be implemented, potentially reducing the associated risk of morbidity and mortality. Future studies should utilize the updated OH definitions using beat-to-beat technology, rather than conventional methods that may offer less accurate detection.

### An implantable system to restore hemodynamic stability after spinal cord injury [^111nuaer]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Results

Underappreciated prevalence of hypotensive complications

EES is a promising therapy to address the lack of satisfying management options for hemodynamic instability due to SCI. However, EES requires a neurosurgical intervention that must be weighed against the risks and benefits of the procedure. Establishing this balance requires an understanding of the prevalence, symptomatology and effectiveness of current management strategies. While hypotension is a recognized medically refractory complication of SCI, these epidemiological factors have not been quantified conclusively.

To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the Spinal Cord Injury Community Survey (SCICS), which includes self-reported information on symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and demographic information in 1,479 individuals living with chronic SCI (Supplementary Fig. 1a–e and Supplementary Note 1). This analysis revealed that 78% of individuals with tetraplegia had been told by a medical practitioner that they had orthostatic hypotension. Of this subset of individuals who were diagnosed, 28% of them were being treated for orthostatic hypotension, yet 91% still experienced symptoms (Fig. 1a).

### Orthostatic hypotension: JACC state-of-the-art review [^116axeU7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent and disabling feature of autonomic failure due to both peripheral and central neurodegenerative diseases. Community-based epidemiological studies have demonstrated a high morbidity and mortality associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. It is due to impairment of baroreflex-mediated vasoconstriction of the skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulation and is caused by damage or dysfunction at central and/or peripheral sites in the baroreflex efferent pathway. Nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions may be implemented to ameliorate the symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and improve quality of life. Many patients will be adequately treated by education, counseling, removal of hypotensive medications, and other nonpharmacological interventions, whereas more severely afflicted patients require pharmacological interventions. The first stage of pharmacological treatment involves repletion of central blood volume. If unsuccessful, this should be followed by treatment with sympathomimetic agents.

### Orthostatic hypotension, hypertension treatment, and cardiovascular disease: an individual participant meta-analysis [^117TEE2q]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are ongoing concerns about the benefits of intensive vs standard blood pressure (BP) treatment among adults with orthostatic hypotension or standing hypotension.

Objective

To determine the effect of a lower BP treatment goal or active therapy vs a standard BP treatment goal or placebo on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or all-cause mortality in strata of baseline orthostatic hypotension or baseline standing hypotension.

Data Sources

Individual participant data meta-analysis based on a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases through May 13, 2022.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) with orthostatic hypotension assessments.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Individual participant data meta-analysis extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Effects were determined using Cox proportional hazard models using a single-stage approach.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were CVD or all-cause mortality. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic BP of at least 20 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP of at least 10 mm Hg after changing position from sitting to standing. Standing hypotension was defined as a standing systolic BP of 110 mm Hg or less or standing diastolic BP of 60 mm Hg or less.

Results

The 9 trials included 29 235 participants followed up for a median of 4 years (mean age, 69.0 [SD, 10.9] years; 48% women). There were 9% with orthostatic hypotension and 5% with standing hypotension at baseline. More intensive BP treatment or active therapy lowered risk of CVD or all-cause mortality among those without baseline orthostatic hypotension (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76–0.86) similarly to those with baseline orthostatic hypotension (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–1.00; p = 0.68 for interaction of treatment with baseline orthostatic hypotension). More intensive BP treatment or active therapy lowered risk of CVD or all-cause mortality among those without baseline standing hypotension (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75–0.85), and nonsignificantly among those with baseline standing hypotension (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75–1.18). Effects did not differ by baseline standing hypotension (P = 0.16 for interaction of treatment with baseline standing hypotension).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this population of hypertension trial participants, intensive therapy reduced risk of CVD or all-cause mortality regardless of orthostatic hypotension without evidence for different effects among those with standing hypotension.

Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic intolerance — Orthostatic intolerance is a general term referring to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing (usually with a change in position from sitting or lying to an upright position) and are relieved by sitting or lying. Most commonly, the symptoms include lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. These symptoms may be accompanied by hemodynamic disturbances, including blood pressure decrease, which may or may not meet criteria for OH, and heart rate increase, which may be inadequate or compensatory. One condition of note is Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm. Although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^116i4f1V]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular interventions

Strong recommendation. Management of orthostatic hypotension should be included as a component of a multidomain intervention (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: 1A.

Strong recommendation. Interventions for cardiovascular disorders identified during assessment for risk of falls should be the same as that for similar conditions when associated with syncope, in addition to other interventions based on the multifactorial falls risk assessment. GRADE 1B.

Recommendation details and justification

Whereas many multidomain fall prevention programmes have included strategies to treat orthostatic hypotension, including modification of possible culprit medications, rehydration, compression garments and medications (e.g. fludrocortisone and midodrine), there are no single intervention studies for orthostatic hypotension in falls prevention. In older adults with hypertension, symptoms may be ameliorated by the judicious use of antihypertensive medications titrated very slowly and with careful monitoring after changing the dose.
For the management of syncope, we advise following local syncope guidelines (e.g. European Cardiac Society Task force on Syncope). Many multifactorial fall prevention programmes that have shown benefit for fall prevention have included strategies to modify orthostatic blood pressure.
The presence of more than one cardiovascular risk factor for falls is not uncommon. Clear causality for a single risk factor may be difficult to establish; therefore, all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors should be treated.
Interventions for bradycardic disorders (sinus node disease, atrioventricular conduction disorders, vasovagal syndrome and carotid sinus syndrome) and tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia) include modification of culprit medications, specific anti-arrhythmic medication and, in some cases, implantable devices (such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) and are as per local syncope guidelines.

### Pathophysiology… [^112JADnU]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology define orthostatic hypotension as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing up. 1 The AAS and AAN also provide a tilt-table definition. 1 This determination has limited usefulness for the approach outlined in this article and appears to have a high rate of false-positive results. 2, 3. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed in all age groups, but it occurs more frequently in the elderly, especially in persons who are sick and frail. 4, 5 It is associated with several diagnoses, conditions, and symptoms, including lightheadedness soon after standing, an increased rate of falls, and a history of myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack 6; it also may be predictive of ischemic stroke.
7.

A discussion of the pathophysiology of each reported cause of orthostatic hypotension is beyond the scope of this article, but a few comments are important. In general, all parts of the cardiovascular and nervous systems must work together. If there is inadequate intravascular volume, impairment of the autonomic nervous system, reduction of venous return, or inability of the heart to beat more rapidly or with greater power, orthostatic hypotension may result. If medication and non-neurogenic etiologies are ruled out, neurogenic causes should be considered, using the patient's history and physical examination to direct the evaluation. Many of the neurogenic etiologies of orthostatic hypotension are difficult to diagnose and treat, and neurologic consultation may be necessary.

Although it is not part of the formal definition of orthostatic hypotension, the absence of a significant increase in heart rate along with a significant postural decrease in blood pressure may suggest an autonomic cause. Treatment The first steps in treatment of orthostatic hypotension are diagnosis and management of the underlying cause. A patient with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension who has a disease with no complete or specific cure may benefit from nonpharmacologic interventions. Increasing salt and fluid intake often is an initial step, although it may be difficult to undertake in some patients, such as those with severe congestive heart failure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used to increase intravascular volume.

### Efficacy of treatments for orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review [^1128JS1i]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Background

orthostatic hypotension (OH) affects up to 30% of adults over 65 and frequently contributes to falls and syncopal episodes. Current guidelines suggest a wide range of treatments, but systematic reviews of the evidence base for such recommendations are lacking.

Methods

we performed a systematic review to assess the evidence for all non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for OH. Our search included the following databases: MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; and the Cochrane library. We searched grey literature and references from included studies and other reviews. We included randomised, placebo-controlled trials, which measured postural drop as an outcome. Study quality was assessed using pre-specified measures of bias.

Results

overall, 36 trials (21 interventions) were included. We identified a heterogeneous population and a wide variety of study methods, precluding meta-analysis. Most trials were of poor quality with high risk of bias. Changes in postural drop and symptoms were frequently inconsistent. Compression bandages, indomethacin, oxilofrine, potassium chloride and yohimbine improved the postural drop. Several vasoactive drugs-including midodrine and pyridostigmine-improved the standing blood pressure, but overall worsened the postural drop.

Conclusions

many commonly recommended interventions for OH have a limited evidence base supporting their use. High quality, randomised, controlled trials are needed to underpin clinical practice for this condition.

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^113f9eks]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology and cardiovascular risks of orthostatic hypertension

The epidemiology of orthostatic hypertension and the data regarding the cardiovascular risk associated with orthostatic hypotension have been reviewed recently. Briefly, orthostatic hypertension defined as a sustained increase in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing was observed in 5–30% of participants in epidemiological surveys or clinical trials. Risk factors for orthostatic hypertension included age, adiposity, arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. An exaggerated orthostatic pressor response with office blood pressure in the normotensive range may precede arterial hypertension in younger people. Among people with arterial hypertension, individuals showing an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response are more likely to exhibit subclinical cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or cerebrovascular disease. Orthostatic hypertension was also associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The clinical significance of these findings is difficult to generalize because in the past, diagnostic criteria for orthostatic were not harmonized.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic syndromes — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

### Acceptability of non-drug therapies in older people with orthostatic hypotension: a qualitative study [^113Ymp6o]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) results from a sustained reduction in blood pressure (BP, ≥ 20 mmHg systolic or ≥ 10 mmHg diastolic) within 3 min of standing. It is highly prevalent in the older population, affecting up to 20% of community-dwelling older people. It is a disabling condition, resulting in reduced quality of life and an increased risk of cognitive impairment and death. Much of the evidence to support existing treatment options for OH is of poor quality and largely based on cohorts with autonomic failure, creating uncertainty for its management in older populations. Non-drug treatments are recommended as first line therapy and older people have a preference for these therapies over pharmacologic agents due to their existing medication burden. However, non-drug interventions are often more complex to deliver, have lower levels of adherence and the evidence for their use is scanty at best.

As the older population is rapidly expanding we can expect a growing demand for evidence in this area. However, if an intervention is deemed unacceptable, its effectiveness becomes irrelevant.
