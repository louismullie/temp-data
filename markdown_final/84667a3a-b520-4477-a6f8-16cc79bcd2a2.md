## Question

What is the role of captopril in renal artery stenosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of captopril in renal artery stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of renovascular hypertension and how ACE inhibition changes renal hemodynamics. Then, I should verify current guideline positions on ACE inhibitors in unilateral versus bilateral disease and solitary kidneys. Next, I will review safety and monitoring, dosing, and drug interactions. After that, I will examine the diagnostic role of captopril renography and its limitations, including comparisons with ARBs and with anatomic imaging. Finally, I will consider decision thresholds for revascularization and key clinical pearls for patient selection and follow-up [^115xsHGK].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis. Reduced perfusion from renal artery stenosis activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, with angiotensin II constricting efferent arterioles to preserve glomerular filtration; captopril, by blocking ACE, reverses that efferent tone, lowering blood pressure but potentially dropping intraglomerular pressure in a stenotic kidney, which is exactly why creatinine can rise when ACE inhibitors are started in significant RAS [^115xsHGK] [^114TpzFh].

> I need to ensure guideline-concordant therapeutic positioning. For unilateral RAS with hypertension, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended first-line; hold on, let me verify if this is explicitly endorsed in recent European vascular guidelines, which indeed recommend RAAS blockers as first-line in unilateral disease and also allow initiation in bilateral severe RAS or in a solitary functioning kidney, but only with close follow-up and absence of adverse effects, which underscores the need for vigilant monitoring rather than blanket avoidance [^113u6WRa] [^111qvRAE].

> Wait, I should double-check safety and monitoring specifics. Initiation requires baseline and early follow-up serum creatinine and potassium because ACE inhibitors can cause transient or progressive azotemia and hyperkalemia in RAS, with FDA labeling emphasizing creatinine and potassium checks during the first weeks after starting therapy, and enalapril data documenting BUN/creatinine rises in about 20% of patients with unilateral or bilateral RAS that are usually reversible after discontinuation or diuretic adjustment [^114TpzFh] [^111zC1CW].

> Let me review dosing and hemodynamic effects for captopril itself. Captopril lowers peripheral resistance with increased renal blood flow and typically no change in GFR overall, producing maximal BP effect 60 to 90 minutes post dose; dosing is generally 25 to 150 mg twice or three times daily, with a maximum daily dose of 450 mg if needed, recognizing that BP effects can be progressive over weeks and that higher total daily doses and preexisting renal disease raise the risk of proteinuria and renal function perturbations, which should prompt closer monitoring or dose adjustment [^111hggif] [^115s7Bbd] [^1151N67s].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic role of captopril renography. By removing angiotensin II–mediated efferent constriction, ACE inhibition can unmask functionally significant stenosis, producing characteristic asymmetry and delayed excretion; one study showed captopril renography positivity in 25 of 33 stenosed vessels, suggesting reasonable sensitivity, but hold on, I should not jump to conclusions because meta-analytic data indicate CTA and contrast-enhanced MRA generally outperform functional renography for anatomic diagnosis in suspected renovascular hypertension, so renography is best viewed as a functional adjunct rather than a stand-alone diagnostic arbiter [^116iTnhA] [^113CthUu].

> I will now examine comparisons with ARBs and dual blockade. Captopril appears superior to valsartan or losartan for provoking diagnostic changes on renography, which tracks with pharmacologic differences in RAAS interruption; therapeutically, ARBs may be better tolerated than ACE inhibitors in some patients, yet guidelines accept either ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line RAAS blockade for unilateral RAS, so medication choice should be individualized for cough or angioedema risk while preserving close renal monitoring [^116iTnhA] [^116Mnyuo] [^113u6WRa].

> Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interactions and dual RAAS blockade risks. The FDA advises avoiding combined use of RAAS inhibitors because dual blockade increases hypotension, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury without added clinical benefit for most patients, and it also warns about NSAIDs attenuating antihypertensive effects and precipitating renal dysfunction, so I need to check for concomitant aliskiren, potassium-sparing diuretics, and NSAIDs before or during captopril therapy [^112BFXy4].

> Now, regarding contraindications and cautions, I initially thought bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney were absolute contraindications to captopril. Wait, I should correct myself because guidelines actually allow cautious use in these settings with close monitoring, whereas true contraindications include prior ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema and coadministration with neprilysin inhibitors within 36 hours, and strong warnings exist to avoid aliskiren in diabetes or in renal impairment, with early and frequent monitoring recommended if ACE inhibitors are used in stenotic kidneys given the risk of creatinine rises [^111ovEzw] [^112BFXy4] [^111zC1CW].

> Next, I should review when to pursue revascularization rather than medical therapy alone. Contemporary hypertension and vascular guidelines suggest considering angioplasty and stenting for hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RAS, typically 70% to 99% stenosis or 50% to 69% with post-stenotic dilatation or a significant pressure gradient, but only in the presence of high-risk clinical features such as resistant hypertension despite maximal therapy, recurrent heart failure or flash pulmonary edema, progressive kidney dysfunction with a viable kidney, or bilateral disease or solitary kidney disease; randomized trials like ASTRAL/STAR and CORAL did not demonstrate clear composite outcome benefit of routine stenting over optimized medical therapy, highlighting the importance of careful selection based on risk features and kidney viability [^1147DVZn] [^111P3iAu] [^112oZ3or].

> But wait, what if I want physiologic evidence to refine selection. Older physiologic data suggest renin hypersecretion tends to occur when luminal narrowing is 80% or more, implying that lesser stenoses often lack RAAS activation and may not benefit from intervention, and stimulated renal venous renin lateralization ratios can help identify patients more likely to benefit from angioplasty, though I should confirm that these approaches are adjunctive and not stand-alone decision-makers in modern practice [^114qt9tt] [^115rKCG7].

> I should confirm limitations of captopril renography and potential confounders. Accuracy can be reduced in bilateral disease and renal impairment, and chronic RAAS blockade or other antihypertensives may interfere with test performance, while interobserver variability, particularly for cortical retention, can complicate interpretation; rare false positives can occur in renin-secreting conditions such as renal tumors, so results must be integrated with clinical and anatomic data rather than taken in isolation [^115fBDRo] [^116bSPBm] [^114EahZA].

> Let me reconsider practical management pearls to close the loop. Start RAAS blockade in unilateral RAS with hypertension, or cautiously in bilateral or solitary kidney stenosis if needed, check creatinine and potassium at baseline and within one to two weeks of initiation and after dose uptitration, and avoid dual RAAS blockade and NSAIDs where possible; for persistent resistant hypertension or cardiorenal syndromes with high-risk features despite optimized medical therapy, evaluate for hemodynamically significant lesions and kidney viability to consider revascularization, while aligning blood pressure targets with contemporary vascular guidance and reassessing for adverse renal trends after ACE inhibitor initiation [^113u6WRa] [^114TpzFh] [^114ZXQyV].

Captopril is effective for blood pressure control in unilateral renal artery stenosis [^113u6WRa], but in bilateral disease or a solitary kidney, it can cause **acute renal failure and hyperkalemia** due to loss of efferent arteriolar tone [^114TpzFh] [^111zC1CW]. Use captopril cautiously in bilateral stenosis or a solitary kidney [^111qvRAE], with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes; **discontinue if creatinine rises > 30%** or hyperkalemia develops. Captopril is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to ACE inhibitors [^111ovEzw], and dual RAS blockade should be avoided [^112BFXy4]. Revascularization is reserved for resistant hypertension, progressive renal dysfunction, or recurrent flash pulmonary edema despite optimal medical therapy [^1147DVZn].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for captopril use in RAS

ACE inhibition by captopril **reduces angiotensin II and aldosterone**, thereby lowering systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure [^111hggif]. In unilateral RAS, it lowers blood pressure and may improve renal perfusion in the unaffected kidney [^115xsHGK]. In bilateral RAS or a solitary kidney, captopril reduces efferent arteriolar tone, decreases GFR, and can precipitate **acute renal failure** [^111Add98].

---

## Clinical benefits of captopril in RAS

Key clinical benefits in RAS include **blood pressure control** — effective in unilateral disease via reduced systemic vascular resistance [^111hggif] — and **renal protection**, which may slow progression of renal dysfunction in unilateral RAS by lowering intraglomerular pressure and proteinuria [^115xsHGK].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of captopril in RAS

- **Acute renal failure**: In bilateral RAS or a solitary kidney, captopril can cause acute renal failure by reducing efferent arteriolar tone and GFR [^114TpzFh].

- **Hyperkalemia**: Reduced aldosterone can cause hyperkalemia, especially in bilateral RAS or a solitary kidney [^113CnKZv].

- **Hypotension**: Excessive hypotension may occur, particularly in volume-depleted patients [^1151N67s].

- **Proteinuria**: Proteinuria may occur, especially at higher doses or with pre-existing renal disease [^1151N67s].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Unilateral RAS**: ACE inhibitors, including captopril, are first-line therapy for unilateral RAS with hypertension [^113u6WRa].

- **Bilateral RAS or solitary kidney**: ACE inhibitors may be considered with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^111qvRAE].

- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to ACE inhibitors, history of angioedema [^111ovEzw], or dual RAS blockade.

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Measure serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium before starting captopril [^111zC1CW].

- **Initial monitoring**: Recheck renal function and electrolytes within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose escalation.

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function and electrolytes during therapy [^113CnKZv].

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or discontinue if creatinine rises > 30% from baseline or if hyperkalemia develops.

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

Alternative options include angiotensin receptor blockers when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated; calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics as first-line adjuncts for blood pressure control in RAS [^113u6WRa]; and **revascularization** for resistant hypertension, progressive renal dysfunction, or recurrent flash pulmonary edema despite optimal medical therapy [^1147DVZn] [^11723rCL].

## Summary of captopril use in RAS

| **Clinical scenario** | **Captopril use** | **Monitoring** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Unilateral RAS | First-line therapy [^113u6WRa] | Routine monitoring | Low risk [^115xsHGK] |
| Bilateral RAS or solitary kidney | Cautious use [^111qvRAE] | Close monitoring [^111zC1CW] | High risk [^111Add98] |
| Resistant hypertension or progressive renal dysfunction | Consider revascularization [^1147DVZn] | N/A | N/A |

---

Captopril is effective for unilateral RAS but **requires caution in bilateral disease or a solitary kidney** due to risks of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. Use is guided by clinical context, with close monitoring and consideration of alternatives or revascularization when indicated [^113u6WRa] [^1147DVZn].

### Captopril [^114TpzFh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Impaired renal function - **Hypertension**: Some patients with renal disease, particularly those with severe renal artery stenosis, have developed increases in BUN and serum creatinine after reduction of blood pressure with captopril. A captopril dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of diuretics may be required. For some of these patients, it may not be possible to normalize blood pressure and maintain adequate renal perfusion.

- **Heart failure**: About 20% of patients develop stable elevations of BUN and serum creatinine greater than 20% above normal or baseline upon long-term treatment with captopril. Less than 5% of patients, generally those with severe preexisting renal disease, required discontinuation of treatment due to progressively increasing creatinine. Subsequent improvement probably depends upon the severity of the underlying renal disease.

See clinical pharmacology, dosage and administration, adverse reactions: altered laboratory findings.

Hyperkalemia - **Elevations in serum potassium**: Elevations have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including captopril. Patients at risk for the development of hyperkalemia when treated with ACE inhibitors include those with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and those using concomitant potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes, or other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium. In a trial of type I diabetic patients with proteinuria, the incidence of withdrawal of treatment with captopril for hyperkalemia was 2% (4/207).

Regarding medical management for renal artery stenosis, particularly concerning antihypertensive therapy, ESVS 2025 guidelines recommend considering initiating ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with bilateral severe renal artery stenosis or with a renal artery stenosis in a single functioning kidney, provided the treatment is without side effects and includes regular follow-up of renal function and blood pressure (BP).

### Captopril [^112BFXy4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on captopril tablets and other agents that block the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with captopril tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with captopril tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including captopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving captopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including captopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for renal artery stenosis, particularly renal artery angioplasty, the ESC 2024 guidelines suggest considering renal artery angioplasty and stenting in patients with hemodynamically significant, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. This is defined as stenosis of 70–99%, or 50–69% with post-stenotic dilatation and/or a significant trans-stenotic pressure gradient, alongside the following conditions:

- **Recurrent heart failure (reHF), unstable angina, or sudden onset flash pulmonary edema**: Despite maximally tolerated medical therapy.

- **Resistant hypertension**.

- **Hypertension with unexplained unilaterally small kidney or chronic kidney disease (CKD)**.

- **Bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary viable kidney**.

Captopril tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product or any other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, such as a patient who has experienced angioedema during therapy with any other ACE inhibitor.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with captopril tablets in patients with diabetes (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Captopril tablets are contraindicated in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor, such as sacubitril. Do not administer captopril tablets within 36 hours of switching to or from sacubitril/valsartan, a neprilysin inhibitor (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

### Endovascular therapy of renal artery stenosis: Where do we stand today [^111p4iB1]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Angioplasty and stent therapy for stenoses of the renal artery have long been part of everyday life for interventional radiologists. However, newer studies challenge the clinical significance of these methods. A decisive advantage of endovascular techniques for the treatment of arterial hypertension, as opposed to therapy with modern antihypertensives, could not be proven in individual randomized studies, even though blood pressure control was observed to be facilitated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Renal function often did not show any sustainable improvement following the elimination of the renal artery stenosis. However, progression of kidney insufficiency could be slowed down. There is still no general justification from the existing data for the treatment of incidental stenoses. Many questions remain open regarding the technique.

- **Fibromuscular dysplasia**: This condition can generally be treated by balloon angioplasty.
- **Atherosclerotic stenoses**: A metallic endoprosthesis must often be used. The outstanding morphologic results of stent therapy in the short and medium-term course are often simply used to justify primary stent implantation in ostial stenoses.

### What is critical renal artery stenosis? Implications for treatment [^114qt9tt]. American Journal of Hypertension (2000). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease due to progressive atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in the elderly. At what degree of renal artery stenosis should intervention be recommended is not clear. To answer this question, unilateral or bilateral activation of the renin-angiotensin system or its absence was detected by captopril-stimulated renal vein renin measurements in 49 hypertensive patients, aged 63 years, with normal or near-normal renal function (serum creatinine concentration ≤ 2.0 mg/dL). This information was matched against radiographic measurements of the extent of renal artery stenosis.

With few exceptions, unilateral or bilateral hypersecretion of renin was associated with an 80% or greater reduction of renal artery lumen diameter. In contrast, normal secretion or suppression of renin production in a kidney contralateral to an ischemic one was associated with either a normal caliber renal artery or renal artery stenosis less than 80%.

These findings suggest that renal artery stenosis less than 80% should be monitored rather than treated, because improvement of renal function and amelioration of hypertension are not expected unless the renin-angiotensin system has been activated in the affected kidney. Renoprotection by early intervention is uncertain because the progression of renal artery stenosis is unpredictable. Normal captopril-stimulated renal vein renin measurements in hypertensive patients obviate the need for further work-up or interventional therapy of renovascular disease.

### Management of renovascular hypertension [^1125zXuX]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is a potentially reversible cause of hypertension, and transcatheter techniques are essential to its treatment. Angioplasty remains a first-line treatment for stenosis secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia. Renal artery stenting is commonly used in atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, although recent trials have cast doubts upon its efficacy. Renal denervation is a promising procedure for the treatment of resistant hypertension, and in the future, its indications may expand.

### ACE inhibition is superior to angiotensin receptor blockade for renography in renal artery stenosis [^116iTnhA]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can prevent the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin II on the efferent renal vessels, which is believed to play an important role in renovascular hypertension. This effect is considered essential for demonstrating renovascular hypertension using captopril renography.

In this study, renographic changes induced by captopril and the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan were compared in patients with a high probability of renovascular hypertension. Twenty-five patients with 33 stenosed renal arteries (grade of stenosis > 50%) and hypertension were studied. Captopril, valsartan, and baseline renography were performed within 48 hours using technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine. Blood pressure was monitored, plasma renin concentration before and after intervention was determined, and urinary flow was estimated from the urinary output of the hydrated patients.

Alterations in renographic curves after intervention were evaluated according to the Santa Fe consensus on ACE inhibitor renography. Captopril renography was positive, indicating renovascular hypertension, in 25 of the 33 stenosed vessels, whereas valsartan renography was positive in only ten. Blood pressure during captopril and valsartan renography was not different; the reduction in blood pressure was the same after valsartan and captopril. Plasma renin concentration was comparable for valsartan and captopril studies, showing suppressed values after intervention in as many as 12 of the 25 patients.

### Development of chronic heart failure in a young woman with hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis with preserved renal function [^112xgHzf]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old woman with presumed essential hypertension and symptoms equivalent to New York Heart Association class II was suspected of heart failure and referred to echocardiography. The patient's ECG showed a left bundle branch block. Electrolytes, serum creatinine, and estimated-glomerular filtration rate, as well as a urine test for protein, were all normal. The patient had no peripheral oedema. The transthoracic echocardiography confirmed systolic and diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25% and left ventricular hypertrophy. An ultrasound of renal arteries and renal CT angiography (renal CTA) revealed a significant stenosis and an aneurysm corresponding to the right renal artery, presenting challenges to traditional interventions.

Standard therapy included in the trials consisted of: ALOFT and ASPIRE–ACE inhibitor (or ARB) and β-blocker; ALTITUDE–ACE inhibitor or ARB; and ASTRONAUT–which included diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, β-blockers, and aldosterone-blocking agents, unless contraindicated.

- **Study selection**: The PubMed database was systematically searched for English language articles published from May 2008 to May 2013, reporting results of trials comparing dual blockers of the RAS with monotherapy. The search terms used were "angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor", "angiotensin receptor blocker", "cardiovascular disease", "chronic kidney disease", "diabetes", "direct renin inhibitor", "dual RAS blockade", "heart failure", and "myocardial infarction". Additionally, the reference lists of the articles retrieved through the electronic search were reviewed for other potentially eligible articles. This review was also supplemented with publications of landmark studies on single RAS inhibition that fell outside the initial search criteria.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: Epidemiology, cardiovascular outcomes, and clinical prediction rules [^1161priA]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common primary disease of the renal arteries, associated with two major clinical syndromes: ischemic renal disease and hypertension. The prevalence of this condition in the population is undefined due to the absence of a simple and reliable large-scale test. Renal artery involvement is frequent in patients with coronary heart disease and/or heart failure and may affect cardiovascular outcomes and survival in these individuals.

- **Justification for suspicion**: Suspecting renal arterial stenosis in patients with episodes of pulmonary edema is justified by observations that approximately one-third of elderly patients with heart failure exhibit atherosclerotic renal disease. Whether interventions aimed at restoring arterial patency may reduce the high mortality in heart failure patients remains unclear, as no prospective study has been conducted at the time of writing.

- **Cost containment and clinical prediction**: Increased awareness of cost containment has renewed interest in clinical cues for suspecting renovascular hypertension. The DRASTIC study significantly contributed by attempting to validate clinical prediction rules. In this study, a clinical rule was derived that predicted renal artery stenosis with a sensitivity of 65%, comparable to renal scintigraphy's 72%, and a specificity of 87% versus 92%. Systematic and quantitative testing demonstrated that clinical findings could detect renal artery stenosis as accurately as more complex tests.

### Diagnostic criteria for renovascular disease: Where are we now [^115esLhs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease, especially atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) in older subjects, is commonly encountered in clinical practice. This is at least in part due to major advances in non-invasive imaging techniques that allow greater diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy than ever before. Despite increased awareness of ARAS, renal revascularization is less commonly performed, likely as a result of several prospective, randomized clinical trials which fail to demonstrate major benefits of renal revascularization beyond medical therapy alone.

Primary care physicians are less likely to investigate renovascular disease, and nephrologists likely see more patients following a period of unsuccessful medical therapy with more advanced ARAS. The goal of this review is to revisit diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms to characterize more clearly which patients will likely benefit from further evaluation and intensive treatment of renal artery stenosis.

### Can exercise renography be an alternative to ACE inhibitor renography in hypertensive patients who are suspicious for renal artery stenosis [^1111ASx3]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of Tc-99m ethylenedicysteine exercise renography in patients with hypertension who were suspicious for renal artery stenosis and compare the results with captopril renography.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine patients with hypertension who were highly suspect for having renal artery stenosis were included in the study. Basal captopril exercise renograms were performed within one week in all patients with Tc-99m EC. Exercise was performed with a bicycle ergometer as described in the literature. Interpretations of renograms were made according to the consensus report on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor renography as high, low, or intermediate probability. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were also obtained on both the kidneys and a patient basis. The results were compared with renal angiography in 19 patients.

- **Results**: Twenty of 29 patients had concordant results with both captopril and exercise studies. All discordant tests were normal with captopril but positive with exercise renograms. Nineteen patients with 38 kidneys were included for statistical data analysis. Nine kidneys, which were either atrophic or abnormal during the basal study, were excluded from the kidney-based analysis. With contrast angiography, 8 patients had renal artery stenosis. When evaluated on a kidney basis, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for captopril scans were 87%, 100%, 100%, and 95%, and for the exercise scans were 100%, 90%, 80%, and 100% respectively.

### Losartan renography for the detection of renal artery stenosis: comparison with captopril renography and evaluation of dose and timing [^116Mnyuo]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

Radionuclide renography with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition plays an important role in the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. Angiotensin receptor antagonists inhibit the renin angiotensin system at different levels from ACE inhibitors by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors. The AT1 angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan has recently been used clinically in the treatment of hypertension. However, the available data on the use of losartan with renography for the detection of renovascular hypertension are limited and contradictory. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the effectiveness of losartan renography and captopril scintigraphy in revealing renal artery stenosis.

- **Methods**: A total of 61 renal units in 32 patients with hypertension were studied in two groups based on the losartan dosage (50 mg in group A and 100 mg in group B). Group A consisted of 17 patients, in whom 19 renal units had angiographically proven renal artery stenosis (≥ 50%). In group B, there were 15 patients, in whom 20 renal arteries were stenotic. All of the patients underwent three renographies (baseline, captopril renography, and early losartan renography). Early losartan renography was performed at 1 hour after oral losartan administration in both groups. In group B, seven patients underwent additional losartan renography (late losartan), performed 3 hours after oral losartan administration; these patients composed group B1.

- **Results**: The sensitivities of captopril and losartan studies were 63.2% and…

### Renal artery stenosis: Pathophysiology and treatment [^115xsHGK]. Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy (2009). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on renal artery stenosis:

- **Definition**: Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or both renal arteries, leading to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.

- **Pathophysiology**: The most common causes of renal artery stenosis are atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), accounting for approximately 90% and 10% of renal artery stenosis cases, respectively. Renal artery stenosis decreases renal perfusion, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which leads to renovascular hypertension. This condition may cause ischemic nephropathy, resulting in progressive renal dysfunction.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in the general population is estimated at 5–10%, and as high as 25% in elderly patients with hypertension.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for renal atherosclerosis include older age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and a family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Risk factors for FMD include female sex, tobacco use, and a family history of FMD.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, renal artery stenosis can present with refractory hypertension, impaired renal function, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure (HF). Physical examination may reveal an abdominal bruit.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of renal artery stenosis can be severe if left untreated, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients undergoing revascularization for hypertension related to atherosclerotic stenosis should continue pharmacotherapy after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events. Restenosis occurs in 10–25% of cases.

### The utility of renal venous renin studies in selection of patients with renal artery stenosis for angioplasty: a retrospective study [^115rKCG7]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Recent studies of renal artery stenosis (RAS) have failed to demonstrate a greater benefit from angioplasty in terms of blood pressure (BP) lowering compared to medical treatment. It is essential to identify patients with haemodynamically significant RAS to determine who would benefit from angioplasty.

We examined whether performing renal venous renin studies under stringent conditions might predict BP improvement. Patients with at least 60% RAS who underwent renal venous renin measurements between 2008 and 2013 were identified. Renal venous renin lateralization ratios (RVRRs) were calculated by dividing venous renin from the stenotic kidney by contralateral levels before and after stimulation with enalaprilat or captopril. Benefit was defined as achieving a BP less than 140/90 mmHg without medication, a 10% decrease in mean BP without an increase in daily defined doses (DDDs), or a decreased DDD without a significant increase in mean BP.

In this study, 28 patients received medical treatment, and 42 underwent angioplasty (median age 60.1 years, 41% male, 29% with chronic kidney disease, and 50% with resistant hypertension). At 11.4 ± 3.3 months, 69% of patients treated with angioplasty experienced BP benefit compared to 25% of those with medical treatment (P < 0.001). Logistic regression identified resistant hypertension [odds ratio (OR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.04–0.82, P = 0.03] and baseline DDD (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.98, P = 0.04) as negatively associated with benefit, and a positive stimulated RVRR (OR 21.6, 95% CI 3.50–133.3, P = 0.001) as positively associated with benefit from angioplasty.

### Renal arterial intervention and angiotensin blockade in atherosclerotic nephropathy [^117C9Vmt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal arterial disease (ARAD) is becoming a more important cause of end-stage renal failure. Diagnosis is more easily achieved because of greater clinical suspicion and more refined screening tools. However, the medical and interventional management of patients with ARAD is not well defined in the literature because there have been few randomized trials. Because the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and more recently angiotensin-antagonists, has become much more widespread, it is inevitable that we should, knowingly or not, give these drugs to patients with ARAD.

We describe two case studies in which the angiotensin-antagonist irbesartan was given to two patients with effectively single-functional kidneys after successful renal arterial radiologic intervention. The rationale for the use of irbesartan was to control blood pressure (BP), which had not responded to the initial arterial intervention, in patients both refractory to and intolerant of many other antihypertensive drugs. Irbesartan successfully and safely reduced systemic BP, as measured by ambulatory BP, without prejudicing renal function, measured by individual kidney function GFR.

### Renal artery stenosis: A cardiovascular perspective [^111frmTH]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is an important clinical entity that can lead to uncontrolled hypertension and progressive renal failure. The most common causes of RAS are atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia. Because the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension is established only when revascularization of a stenosed renal artery results in cure or improvement in patients' hypertension, establishing a causal relationship between RAS and hypertension continues to present a challenge. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is essential in the diagnosis of this condition.

- **Methods**: Multiple tests, both invasive and noninvasive, are available as screening methods. Angiography remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of RAS. Besides its value in establishing the diagnosis, it provides anatomic information regarding the site and severity of stenoses and appropriate revascularization strategies. Magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasonography are the most promising and accurate noninvasive screening tests available, even in the presence of renal insufficiency. With advances in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty techniques, including renal artery stenting, many more patients are eligible for less invasive and effective revascularization strategies compared with traditional surgical procedures.

- **Results**: Revascularization of a stenosed renal artery is associated with the preservation of renal function and better control of hypertension, unstable angina, and congestive heart failure. Because atherosclerotic RAS is associated with generalized atherosclerosis, its management is crucial in improving patient outcomes.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^111P3iAu]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

In the Renal Artery Stenosis in Coronary Artery Disease (RASCAD) trial, 84 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for ischaemic heart disease and who had renal artery stenosis > 50% but ≤ 80% were randomized to revascularization plus standard medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. After 1 year, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between groups, i.e. change in echocardiographic left ventricular mass index. The study had no inclusion criterion relevant to hypertension or other ARVD phenotypes, had slow enrolment rates, and a final population that was half of that planned.

The multicenter Cardiovascular Outcomes with Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) study originally aimed to enroll 947 patients with ARVD and either uncontrolled systolic hypertension while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs, or CKD and RAS > 80% but ≤ 60% but 20 mmHg. The primary endpoint was a composite of death from CV or renal causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for CHF, progressive renal insufficiency, or the need for renal replacement therapy. The CORAL study replicated the findings of the STAR and ASTRAL trials and also showed no additional benefit in the composite primary endpoint when compared with medical therapy alone. However, several methodological issues appeared. Similar to the other clinical trials, patients with a presentation suggestive of critical RAS (flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function after ACEI/ARB use) were.

### A case report of successfully treated nephrotic syndrome after renal angioplasty [^113sWL33]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The standard treatment of renovascular hypertension accompanying renal artery stenosis (RAS) consists of angioplasty and administration of antihypertensive medication. Although nephrotic syndrome (NS) has been reported to be associated with RAS, the development of NS after revascularization of RAS is extremely rare.

- **Case presentation**: A 48-year-old man presented with uncontrolled hypertension and azotemia. The right kidney was atrophic, and RAS of the left kidney was suspected based on a post-captopril DTPA scan. His blood pressure stabilized after renal angioplasty; however, he complained of edema after 1 week. NS developed and was diagnosed as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) based on renal biopsy. He received an angiotensin receptor blocker, and proteinuria resolved after 1 year.

- **Conclusions**: FSGS rarely develops after angioplasty of renal artery stenosis. This is the first report of successful treatment of this condition using an angiotensin receptor blocker during 1-year follow-up.

### Cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease-induced resistant hypertension: Further considerations for 24-hour blood pressure profiles [^112qMyRs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The figure shows the suspected mechanisms of BP elevation in renal artery stenosis and recommendations for the management of renovascular hypertension. Renal hypoperfusion due to renal artery stenosis induces excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing both sympathetic nervous system activation and fluid retention, which may lead to elevated BP levels at bedtime and/or an abnormal nocturnal BP dipping pattern.

- **Mechanisms and management of renovascular hypertension**:
	- Renal artery stenosis leads to renal hypoperfusion, which induces excessive activation of the RAAS and the sympathetic nervous systems, as well as fluid retention caused by the decrease in pressure natriuresis. These abnormalities cause elevation of BP levels and flash pulmonary edema. Based on the mechanisms of renovascular hypertension, we speculated that an increase in nighttime BP levels and abnormal nocturnal BP dipping may occur in patients with resistant hypertension due to renovascular disease. Nighttime BP is an important target to prevent CVD events, especially in resistant hypertension.

In the management of renovascular hypertension, interventional renal angioplasty, including PTRA, should be considered in patients with poor BP control despite the adequate use of multiple antihypertensive medications. *Contraindicated in bilateral stenosis and taking care of renal dysfunction. ACEI indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; ARB, angiotensin receptor antagonist; BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; CHF, congestive heart failure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CVD.

### Renal artery stenting in consecutive high-risk patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A prospective 2-center cohort study [^113peEe4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Renography was performed with 99m technetium‐mercapto‐acetyl‐triglycine or 99m technetium‐diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Captopril renography was carried out 60 minutes after 25 mg of captopril had been administered orally. Baseline renography was conducted after the patients had discontinued treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin‐receptor blocker (ARB) for 5 to 10 days, according to local guidelines. Renograms were classified according to the consensus report on ACEi renography as either low or intermediate/high probability for renovascular hypertension. Intermediate/high probability was classified as follows: relative function of one kidney ≤ 30% or increased excretion time ≥ 11 minutes (≥ grade 2 renogram) with no change between baseline and captopril renography, or an improvement in split kidney function of ≥ 5% or a decrease in time to peak activity of at least 5 minutes (change ≥ 1 renogram grades) on the affected side on baseline renography compared to captopril renography.

- **Description of stenoses**: All noninvasive imaging and invasive angiographic findings were evaluated and described independently by two experienced radiologists. Stenoses were classified as < 70%, 70% to 79%, 80% to 89%, ≥ 90%, or occlusion.

- **Renal artery stenting**: PTRA with stent placement was performed via retrograde femoral or brachial approach using different sheaths, guidewires, and balloon‐expandable stents according to local team policy.

### Ischemic nephropathy: Where are we now [^115QW5M5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Identification and reversing the loss of kidney function beyond occlusive disease of the renal arteries poses a major clinical challenge. Recent studies indicate that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis develops as a function of age and is commonly associated with other microvascular diseases, including nephrosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy. The risks of renal artery stenosis are related both to declining kidney function and to accelerated cardiovascular disease, with increased morbidity and mortality. Newer drugs, including agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, have improved the level of blood pressure (BP) control for renovascular hypertension. Progressive renovascular disease during medical therapy can produce refractory hypertension, congestive heart failure, and renal failure with tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

Recent studies indicate a complex interplay of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of fibrogenic cytokines as a result of experimental atherosclerosis and renal hypoperfusion. Advances in imaging and interventional devices offer major new opportunities to prevent progressive loss of kidney function. Recent series indicate that although 25 to 30% of patients with impaired renal function can recover glomerular filtration after revascularization, many have no apparent change in kidney function and 19 to 25% experience a significant loss of kidney function, in some cases as a result of atheroemboli.

To select patients who are most likely to benefit from vascular intervention, clinicians should understand the pathophysiology of developing ischemic nephropathy.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^114inwQB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

An objective reader should note that recent RCTs attempted to properly examine whether revascularization of the renal artery is superior to medical treatment alone in ARVD. The investigators of more recent trials tried to avoid the limitations of early RCTs. This is exemplified in the original design of the CORAL trial, which included a large population, a clinically relevant cardiorenal primary endpoint, and required both resistant hypertension and angiographically documented severe RAS. However, the complexity of the disease under study led to very slow recruitment and protocol amendments that introduced bias.

Overall, a set of major limitations are common for these RCTs. All of them had non-standardized inclusion criteria, resulting in enrollment of large numbers of patients with mild/asymptomatic RAS, mild hypertension, or advanced CKD with small kidneys — individuals with almost certain absence of benefit from RAS revascularization. The presence of systematic biases in radiological assessment of RAS and poor laboratory proof of critical RAS is also highly possible. There was large variability not only between but also within study protocols in imaging techniques used for RAS diagnosis and evaluation, often resulting in overestimation of the degree of stenosis. Additional methodological limitations include a large number of patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria that were not randomized based on investigators' judgment without specific justification.

### Diagnostic tests for renal artery stenosis in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension: a meta-analysis [^113CthUu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To summarize and compare the validity of computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasonography, captopril renal scintigraphy, and the captopril test for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension, we conducted this meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: For each diagnostic modality, published studies were identified via MEDLINE literature searches.

- **Study selection**: Original studies were selected based on the following criteria: 1) suspicion of renovascular hypertension was the indication for the test; 2) intra-arterial x-ray angiography was used as the gold standard; 3) a cutoff point for a positive test result was explicitly defined; and 4) absolute numbers of true-positive, false-negative, true-negative, and false-positive results were available or could be derived from the presented data.

- **Data extraction**: A standard form was used for extracting relevant data.

- **Data synthesis**: Data on the accuracy of the different diagnostic methods were analyzed and compared by constructing summary receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and by computing areas under the summary ROC curves.

- **Results**: Although accuracy varied greatly among all diagnostic modalities, summary ROC curves indicated that computed tomography angiography and gadolinium-enhanced, three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography performed significantly better than the other diagnostic tests.

- **Conclusions**: Computed tomography angiography and gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography seem to be preferred in patients referred for evaluation of renal artery stenosis.

### Enalaprilat [^111zC1CW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with all vasodilators, enalapril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle, such as those with aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- **Impaired renal function**: Due to the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may occur in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on this system's activity, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril or enalaprilat, may lead to oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely, acute renal failure and/or death.

In clinical studies involving hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 20 percent of patients receiving enalapril. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril or enalaprilat and/or diuretic therapy. It is recommended that renal function be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy in such patients.

Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have experienced minor and transient increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, particularly when enalaprilat is administered concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of enalaprilat and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be necessary.

### Plasma renin activity revealed renal artery stenosis concealed by aneurysms [^11561V7w]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

We describe a case of renovascular hypertension with renal artery stenosis concealed by aneurysms. Arteriography demonstrated no apparent renal artery stenosis but revealed aneurysms on the left renal artery. Captopril-loaded renoscintigraphy could not detect disturbed renal perfusion. High basal and exaggerated plasma renin activity after captopril administration were the only clues indicating renovascular hypertension. A reduction of the systemic blood pressure and normalized plasma renin activity after resection of the aneurysms confirmed preoperative renovascular hypertension. Fibromuscular dysplasia was an underlying cause of the arterial deformity. In cases of hypertension accompanied by renal artery aneurysms, the captopril-challenge test can be a useful tool to detect renal artery stenosis concealed by the aneurysms.

Regarding medical management for renal artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to antihypertensive therapy, ESVS 2025 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacological treatment for hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis who have a blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140/90 mmHg. The target BP levels should be < 130/80 mmHg for patients aged < 65 years, < 140/80 mmHg for patients aged 65–79 years, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140–150 mmHg for patients aged ≥ 80 years, provided these levels are achieved without side effects.

### Unilateral renal artery stenosis presented with hyponatremic-hypertensive syndrome - case report and literature review [^117FW5Mi]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for renal artery stenosis-associated hyponatremic-hypertensive syndrome (HHS) lies in the restoration of intravascular volume, prevention of acute insult of hypertensive crisis, and correction of underlying renal arterial stenosis. Volume depletion needs to be corrected first to improve systemic blood flow and prevent further injury resulting from renal ischemia. After volume repletion, the prompt decline of blood pressure can be achieved by intravenous calcium channel blockers, which have been suggested as the first-line drug for severe hypertension with acute kidney injury.

For cases with HHS, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should be introduced to mitigate the over-activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. However, the use of diuretics is not recommended due to the potential deleterious effects of fluid and sodium wasting, which could further activate the RAA system. Lastly, correction of renal artery stenosis can be achieved surgically by percutaneous renal angioplasty, renal artery reconstruction, or nephrectomy.

All patients received antihypertensive agents as the first-line therapy. Eleven and three cases underwent angioplasty and unilateral nephrectomy, respectively. It is important to note that HHS caused by renal artery stenosis requires careful management to avoid complications.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^1152pM9Y]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Owing to the cardiovascular (CV) and renal protective effects of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, dual RAS blockade is currently under investigation, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combinations, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) combinations. However, studies of double RAS blockade in high-risk patients have provided mixed results, and evidence does not support this therapeutic approach.

Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing an ARB may be preferred over those containing ACE inhibitors. ARBs have superior tolerability over ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, leading to adverse effects such as dry cough and angioedema. Several studies have shown that treatment with ARBs is associated with significantly lower rates of cough and angioedema compared to ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, ARBs, in particular telmisartan, are well tolerated in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Due to their superior tolerability, ARBs may be associated with a higher rate of adherence than ACE inhibitors. In a large cohort of patients in Italy, the rate of discontinuation of the initial single antihypertensive drug treatment was lower for ARBs compared with ACE inhibitors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–0.94).

In addition to increasing the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of thiazides and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), adding a RAS inhibitor may help to attenuate the unfavorable metabolic side effects of thiazide monotherapy and CCB-induced peripheral edema. CCB-induced peripheral edema, which is most likely to occur with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, is caused by increased capillary pressure and flow.

### Captopril [^115s7Bbd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If further blood pressure reduction is required, the dose of captopril tablets may be increased to 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., and then, if necessary, to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., while continuing the diuretic. The usual dose range is 25 to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg captopril tablets should not be exceeded.

For patients with severe hypertension, such as accelerated or malignant hypertension, when temporary discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy is not practical or desirable, or when prompt titration to more normotensive blood pressure levels is indicated, diuretic therapy should be continued, but other antihypertensive medication stopped. Captopril tablets dosage should be promptly initiated at 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., under close medical supervision.

When necessitated by the patient's clinical condition, the daily dose of captopril tablets may be increased every 24 hours or less under continuous medical supervision until a satisfactory blood pressure response is obtained, or the maximum dose of captopril tablets is reached. In this regimen, the addition of a more potent diuretic, such as furosemide, may also be indicated.

Beta-blockers may also be used in conjunction with captopril tablets therapy; however, the effects of the two drugs are less than additive (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

### Captopril [^111hggif]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Administration of captopril tablets results in a reduction of peripheral arterial resistance in hypertensive patients, with either no change or an increase in cardiac output. There is an increase in renal blood flow following administration of captopril tablets, and glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged.

Reductions in blood pressure are usually maximal 60 to 90 minutes after oral administration of an individual dose of captopril tablets. The duration of effect is dose-related. The reduction in blood pressure may be progressive, so to achieve maximal therapeutic effects, several weeks of therapy may be required. The blood pressure-lowering effects of captopril and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In contrast, captopril and beta-blockers have a less than additive effect.

Blood pressure is lowered to about the same extent in both standing and supine positions. Orthostatic effects and tachycardia are infrequent but may occur in volume-depleted patients. Abrupt withdrawal of captopril tablets has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.

In patients with heart failure, significantly decreased peripheral (systemic vascular) resistance and blood pressure (afterload), reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and pulmonary vascular resistance, increased cardiac output, and increased exercise tolerance time (ETT) have been demonstrated. These hemodynamic and clinical effects occur after the first dose and appear to persist for the duration of therapy. Placebo-controlled studies of 12 weeks duration in patients who did not truncate the findings indicate sustained benefits.

### Usefulness of captopril renography to predict the benefits of renal artery revascularization or captopril treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy [^117NPUJv]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2002). Low credibility.

This retrospective study aimed to use captopril renography (CR) for predicting the benefits of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. CR was utilized in 60 hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy to detect the probability of renovascular hypertension (RVH) and to predict the benefits of renal artery revascularization or captopril treatment. Ten of the 60 patients showed a high probability of RVH with marked changes in the renogram curve after an oral intake of 50 mg captopril compared to baseline findings. All of these 10 patients confirmed significant main renal artery stenosis, bilaterally in four patients and unilaterally in the remaining six patients, as determined by renal angiographic findings. After successful revascularization, blood pressure was well controlled and renal function was preserved in all 10 patients.

The other 50 patients showed a low or intermediate probability of RVH with normal or unchanged findings on CR after 50 mg captopril. Captopril alone or in combination treatment was then started and continued for these 50 patients. After monitoring for at least 6 months, blood pressure was well controlled and renal function was preserved in all 50 patients on captopril treatment. We conclude that CR should be considered as the standard diagnostic criterion for RVH and may be helpful in predicting the beneficial impact of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy.

### Reliability of captopril renography in patients under chronic therapy with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists [^115fBDRo]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Captopril renography is a reliable and widely used test for the functional diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. Well-recognized drawbacks of the procedure include reduced accuracy in patients with bilateral disease or renal impairment, as well as possible interference from concurrent antihypertensive medications such as diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. Currently, no data exist regarding the reliability of captopril renography in patients with renovascular hypertension who are evaluated while under chronic treatment with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists (Sartans). Moreover, the renographic response of the kidney with renal artery stenosis to prolonged therapy with angiotensin II receptor antagonists has not yet been evaluated.

- **Methods**: We investigated the diagnostic effectiveness of (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine captopril renography performed after the acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to the daily dose of AT1 receptor antagonist in 13 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis and subsequent evidence of renovascular hypertension, based on short-term (3-month) blood pressure outcomes after revascularization. The renographic evaluation was first performed after ingestion of the daily therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonist alone (Sartan renography) and was repeated within 7 days after the acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to chronic treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonist (captopril-Sartan renography).

	- Hyponatremia: Particularly in patients receiving a low sodium diet or concomitant diuretics.

	- BUN/serum creatinine: Transient elevations of BUN or serum creatinine, especially in volume or salt depleted patients or those with renovascular hypertension, may occur. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine.

- **Hematologic**: A positive ANA has been reported.

- **Liver function tests**: Elevations of liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have occurred.

### Renal artery stenting in consecutive high-risk patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A prospective 2-center cohort study [^116FU1DM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In up to 12% of patients with kidney failure, the attributable cause may be progressive ischemic nephropathy caused by atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Our study included data on kidney function from 24 months before renal artery stenting, and our observations suggest that revascularization may change the natural course of ischemic kidney injury in patients with severe renal artery stenosis.

Thus, in 85% of successfully treated patients with rapidly declining kidney function at baseline, the estimated GFR was unchanged or had improved at last follow-up compared with baseline. Furthermore, captopril renography 24 months after renal artery stenting showed a significant improvement of the kidney function on the treated side. Finally, we observed a significant decrease in albuminuria after renal artery stenting.

Taken together, our observations suggest that renal artery stenting can stabilize and even increase estimated GFR in patients with rapidly declining kidney function. This conclusion concurs with a recently published retrospective study of the effect of renal artery stenting in patients with rapidly deteriorating kidney function.

- **Baseline predictors**: Favorable response in kidney function after successful revascularization included severity of clinical presentation at baseline (increasing systolic BP, rapidly declining kidney function, and reHeart failure/sudden pulmonary edema) and angiographic stenosis ≥ 90%.
- **Unfavorable response**: A resistance index ≥ 0.8 was associated with an unfavorable response in estimated GFR after PTRA, which is in agreement with a previous study.

The standard treatment of renovascular hypertension accompanying renal artery stenosis (RAS) consists of angioplasty and administration of antihypertensive medication. Although nephrotic syndrome (NS) has been reported to be associated with RAS, the development of NS after revascularization of RAS is extremely rare.

The right kidney was atrophic, and RAS of the left kidney was suspected based on a post-captopril DTPA scan. His blood pressure stabilized after renal angioplasty; however, he complained of edema after one week. NS developed and was diagnosed as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) based on renal biopsy. He received an angiotensin receptor blocker, and proteinuria resolved after one year.

- **Conclusions**: FSGS rarely develops after angioplasty of renal artery stenosis. This is the first report of successful treatment of this condition using an angiotensin receptor blocker during a one-year follow-up.

### Positive captopril renography without renal artery stenosis but a renal cell carcinoma [^114EahZA]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A positive captopril renography indicates that a patient's hypertension is renin-dependent, most commonly caused by renal artery stenosis. The authors reported a case of positive captopril renography; however, CT demonstrated that the renal arteries were intact, but there was a large chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Renin-dependent hypertension was relieved soon after nephrectomy. It is an uncommon cause of positive captopril renography.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor initiation and dose uptitration in children with cardiovascular disease: A retrospective review of standard clinical practice and a prospective randomized clinical trial [^111AdP6b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

Renal function during captopril uptitration was assessed by measuring serum electrolyte levels at baseline and again during the uptitration process. In the rapid uptitration protocol, electrolytes were measured at an average of 3.4 ± 1.0 days after the initial captopril dose, while in the prolonged protocol, measurements occurred at an average of 5.1 ± 3.4 days post-initiation (P = 0.04). No statistically significant differences were noted in the percentage change from baseline to repeat measurements between the rapid and prolonged protocols. Variances related to renal function did not differ between groups.

- **ACEI use postdischarge**: Follow-up data were available for 26 of 46 study subjects discharged from the hospital and seen at our center between 4 and 12 weeks postdischarge. Data were unavailable for 20 subjects; 2 died postdischarge, 3 received a transplant during admission with ACEIs discontinued at transplantation, 1 was not followed by our center postdischarge, and 14 did not have follow-up visits within 12 weeks postdischarge.

For those with available data, the median duration from discharge to follow-up data collection was 7.6 (IQR: 5.1–9.6) weeks. At follow-up, 15 of 26 patients continued on captopril, 3 were switched to enalapril and 2 to other medications.

### Incidental atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients undergoing elective coronary angiography: Are these lesions significant [^114DWr4m]. American Journal of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiologists often identify atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) during cardiac angiography. The importance of such 'incidental' ARAS (iARAS) is not known. The present study sought to describe renal perfusion using non-captopril (baseline) nuclear renograms in patients with iARAS and to determine characteristics associated with a positive captopril renogram.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting for non-emergent coronary angiography between June 2001 and February 2006 were angiographically screened for iARAS. Those with > 50% stenosis of one or both renal arteries were referred to nephrology and underwent nuclear renography.

- **Results**: 131 patients had renograms. The mean age was 73.2 ± 8.1 years and the median eGFR was 51.2 (40.0, 66.6) ml/min/1.73 m². 51% had evidence of reduced perfusion to one kidney, of which 13% were discordant with the angiographic lesion. 9% had positive captopril renograms. Captopril renogram positivity was associated with severe unilateral stenosis (p = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: In cardiac patients diagnosed with iARAS, the presence of known anatomic lesions did not correlate with captopril renogram positivity. Uncertainty remains as to whether nuclear renography is a poor functional test in this population, or the lesions are not functionally significant. These results lead us to question both the significance of such lesions and the utility of conducting renograms in this population.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^11723rCL]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly in patients with renal artery stenosis, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering renal artery angioplasty and stenting in patients with hemodynamically significant, atherosclerotic, renal artery stenosis. This includes cases where stenosis is between 70–99%, or 50–69% with post-stenotic dilatation and/or a significant trans-stenotic pressure gradient in the following conditions:

- **Resistant hypertension**: Where high blood pressure cannot be controlled despite maximally tolerated medical therapy.

- **Renal and cardiac complications**: Cases involving recurrent heart failure, unstable angina, or sudden onset flash pulmonary edema.

- **Kidney-related conditions**: Hypertension with an unexplained unilaterally small kidney or chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Bilateral/unilateral renal artery stenosis**: In bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary viable kidney.

### Addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker to full-dose ACE-inhibition: Controversial or common sense [^111RTZP2]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) interfere with the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in different ways. Theoretically, one might expect beneficial effects when they are used in combination, as more complete suppression of the RAS can be achieved. However, can this additional effect still be seen in patients on full-dose ACE inhibition?

Several controlled trials demonstrated that combination therapy can have additional benefits in hypertensive patients, chronic heart failure patients, and both diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy patients. However, the clinical benefit was not always as pronounced as expected, and not every patient will benefit from dual blockade of the RAS. There is some evidence of a less pronounced effect of combination therapy when a full dose of the ACE inhibitor is given.

It is well known that ACE inhibitors cannot completely suppress the formation of angiotensin II, particularly when the RAS is activated. Indeed, clinical trials indicated that add-on therapy with an ARB was especially useful when the RAS remained activated despite full-dose ACE inhibitor treatment. In summary, the combination of a full-dose ACE inhibitor and an ARB can be a rational choice in selected patients.

### Bilateral renal artery revascularisation in heart failure [^112r3hLX]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis can complicate the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, as it is a conventional contraindication to the use of ACE inhibitors. We report a case in which bilateral renal artery revascularisation allowed the safe reintroduction of enalapril (and subsequently sacubitril valsartan) in a patient with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. There is a role for renal artery angioplasty in selected patients to allow optimal medical therapy for patients with heart failure due to impaired systolic function.

### Enalaprilat [^111Add98]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with all vasodilators, enalapril should be administered with caution to patients with aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle.

- **Impaired renal function**: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure, whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril or enalaprilat, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death.

- **Clinical studies**: In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 20 percent of patients receiving enalapril. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril or enalaprilat and/or diuretic therapy. Therefore, in such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.

Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when enalaprilat has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of enalaprilat and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be necessary.

Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include an assessment of renal function during therapy.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension: Pragmatism, pitfalls, and perspectives [^115q2btt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For many years and even decades, a diagnostic work-up to look for a secondary form of hypertension, particularly of renovascular origin, has been a central tenet in medicine. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is considered the most common cause of renovascular hypertension. However, advances in understanding the complex pathophysiology of this condition and the recently documented futility of renal revascularization bring into question whether atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis truly causes "renovascular hypertension".

From a clinical point of view, a clear distinction should be made between hypertension associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis do not have a form of hypertension that is remediable or improved by angioplasty; to expose them to the cost, inconvenience, and risk of a diagnostic work-up add up to little more than a wild goose chase. However, with very few exceptions, medical therapy with antihypertensives and statins remains the cornerstone for the management of patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension.

Regarding the medical management of renal artery stenosis, specifically in relation to antihypertensive therapy, the CHEP 2018 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy in patients with hypertension attributable to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. It is important to recognize that these patients do not benefit from renal angioplasty and stenting over optimal pharmacotherapy alone.

### Chronic total occlusion of renal artery in symptomatic young patient with resistant hypertension: Is a revascularization necessary or redundant [^115ZvBtg]? Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

In the screening diagnosis of RAS, Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) is of primary importance. The performance and interpretation of the result require a great deal of experience, and difficulties in the examination are encountered in overweight patients. It is worth remembering that DUS may overestimate the degree of stenosis in relation to the reference test, which is digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with pressure measurements. The latter is performed especially in situations of inconclusive noninvasive findings or when revascularization is being considered. The significance of stenosis is confirmed by a systolic pressure gradient of more than 20 mmHg or a ratio of pressure behind the lesion to pressure before the lesion of less than 0.9. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) also play an important role in the diagnosis.

The mere finding of RAS does not imply the need for treatment, especially endovascular one. The basis is the elimination of cardiovascular risk factors, and treatment with a statin and acetylsalicylic acid in an atherosclerotic cause. The occurrence of hypertension requires taking steps in accordance with the relevant guidelines, with ACEIs or ARBs as first-line pharmacotherapy, because they improve the prognosis in this group of patients, including mortality reduction. The exception is when the stenosis is bilateral or involves a single kidney, in which case these medications may lead to a significant reduction in glomerular filtration. Therapy with ACEIs and ARBs in this subgroup of patients can be used exceptionally.

### Renal artery stenosis: Pathophysiology and treatment [^114v7Yqh]. Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy (2009). High credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is a condition associated with several symptoms and complications. These include the presence of an epigastric or flank bruit, age over 65 years, increased serum erythropoietin (EPO), hypertensive crisis, and systolic renal bruit. Patients may also experience renal insufficiency, increased serum urea, and atherosclerotic disease. Other related conditions are heart failure (HF), renal artery obstruction, elevated blood hemoglobin, increased urine protein, and unilateral atrophic kidney.

Moreover, hypertension, systolic-diastolic renal bruit, pulmonary edema, systolic and diastolic abdominal bruit, and resistant hypertension are notable concerns. Coronary artery disease and polycythemia are also potential comorbidities of this disease.

### Is duplex scanning the best screening test for renal artery stenosis [^112AXS77]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Screening for renal artery stenosis is indicated in patients with suspected renovascular hypertension or ischemic nephropathy to identify those who could benefit from renal artery interventions. The critical requirements for a clinically useful screening test include safety, low cost, and a high sensitivity or low false-negative rate. Arteriography remains the "gold standard" for the anatomic diagnosis of renal artery disease, but it is unsuitable for screening because of its high cost and invasive nature.

Although renal duplex scanning is technically difficult, experienced laboratories have achieved sensitivities and specificities in the range of 93% to 98% for identifying stenoses in the main renal arteries. Renal duplex scanning also provides a method for assessing the renal parenchyma and predicting the clinical outcome of renal revascularization.

- **Limitations of renal duplex scanning**: The principal limitation is the failure to identify accessory renal arteries. The presence of one or more widely patent main renal arteries makes ischemic nephropathy unlikely, as this condition results from "total" renal ischemia. However, renovascular hypertension can be present with normal main renal arteries when there are isolated stenoses involving accessory renal arteries; therefore, further testing may be indicated in selected hypertensive patients with normal main renal arteries by duplex scanning.

Currently, duplex scanning in a qualified vascular laboratory is arguably the best screening test for renal artery stenosis.

### Segmental renal artery stenosis diagnosed with captopril renography in a child [^117Sz8u3]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

A 9-year-old girl with clinical suspicion of renovascular hypertension was referred for captopril renography. This diagnostic procedure revealed a segmental abnormality when the left kidney was analyzed as two separate cortical regions of interest. Subsequent angiography confirmed stenosis in the distal mid and lower pole branches of the left renal artery.

### Interobserver agreement on captopril renography for assessing renal vascular disease [^116bSPBm]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Captopril-stimulated renography is widely used to screen selected groups of hypertensive patients for renal vascular disease. Evaluation of the test is a complex task. Lack of interobserver agreement on the assessment and interpretation of renographic parameters may contribute to differences in sensitivity and specificity between studies.

- **Methods**: Three experienced nuclear medicine physicians evaluated 658 renograms of 503 hypertensive patients suspected of having renal vascular disease from a large Dutch multicenter study (the Dutch Renal Artery Stenosis Intervention Cooperative [DRASTIC] study). Interobserver agreement on several renographic parameters was assessed by the kappa statistic and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

- **Results**: The interobserver agreement on the time to excretion was high: The pooled ICC was 0.90. The pooled kappa was ≥ 0.65 for the pattern of the time-activity curves, the visual aspect of the scintigraphic images (visible uptake and kidney size), and the judgment on the presence of renal artery stenosis. However, the interobserver agreement on cortical retention and pelvic retention by visual inspection of the images was rather low (pooled kappa = 0.46 and 0.52, respectively). Pelvic retention was found to complicate the interpretation of renography.

- **Conclusion**: Interobserver agreement on most of the renographic parameters was satisfactory, but the assessment of cortical retention was more difficult, particularly in the presence of pelvic retention. Captopril renography should be interpreted with caution if pelvic retention is present.

### Clinical problems in renovascular disease and the role of nuclear medicine [^115M3nnx]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although renovascular disease remains defined as a stenosis of the main renal artery or its proximal branches (renal artery stenosis [RAS]), its clinical overview has changed dramatically over the last 15–20 years, and its management is more controversial than ever before. The clinical problems, including diagnosis, treatment, and the relative contribution of different pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the progression of kidney disease, have shifted significantly.

This presentation aims to emphasize the paradigm shift from a past focus on renovascular hypertension (RVH) to a context of preserving or recovering threatened renal function in patients with progressive atherosclerotic renovascular disease until it reaches the last stage of irreversible "ischemic nephropathy". Previously, RVH, a very rare disease, dominated the foreground, where activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was believed to play the major, if not only, role in RVH issues. Retrospective RVH diagnosis was established either by improvement or, more rarely, by the cure of hypertension after revascularization, most often achieved through percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with or without stent placement.

At that time, captopril radionuclide renography was an efficient diagnostic tool because it was a functional (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition), noninvasive test aiming to demonstrate both RAAS activation and the lateralization (or asymmetry) of renin secretion by the kidney affected by a "hemodynamically significant" RAS.

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^114gG5Qa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

- **Renovascular hypertension**: Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is an important cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for 1% to 5% of all hypertension cases and 5.4% in young adults. It is generally due to renal artery stenosis (RAS), typically from atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in a 9:1 ratio. Both pathological processes lead to reduced renal perfusion and consequent altered flow dynamics at the distal tubular macula densa and the proximal tubule stretch receptors, resulting in renin release from juxtaglomerular cells.

Atherosclerotic RAS typically affects older patients with atherosclerotic disease at other sites. The treatment of choice is angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or ACE inhibitors to inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway, complemented by statin therapy aimed at reducing the atherosclerotic burden, in addition to modification of vascular risk factors (e.g. smoking cessation, diet and lifestyle changes, and control of diabetes). Angioplasty and stenting of stenosed arteries offer limited benefit, with recurrence rates of stenosis in previously treated lesions ranging from 10% to 50%.

Renal FMD is classified into focal or multifocal based on imaging appearance. Focal renal FMD tends to present in patients younger than 30 years with more severe hypertension. These cases may have familial traits, occasionally with Mendelian pattern inheritance, and specific genetic mutations have been described in a minority of cases. Multifocal renal FMD tends to occur later in life and is more prevalent in women. Concomitant involvement of other arterial vascular beds may occur, and particularly, cerebral FMD should be considered.

### Captopril [^1151N67s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Proteinuria: Total urinary proteins greater than 1 g per day were seen in about 0.7 percent of patients receiving captopril. About 90 percent of affected patients had evidence of prior renal disease or received relatively high doses of captopril (in excess of 150 mg/day), or both. The nephrotic syndrome occurred in about one-fifth of proteinuric patients. In most cases, proteinuria subsided or cleared within six months whether or not captopril was continued. Parameters of renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in the patients with proteinuria.

- **Hypotension**: Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of captopril use in salt/volume depleted persons (such as those treated vigorously with diuretics), patients with heart failure or those undergoing renal dialysis (see precautions: drug interactions). In heart failure, where the blood pressure was either normal or low, transient decreases in mean blood pressure greater than 20 percent were recorded in about half of the patients. This transient hypotension is more likely to occur after any of the first several doses and is usually well tolerated, producing either no symptoms or brief mild light-headedness, although in rare instances it has been associated with arrhythmia or conduction defects. Hypotension was the reason for discontinuation of the drug in 3.6 percent of patients with heart failure.

Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. A starting dose of 6.25
