## Question

Fifth cranial nerve symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal) symptoms, specifically how they are organized by mechanism, distribution, and diagnostic implications, with a clear reasoning plan and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core anatomy and functions of the trigeminal nerve to anchor symptom mapping. Then, I should categorize symptom types by sensory, motor, and autonomic domains. Next, I will map symptoms to the three divisions (V1, V2, V3) and consider combined patterns. After that, I need to distinguish classic trigeminal neuralgia from symptomatic forms and other trigeminal neuropathies. Finally, I should integrate red flags, imaging indications, and a pragmatic diagnostic approach, while double-checking areas where I might overgeneralize or miss nuances.

> Let me first confirm the foundational anatomy and functions so I don't misattribute symptoms. The trigeminal nerve is the largest cranial nerve, with mixed sensory and motor roles: sensory to the face, oral cavity, and cornea via ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) divisions, and motor to the muscles of mastication via V3; it also carries autonomic fibers that modulate lacrimal and salivary function indirectly, which explains why corneal anesthesia and dry eye can coexist with trigeminal injury [^1159q8dY] [^112V8ipY].

> I will now examine sensory symptoms, since these dominate clinical presentations. Pain in trigeminal neuralgia is classically sudden, unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, and recurrent in one or more trigeminal divisions, often triggered by light touch or routine activities like chewing or washing the face; the annual incidence is about 4–5 per 100,000, and V2–V3 are more commonly involved than V1 in classic disease [^113g6uuc] [^114qZDVo]. Wait, let me verify the V1 frequency — some sources note V1 is less commonly isolated, but ophthalmic division involvement does occur and can herald serious disease, so I should not underweight V1 symptoms when present [^114qZDVo]. Numbness or paresthesia reflects sensory neuropathy and may be the earliest manifestation of malignancy or autoimmune disease; persistent or progressive numbness warrants periodic reassessment and targeted imaging even if pain coexists [^116qFQZM]. Corneal anesthesia or neurotrophic keratitis presents with reduced or absent corneal sensation, poor ocular surface healing, and a striking discrepancy between minimal symptoms and significant corneal findings, risking ulceration and vision loss if unrecognized [^115FqKJr].

> Next, I should review motor symptoms, which are less common but highly localizing. Weakness of mastication manifests as difficulty biting, chewing, or jaw opening, with deviation toward the weak side on mouth opening; this pattern localizes to V3 motor fibers and helps distinguish trigeminal motor involvement from facial nerve causes of oral incompetence [^1159q8dY]. Hold on, I should verify that jaw deviation is indeed ipsilateral to the lesion — yes, the jaw deviates toward the weakened side due to unopposed contralateral pterygoid action, which is a reliable clinical sign [^notfound].

> Let me consider autonomic and ocular surface manifestations, since they are often overlooked. Reduced corneal sensitivity predisposes to neurotrophic keratitis with epithelial breakdown and ulceration; patients may have minimal discomfort despite marked corneal disease, so I need to actively test corneal reflexes and surface integrity when trigeminal dysfunction is suspected [^115FqKJr]. Dry eye symptoms can accompany trigeminal sensory loss or coexisting autonomic dysfunction, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for neuropathic ocular pain masquerading as "dry eye" in the setting of trigeminal small-fiber involvement [^114FRVmK].

> Now, I should map symptoms by division to refine localization. Ophthalmic division (V1) involvement produces pain, dysesthesia, or numbness of the forehead, upper eyelid, nasal bridge, and cornea; herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a classic cause and an ophthalmic emergency given the high risk of ocular complications and vision loss, so I need to check for vesicles in the V1 dermatome and initiate urgent antiviral therapy when suspected [^116StGgQ]. Maxillary division (V2) involvement yields cheek, upper lip, lateral nasal ala, and upper teeth/gums symptoms, including dental pain that can mislead the dentist if the source is neurogenic rather than odontogenic [^1159q8dY]. Mandibular division (V3) involvement causes lower face, lower lip/chin, and lower teeth/gums symptoms, plus masticatory weakness if motor fibers are affected, which is a key differentiator from purely sensory V1–V2 patterns [^1159q8dY].

> I need to ensure I account for combined patterns that imply multifocal or proximal disease. Multiple divisions can be involved in cavernous sinus or Meckel's cave lesions, producing V1–V2–V3 sensory loss with possible coexisting ocular motor palsies (III, IV, VI) or facial pain syndromes such as Tolosa-Hunt, which is a steroid-responsive granulomatous inflammation but remains a diagnosis of exclusion requiring MRI to exclude neoplasm or vascular lesions [^117BzYWj]. But wait, what if the pattern is bilateral or includes sensory deficits — those features push me toward symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia rather than classic disease, so I should double-check for underlying structural causes like multiple sclerosis or tumor [^113Q2GPt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without distinguishing classic trigeminal neuralgia from symptomatic forms. Classic trigeminal neuralgia presents with paroxysmal, shock-like pain in a single division, no sensory loss on examination, normal trigeminal reflexes, and often responds initially to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine; symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia tends to present at a younger age, may be bilateral, shows sensory deficits or abnormal reflexes, and is more likely due to multiple sclerosis, tumor, or vascular malformation, prompting MRI in essentially all cases to exclude secondary causes [^113Q2GPt] [^114okwxG]. I should confirm that guidelines now recommend MRI for all suspected trigeminal neuralgia to exclude secondary etiologies — yes, contemporary EAN guidance supports MRI as standard in the workup, with attention to high-resolution sequences for neurovascular compression and blinded reads to avoid bias [^114okwxG] [^115Eq88b].

> Next, I should review other trigeminal neuropathies beyond classic neuralgia. Trigeminal neuropathy presents with numbness or paresthesia in one or more divisions, often without the severe paroxysmal pain of neuralgia; causes include dental or surgical trauma, compressive lesions, infections, and systemic diseases, and persistent numbness warrants MRI and targeted labs to exclude malignancy or autoimmune etiologies [^116UGUKR] [^116qFQZM]. Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy frequently persists beyond 6 months and negatively impacts quality of life, so I need to set expectations and consider early pain and sensory rehabilitation strategies in these patients [^111W1ZcT]. Let me also remember that systemic sclerosis and other connective tissue diseases can cause trigeminal neuropathy or neuralgia, so I should screen for systemic features and coordinate multidisciplinary care when suspected [^112UhEzJ].

> I should double-check red flags that mandate urgent imaging or specialty referral. New focal neurologic deficits, progressive sensory loss, multiple cranial nerve involvement, atypical pain features, or failure of typical medical therapy should prompt brain MRI with contrast covering the brainstem, cisternal segments, Meckel's cave, cavernous sinus, and skull base, because these regions harbor the most consequential causes of trigeminal dysfunction including tumor, aneurysm, demyelination, and infection [^113CsjWm] [^1159q8dY]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said MRI is "mandatory" for all trigeminal neuralgia — let me verify guideline language; EAN recommends MRI in all patients with trigeminal neuralgia to exclude secondary causes, which in practice functions as a strong standard even if not framed as a legal mandate, so I should align with that stance [^114okwxG] [^115Eq88b].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic approach while keeping verification steps explicit. Start with a meticulous history of pain quality, triggers, distribution, and associated neurologic or systemic symptoms; perform a focused cranial nerve exam including facial sensation in V1–V3, corneal reflex, jaw opening/deviation, and inspection of the ocular surface for keratopathy; obtain brain MRI with contrast and high-resolution trigeminal sequences in essentially all suspected trigeminal neuralgia or neuropathy to exclude secondary causes; add targeted labs such as syphilis serology, connective tissue disease screening, or CSF analysis when clinical features suggest infection, inflammation, or demyelination; and consider trigeminal reflex testing where available to support classic versus symptomatic classification, recognizing that normal reflexes reduce but do not eliminate the need for imaging [^114okwxG] [^111KpibU] [^113CsjWm].

> Finally, I need to ensure I haven't overlooked special contexts that modify pretest probabilities. Pediatric trigeminal neuralgia is rare and more often bilateral or associated with compressive lesions, so I should maintain a lower threshold for MRI and multidisciplinary evaluation in children [^114qZDVo]. Immunocompromised patients with V1 pain or vesicles require urgent HZO management and ophthalmology co-care to prevent vision loss, reinforcing the need to examine the cornea and start antivirals promptly [^116StGgQ]. And I should remember that barometric pressure changes during flight or diving can rarely precipitate trigeminal neuropathy with facial numbness, so travel history can contextualize otherwise puzzling sensory symptoms [^114RofGf].

The fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve) supplies **sensory input to the face and motor control to the muscles of mastication** [^114FRVmK]. Symptoms of trigeminal nerve dysfunction include **facial pain** (trigeminal neuralgia, herpes zoster) [^113g6uuc] [^116StGgQ], **facial numbness** (sensory loss, paresthesia) [^116qFQZM], and **motor weakness** (difficulty chewing, jaw deviation) [^notfound]. Additional features may include corneal anesthesia with neurotrophic keratitis [^115FqKJr], triggerable paroxysmal pain [^114tMmyJ], and sensory deficits from trauma, tumors, or vascular compression [^112V8ipY] [^113UnU49]. Evaluation should include a focused neurologic exam and MRI [^113CsjWm] to localize the lesion and identify causes such as multiple sclerosis, tumors, or vascular compression [^111eccJC] [^115Eq88b].

---

## Sensory symptoms

Sensory symptoms are the **most common manifestation** of trigeminal nerve dysfunction and include:

- **Facial pain**: Sudden, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve [^113g6uuc]. This is characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia [^114tMmyJ], which can be triggered by light touch, eating, talking, or brushing teeth [^114tMmyJ].

- **Facial numbness**: Loss or reduction of sensation in the facial regions innervated by the trigeminal nerve, including the forehead, cheeks, and jaw [^116qFQZM]. This may be associated with paresthesia (tingling or pins-and-needles sensations) [^112Ejm3J].

- **Corneal anesthesia**: Loss of corneal sensation, which can lead to neurotrophic keratitis, a condition characterized by corneal epithelial defects, ulceration, and potential vision loss [^115FqKJr].

- **Triggerable pain**: Paroxysmal pain episodes triggered by everyday activities such as chewing, speaking, or touching the face [^114tMmyJ].

---

## Motor symptoms

Motor symptoms result from dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve's motor fibers, which innervate the muscles of mastication (masseter, temporalis, medial and lateral pterygoids) [^114FRVmK]. These include **weakness of mastication**, with difficulty chewing or biting and a tendency for the jaw to deviate toward the affected side when opening the mouth [^notfound], and **bruxism and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders**, characterized by involuntary grinding or clenching of the teeth and associated TMJ pain [^114FRVmK].

---

## Specific clinical syndromes

Several **clinical syndromes** are associated with trigeminal nerve dysfunction:

| **Syndrome** | **Description** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Trigeminal neuralgia | Sudden, severe, brief, stabbing facial pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve | - Vascular compression <br/> - Multiple sclerosis <br/> - Tumors [^113g6uuc] [^114qZDVo] |
| Herpes zoster ophthalmicus | Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the ophthalmic division, causing facial pain, vesicular rash, and potential vision loss | Varicella-zoster virus [^116StGgQ] |
| Trigeminal neuropathy | Sensory loss or paresthesia in the trigeminal distribution without significant pain | - Trauma <br/> - Tumors <br/> - Vascular lesions <br/> - Dental procedures [^116UGUKR] [^116qFQZM] |
| Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy | Persistent sensory disturbances or pain following facial trauma or dental procedures | - Trauma <br/> - Dental procedures [^111W1ZcT] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to identify the **underlying cause** of trigeminal nerve symptoms:

- **Clinical examination**: Detailed neurological examination to assess sensory and motor function of the trigeminal nerve, including corneal reflex testing and evaluation of masticatory muscle strength [^notfound].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI with contrast is the preferred modality to visualize the trigeminal nerve pathway, identify structural lesions, vascular compression, or demyelinating plaques [^113CsjWm] [^114okwxG].

- **Trigeminal reflex testing**: Abnormal trigeminal reflexes may indicate symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia due to structural lesions [^113Q2GPt].

---

## Conclusion

Trigeminal nerve symptoms span sensory loss, facial pain, and masticatory weakness, with presentations including trigeminal neuralgia, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, and post-traumatic neuropathy [^113g6uuc] [^116StGgQ] [^111W1ZcT]. Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical examination and neuroimaging** to localize lesions and identify causes such as vascular compression, multiple sclerosis, or tumors [^113CsjWm] [^114okwxG].

### Sensory restoration of the facial region [^112V8ipY]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Normal sensitivity of the face is very important for preserving its integrity and function as an efferent source of information for the brain. The trigeminal nerve, which is the largest cranial nerve, conducts most of facial sensory function through its 3 branches: the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3). The trigeminal nerve may be damaged by a variety of etiologies including inflammatory disorders, brain tumor resection, trauma, iatrogenic injury, or congenital anomalies. Temporary or permanent damage can lead to numbness, lip-biting injury, corneal anesthesia, and, in the worst scenario, even blindness. Different age groups, mechanisms of the injury, and the time between injury and repair can affect the final result of the nerve repair. Unlike the well-understood facial nerve palsy, so far there is no universal approach to restore the facial sensory function. This article serves to thoroughly review the basic anatomy of trigeminal nerve, diagnosis of sensory nerve dysfunction, and attempts to establish a protocol for treatment and rehabilitation of affected patients.

Recent studies have revealed that the brainstem is characteristically involved in hypoxic encephalopathy in infants. However, few reports have described clinical and cranial magnetic resonance findings in detail because most patients with brainstem lesions die during delivery or soon afterward. Reported here is a patient who manifested selective brainstem injury caused by perinatal hypoxic cerebral injury and exhibited palsy of the lower-brainstem cranial nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate lesions of brainstem cranial nerves, which were consistent with symptoms of brainstem dysfunction.

### Trigeminal neuropathy and neuritis… [^116UGUKR]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Trigeminal neuropathy is a syndrome in which there is a disorder of sensation confined to the distribution of the fifth cranial nerve. Treatment for this condition depends upon understanding of its causes, which are various. Sixty-one cases of trigeminal neuropathy were separated into six groups, according to the presumed cause. The neuropathy followed a dental procedure in 21 patients and resulted from the pressure of a denture on the mental nerve in another eight. Surgical or mechanical trauma caused eight instances. Hydroxystilbamidine isethionate produced bilateral trigeminal neuropathy in seven cases. Ten patients made up a miscellaneous group, of whom three had tumors, two had intracranial aneurysms, and two had herpetic lesions. There was also a group of seven in which no cause was discovered.

Leptomeningeal metastases — epidemiology, presentation, and outcomes: Leptomeningeal metastasis occurs in approximately 5% of patients with cancer, most cases arise from breast cancers, lung cancers, and melanoma, and tumor cells gain access to the leptomeninges by hematogenous dissemination, lymphatic spread, or direct extension with dissemination throughout the neuraxis by the constant flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Infiltration of the leptomeninges by any malignancy is a serious complication that results in substantial morbidity and mortality, with common symptoms depending on location including new cranial nerve palsies when the posterior fossa is involved, spinal cord-related symptoms such as pain, focal motor or sensory dysfunction, and bowel/bladder dysfunction, and ventricular system involvement with headache, nausea/vomiting, and confusion. The median survival of patients diagnosed with this disorder is typically 2 to 4 months, although survival may be extended by early detection and intervention, and the underlying tumor type can have some impact on overall survival.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1122NsMc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — imaging indications and modality: Routine imaging at the time of initial diagnosis is discouraged, but there is a distinct role for imaging when suggestive history or physical findings are present or if paralysis fails to recover or worsens; any presentation inconsistent with Bell's palsy should be further evaluated by imaging. Features atypical of Bell's palsy include a second paralysis on the same side, paralysis of isolated facial nerve branches, other cranial nerve involvement, or no sign of recovery after 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire facial nerve course, with and without contrast, is the imaging test of choice in these circumstances; imaging should include the internal auditory canal (IAC) and face, and if MRI is contraindicated, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) can be used.

### Lymphoma of the orbit masquerading as tolosa-hunt syndrome [^117BzYWj]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia and ipsilateral cranial neuropathies. It is caused by an idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus or orbital apex complex that is exquisitely responsive to parentral glucocorticoids. The estimated annual incidence is one case per million per year in the US. This rare clinical entity was first described in 1954 as a syndrome comprised of two features: (a) pain in the first division of the trigeminal nerve; and (b) progressive paralysis, partial or total, of the oculomotor nerve and occasionally of the fourth, sixth, and the fifth cranial nerves. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be carefully differentiated from life threatening diagnoses, a mandate challenged by the lack of a specific diagnostic test to identify this disorder.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is caused by an inflammatory process of unknown etiology. The inflammation leads to compression and secondary dysfunction of the structures within the cavernous sinus, including cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, as well as the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve resulting in clinical symptoms.

### Facial and trigeminal nerves neuropathy induced by atmospheric pressure changes: a meta-analysis [^114RofGf]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Barometric pressure changes during flight or diving may cause facial barotrauma. Neuropathy of the fifth (CN5) or the seventh (CN7) cranial nerves is a rare manifestation of this condition. The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for baroneuropathies of CN5 and CN7.

Methods

A search of PubMed and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify all published cases of CN5 and CN7 neuropathies. Only original case reports and series that documented events of neuropathies associated with the trigeminal nerve or facial nerve while flying, diving, or mountain climbing were included. Assessed variables included sex, medical history, age, setting (flight or diving), atmospheric pressure changes, number of episodes, symptoms, treatment, and recovery.

Results

We identified a total of 48 articles described > 125 episodes in 67 patients. Mean age was 33.5 ± 12.1 years with a male predominance (76.1%). Cases were equally distributed between flight and diving (50.7%, 46.3%, respectively). CN5 involvement was observed in 77.6% of patients, with ear pain and facial numbness as the most common symptoms. The latter was correlated with positive otolaryngology medical history. CN7 was involved in 88.1% of patients. Flying, as opposed to diving was correlated with spontaneous resolution of symptoms (86.7% vs. 42.3% of cases resolved spontaneously, respectively, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Flight is an equal risk factor to diving with respect to CN5 and CN7 barotrauma. Involvement of CN7 was observed in most cases, but possibly due to report-bias. Positive medical history is a risk factor for facial numbness.

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: a review [^117AbonC]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy is the most common condition involving a rapid and unilateral onset of peripheral paresis/paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. It affects 11.5–53.3 per 100,000 individuals a year across different populations. Bell's palsy is a health issue causing concern and has an extremely negative effect on both patients and their families. Therefore, diagnosis and prompt cause determination are key for early treatment. However, the etiology of Bell's palsy is unclear, and this affects its treatment. Thus, it is critical to determine the causes of Bell's palsy so that targeted treatment approaches can be developed and employed. This article reviews the literature on the diagnosis of Bell's palsy and examines possible etiologies of the disorder. It also suggests that the diagnosis of idiopathic facial palsy is based on exclusion and is most often made based on five factors including anatomical structure, viral infection, ischemia, inflammation, and cold stimulation responsivity.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis [^112S7un4]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

What is the best management for neurological complications of SSc?

A range of neurological complications of systemic sclerosis have been reported. Some of these relate to secondary effects of scleroderma renal crisis including hypertensive encephalopathy and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Peripheral nerve complications can be the presenting feature including carpal tunnel syndrome most often in early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Cranial nerve involvement is well recognised and includes trigeminal neuropathy as well as trigeminal neuralgia. Involvement of other cranial nerves, particularly the glossopharyngeal nerve, also occurs.

Peripheral neuropathy has also been observed in case series including most often neuronal patterns of neuropathy by electrophysiological, quantitative sensory testing and pathological investigation.

There have been additional reports of autonomic and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy in SSc involves the enteric, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems affecting the function of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, urinary, skin and ocular systems. Depending on the system affected, dysautonomia in SSc may underlie several symptoms. Although some reported associations include restless leg syndrome, erythromelalgia and regional pain syndromes, albeit of infrequent occurrence.

Large fibre neuropathy is increasingly recognised in SSc. In addition, peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) has been reported mostly affecting cranial, truncal, upper and lower extremities' nerves. The latter was recently reported to be of high prevalence in a larger cohort, where PSN assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST) was present in the feet in 85.3% of 109, with 80% reporting at least one neuropathic symptom. When PSN was present it was reported as a disabling manifestation, with paraesthesia, numbness or stabbing pain. PSN in the feet involved both large and small neural fibres, often co-existing. Clinically, the presence of neuropathic symptoms might serve as an indicator of PSN, although it can have a subclinical presentation. Therefore, it is important to screen for PSN with tests that capture both small and large fibre neuropathy. Polyneuropathy can also be demyelinating in the context of the scleroderma-like POEMS syndrome.

### Isolated sixth cranial nerve palsy as the presenting symptom of a rapidly expanding ACTH positive pituitary adenoma: a case report [^116Pwixv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The cavernous sinus contains the carotid artery as well as the oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal, and abducens nerves. Extraocular palsy generally indicates compression of the cavernous sinus wall or direct extension of the pituitary adenoma into the cavernous sinus. The incidence of ocular palsy occurring with pituitary tumors has been reported to be between 4.6 and 32%. Most commonly affected is the oculomotor nerve; rarely is the abducens nerve involved. A retrospective review of 64 patients hospitalized with pituitary adenoma found that a defect in ocular movement was present in 14% of patients, with oculomotor nerve involvement in 78% of cases. The sixth cranial nerve runs lateral to the internal carotid artery, but medial to the third, fourth, and first and second divisions of the fifth cranial nerves which run superior to inferior within the lateral dural border of the cavernous sinus. It is therefore more often spared because of its more sheltered position within the sinus. Our patient is unusual in that initially the sixth cranial nerve paresis was in isolation.

### Syphilitic meningitis presenting with multiple cranial neuropathies [^114tBM4u]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

In the past 90 years, there have been 12 cases in the literature of syphilis presenting with multiple cranial neuropathies. Of these, 10 cases were diagnosed with early syphilitic meningitis, one with early meningovascular syphilis and one with late latent syphilis. A further three cases in the non-English literature are reviewed by Piura et al. Of the 12 cases, the seventh and eighth nerves were more commonly involved (12/12 and 11/12, respectively), the fifth nerve was involved in three cases, and the sixth in two. Ten of these patients presented without a history of a primary chancre while four had preceding rash and lymphadenopathy. Four of the patients were HIV coinfected, six were HIV-negative and two had unknown status. Of the patients that were HIV-unknown or negative, three presented without any risk factors for syphilis.

This case was unique due to multiple cranial nerve involvement. This is the most extensive cranial neuropathy to be reported to date with syphilitic infections, with most previously reported cases involving between one to three cranial nerves. Interestingly, our patient presented without any risk factors for syphilis, likely reflecting the increasing prevalence in the community. This combined with the lack of meningeal symptoms and the broad range of differentials for multiple cranial neuropathies made the diagnosis more challenging. Serological tests for syphilis, followed by CSF studies if serology returns positive, should be considered in all patients presenting with multiple cranial neuropathies, as well as in patients presenting with isolated cranial neuropathies without vascular risk factors.

Learning points

Syphilis should be considered in all patients with cranial neuropathies and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, as early recognition and treatment can lead to dramatic clinical improvement.
In this context, syphilis screening should be performed even in the absence of traditional risk factors or history of primary chancre, given the concerning increase in syphilis incidence over the past two decades.
Subacute-chronic meningitis can occur without typical symptoms of headache, photophobia and neck stiffness, and CSF examination remains an important diagnostic tool in patients with unexplained cranial neuropathies.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115ZxHJz]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of facial pain.

Purpose

To answer the following questions: 1) In patients with TN, how often does routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) identify a cause? 2) Which features identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic TN (STN; i.e., a structural cause such as a tumor)? 3) Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify patients with neurovascular compression? 4) Which drugs effectively treat classic and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia? 5) When should surgery be offered? 6) Which surgical technique gives the longest pain-free period with the fewest complications and good quality of life?

Methods

Systematic review of the literature by a panel of experts.

Conclusions

In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with MS remains uncertain.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^114E3PVC]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurological symptoms

This section concerns the effect of treatment on neurological symptoms other than deafness, which was considered earlier. No randomized comparative trials were identified in which the effects of bisphosphonates or other treatments have been evaluated in respect to neurological symptoms. We identified two case series of patients that addressed this issue. Chen and colleagues described the response to treatment with salmon or porcine calcitonin given subcutaneously in 49 PDB patients with neurological symptoms treated between 1969 and 1973 at a single referral center in the US. 109 The starting dose was 100 IU by subcutaneous injection, although subsequently the dose was reduced in some patients to 50 IU 3 times weekly. Treatment was continued for 7 to 31 months (average 23 months). The indication for treatment in 10 patients was cranial nerve lesions (other than lesions of the 8th cranial nerve), spinal nerve root dysfunction in 15, spinal cord problems in 6, and miscellaneous neurological problems in 8. The authors reported objective improvement in 40% of patients with a cranial nerve lesion responded to treatment, as compared with 33% with spinal nerve problems, 50% with spinal cord symptoms, and 0% with miscellaneous problems. In another case series from the UK, Douglas reported the results of treatment with calcitonin, etidronate, or clodronate in 8 patients with neurological dysfunction due to Paget's disease of the spine. 50 Seven of the 8 patients were treated with calcitonin 100 IU daily and all improved neurologically. One patient treated with clodronate also improved. In 3 patients whose symptoms recurred despite treatment with calcitonin, there was a response to etidronate or clodronate. Douglas also reviewed the results of medical treatment of spinal dysfunction from other published case reports with calcitonin at that time 50 and identified 13 additional patients who had been treated with calcitonin for spinal cord dysfunction whose symptoms had improved after therapy.

The evidence summary and recommendations for the use of calcitonin and bisphosphonates in the treatment of neurological symptoms in PDB are shown in Table 14.

### Multiple cranial nerve palsies… [^111PinLD]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Cranial nerves VI, VII, V, and III were most commonly affected. The locations and causes were diverse, with cavernous sinus, brainstem, and individual nerves being the most frequent sites, and tumor, vascular disease, trauma, infection, and the Guillain-Barré and Fisher syndromes being the most frequent causes. Demyelinating disease included cases of proven and probable multiple sclerosis as well as acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The 26 cases with functional cranial nerve signs represented various combinations of hysterical loss of smell, sight, facial sensation, and hearing, and, less frequently, face and tongue paralysis, ipsilateral to functional hemiplegia or, in 6 instances, to Bell palsy.
2.

Reflecting frequent involvement in cavernous sinus lesions and meningeal processes, the sixth cranial nerve was most commonly involved by a wide margin. The seventh cranial nerve was implicated in the Guillain-Barré and Fisher syndromes as well as in benign causes and skull base lesions. Cranial nerves III and V were most commonly damaged within the cavernous sinus. Recurrent cranial neuropathy frequently involved cranial nerves VII, III, and VI. Of the 50 patients with 8 or more impaired cranial nerves, 26 had Guillain-Barré or Fisher syndromes, 15 had tumors, 3 had botulism, 3 had other infections, and 3 had other causes. The most common combinations of involved cranial nerves were III and VI, V and VI, and V and VII. In the present study, only 22% of MCN cases originated in the brainstem.

Central signs were absent in just 1 case that had a lateral pontomedullary infarct similar to another in the literature. 21 Nearly all of the brainstem cases of MCN will have telltale clues such as long track signs, gaze palsies, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and complex spontaneous eye movement abnormalities.

### Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis [^115FqKJr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of NK is mainly based on the clinical history of conditions associated with trigeminal impairment, presence of PED or ulcers, and decreased corneal sensitivity. Patients with NK rarely complain of ocular symptoms, with a discrepancy between clinical findings and symptoms. Even if reduction or absence of corneal sensitivity is pathognomonic of NK, a differential diagnosis with infective and immune keratitis should always be included. On the other hand, the assessment of corneal sensitivity during evaluation for corneal ulcer may reveal the presence of NK, allowing correct diagnosis and treatment (Figure 2).

Clinical history

Many ocular and systemic conditions may be associated with development of NK and the patient's clinical history should be accurately investigated. Presence of systemic disease (diabetes or multiple sclerosis), treatments (neuroleptic and antipsychotic drugs), and local causes (previous corneal surgery or traumas, topical anesthetic abuse, chronic topical drug use, chemical burns, or contact lens abuse) potentially leading to corneal sensory impairment should be carefully investigated. Additionally, conditions that may damage the fifth cranial nerve or its nucleus, such as neoplasms of the brain, neurosurgery, or vascular accident, should be considered. Finally, NK has been described in several congenital diseases, including familial dysautonomia, Goldenhar-Gorlin syndrome, Moebius syndrome, familial corneal hypoesthesia, and congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.

Ocular symptoms

Symptoms of ocular surface discomfort are rarely reported by NK patients. However, patients may complain of blurred vision due to PED, corneal stroma scarring, and/or swelling.

General examination

General examination assessing for the presence of cranial nerve involvement may aid localization of trigeminal nerve damage. Seventh or eighth cranial nerve palsy may indicate trigeminal involvement from acoustic neuroma or from its surgical resection. Third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve dysfunction may indicate an aneurysm or cavernous sinus that also damages the trigeminal nerve.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® cranial neuropathy: 2022 update [^113CsjWm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cranial neuropathy can result from pathology affecting the nerve fibers at any point and requires imaging of the entire course of the nerve from its nucleus to the end organ in order to identify a cause. MRI with and without intravenous contrast is often the modality of choice with CT playing a complementary role. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: pathology and pathogenesis [^113UnU49]. Brain (2001). Low credibility.

There is now persuasive evidence that trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by demyelination of trigeminal sensory fibres within either the nerve root or, less commonly, the brainstem. In most cases, the trigeminal nerve root demyelination involves the proximal, CNS part of the root and results from compression by an overlying artery or vein. Other causes of trigeminal neuralgia in which demyelination is involved or implicated include multiple sclerosis and, probably, compressive space-occupying masses in the posterior fossa. Examination of trigeminal nerve roots from patients with compression of the nerve root by an overlying blood vessel has revealed focal demyelination in the region of compression, with close apposition of demyelinated axons and an absence of intervening glial processes. Similar foci of nerve root demyelination and juxtaposition of axons have been demonstrated in multiple sclerosis patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Experimental studies indicate that this anatomical arrangement favours the ectopic generation of spontaneous nerve impulses and their ephaptic conduction to adjacent fibres, and that spontaneous nerve activity is likely to be increased by the deformity associated with pulsatile vascular indentation. Decompression of the nerve root produces rapid relief of symptoms in most patients with vessel-associated trigeminal neuralgia, probably because the resulting separation of demyelinated axons and their release from focal distortion reduce the spontaneous generation of impulses and prevent their ephaptic spread. The role of remyelination in initial symptomatic recovery after decompression is unclear. However, remyelination may help to ensure that relief of symptoms is sustained after decompression of the nerve root and may also be responsible for the spontaneous remission of the neuralgia in some patients. In addition to causing symptomatic relief, vascular decompression leads to rapid recovery of nerve conduction across the indented root, a phenomenon that, we suggest, is likely to reflect the reversal of compression-induced conduction block in larger myelinated fibres outside the region of demyelination. Trigeminal neuralgia can occur in association with a range of other syndromes involving vascular compression and hyperactivity of cranial nerves. Clinical observations and electrophysiological studies support the concept that demyelination and ephaptic spread of excitation underlie most, if not all, of these conditions.

RESULTS

Clinical features

Fifty-three patients were identified on the basis of a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of vasculitis between January 1999 and August 2005. The clinical characteristics of our cohort of patients are summarised in table 1 and a breakdown of all patients is shown in supplementary table 1 (available online). Thirty-one patients (58%) had SVN and 22 (42%) NSVN. There was a female preponderance (women:men 30:23). Age range at the time of biopsy was 32–79 years (mean 56 (SD 13)). Duration of symptoms prior to biopsy ranged from 1 to 144 months (mean 15 (SD 23), median 6). Mean duration of symptoms prior to biopsy was shorter in the SVN than in the NSVN group (8.5 vs 23.5 months, respectively) but this difference was not statistically significant (Mann–Whitney rank sum test, p = 0.36). The majority (87%) of neuropathies were painful on presentation and the most common presentation was with either an asymmetric sensorimotor neuropathy or mononeuritis multiplex (45% and 20% of patients, respectively). Nine patients (17%) had only sensory findings on presentation (one with a pure small fibre neuropathy). One patient presented with a bilateral asymmetric brachial and another with bilateral asymmetric lumbosacral plexopathy. Only four patients (8%) had cranial nerve involvement (third cranial nerve in one patient, fifth cranial nerve in two patients, and sixth cranial nerve in one patient). Table 2 shows the frequency of involvement of different motor nerves, as determined by clinical examination. Supplemental table 2 (available online) shows the same data divided into SVN versus NSVN groups. Note that for the purposes of table 2, the observed deficits were decomposed into constituent peripheral nerves (sciatic nerve involvement in two patients was reduced to peroneal and tibial). There was a distal predominance. The most commonly involved nerve was the peroneal (86% of patients); in the upper limbs the most commonly involved nerve was the ulnar (63% of patients).

### Hypopituitarism and cranial nerve involvement mimicking tolosa-hunt syndrome as the initially presenting feature of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a case report [^112TYmiw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of lymphoma is likely often delayed because it is challenging to differentiate the area of involvement and to estimate the timing when symptoms present. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is a benign disease with unilateral orbital pain with paresis of one or more of the third, fourth, and/or sixth cranial nerves. THS-mimicking symptoms are clinically often encountered, and could be associated with malignant disease. Therefore, the differentiation from other diseases is critical. Generally, if THS-mimicking symptoms persist or worsen, the infiltrative neoplastic diseases are implicated as a cause of the symptoms; however, if they improve, benign diseases are considered.

Hypopituitarism is usually associated with pituitary mass lesions, whereas upper unilateral cranial nerve palsies are associated with skull base lesions around the cavernous sinus. These two lesions are anatomically separated by the bone. Therefore, to understand the patient's clinical state, it is radiologically important to investigate how these two lesions could be simultaneously involved. As for lymphoma originating from extra pituitary gland, only one case of nasopharyngeal lesion has been reported; there was both oculomotor nerve palsy and pituitary dysfunction, but no bone erosion.

Here, we present a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with a unique clinical course. Initially there was hypopituitarism, and there was ophthalmoplegia and unilateral upper cranial nerve palsies mimicking THS with sphenoidal and cavernous sinuses lesion invading the sella with erosion of the sphenoidal bone. She later presented typical symptoms of systemic lymphoma after the remission of cranial nerve symptoms. This case emphasizes the importance of considering DLBCL as a cause of hypopituitarism if there is association with THS-like symptoms, even when symptoms are temporary and there is no obvious mass originating from the pituitary gland.

Cranial Nerve Palsy

Due to COVID-19, paralysis of the third, fourth, sixth and seventh cranial nerves has been observed. They may occur as primary, isolated paralysis, but also in the context of broader conditions such as Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis.

Cases of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy have been reported, both with and without pupillary involvement. Similarly, isolated abducens nerve palsy has been reported associated with COVID-19. There are also known cases of unilateral trochlear nerve palsy with contralateral tonic pupil, as well as bilateral palsy of this nerve in the course of cerebral vasculitis associated with COVID-19.

Cases of isolated facial nerve palsy associated with COVID-19 have also been reported. Lima et al also described palsy of the VII nerve coexisting with ipsilateral VI nerve palsy.

Drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulins have been used in treatment of COVID-19-related cranial neuropathies. However, there is no clear data on the benefits of the treatment. These neuropathies also appear in the context of Miller Fisher and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Dinkin et al described a patient with COVID-19 in whom the use of intravenous immunoglobulins led to partial improvement of deficits associated with presumed Miller Fisher syndrome. Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al reported a similar case with Miller Fisher syndrome in which most of the deficits resolved after intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins. Sansone et al showed that among patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2, the first neurological symptoms appeared approximately 10 days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms.

Additionally, it has been reported that COVID-19 may be responsible for the emergence of new cases of myasthenia gravis. Restivo et al described in detail three patients whose myasthenic symptoms appeared 4–7 days after the initial symptoms of COVID-19.

Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^11197ZeW]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Predictors of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) risk among patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN): Younger age and abnormal trigeminal nerve evoked potentials are probably associated with an increased risk of STN, but there is too much overlap in patients with classic TN (CTN) and STN for these predictors to be considered clinically useful. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves probably increases the risk of STN, whereas the absence of these features does not rule out STN. Involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and unresponsiveness to treatment are probably not associated with an increased risk of STN.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^114qZDVo]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

The prevalence rate of TN ranges between 0.03% and 0.3%. There is a female preponderance, with a male: female ratio between 1:1.5 and 1:1.7. Classic TN is generally diagnosed in elderly population with peak incidence between 50 and 60 years. V2 and V3 are the most commonly affected branches of TN. In less than 5% of the cases is the ophthalmic (V1) branch affected in isolation. Trigeminal symptoms are present in 2–4% of the patients with multiple sclerosis, and in 1–5%, it can be the presenting feature of the disease. Conversely, multiple sclerosis is detected in 2–14% of the patients with TN.,

TN is more commonly seen in adults compared with pediatric TN, which comprises less than 1.5% of all cases. Pediatric TN is more likely to be bilateral (42%) compared with adult TN. It is associated with compression of multiple cranial nerves (46%) as a result of congenitally abnormal vessels, vascular malformations, tumors, cysts, aneurysms, or arachnoiditis.

### The link between idiopathic intracranial hypertension, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: exploration of a shared pathophysiology [^111uUK1t]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cranial nerve involvement

It has been shown that the perineural spaces of several cranial nerves including the olfactory, optic, trigeminal, and auditory nerves show multiple lymphatic pathways of CSF drainage toward the retropharyngeal and cervical lymph nodes.

When CSP increases, CSF is forced into the cranial nerve root sheaths. This might compromise the blood supply or cause mechanical pressure on the neurons or axons during their intracranial course.

The olfactory nerve (I)

Patients with IICH often show decreased olfactory bulb volumesand impaired olfactory function. These findings have also been reported for patients with FM. It is most likely that these symptoms are due to increased pressure compromising the blood supply and damaging the olfactory nerve cell bodies.

The optic nerve (II)

In IICH, the optic nerve diameter may be increased as the pressure of the CSF dilates the nerve sheath. Additionally, due to the increased pressure, the optic nerve fibers inside may be damaged. Consequently, even in the absence of papilledema, peripheral visual field defects may occur.

Visual field defects have been detected in patients with FM, which might indicate that the nerve root fibers of the optic nerve are damaged by the increased pressure.

Figure 2 shows T2-weighted sagittal MRI images of a dilated optic nerve in a 46-year-old female patient with unexplained widespread pain. She was later diagnosed with IICH because a lumbar puncture revealed an OP of 23 cm H₂O, and visual field defects were detected. Evacuation of 20 mL of CSF dramatically improved her symptoms during a period of 2 or 3 days.

The oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), and abducens nerve (VI)

The third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves control the motor function of the eye muscles. In IICH, compression of these nerves may cause oculomotor weakness, and patients present with double vision and, in severe cases, even oculomotor palsy. In patients with FM and CFS, double vision has been reported, and in patients with CFS, eye motility dysfunction has been observed.

### Lower cranial nerve syndromes: a review [^115u4sM5]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review encompassing the syndromes associated with the lower cranial nerves (LCNs). We will discuss the anatomy of some of these syndromes and the historical contributors after whom they were named. The LCNs can be affected individually or in combination, since the cranial nerves at this level share their courses through the jugular foramen and hypoglossal canal and the extracranial spaces. Numerous alterations affecting them have been described in the literature, but much remains to be discovered on this topic. This paper will highlight some of the subtle differences among these syndromes. Symptoms and signs that have localization value for LCN lesions include impaired speech, deglutition, sensory functions, alterations in taste, autonomic dysfunction, neuralgic pain, dysphagia, head or neck pain, cardiac or gastrointestinal compromise, and weakness of the tongue, trapezius, or sternocleidomastoid muscles. To assess the manifestations of LCN lesions correctly, precise knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the area is required. Treatments currently used for these conditions will also be addressed here. Effective treatments are available in several such cases, but a precondition for complete recovery is a correct and swift diagnosis.

### Cranial nerve abnormalities in oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum [^113k7w73]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cranial nerve abnormalities might be observed in hemifacial microsomia and microtia (oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum), but the rate, features, and relationship with functional impairment or phenotype severity have not yet been defined. This study aimed at investigating absence/asymmetry, abnormal origin, morphology and course of cranial nerves, and presence/asymmetry of the foramen ovale and inferior alveolar nerve canal in a cohort of oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum patients.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-nine patients with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (mean age, 7 years; age range, 0.2–31 years; 12 females) underwent brain MR imaging, CT, and neurologic evaluation; 19 patients had a more severe phenotype (Goldenhar syndrome).

Results

Cranial nerve abnormalities were detected only in patients with Goldenhar syndrome (17/19, bilaterally in 8) and were involved the second (4/19), third (1/18), fifth (11/19), sixth (8/16), seventh (11/18), and eighth (8/18) cranial nerves. Multiple cranial nerve abnormalities were common (11/17). Eleven patients showed bone foramina abnormalities. Trigeminal and facial nerve dysfunctions were common (44% and 58%, respectively), especially in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. Trigeminal abnormalities showed a good correlation with ipsilateral dysfunction (P = 0.018), which further increased when bone foramina abnormalities were included. The facial nerve showed a trend toward correlation with ipsilateral dysfunction (P = 0.081). Diplopia was found only in patients with Goldenhar syndrome and was associated with third and sixth cranial nerve abnormalities (P = 0.006).

Conclusions

Among patients with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, cranial nerve morphologic abnormalities are common, correlate with phenotype severity, and often entail a functional impairment. The spectrum of cranial nerve abnormalities appears wider than simple hypo-/aplasia and includes an anomalous cisternal course and partial/complete fusion of diverse cranial nerves.

### Idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy in childhood [^115R44sa]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Harris first reported transient idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy in 1935, although it later appeared that, in some of his patients, this condition evolved to typical chronic and painful trigeminal neuralgia. The patients who were later described by Hill and Hughes suffered a combined motor-sensory Vth cranial nerve dysfunction, and most cases reported by Spillane and Wells developed sustained permanent trigeminal neuropathy. The largest reported series of pure trigeminal sensory neuropathy includes 10 adults with varying degrees of sensory disturbance confined to all three nerve divisions. These patients experienced no facial pain or motor deficit, and 5 (50%) recovered completely within a few months. It is estimated that typical trigeminal neuralgia occurs in about 1 in 25,000 of the population and is uncommon prior to the third decade, with 1% of the cases occurring before the age of 20 years. To our knowledge, we present the first clinical report of idiopathic trigeminal sensory neuropathy occurring in childhood.

### Internal carotid artery aneurysms, cranial nerve dysfunction and headache: the role of deformation and pulsation [^115nKrHo]. Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Cranial nerve dysfunction and headache may occur with unruptured aneurysms of the cavernous and supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid artery. Nerve deformation (mass effect) and transmitted pulsations have been suggested as pathogenetic mechanisms. Differentiation may be possible by studying effects of endovascular treatment with Guglielmi detachable coils. Symptoms and signs of cranial neuropathy were retrospectively contrasted with angiographic aneurysm volumes before and after treatment in 10 patients. Mean follow-up was 36 months. Symptoms improved in three of four patients with cranial nerve dysfunction and in all patients with headache. None of the other patients, one with cranial nerve dysfunction, and three who were asymptomatic, developed any new symptoms after treatment. Aneurysm volume ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 cm(3)before and 0.2 to 5.7 cm(3) after treatment; the size thus increased by 15 to 110%, a change which was statistically significant (P = 0.004). The consistent increase in aneurysm volume with treatment is not associated with clinical deterioration, suggesting that deformation and displacement play a minor role in cranial neuropathy and that transmitted pulsations may be more important.

### Literature review regarding the methodology of assessing third nerve paresis associated with non-ruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysms [^111CX7kQ]. Neurosurgical Review (2005). Low credibility.

The association of third cranial nerve palsy subsequent to an enlarging posterior communicating artery (P-Com A) aneurysm has been well described. In our current communication, we review the relevant literature and propose a classification system for the severity of the third cranial nerve palsy, correlating it to the postoperative recovery. Our four grade scale (I-IV) included the degree of the levator palpebrae muscle paresis, the presence of pupillary reaction and the impairment of the third nerve mediated extraocular muscle movement. We evaluated five patients with third nerve palsy secondary to non-ruptured, P-Com A aneurysm. Patients were re-evaluated at 2, 4, 8, 24 weeks postoperatively. Four of the five patients had complete recovery within 4–8 weeks after surgery. One patient had grade II third nerve paresis and complete resolution of the third nerve symptoms within 4 weeks, whereas three patients with grade III and IV had complete resolution 4–8 weeks after surgery. The fifth patient, with grade IV paresis, had minimal (grade III) improvement 6 weeks after surgery, and incomplete recovery (grade I) 6 months postoperatively. Our simple grading system of third nerve palsy associated with P-Com A aneurysms, can be a helpful tool for the initial evaluation and for the monitoring of recovery in these patients.

### The trigeminal nerve: an illustrated review of its imaging anatomy and pathology [^1159q8dY]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The trigeminal nerve is the largest cranial nerve and has both sensory and motor components. Due to its extensive distribution in the head and neck, the nerve or its branches may be involved by a myriad of disease entities. Additionally, the nerve may act as a route of spread in various inflammatory and neoplastic diseases, underlining the need for a thorough understanding of its anatomy. A segmental division of the trigeminal system is preferred when interpreting imaging studies as both the type of lesion and symptoms may vary based on the site of involvement. These segments include the brainstem, cisternal, Meckel's cave, cavernous sinus, and peripheral divisions. In general, dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred to evaluate nerve dysfunction. In select cases, contrast medium administration, heavily T2-weighted sequences, or MR angiography may prove to be diagnostic. This review aims to review the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve briefly, followed by illustrations of various lesions that may present with trigeminal nerve dysfunction.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for trigeminal neuralgia, more specifically with respect to MRI, EAN 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain MRI in all patients with trigeminal neuralgia to exclude secondary causes. Use a combination of three high-resolution sequences, 3D T2-weighted, 3D time-of-flight MRA and 3D T1-weighted gadolinium, to aid the detection of a possible neurovascular compression. Blind the neuroradiologist to the side of pain. Describe whether a vessel contact causes morphological changes of the nerve.

Trigeminal neuralgia definition and incidence — population context: The International Association for the Study of Pain defines TN as sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The annual incidence of TN is 4 to 5 in 100,000. The latest classification of the International Headache Society distinguishes between classic and symptomatic TN, and classic TN includes all cases without an established etiology (i.e., idiopathic), as well as those with potential vascular compression of the fifth cranial nerve.

### Imaging the cranial nerves: part I: methodology, infectious and inflammatory, traumatic and congenital lesions [^1145KWYc]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Many disease processes manifest either primarily or secondarily by cranial nerve deficits. Neurologists, ENT surgeons, ophthalmologists and maxillo-facial surgeons are often confronted with patients with symptoms and signs of cranial nerve dysfunction. Seeking the cause of this dysfunction is a common indication for imaging. In recent decades we have witnessed an unprecedented improvement in imaging techniques, allowing direct visualization of increasingly small anatomic structures. The emergence of volumetric CT scanners, higher field MR scanners in clinical practice and higher resolution MR sequences has made a tremendous contribution to the development of cranial nerve imaging. The use of surface coils and parallel imaging allows sub-millimetric visualization of nerve branches and volumetric 3D imaging. Both with CT and MR, multiplanar and curved reconstructions can follow the entire course of a cranial nerve or branch, improving tremendously our diagnostic yield of neural pathology. This review article will focus on the contribution of current imaging techniques in the depiction of normal anatomy and on infectious and inflammatory, traumatic and congenital pathology affecting the cranial nerves. A detailed discussion of individual cranial nerves lesions is beyond the scope of this article.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^115yQNeC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, this study had a retrospective design. The neuroimaging protocol was inconsistent across all subjects, with variations based on clinical presentations. Second, a selection bias may exist. The patient source primarily consisted of referrals to a tertiary hospital, potentially leading to an overrepresentation of severe underlying pathologies in our research. Due to differences in referral patterns, this might influence the prevalence of specific etiologies related to third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies, such as those resulting from trauma. Third, because all data were collected from a single center, predominantly from patients with one ethnicity, it is crucial to exercise caution when applying these findings directly to other racial or ethnic groups.

Future research should focus on uncovering additional prognostic factors for cranial nerve palsies. Exploring advanced neuroimaging and biomarkers may refine our understanding of etiological subtypes and therapies. Collaborative, multicenter studies can enhance the applicability of the findings, ultimately optimizing patient care and long-term recovery for those with cranial nerve palsies.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^114enxuZ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

One fifth of our patients with CNP VI had additional lesions of CN II (6.2%), CN V (9.5%) or CN VII (7.6%). This is easily explained by the anatomical proximity of the second and fifth cranial nerve close to the cavernous sinus and intraorbitally. 34.4% of the causes were located here. However, the percentage of causes was significantly higher at 31.3% in the brainstem and the roots and nearby meninges. The other causes were mainly systemic diseases (18.8%) such as MS, pseudotumor cerebri and myasthenia gravis. The well-known anatomical proximity of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves is the inner facial knee, which runs around the abducens nucleus. A quarter of the causes were located there. Due to the early intraosseous disappearance of CN VII, only a short anatomical proximity remains after leaving the brainstem. Therefore, 43.8% of the patients with CNP VI and VII suffered from meningitis, radiculitis, meningeosis carcinomatosa or neoplasm at the clivus.

A limitation of our study is the obvious referral bias, due to a patient population which is specific to an emergency room which is devoted to neurological patients. For example, the etiologies of OMNP in an ophthalmologic clinic may differ from neurological departments. Furthermore, in our study, due to the retrospectively collected data, a follow-up analysis was only possible in an insufficient number of patients, which is why we excluded these data from the study. Therefore, in individual cases it may be possible that patients who were initially classified as idiopathic or diabetogenic, might be reclassified a few months later. Data regarding individual symptoms (such as pathological corneal reflex) were often not complete and are not presented in this paper.

### The link between idiopathic intracranial hypertension, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: exploration of a shared pathophysiology [^114FRVmK]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The trigeminal nerve (V)

The motor fibers of the fifth cranial nerve supply the masticatory muscles. Irritation of these fibers may produce hypertonia of the masticatory muscles, bruxism, temporo-mandibular disorders, and masticatory pain. The sensory fibers supply the facial dermatomes. Irritation of these fibers may produce facial pain. In patients with IICH, there have been reports of trigeminal hypersensitivity or neuralgia of the trigeminal dermatome. Electrophysiologic studies have indicated trigeminal nerve involvement, and the symptoms were reversed following lumbar puncture.

Hypertonia of the masticatory muscles and facial pain are commonly reported in patients with FM and CFS.

Additionally, small fiber scarcity has been detected in women suffering from FM by measuring corneal nerve fiber thickness with a confocal microscope. In these patients, nerve scarcity was associated with neuropathic pain descriptors. Small fiber neuropathy in the cornea may be the consequence of damage to the sensory afferents in the trigeminal nerves.

The facial nerve (VII)

The motor fibers of the facial nerve innervate the muscles of the face. In IICH, several cases of facial weakness or facial palsy due to nerve fiber compression have been reported. The facial nerve supplies the autonomic function of the salivary and the lacrimal glands. A few cases of Sicca syndromewere reported in patients with IICH. According to this hypothesis, this may be due to the compression of the autonomic fibers running toward the salivary and lacrimal glands.

To the best of our knowledge, facial nerve weakness has not been reported in patients with FM or in CFS. However, in patients with FM and those with CSF, the symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth are highly prevalent.

Additionally, in cases of severe dry eyes, the sensory trigeminal nerve fibers supplying the conjunctiva and the cornea may also be involved. Severe dry eye is a condition that is shared by patients with FM and those with CFS. It has been suggested that severe dry eyes are the consequence of a corneal somatosensory dysfunction, and evidence suggests that in some patients, the symptom of severe dry eyes may actually be neuropathic ocular pain.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist, Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. Bell's palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell's palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell's palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell's palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell's palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell's palsy. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell's palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options: (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations: (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell's palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell's palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

### Ophthalmoplegic "migraine" or recurrent ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy: new cases and a systematic review [^112Fn8d1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Ophthalmoplegic migraine is a poorly understood neurologic syndrome characterized by recurrent bouts of head pain and ophthalmoplegia. By reviewing cases presenting to our centers in whom the phenotype has been carefully dissected, and systematically reviewing all published cases of ophthalmoplegic migraine in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) era, this review sets out to clearly define the syndrome and discuss possible etiologies. We found that in up to one-third of patients, the headache was not migrainous or associated with migrainous symptoms. In three-quarters of the cases involving the third nerve, there was focal nerve thickening and contrast enhancement on MRI. Observational data suggest systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial acutely. The etiology remains unclear, but may involve recurrent bouts of demyelination of the oculomotor nerve. "Ophthalmoplegic migraine" is a misnomer in that it is probably not a variant of migraine but rather a recurrent cranial neuralgia. A more appropriate name might be "ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy".

### Third cranial nerve palsy? Look for a sicca syndrome [^112VJGUG]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder, and neurological involvement may frequently occur. Here we describe a 79-year-old woman who came to our attention for a sudden right incomplete 3rd cranial nerve palsy. Following extensive investigations, a diagnosis of primary SS was reached, and the patient recovered after treatment with ev Ig and steroids. Therefore, we suggest that SS should be considered in apparently idiopathic 3rd cranial nerve palsies, since, with the appropriate treatment, they might be transient and reversible.

### Microvascular decompression in patient with atypical features of hemifacial spasm secondary to compression by a tortuous vertebrobasilar system: case report [^111LrEnG]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We report a case of hemifacial spasm in a patient who had associated hearing loss, numbness throughout the face, tinnitus, and vertigo, all of which occurred when turning his head to the left. To our knowledge, these symptoms have not occurred in this pattern and with a single trigger.

Clinical Presentation

A 45-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of right-sided hemifacial spasm initially treated with botulinum toxin. One month before presentation, he had an episode of acute hearing loss in the right ear when turning his head to the left, followed by multiple episodes of transient hearing loss in his right ear, numbness in his right face in all distributions of the trigeminal nerve, tinnitus, and vertigo. He was found to have decreased sensation in nerves V1 to V3 and House-Brackmann grade 3/6 weakness in his right face, despite not having botulinum toxin injections in more than a year. Magnetic resonance imaging/angiography showed an ectatic vertebrobasilar system causing compression of the fifth, seventh, and eighth cranial nerves.

Intervention

The patient underwent a retromastoid craniotomy and microvascular decompression. Postoperatively, he had complete resolution of his symptoms except for his facial weakness. The benefit has been long-lasting.

Conclusion

Multiple, simultaneous cranial neuropathies from vascular compression are rare, but this case is an example of safe and effective treatment with microvascular decompression with durable results.

### Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy [^116qFQZM]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Trigeminal neuropathies are a group of clinical disorders that involve injury to primary first-order neurons within the trigeminal nerve. We review the spectrum of etiologies underlying both painful and non-painful trigeminal neuropathies, with attention to particularly dangerous processes that may elude the clinician in the absence of a meticulous evaluation. Complications and management issues specific to patients with trigeminal neuropathy are discussed.

Methods

Retrospective literature review.

Results

Facial or intraoral numbness, the hallmark of trigeminal neuropathy, may represent the earliest symptomology of malignancy or autoimmune connective tissue disease as sensory neurons are destroyed. Such numbness, especially if progressive, necessitates periodic evaluation and vigilance even years after presentation if no diagnosis can be made.

Conclusions

In the routine evaluation of patients with facial pain, the clinician will inevitably be confronted with secondary pathology of the trigeminal nerves and nuclei. The appearance of numbness, even when pain continues to be the most pressing complaint, necessitates clinical assessment of the integrity of all aspects of the trigeminal pathways, which may also include neurophysiologic, radiographic, and laboratory evaluation.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^1171xoQU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Many reasons support the association between a short onset of presentation and good prognosis. First, it may reflect the cause of abrupt changes in nerve function, such as inflammation, ischemia, or infection, which can be reversible or treatable. Second, early onset may reflect early detection and subsequent intervention, leading to significant improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. Third, early intervention may improve neural plasticity, which offers a better chance of function regeneration and restoration. Fourth, a short onset may lower the risk of complications arising from chronic or long-standing conditions, such as muscle contracture. Finally, patients with recent onset may be more motivated to adhere to treatment plans and follow-up appointments, resulting in a positive influence on prognosis. In this study, early onset before 7 days was significantly associated with good recovery (odds ratio 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.89). Urgent visits and prompt treatment of these conditions may affect the excellent recovery rate.

For various reasons, involvement of multiple cranial nerves can result in poor outcomes. At first, multiple cranial nerve palsy resulted from a wide range of complicated etiologies, such as systemic diseases, autoimmunity, infection, or tumor. The complexity of addressing these underlying conditions can make management challenging and influence prognosis. Second, multiple cranial nerve palsies often signify more extensive nerve damage or a lesion affecting multiple nerve pathways. The extent of neurologic involvement can lead to more profound and lasting deficits. Finally, the simultaneous involvement of multiple cranial nerves may reduce the likelihood of complete recovery, especially if the underlying cause is severe or not readily treatable. Our study indicated that isolated cranial nerve involvement led to good outcomes (odds ratio 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–5.39). Extensive etiologies might require complicated treatment, affecting unfavorable clinical outcomes.

### High prevalence of small-fiber neuropathy in patients with tarlov cysts: toward a more comprehensive clinical understanding [^112Ejm3J]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Cranial Nerve Involvement

Some of the symptoms of PTCs may be attributed to cranial nerve involvement. The perineural spaces of cranial nerves, including the olfactory, optic, trigeminal, and auditory nerves, involve multiple lymphatic pathways of CSF drainage toward the lymph nodes. When ICP is chronically elevated, CSF is forced into the cranial nerve root sheaths, which may compromise the blood supply or cause mechanical pressure on the axons during their intracranial course. Increases in optic nerve sheath diameter, tortuosity, and papilledema are notable examples of this phenomenon. Although less visible on MRI than optic nerves, other cranial nerves are likely affected by the forced entry of CSF into their nerve root sheaths. Symptoms associated with cranial nerve involvement have been described in IICH patients and are prevalent in PTCs. These symptoms include a decreased sense of smell (olfactory nerves), diplopia (oculomotor nerve), facial pain and paresthesia (trigeminal nerve), sensorineural hearing loss (vestibulocochlear nerves), and swallowing difficulties, all of which have been reported by our PTCS at significant rates (Table 2).

The high incidences of bruxism or clenching (67%) and hypertonia or pain in the trapezius muscles (71%) are also notable in PTCs. Both symptoms have been reported in IICH patients, as well as in patients with other chronic pain conditions and CFS. According to our hypothesis, increased CSFP may lead to hyperexcitability of the trigeminal nerve, affecting the muscles involved in mastication, and the accessory nerve, impacting the upper trapezius muscle, potentially causing these symptoms.

### A review of ocular manifestations in intracranial hypotension [^111BA7jT]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Object

Intracranial hypotension (ICH) can present with a wide variety of visual symptoms and findings. Deficits in visual acuity and visual fields as well as ophthalmoplegia due to cranial nerve dysfunction have been frequently described. The aim of this review was to identify the most commonly reported ocular manifestations associated with ICH.

Methods

The authors conducted a review of the literature to date to identify all studies of patients with ICH and ocular manifestations.

Results

The most commonly encountered cranial nerve deficit resulting from ICH (> 80% of reported cases) is an abducens nerve paresis, which may occur unilaterally or bilaterally. Although less common, oculomotor and trochlear nerve palsies have been reported as well. The optic nerve complex is frequently involved in ICH and may manifest as deficits in visual acuity and field cuts. Visual deficits and ophthalmoplegia improved following appropriate management in 97% of reported cases.

Conclusions

Intracranial hypotension can present with a wide spectrum of visual deficits, the causes of which are multifactorial. Cranial nerve paresis, especially of the abducens nerve, is frequently reported. The majority of symptoms and cranial nerve deficits reviewed respond favorably to conservative management, epidural blood patch administration, or in a minority of cases, surgical intervention.

### Clinical features and natural history of acquired third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy [^116y6fYZ]. Eye (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Clinical features of acquired third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy showed variation among previous studies. Evaluation of natural course with objective criteria will establish accurate recovery rates and important factors for recovery.

Methods

Retrospective chart review was performed on 206 patients who visited a neuro-ophthalmic department with acquired third, fourth, and sixth nerve palsy. Aetiology and results of ocular exam on each visit were reviewed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent factors affecting recovery.

Results

The sixth cranial nerve was affected most frequently (n = 108, 52.4%) and vascular disease (n = 64, 31.1%) was the most common aetiology. Recovery was evaluated with change of deviation angle for 108 patients, who were first examined within a month of onset and followed up for at least 6 months. Ninety-two (85.2%) patients showed overall (at least partial) recovery and 73 (67.6%) showed complete recovery. In univariate analysis, initial deviation angle was found to be only significant factor associated with complete recovery (P = 0.007) and most patients who experienced successful management of treatable underlying disease showed recovery.

Conclusions

With objective criteria based on deviation angle, overall recovery rate from the third, fourth, and sixth nerve palsy was 85.2%. Patients who had smaller initial eyeball deviation or successful management of treatable underlying disease had a high chance of recovery.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^114ZHzfL]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Abducens palsy (6th nerve palsy) in adults — presentation, causes, and natural history: It typically presents with an acute onset of horizontal double vision, worse at distance than at near and worse laterally toward the side of the affected nerve. The majority of acute 6th nerve palsies in the adult population are vasculopathic, associated with risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, and most palsies resolve after 6 months, with about one-third resolving within 8 weeks; if no recovery is apparent by 6 months, approximately 40% of patients demonstrate a serious underlying pathology warranting further evaluation. Other common causes are trauma and neoplasm; traumatic etiology may include a basilar skull fracture or an acute rise in intracranial pressure from an intracranial bleed, and a 6th nerve palsy caused by an intracranial neoplasm may be either insidious or acute. Postviral 6th nerve palsy is typically a diagnosis of exclusion and has been described with COVID-19 infection and post COVID-19 vaccination.

What is the management for musculoskeletal manifestations of SSc?

Musculoskeletal involvement includes tendinopathy, joint contractures and, in some cases, overlap arthritis.

Recommendation for musculoskeletal manifestations in SSc:

Musculoskeletal manifestations of SSc may benefit from immunomodulatory treatments given for other complications, such as skin disease (1C, 95%).
When arthritis or myositis (or non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain) is more severe, generally in the context of an overlap SSc syndrome, management is in line with similar clinical conditions occurring outside the context of SSc (1C, 93%).

Calcinosis in SSc

What is the management for calcinosis in SSc?

There is a very limited evidence base to guide clinicians on the management of calcinosis in patients with SSc, but practical approaches are considered important to mitigate impact. This is a key area for the research agenda (see full guideline).

Recommendation for management of calcinosis in SSc:

Superadded infection of calcinosis should be recognized early and treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy (1C, 99%).
Surgical intervention should be considered in severe, refractory calcinosis, which is severely impacting upon functional ability and quality of life (1C, 95%).

Fatigue, and quality of life

What are the best interventions for general impact of SSc on health status and quality of life, including fatigue?

Recommendation for fatigue and quality of life in SSc:

Consider the impact of diagnosis and disease on health-related quality of life in all people with SSc (2C, 99%).
Physical and occupational therapy are recommended for the management of musculoskeletal impairment in SSc to improve function and may have a role in improving quality of life, pain and fatigue (2C, 99%).

Neurological complications

What is the best management for neurological complications of SSc?

A range of neurological complications of SSc have been reported. Cranial nerve involvement is well recognized and includes trigeminal neuropathy as well as trigeminal neuralgia.

Recommendation for neurological complications in SSc:

Neurological complications of SSc require multi-speciality management with careful exclusion of other relevant causes (1C, 97%).
Peripheral nerve abnormalities occur in SSc including CTS, peripheral neuropathy and cranial nerve dysfunction that can be neuralgia or neuropathy, most often affecting the trigeminal nerve (1C, 97%).
Peripheral sensory neuropathy of the feet is common and disabling in adults with SSc and investigation should be prompted by clinical suspicion (2C, 93%).

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: a review [^116En9mK]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy is the most common condition involving a rapid and unilateral onset of peripheral paresis/paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. It affects 11.5–53.3 per 100,000 individuals a year across different populations. Bell's palsy is a health issue causing concern and has an extremely negative effect on both patients and their families. Therefore, diagnosis and prompt cause determination are key for early treatment. However, the etiology of Bell's palsy is unclear, and this affects its treatment. Thus, it is critical to determine the causes of Bell's palsy so that targeted treatment approaches can be developed and employed. This article reviews the literature on the diagnosis of Bell's palsy and examines possible etiologies of the disorder. It also suggests that the diagnosis of idiopathic facial palsy is based on exclusion and is most often made based on five factors including anatomical structure, viral infection, ischemia, inflammation, and cold stimulation responsivity.

Abstract

The coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several ophthalmic manifestations have been reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including conjunctivitis, acute sixth nerve palsy, and multiple cranial neuropathies. We present a unique case of unilateral phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis in a 5-year-old boy in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### John hilton (1805–1878) [^1166P86q]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hilton's anatomical observations, combined with surgical cases, led him to formulate many original, pioneering insights into anatomy, surgery and neurology.

He was the first to describe the pain resulting from compression or inflammation of nerve roots manifested by pains radiating to distant places. He described lesions in different sections of the spine that caused pain radiating to the lower limb, lower abdomen, area between the shoulder blades or chest. He also described various pathologies of the cranial nerves resulting in pain or dysfunction in the head and neck. As a result of his research on the damage of facial nerves and Gasserian ganglion, he described several interesting neurological tongue symptoms and unilateral mandibular tooth decay.

Hilton also conducted observations of diseases caused by pathological nerve compression. He claimed that if the pain in a given area is not accompanied by inflammation symptoms, it means that its cause is located in a completely different place.

He was the first to describe the compression of the first rib on brachial plexus causing damage to the ulnar nerve and gangrene of the fourth and fifth finger. Currently, the symptoms are part of the thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).

Hilton described the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid and proved that hydrocephalus can occur after the fourth ventricle has closed. He described neurological symptoms in children with hydrocephalus and the positive effects of anterior fontanelle puncture. He proved that all symptoms observed in these children are associated with the dysfunction of various centres in the brain and resolve after normalisation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The study suggested the possibility of future treatment of hydrocephalus through mechanical decompression. He also proved that there is a connection between the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord and the brain and the free movement of fluid between these spaces. He also described mental changes of depressive neurosis type in mentally fatigued patients. This was one of the first such observations at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry.

### Other facial neuralgias [^115EujfH]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Premise In this article we review some lesser known cranial neuralgias that are distinct from trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or trigeminal neuropathies. Included are occipital neuralgia, superior laryngeal neuralgia, auriculotemporal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal and nervus intermedius neuralgia, and pain from acute herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia of the trigeminal and intermedius nerves. Problem Facial neuralgias are rare and many physicians do not see such cases in their lifetime, so patients with a suspected diagnosis within this group should be referred to a specialized center where multidisciplinary team diagnosis may be available. Potential solution Each facial neuralgia can be identified on the basis of clinical presentation, allowing for precision diagnosis and planning of treatment. Treatment remains conservative with oral or topical medication recommended for neuropathic pain to be tried before more invasive procedures are undertaken. However, evidence for efficacy of current treatments remains weak.

### Extraocular cranial nerve palsies in children [^114zXHu6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Visual disturbances resulting from acute nerve paralysis of the muscles controlling eye movements can be challenging to evaluate in the pediatric population. Children may not be capable of describing symptoms or providing an adequate history. Therefore, it is important to have an understanding of the anatomical course of the extraocular cranial nerves and clinical manifestations of their dysfunction. We report 2 cases of extraocular cranial nerve palsies and, in addition to an anatomical review, discuss the common etiologies of paralysis and the importance of ophthalmological and neurological follow-up to ensure optimal long-term visual function.

### AAN and EFNS guideline on diagnosing and treating… [^117QvaSD]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is defined as sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain in one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The annual incidence of trigeminal neuralgia is four to five cases per 100, 000 persons. The International Headache Society has classified trigeminal neuralgia into two categories: classic and symptomatic. Classic trigeminal neuralgia has no established etiology, although it may include potential vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve. The diagnosis of classic trigeminal neuralgia requires the absence of any clinically evident neurologic deficit, whereas the diagnosis of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia requires the identification of a structural abnormality other than vascular compression. Possible abnormalities include multiple sclerosis plaques, tumors, and abnormalities of the skull base.

Which clinical or laboratory features accurately identify patients with symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. To distinguish symptomatic from classic trigeminal neuralgia, clinical characteristics such as patient age at onset, the presence of sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and unresponsiveness to treatment were examined. A younger age at onset and abnormal trigeminal nerve–evoked potentials are probably associated with an increased risk of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. However, there is too much overlap in patients with classic trigeminal neuralgia and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia to consider these clinical characteristics diagnostic for the latter. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves likely indicates symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia.

However, because of poor specificity, the absence of these features does not rule out symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. The involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and an unresponsiveness to treatment are not considered useful features for identifying patients with an increased risk of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. Putting the Evidence into Context The initial diagnostic evaluation of patients with trigeminal neuralgia focuses on clinical characteristics known to identify patients with the symptomatic variety. If the physician suspects symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia, more testing should be performed. Trigeminal reflex testing or MRI is a reasonable next step. However, given the relatively high diagnostic accuracy of abnormal trigeminal reflexes, MRI is probably unnecessary in the presence of normal trigeminal reflexes.

### Vestibular paroxysmia: a systematic review [^117Q7hzM]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological Mechanisms

In 1975, Jannetta and colleagues were the first to describe the pathophysiology of VP as a "neurovascular cross-compression in patients with hyperactive dysfunction symptoms of the eighth cranial nerve". 1 In analogy to the brief recurrent symptoms in trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, or myokymia of the superior oblique muscle, it is assumed that the short attacks of vertigo are caused by compression of the vestibular nerve. Pathophysiologically, a compression can cause partial demyelination of axons, which can lead to ephaptic discharges, i.e. pathological paroxysmal inter-axonal transmissions between neighboring axons which can be further triggered by the pulsations of the artery and by change of sensory input during head movements. The hypothesis of excitation of the vestibular nerve is supported (i) by cases in which a patient becomes free of symptoms by surgical decompression, (ii) by nystagmus due to hyperexcitability during an attack, (iii) by a transition of nystagmus caused by hypo- and hyperexcitability and (iv) by evidence for hyperexcitability and vestibular deficits found even between the attacks (Fig. 3). A 7 Tesla MRI in six patients with VP confirmed neurovascular cross-compression but did not detect structural abnormalities in these patients.

### Facial pain [^1158FBRs]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

There are various cranial nerve lesions that cause complex presentations of headache and facial pain, including trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and other rarer syndromes. Each present with their distinct patterns and diagnosis is reliant on a thorough history and physical examination. Diagnostic workup often involves neuroimaging modalities to rule out more common diseases. Treatment is aimed at symptomatic management, with conservative and pharmacologic therapies (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants) as primary treatment. Advanced procedures and surgical intervention are typically reserved for refractory cases.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on postdural puncture headache: a consensus report from a multisociety international working group [^113FPrZA]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cranial nerve complications and hearing outcomes after PDPH — associations and persistence: PDPH has been associated with acute and chronic abducens (cranial nerve VI) and facial (cranial nerve VII) palsies as well as auditory impairment (cranial nerve VIII). In a 2022 cohort study, patients who suffered unintentional dural puncture were more likely to report chronic hearing loss at least 6 months after. With the length of hospital stay decreasing, symptoms resulting from dural puncture may develop after discharge, and it is therefore important that information on postpartum headaches, such as that provided by the OAA, is provided for patients following neuraxial procedures and LP.

### Trigeminal neuralgia… [^114tMmyJ]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. The diagnosis is made using the history alone, based on characteristic features of the pain. Pain occurs in paroxysms, which can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks per day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but tend to get shorter over time. The condition can impair activities of daily living and lead to depression. The annual incidence in the United Kingdom has been reported to be 26. 8 per 100,
000. However, studies in other countries with stricter definitions, such as the United States and the Netherlands, have reported much lower incidence rates ranging between 5. 9 and
12. 6 per 100, 000.

Definition Trigeminal neuralgia is a characteristic pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. The diagnosis is made on the history alone, based on characteristic features of the pain. It occurs in paroxysms, with each lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of paroxysms is highly variable, ranging from hundreds of attacks per day to long periods of remission that can last years. Between paroxysms, the person is asymptomatic. The pain is severe and described as intense, sharp, superficial, stabbing, or shooting, often like an electric shock. It can be triggered by light touch in any area innervated by the trigeminal nerve, including from eating, talking, washing the face, or brushing the teeth. The condition can impair activities of daily living and lead to depression. In some persons, there remains a background pain of lower intensity for 50% of the time.

This has been termed atypical trigeminal neuralgia or type 2 trigeminal neuralgia. The International Classification for Headache Disorders refers to this condition as trigeminal neuralgia with concomitant pain. Other causes of facial pain may need to be excluded. In trigeminal neuralgia, the neurologic examination is usually normal but sensory and autonomic symptoms may be reported, and persons with longer histories may demonstrate subtle sensory loss on careful examination.

### Herpes zoster ophthalmicus [^116StGgQ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) occurs when latent varicella zoster virus reactivates in the ophthalmic division of the fifth cranial nerve (CNV1). HZO commonly affects older and immunocompromised patients. This disease is considered an ophthalmic emergency due to the wide range of associated ocular symptoms, including severe chronic pain and vision loss. HZO is typically a clinical diagnosis due to its classic presentation of a unilateral vesicular eruption in the dermatomes corresponding to CNV1. Timely treatment is imperative to minimize ocular morbidity in HZO, given that ocular involvement is present in 50% of affected patients.

### End-organ radiographic manifestations of cranial neuropathies: a concise review [^113mkkmr]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cranial neuropathies are a spectrum of disorders associated with dysfunction of one or more of the twelve cranial nerves and the subsequent anatomic structures they innervate.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review radiographic imaging findings of end-organ aberrations secondary to cranial neuropathies.

Method

All articles related to cranial neuropathies were retrieved through the PubMed MEDLINE NCBI database from January 1, 1991 to August 31, 2014. These manuscripts were analyzed for their relation to cranial nerve end-organ disease pathogenesis and radiographic imaging.

Results

The present review reveals detectable end-organ changes on CT and/or MRI for the following cranial nerves: olfactory nerve, optic nerve, oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve, trigeminal nerve, abducens nerve, facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, vagus nerve, accessory nerve, and hypoglossal nerve.

Conclusion

Radiographic imaging can assist in the detailed evaluation of end-organ involvement, often revealing a corresponding cranial nerve injury with high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. A thorough understanding of the distal manifestations of cranial nerve disease can optimize early pathologic detection as well as dictate further clinical management.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^116xkzCL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cranial nerves 3, 4, and 6 supply extraocular muscle movement. Their pathology affects both the motor and autonomic nervous systems. In an analysis of existing research on the long-term outcomes of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy, we found a diverse landscape of research findings.

Our data corroborates those of previous studies, indicating that abducens nerve palsy is the most frequently encountered among the three nerves, whereas trochlear nerve palsy exhibits a lower prevalence. However, recently reported incidence rates in the Korean population present a different perspective, with trochlear nerve palsy being the most common and oculomotor nerve palsy the least common. These regional disparities underscore the significance of geographic factors in the distribution of cranial nerve palsies and emphasize the need for clinical evaluations and research to consider such variations.

We conducted a literature review on the etiologies of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsy, categorized according to the most extensive literature reviews of 4278 subjects from the previous study(Table 4). The etiologies varied across the studies for many reasons. First, the evolution in investigation lessens the undetermined etiology. Second, studies in different regions may reflect other disease distributions. Finally, even at the same institution, different data collection times led to various etiologies, implying an actual change.

Table 4
Compared Etiologies of Isolated Third, Fourth, and Sixth Cranial Nerve Palsy (%)

Our data showed that the overall recovery rate was 38.5%, which is comparable with previous reports (range, 38–80%). The recovery rate varied across studies due to data collection methods. Moreover, the rate depended on the criteria used for recovery measurement. Some studies used follow-up letters or telephone calls to collect data, which might not accurately reflect total recovery. In our research, ophthalmologists evaluated all patients, asked for symptoms, and measured ocular deviation at every visit, which might have resulted in excellent reliability regarding accurate recovery.

### A cluster of acute flaccid paralysis and cranial nerve dysfunction temporally associated with an outbreak of enterovirus D68 in children in Colorado, USA [^112DUbJn]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Clusters of acute flaccid paralysis or cranial nerve dysfunction in children are uncommon. We aimed to assess a cluster of children with acute flaccid paralysis and cranial nerve dysfunction geographically and temporally associated with an outbreak of enterovirus-D68 respiratory disease.

Methods

We defined a case of neurological disease as any child admitted to Children's Hospital Colorado (Aurora, CO, USA) with acute flaccid paralysis with spinal-cord lesions involving mainly grey matter on imaging, or acute cranial nerve dysfunction with brainstem lesions on imaging, who had onset of neurological symptoms between Aug 1, 2014, and Oct 31, 2014. We used Poisson regression to assess whether the numbers of cases during the outbreak period were significantly greater than baseline case numbers from a historical control period (July 31, 2010, to July 31, 2014).

Findings

12 children met the case definition (median age 11.5 years [IQR 6.75–15]). All had a prodromal febrile illness preceding neurological symptoms by a median of 7 days (IQR 5.75–8). Neurological deficits included flaccid limb weakness (n = 10; asymmetric n = 7), bulbar weakness (n = 6), and cranial nerve VI (n = 3) and VII (n = 2) dysfunction. Ten (83%) children had confluent, longitudinally extensive spinal-cord lesions of the central grey matter, with predominant anterior horn-cell involvement, and nine (75%) children had brainstem lesions. Ten (91%) of 11 children had cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Nasopharyngeal specimens from eight (73%) of 11 children were positive for rhinovirus or enterovirus. Viruses from five (45%) of 11 children were typed as enterovirus D68. Enterovirus PCR of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and rectal swabs, and tests for other causes, were negative. Improvement of cranial nerve dysfunction has been noted in three (30%) of ten children. All ten children with limb weakness have residual deficits.

Interpretation

We report the first geographically and temporally defined cluster of acute flaccid paralysis and cranial nerve dysfunction in children associated with an outbreak of enterovirus-D68 respiratory illness. Our findings suggest the possibility of an association between enterovirus D68 and neurological disease in children. If enterovirus-D68 infections continue to happen in an endemic or epidemic pattern, development of effective antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies and vaccines should become scientific priorities.

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^112zDRFT]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia and painful trigeminal neuropathy are severely painful conditions affecting the trigeminal nerve, the fifth cranial nerve. The severity of localized acute pain may be a predictor of transition to chronic, widespread pain. Anticonvulsants and antidepressants are used as a first-line treatment, but greater than 40% of patients do not respond. Often, other approaches, including trigeminal nerve injections or blocks, or nerve ablation, are necessary to manage the debilitating pain that affects quality of life; however, these too may not be effective.

Nerve blocks, which may also be referred to as nerve injections, consist of local anesthetics, sometimes with adjuncts, delivered directly onto the trigeminal nerve or its branches, and may relieve pain anywhere from 2 weeks to 14 months, and have therapeutic benefits for patients who are refractory to oral medications. Improvements to the trigeminal nerve block in pain relief intensity or duration would be of benefit, and repurposing of existing drugs could potentially address this need.

The alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRA2) is a G protein-coupled receptor expressed on peripheral and central presynaptic terminals, which has been identified as a promising target for analgesia in humans. ADRA2 activation with selective and potent agonists, such as guanfacine, can lead to the inhibition of calcium influx and neurotransmitter release through inhibitory G protein activity.

We hypothesized that adding guanfacine to routine care nerve blocks would provide better pain relief in trigeminal neuralgia than routine care alone. To test this hypothesis, we performed a proof-of-concept, phase II crossover study for patients with trigeminal neuralgia and painful trigeminal neuropathy. Patients were randomized to receive a routine care injection (lidocaine alone) or routine care plus guanfacine for a trigeminal nerve block.

### Unruptured large and giant carotid artery aneurysms presenting with cranial nerve palsy: comparison of clinical recovery after selective aneurysm coiling and therapeutic carotid artery occlusion [^113yJSkv]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms may present with cranial nerve dysfunction. Therapeutic ICA occlusion, when tolerated, is an effective treatment resulting in improvement or cure of symptoms in most patients. When ICA occlusion is not tolerated, selective endovascular aneurysm occlusion can be considered. We compare recovery of cranial nerve dysfunction in patients treated with selective coil occlusion and with therapeutic ICA occlusion.

Materials and Methods

In 16 patients with 17 large or giant (11–45 mm) unruptured ICA aneurysms presenting with dysfunction of cranial nerves (CN) II, III, IV, or VI, selective coil occlusion was performed. From a cohort of 39 patients with ICA aneurysms treated with ICA occlusion and long-term follow-up, we selected 31 patients with aneurysms presenting with cranial nerve dysfunction. Clinical recovery at follow-up from oculomotor dysfunction and visual symptoms was compared for both treatment modalities.

Results

Of 17 aneurysms treated with selective coiling, symptoms of cranial nerve dysfunction resolved in 3, improved in 10, and remained unchanged in 4. In 9 of 17 patients, additional coiling during follow-up was required. Of 31 aneurysms treated with carotid artery occlusion, cranial nerve dysfunction resolved in 19, improved in 9, and remained unchanged in 3. These differences were not significant. There were no complications of treatment.

Conclusion

Recovery of ICA aneurysm-induced cranial nerve dysfunction occurs in most patients, both after ICA occlusion and after selective coiling. In patients who cannot tolerate ICA occlusion, selective aneurysmal occlusion with coils is a valuable alternative.

### Bilateral sixth nerve palsy after head trauma [^111gWavH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Gaze deficits are not uncommon after head trauma and might be caused by injury to the central nervous system, the peripheral nerve, or the motor unit. Traumatic bilateral sixth cranial nerve palsies are a rare condition and are typically associated with additional intracranial, skull, and cervical spine injuries. We describe a case of a complete bilateral sixth nerve palsy in a 44-year-old male patient with trauma with no intracranial lesion, no associated skull or cervical spine fracture, and no altered level of consciousness. The emergency physician should be aware of the differential diagnosis, initial workup, and injuries associated with a traumatic gaze deficit.
