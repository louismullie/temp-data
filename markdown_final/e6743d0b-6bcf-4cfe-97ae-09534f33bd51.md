## Question

Losing blood

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing blood loss across clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and immediate priorities. Then, I should verify the best methods for quantifying blood loss and their limitations. Next, I will assess hemodynamic instability and shock physiology. After that, I need to check for coagulopathy and metabolic derangements. Then, I will consider pharmacologic adjuncts like tranexamic acid and uterotonics. I will now examine transfusion thresholds and massive transfusion protocols. Finally, I should review source control strategies, special populations, and quality improvement elements to close the loop on safe, timely care [^1126q1Bo] [^111NLdv7] [^1143KRY9].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and immediate priorities, because management hinges on whether this is obstetric hemorrhage, trauma, perioperative bleeding, or gastrointestinal bleeding, and whether the patient is hemodynamically stable or in extremis; I need to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation are secured while simultaneously initiating hemorrhage control and calling for help, since delays worsen outcomes in major hemorrhage [^117NetK9] [^1126q1Bo] [^112eE1Dy].

> Wait, let me verify the best way to quantify blood loss, because visual estimation consistently underestimates and misclassifies severity; in obstetrics, guidelines now recommend quantitative blood loss whenever feasible, replacing visual estimates, and in the OR or trauma bay, suction canisters, weighed sponges, and standardized collection systems should be used to improve accuracy and guide decisions [^114c5Nsr] [^112PqXU4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hemodynamics; I should confirm shock physiology and the limits of isolated vital signs, since heart rate and blood pressure alone are unreliable early markers, whereas shock index (HR/SBP) and pulse pressure narrowing better stratify risk for massive transfusion and early mortality, with SI thresholds around 0.8–1.0 signaling high-risk bleeding in trauma cohorts [^114AeyGH] [^1126q1Bo].

> I need to check for coagulopathy and metabolic derangements next, because the lethal triad of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy accelerates hemorrhage; serial hemoglobin or hematocrit can help, but initial values may be normal despite significant bleeding due to compensatory hemodilution, so I should trend lactate and base deficit, and use viscoelastic testing when available to guide targeted therapy, while remembering that fibrinogen often drops early in major hemorrhage and warrants early replacement [^111KY9r3] [^116cFZZK] [^112CqVA1].

> Let me consider pharmacologic adjuncts now; tranexamic acid reduces mortality in bleeding trauma when given within 3 hours, and in obstetrics, prophylactic TXA at cesarean reduces calculated blood loss, though results after vaginal delivery are mixed and WOMAN-2 did not show benefit in anemic women, so I should align TXA use with context, timing, and patient risk profile [^115yiout] [^114u9aKe] [^111s9im7] [^115dw6Po].

> I should double-check transfusion thresholds and massive transfusion protocols; restrictive strategies are generally favored, with RBC transfusion typically indicated when hemoglobin falls below 7–8 g/dL in stable adults, but in actively bleeding patients, physiologic triggers and the clinical picture override numeric thresholds, and MTPs using balanced ratios of RBC:plasma:platelets improve outcomes when initiated early for predicted massive hemorrhage [^112DNHZ4] [^114Wvntd] [^1168SWyf].

> Next, I should review source control, because without definitive hemorrhage control, resuscitation alone will fail; this includes surgical exploration, interventional radiology embolization, pelvic stabilization for fracture-related bleeding, endoscopic hemostasis for GI sources, and uterine tamponade or compression devices for PPH, with damage control surgery or radiology reserved for physiologically deranged patients who cannot tolerate prolonged procedures [^112eE1Dy] [^114eQqes] [^116LvFyH].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant, elderly, or on beta-blockers; I need to ensure I adjust expectations because compensatory responses are blunted, so earlier intervention is warranted even when vital signs appear "stable", and in pregnancy, blood volume expansion means a greater absolute loss before hypotension, which can dangerously delay recognition and treatment [^1143KRY9].

> I will now examine quality improvement and systems elements, because outcomes improve with trained teams, standardized protocols, and early recognition; major hemorrhage protocols should be activated preemptively, staff should be trained to recognize early deterioration, and early warning scores should trigger escalation, with repeated hemoglobin or hematocrit and lactate guiding ongoing resuscitation and de-escalation decisions [^111NLdv7] [^1156DpDH] [^116cFZZK].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic approach to ensure I have not missed occult bleeding; in trauma, mechanism plus serial physiologic and laboratory trends outperform isolated parameters, and in PPH, combining lower quantitative blood loss thresholds with abnormal hemodynamics improves prognostic accuracy for severe outcomes, supporting earlier diagnosis and treatment even before 500–1000 mL is reached in some contexts [^112bzWQV].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: secure the airway and circulation, quantify blood loss objectively, assess shock physiology with SI and pulse pressure, detect coagulopathy and metabolic derangements early, deploy TXA and uterotonics when indicated, transfuse based on physiology and MTPs rather than hemoglobin alone, achieve source control without delay, adapt for special populations, and embed this within robust protocols and training to reduce morbidity and mortality from hemorrhage [^113LPj66] [^1126q1Bo] [^114c5Nsr].

Losing blood is a medical emergency that requires **immediate assessment and intervention** to prevent shock, organ failure, and death [^1126q1Bo]. The key steps are to **quantify blood loss** using objective methods (weighing, suction canisters, hemoglobin/hematocrit) [^114c5Nsr] [^112PqXU4], **monitor vital signs and shock index** (HR/SBP) [^114AeyGH], and **identify the cause** with history, exam, and targeted labs (CBC, coagulation profile, type and crossmatch) [^114iAydj] [^113LPj66]. Management focuses on **rapid hemorrhage control** (direct pressure, tourniquet, surgery, embolization) [^1126q1Bo], **hemostatic resuscitation** with balanced blood products (1:1:1 RBC:plasma:platelets) [^1168SWyf], and early tranexamic acid within 3 hours [^114u9aKe]. Transfuse RBCs for hemoglobin < 7 g/dL in stable patients, or at higher thresholds if symptomatic or actively bleeding [^112DNHZ4] [^114Wvntd]. Monitor for coagulopathy, hypothermia, and electrolyte disturbances, and escalate to massive transfusion protocols as needed [^111SZnBz] [^116LvFyH].

---

## Clinical assessment of blood loss

Accurate **assessment of blood loss** is critical for guiding management. Visual estimation is unreliable; objective methods are preferred [^112PqXU4].

- **Quantitative blood loss (QBL)**: Weighing blood-soaked materials, using suction canisters, and calculating hemoglobin/hematocrit changes provide more accurate estimates [^114c5Nsr] [^112PqXU4].

- **Shock index (SI)**: HR divided by SBP; SI ≥ 0.9–1.0 indicates significant hemorrhage and need for urgent intervention [^1126q1Bo].

- **Vital signs**: Tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status indicate significant blood loss and shock [^1126q1Bo].

---

## Physiological responses to blood loss

The body mounts compensatory responses to maintain perfusion; these can **mask severity** until late:

| **Blood loss (% of total volume)** | **Physiological response** |
|-|-|
| < 15% | - Minimal symptoms <br/> - Compensatory vasoconstriction [^1126q1Bo] |
| 15–30% | - Tachycardia <br/> - Mild hypotension <br/> - Anxiety [^1126q1Bo] |
| 30–40% | - Significant hypotension <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Altered mental status [^1126q1Bo] |
| > 40% | - Severe hypotension <br/> - Shock <br/> - Organ failure [^1126q1Bo] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured diagnostic approach is essential to **identify the cause and severity**:

- **History**: Recent trauma, surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, anticoagulant use, menstrual history, pregnancy [^114QVy2W].

- **Physical examination**: Pallor, tachycardia, hypotension, signs of external bleeding, abdominal tenderness, uterine atony [^114bm65g].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, hemoglobin/hematocrit, coagulation profile (INR, aPTT, fibrinogen), lactate, base deficit, type and crossmatch [^113LPj66].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, CT angiography, or MRI to identify internal bleeding sources [^notfound].

---

## Immediate management strategies

Rapid, coordinated management is critical to **prevent deterioration**:

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure airway patency and provide supplemental oxygen [^notfound].

- **Circulation**: Establish two large-bore IV lines, initiate rapid infusion of warmed crystalloids, and begin blood transfusion as indicated [^117NetK9].

- **Hemorrhage control**: Direct pressure, tourniquets, surgical intervention, or embolization [^notfound].

- **Massive transfusion protocol (MTP)**: Activate for anticipated massive transfusion, providing balanced ratios of RBCs, plasma, and platelets [^1168SWyf].

---

## Blood transfusion guidelines

Transfusion decisions should be guided by clinical context, hemoglobin levels, and patient tolerance to anemia [^11758etv]:

- **Stable patients**: Transfuse RBCs if hemoglobin < 7 g/dL, or < 8 g/dL in symptomatic patients or those with cardiovascular disease [^notfound].

- **Active bleeding**: Higher transfusion thresholds may be appropriate based on clinical judgment and ongoing blood loss [^112DNHZ4].

- **Balanced transfusion**: Use a 1:1:1 ratio of RBCs, plasma, and platelets in massive transfusion scenarios [^1168SWyf].

---

## Complications of significant blood loss

Significant blood loss can lead to **severe complications** if not promptly managed:

- **Hypovolemic shock**: Reduced perfusion, organ dysfunction, and death [^112eE1Dy].

- **Coagulopathy**: Dilutional and consumptive coagulopathy, requiring targeted replacement of clotting factors [^117R5nuD].

- **Acute kidney injury**: Due to renal hypoperfusion and shock [^notfound].

- **Infection**: Increased risk due to immunosuppression and transfusion-related complications [^112Mz4wJ].

---

## Preventive measures and patient education

Preventing significant blood loss involves **risk assessment**, **optimization**, and **education**:

- **Preoperative assessment**: Identify patients at risk of bleeding, optimize hemoglobin, and plan for blood conservation strategies [^111VJwid].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on recognizing signs of bleeding, medication adherence, and when to seek medical attention [^116H2ETd].

- **Institutional protocols**: Implement standardized protocols for hemorrhage control, transfusion, and massive transfusion [^111NLdv7].

Losing blood is a critical medical emergency requiring **rapid assessment, hemorrhage control, and targeted resuscitation** to prevent shock, organ failure, and death [^116WiDZA].

Intraoperative and postoperative management of blood loss — patient monitoring — includes to periodically conduct a visual assessment of the surgical field jointly with the surgeon to assess the presence of excessive microvascular (i.e., coagulopathy) or surgical bleeding, and to use standard methods for quantitative measurement of blood loss, including suction canisters, surgical sponges, and surgical drains. Monitor for perfusion of vital organs using standard ASA monitors (i.e., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, electrocardiography) in addition to observing clinical symptoms and physical exam features, and additional monitoring may include echocardiography, renal monitoring (urine output), cerebral monitoring (i.e., cerebral oximetry and NIRS), analysis of arterial blood gasses, and mixed venous oxygen saturation. If anemia is suspected, monitor hemoglobin/hematocrit values based on estimated blood loss and clinical signs, and if coagulopathy is suspected, obtain standard coagulation tests (e.g. INR, aPTT, fibrinogen concentration) or viscoelastic assays (e.g., thromboelastography [TEG] and ROTEM), if available, as well as platelet count.

*Base excess is the quantity of base (HCO₃⁻, in mEq/L) that is above or below the normal range in the body. A negative number is called a base deficit and indicates metabolic acidosis

The SI is the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure, typically ranging between 0.5 and 0.7 in healthy adults. A SI ≥ 0.9–1.0 was retrospectively associated with increased MT (25%), interventional radiology (6.2%) and operative intervention (14.7%) in bleeding trauma patients. Further retrospective studies have used different cut-offs for MT; however, each study had thresholds between SI ≥ 0.8– ≥ 1.0 with AUROCs between 0.73 and 0.89. In a prospective data collection of 1402 trauma patients, SI ≥ 0.8 was more sensitive than SI ≥ 0.9. At cut-off 0.81, SI predicted MT with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity 64%, positive prediction 16% and negative prediction 98%, with correlation to other physiological and anatomical variables; at cut-off 0.91 SI predicted MT with a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 0.87. After adjusting for age/sex, injury severity score (ISS), GCS, SI was an independent predictor for mortality and blood transfusion (OR 3.57; 3.012–4.239;). A SI ≥ 1 retrospectively outperformed the ABC score for MT and clinical hypotension for significant injury and emergent operation. Narrow PP (< 40/ < 30 mmHg) is an ATLS class II haemorrhage signal and was independently associated with transfusion, resuscitative thoracotomy and emergent surgery in a series of retrospective studies. Multivariate analysis of observational data from 957 patients confirmed a narrowed PP (< 30 mmHg) to be significantly associated with MT (OR 3.74, 95% CI 1.8–7.7) and emergent surgery.

Immediate intervention

Recommendation 6

We recommend that patients with an obvious bleeding source and those presenting with haemorrhagic shock in extremis and a suspected source of bleeding undergo an immediate bleeding control procedure (Grade 1B).

Perioperative blood management — intraoperative and postoperative patient monitoring: Periodically conduct a visual assessment of the surgical field jointly with the surgeon to assess the presence of excessive microvascular or surgical bleeding, and use standard methods for quantitative measurement of blood loss including checking suction canisters, surgical sponges, and surgical drains; monitor for perfusion of vital organs using standard ASA monitors in addition to observing clinical symptoms and physical exam features, and additional monitoring may include echocardiography, renal monitoring, cerebral monitoring, analysis of arterial blood gasses, and mixed venous oxygen saturation; if anemia is suspected, monitor hemoglobin/hematocrit values; if coagulopathy is suspected, obtain standard coagulation tests or viscoelastic assays, if available, as well as platelet count; during and after transfusion, periodically check for signs of a transfusion reaction and, if signs are apparent, immediately stop the transfusion, give supportive therapy, and initiate supportive care, and notify the blood bank of the transfusion reaction case.

### Approach to the patient with bleeding [^114iAydj]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Approach to the patient with bleeding begins with a thorough bleeding, medical, and family history to determine the nature of bleeding and severity of bleeding symptoms. Use of a Bleeding Assessment Tool allows the clinician to obtain a comprehensive bleeding history and ultimately determine the individual bleeding score that reflects bleeding severity and is classifiable as either normal or abnormal. In the absence of significant findings within patient history or presenting symptoms clearly pointing to a specific bleeding pathology, an approach to laboratory investigation is presented that proceeds through first-line, second-line, and third-line testing.

### Prognostic accuracy of clinical markers of postpartum bleeding in predicting maternal mortality or severe morbidity: a WHO individual participant data meta-analysis [^1147qrCq]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our findings challenge the exclusive use of the conventional threshold of 500 mL or more of blood loss for diagnosing postpartum haemorrhage and initiating treatment, particularly in low-resource settings, where delays are more likely to result in deaths. Additionally adopting a lower blood loss threshold in combination with abnormal haemodynamic signs could enable better preparedness, earlier recognition of women at risk of clinical deterioration, and potentially improve maternal outcomes. However, this could have substantial resource implications for health systems, including increased demands on staff training and care organisation, particularly in settings where routine monitoring of vital signs and objective blood loss measurement are not yet standard practice. On the contrary, as the key vital signs that were shown to be prognostically valuable (pulse, blood pressure, and shock index) are already core components of maternal early warning systems (eg, the Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score), integrating our findings for timelier and more effective management of women at risk of life-threatening postpartum haemorrhage is likely to be less resource-intensive in settings where such systems are already in place. It is important to note that the use of these diagnostic criteria could lead to an increase in the number of postpartum haemorrhage diagnoses, especially in settings that are simultaneously introducing objective assessment of blood loss and for caesarean births, for which the blood loss is generally greater than vaginal births. It is essential that policy makers and facility leaders do not misinterpret this increase for a decline in the quality of maternal care. In fact, the opposite is likely to be true. With prompt application of the WHO-recommended postpartum haemorrhage first-response treatment bundle, the incidence of more life-threatening blood loss (eg, ≥ 1000 mL) is expected to substantially decrease.

Although increased diagnoses of postpartum haemorrhage could lead to a higher demand for commodities and supplies necessary for first-response treatment, in many settings, this additional cost is likely to be offset by a reduction in the need for more invasive, resource-intensive treatments for severe postpartum haemorrhage complications, such as blood transfusions and admissions to intensive care units. Ultimately, the implementation of a nuanced definition of postpartum haemorrhage is anticipated to increase early detection of postpartum haemorrhage, improve quality of care, and reduce morbidity and mortality related to postpartum haemorrhage globally.

*Base excess is the quantity of base (HCO₃⁻, in mEq/L) that is above or below the normal range in the body. A negative number is called a base deficit and indicates metabolic acidosis

Original data from Mutschler et al.

Isolated vital signs, such as heart rate or systolic blood pressure, have been shown to be unreliable in the assessment of hypovolaemic shock. Heart rate alone has not been shown to predict the need for massive transfusion, in particular not in the geriatric trauma population. In contrast, the SI, defined as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure, has been advocated to better risk-stratify patients for critical bleeding, increased transfusion requirements and early mortality. Paladino and co-workers found that this index may be useful to draw attention to abnormal values, but may be too insensitive to exclude disease and should not lower the suspicion of major injury. Mutschler and co-workers have suggested a novel and clinically reliable classification of hypovolaemic shock based on four classes of worsening base deficit. The objective of this study was to correlate this classification with corresponding SI strata for the rapid assessment of trauma patients in the absence of laboratory parameters. Twenty-one thousand eight hundred fifty-three adult trauma patients were retrieved from the TraumaRegister DGU® database and divided into four strata of worsening SI at emergency department arrival (group I, SI < 0.6; group II, SI ≥ 0.6 to < 1.0; group III, SI ≥ 1.0 to < 1.4; and group IV, SI ≥ 1.4), and demographics, injury characteristics, transfusion requirements, fluid resuscitation and outcomes were assessed. Worsening of SI was associated with increasing injury severity scores (ISS) from 19.3 (± 12.0) in group I to 37.3 (± 16.8) in group IV, while mortality increased from 10.9 to 39.8%. Increments in SI paralleled increasing fluid resuscitation, vasopressor use and decreasing Hb, platelet counts and Quick values. The number of blood units transfused increased from 1.0 (± 4.8) in group I to 21.4 (± 2 6.2) in group IV patients. Of patients, 31% in group III and 57% in group IV required ≥ 10 red blood cell (RBC) units prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Another retrospective database analysis of 10,234 patients has confirmed the role of SI either upon arrival or at departure from the emergency department as a detrimental sign of poor outcome in adult trauma patients.

### Critical care in emergency department: massive haemorrhage in trauma [^116WiDZA]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Inadequate resuscitation of major haemorrhage is an important cause of avoidable death in severely injured patients. Early recognition of blood loss, control of bleeding and restoration of circulating volume are critical to the management of trauma shock, and transfusion of blood components is a key intervention. Vital signs may be inadequate to determine the need for transfusion, and resuscitation regimens targeting vital signs may be harmful in the context of uncontrolled bleeding. This article addresses current concepts in haemostatic resuscitation. Recent guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy in major trauma, and the role of component and adjuvant therapies, are considered. Finally, the potential role of thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry are discussed.

Initial assessment

Recommendation 4

We recommend that the physician clinically assess the extent of traumatic haemorrhage using a combination of patient physiology, anatomical injury pattern, mechanism of injury and the patient's response to initial resuscitation. (Grade 1C)

Rationale

While blood loss may sometimes be obvious, neither visual estimation nor physiological parameters are good guides to the degree of bleeding. The mechanism of injury represents an important screening tool with which to identify patients at risk of significant haemorrhage. For example, the American College of Surgeons defined a threshold of 6 m (20 ft) as a "critical falling height" associated with major injuries. Further critical mechanisms include high-energy deceleration impact, low-velocity versus high-velocity gunshot injuries, etc. The mechanism of injury in conjunction with injury severity and the patient's physiological presentation and response to resuscitation should further guide the decision to initiate early surgical bleeding control as outlined in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol. Table 2 summarises estimated blood loss based on initial presentation according to the ATLS classification system. The ATLS classification has been demonstrated to be a useful guide that allows the quantification of blood loss with acceptable accuracy in haemorrhagic shock. However, several groups have highlighted discrepancies associated with the weight assigned each parameter when assessing blood loss that makes it difficult to classify patients using this system. Mutschler et al. analysed the adequacy of this classification and found that more than 90% of all trauma patients could not be categorised according to the ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock. The same group analysed the validity of the ATLS classification and concluded that this system may underestimate mental disability in the presence of hypovolaemic shock and overestimate the degree of tachycardia associated with hypotension. A retrospective analysis of the validity of the ATLS classification showed that increasing blood loss produces an increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure, but to a lesser degree than suggested by the ATLS classification. In addition, there are no significant changes in respiratory rate or in level of consciousness with bleeding. Table 3 characterises the three types of response to initial fluid resuscitation, whereby the transient responders and the non-responders are candidates for immediate surgical bleeding control.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^115m8Yin]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Trauma physicians must quickly and accurately assess and predict when a massive transfusion protocol, including corresponding logistics, should be activated and terminated. While blood loss may sometimes be obvious, neither visual estimation nor physiological parameters are satisfactory guides to estimate the degree of bleeding. Knowledge about the mechanism of injury provides useful information to identify patients at risk of significant haemorrhage at an early stage. For example, the American College of Surgeons defined a threshold of 6 m (20 ft) as a "critical falling height" associated with major injuries, including haemorrhage. Further critical mechanisms include high-energy deceleration impact as well as low-velocity versus high-velocity gunshot injuries. The mechanism of injury combined with injury severity and the patient's physiological presentation should further guide the decision to initiate early surgical bleeding control as outlined in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) survey. Table 3 summarises estimated blood loss based on initial presentation according to the ATLS classification system of hypovolaemic shock. This classification has been shown to be useful as a rough estimation of sustained blood loss in patients with haemorrhagic shock. However, several groups have highlighted discrepancies associated with the weight assigned to each parameter when assessing blood loss that makes it challenging to classify patients using this system. Mutschler and co-workers have analysed the adequacy of this classification and found that > 90% of all trauma patients could not be categorised according to the ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock. The same group analysed the validity of the ATLS classification and concluded that this system may underestimate mental disability in the presence of hypovolaemic shock, while overestimating the degree of tachycardia associated with hypotension. A retrospective analysis of the validity of the ATLS classification showed that increasing blood loss produces an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure, but to a lesser degree than suggested by the ATLS classification. In addition, there are no significant changes in respiratory rate or in level of consciousness with bleeding. Other parameters used for this classification, such as pulse pressure and urinary output, may not be adequately assessed during the initial phase of care. The individual response to fluid challenge as suggested by the ATLS survey should be viewed critically in the context of low-volume resuscitation and "permissive hypotension", which is currently advocated in bleeding trauma patients.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114bm65g]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Major bleeding classification — hemodynamic instability: An increased heart rate may be the first sign of hemodynamic instability due to blood loss; thresholds that can indicate instability include a systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, a decrease in systolic blood pressure > 40 mm Hg, and orthostatic changes with systolic blood pressure drop ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure drop ≥ 10 mm Hg upon standing; continuous invasive measurement of mean arterial pressure is considered superior for assessment, with a value < 65 mm Hg serving as a cut-off, and surrogate markers such as urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h can be used; if ≥ 1 of these factors applies, the bleed is classified as major.

### Practical management of major blood loss [^116D3FLX]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of bleeding, regardless of cause, is complex and ill understood. For traumatic or sudden unexpected haemorrhage, the use of transfusion packs with red cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets being given in ratios of between 1:1 and 1:3 seems reasonable. This removes the requirement for 'wait and see tests' and should be part of an overall resuscitation and stabilisation plan that may improve outcome following sudden haemorrhage. The replacement of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate with low-volume, targeted concentrates is attractive. There is increasing evidence for the efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrates as a single agent. The combination of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates could be powerful and has the possibility to the management of bleeding and improve outcome in patients but, as yet, remains unproven.

### Major haemorrhage: past, present and future [^1143KRY9]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Major haemorrhage

Definitions of major haemorrhage (in trauma) have traditionally been variable and include: loss of more than one circulating blood volume within 24 h (around 70 ml.kg −1, approximately 5 l in a 70 kg adult); loss of 50% of total blood volume in < 3 h; or bleeding in excess of 150 ml.min −1.

Scores such as the Assessment of Blood Consumption and the shock index (heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure) are available to guide early prediction of massive transfusion but are not used routinely in clinical practice and lack high sensitivity. A recent Delphi consensus identified a pragmatic transfusion‐based definition for clinical research major haemorrhage – ≥ 4 units of any blood component transfused within 2 h of injury. The current trend is towards a more pragmatic definition based on the clinical effect of haemorrhage on the patient's physiology. Major haemorrhage can be considered to be bleeding which leads to a systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg or a heart rate of > 110 beats·min⁻¹. However, changes in physiology may be masked in certain patient groups, e.g. older patients, pregnancy and people taking beta‐blockers.

Definitions may also vary between patient populations. In obstetrics, postpartum haemorrhage has been defined as blood loss > 500 mL from the genital tract within 24 h of delivery. This can be further defined as minor (500–1000 ml) or major (> 1000 ml). Major can be divided into moderate (1000–2000 ml) or severe (> 2000 ml). In patients with upper and/or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, various risk scores have been validated to stratify severity of bleeding to guide subsequent management. Anaesthetists encounter major haemorrhage in a wide variety of situations including: the emergency department (trauma, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage); elective and emergency surgery (particularly cardiac, liver, orthopaedics and vascular); obstetrics; and critical care. The general principles of management will be similar in these situations. However, these various sources of bleeding may have varying pathophysiology and so behave in different ways.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^112PqXU4]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Perioperative blood management — monitoring for blood loss: Blood loss monitoring consists of visual assessment of the surgical field, including the extent of blood present, presence of microvascular bleeding, surgical sponges, clot size and shape, and volume in suction canister. The literature is insufficient to evaluate the impact of periodically assessing the surgical field for the extent of blood present, the presence of excessive microvascular bleeding (i.e., coagulopathy) or observing surgical sponges, clot size and shape, or the volume of blood in the suction canister to measure blood loss. Both the consultants and ASA members strongly agree regarding: (1) periodically conducting a visual assessment of the surgical field jointly with the surgeon to assess the presence of surgical or excessive microvascular (i.e., coagulopathy) bleeding and (2) use of standard methods for quantitative measurement of blood loss including checking suction canisters, surgical sponges, and surgical drains. The risk of underestimating blood loss may be reduced by adopting more precise volumetric and gravimetric measurement techniques.

11 ASSESSMENT AND RESUSCITATION

11.1 Damage control resuscitation in PPH

Hemorrhagic shock is the most frequent type of shock in obstetric patients. Blood loss exceeding 40% of total blood volume leads to global hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. These metabolic complications, accompanied by organ hypoperfusion, trigger an irreversible state of coagulopathy, bolstering hemorrhage and inducing multiple organ dysfunction and death. The concept of damage control resuscitation (DCR) was first reported by trauma surgeons and its applicability has spread in traumatic and nontraumatic scenarios in general surgery, orthopedics, and obstetrics.DCR consists of a series of strategies to minimize hemorrhage, prevent the deadly triad (coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia), and maximize tissue oxygenation. This is achieved by a staged surgical approach that minimizes operative time, counteracting life‐threatening conditions and deferring the definitive surgical procedures until normal physiology is restored at the intensive care unit (ICU).

Efforts in DCR are focused on permissive resuscitation by blood product transfusion, use of massive blood transfusion protocols, limited use of crystalloids, bleeding control (including damage control surgery [DCS] and damage control interventional radiology [DCIR]), and physiological and biochemical stabilization in the ICU.DCR is usually reserved for severely injured patients who may not survive the surgical efforts to achieve primary repair in the operating room. It is evident that this approach can be considered only in higher‐level care facilities where there is availability of experienced personnel with 24‐h laboratory and blood bank services.

The most important aspects of DCS are described below. Hypotensive and hemostatic reanimation are discussed in sections 11.2.1 and 11.2.6, respectively.

11.1.1 Decision for damage control surgery

Physiological and metabolic markers have been proposed to identify patients that could benefit from DCS. Three parameters have been described in the literature as significant clinical indicators for early implementation of DCR and DCS: acidosis (base deficit > 8), blood loss > 1500 ml, and hypothermia (temperature < 35°C). Other important parameters to consider are systolic blood pressure < 70 mm Hg, maternal blood pH < 7.1, and persistent bleeding despite several transfusions (defined as 6 units of packed red blood cells by some authorsand > 10 units by others) (Table 9).

Alternative indications for damage control surgery secondary to postpartum hemorrhage a

Continuous vital sign monitoring and serial monitoring with blood gas analysis and body temperature are recommended. Operative time and number of blood units transfused are also crucial for DCR decision‐making.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^112c59Ds]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency general surgeons often provide care to severely ill patients requiring surgical interventions and intensive support. One of the primary drivers of morbidity and mortality is perioperative bleeding. In general, when addressing life threatening haemorrhage, blood transfusion can become an essential part of overall resuscitation. However, under all circumstances, indications for blood transfusion must be accurately evaluated. When patients decline blood transfusions, regardless of the reason, surgeons should aim to provide optimal care and respect and accommodate each patient's values and target the best outcome possible given the patient's desires and his/her clinical condition. The aim of this position paper was to perform a review of the existing literature and to provide comprehensive recommendations on organizational, surgical, anaesthetic, and haemostatic strategies that can be used to provide optimal peri-operative blood management, reduce, or avoid blood transfusions and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

### Reappraising the concept of massive transfusion in trauma [^115RWS5v]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, current definitions of massive transfusion are not supported by clinical outcomes and are not useful for guiding management. Rather, mortality increases with each PRBC unit required, although not linearly. The robust prediction of massive transfusion from standard admission parameters remains difficult. The concept of massive hemorrhage may be more useful than is massive transfusion for modern trauma care. New approaches are required for the early diagnosis of patients with acute traumatic coagulopathy who are actively bleeding and will go on to require significant blood-component transfusions.

### Tranexamic acid for the prevention of blood loss after vaginal delivery [^111s9im7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study TRAAP was published by Sentilhes L and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Postpartum hemorrhage and Vaginal delivery. In the TRAAP study, the trial question was: what is the role of prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid in addition to prophylactic oxytocin in the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in females with vaginal delivery? In the TRAAP study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TRAAP study, the population was: 3891 female patients. The inclusion criteria were females in labor who had a planned vaginal delivery of a singleton live fetus at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation and were receiving prophylactic oxytocin after delivery. The key exclusion criteria were increased risk of venous or arterial thrombosis or bleeding, a history of epilepsy or seizure, or poor comprehension of oral French. In the TRAAP study, the interventions were: n = 1945 tranexamic acid (1 g dose IV over a period of 30–60 seconds during the 2 minutes after delivery) n = 1946 placebo (normal saline). In the TRAAP study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in postpartum hemorrhage of at least 500 mL (8.1% vs. 9.8%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01). In the TRAAP study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in provider-assessed clinically significant postpartum hemorrhage (7.8% vs. 10.4%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91) Significant decrease in the use of additional uterogenic agents (7.2% vs. 9.7%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92) Significant decrease in blood loss > 500 mL in the collector bag (6.6% vs. 8.8%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.94). In the TRAAP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events at 3 months. significant difference in non-severe frequency of vomiting or nausea in the delivery room (7.0% vs. 3.2%). In the TRAAP study, the conclusion was: in females in labor who had a planned vaginal delivery of a singleton live fetus at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation and were receiving prophylactic oxytocin after delivery, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to postpartum hemorrhage of at least 500 ml.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^111e8Xjj]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Transfusion threshold in asymptomatic postoperative hip fracture patients — a blood transfusion threshold of no higher than 8g/dl is suggested in asymptomatic postoperative hip fracture patients, with Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. The Carson (2011) FOCUS trial is the largest (n = 2016) and showed that a restrictive transfusion threshold of hemoglobin 8g/dl resulted in no significant difference in primary or secondary outcomes at 30- or 60-days; Gregersen's (2015) study comparing 9.7g/dl vs. 11.3 g/dl also showed no significant difference in most outcomes. In these studies, blood was transfused 1 unit at a time and the patient reassessed for presence of symptoms or signs after each transfusion. Implementation is likely to result in lower transfusion associated complications and cost, but cognitively impaired patients may not report symptoms and warrant special attention. Confirmatory studies by other authors would strengthen evidence.

The problem is called postoperative bleeding rather than postoperative hemorrhage to emphasize the fact that perfect postoperative hemostasis rather than acceptable postoperative blood loss is the ideal. Postoperative bleeding is a risk of all surgical procedures. The best way to reduce the risk of hemorrhage is to identify and correct potential causes of coagulopathy both pre- and post-operatively.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^112DNHZ4]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Recommendation 16

We suggest a target systolic blood pressure of 80 to 100 mm Hg until major bleeding has been stopped in the initial phase following trauma without brain injury (grade 2C).

Rationale

To maintain tissue oxygenation, traditional treatment of trauma patients uses early and aggressive fluid administration to restore blood volume. However, this approach may increase the hydrostatic pressure on the wound and cause a dislodgement of blood clots, a dilution of coagulation factors, and undesirable cooling of the patient. The concept of low-volume fluid resuscitation, so-called 'permissive hypotension', avoids the adverse effects of early aggressive resuscitation while maintaining a level of tissue perfusion that, although lower than normal, is adequate for short periods. Its general effectiveness remains to be confirmed in randomised clinical trials, but studies have demonstrated increased survival when a low-volume fluid resuscitation concept was used in penetrating trauma. In contrast, no significant difference was found in patients with blunt trauma. One study concluded that mortality was higher after on-site resuscitation compared with in-hospital resuscitation. It seems that greater increases in blood pressure are tolerated without exacerbating haemorrhage when they are achieved gradually and with a significant delay following the initial injury. All the same, a recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials for or against early or larger volumes of intravenous fluids in uncontrolled haemorrhage. The low-volume approach is contraindicated in traumatic brain injury and spinal injuries because an adequate perfusion pressure is crucial to ensure tissue oxygenation of the injured central nervous system. In addition, the concept of permissive hypotension should be considered carefully in the elderly patient and may be contraindicated if the patient suffers from chronic arterial hypertension.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion enables the maintenance of oxygen transport in some patients. Early signs of inadequate circulation are relative tachycardia, relative hypotension, oxygen extraction greater than 50%, and PvO₂ (mixed venous oxygen pressure) of less than 32 mm Hg. The depth of shock, haemdoynamic response to resuscitation, and the rate of actual blood loss in the acutely bleeding and haemodynamically unstable patient may also be integrated into the indication for RBC transfusion. In general, RBC transfusion is recommended to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) between 7 and 9 g/dl.

### Trends in postpartum hemorrhage in high resource countries: a review and recommendations from the international postpartum hemorrhage collaborative group [^116dJsoN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Definitions of PPH

While no single definition for PPH is promulgated for clinicians, in the United States and Canada, for example, a blood loss of 500 mL for a vaginal delivery and 1,000 mL for a caesarean birth are often used. In contrast, a blood loss of 500 mL for a vaginal delivery and 750 mL for a caesarean delivery is used in Australia, and in other data 500 mL blood loss is used to define PPH irrespective of the mode of delivery. Regardless of the definitions used, routine visual estimates of blood loss are frequently inaccurate, and analyses using calculated blood loss demonstrate that many and perhaps most women lose enough blood at delivery to meet the diagnostic criteria for PPH. Moreover, while women delivered by caesarean section lose more blood on average than women who have vaginal births, there is no reason to believe that the physiologic impact of blood loss differs according to the route of delivery, suggesting that the use of a unified definition irrespective of the route of delivery is more appropriate. Alternatively, PPH has been defined as a 10% or more drop in hematocrit. How these definitions are used, their inherent inaccuracies, and the translation of definitions to administrative ICD coding complicates the interpretation of trend data. For example, instructions to medical coders may not discriminate between modes of delivery and instead use 500 mL of vaginal blood loss regardless of delivery route.

### Determination of total menstrual blood loss [^115PWBoA]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop and validate a simple method of measuring total menstrual blood loss using a pictorial representation of blood loss, the menstrual pictogram.

Design

A prospective evaluation of total menstrual blood loss measurement by the menstrual pictogram compared to the alkaline hematin technique.

Setting

Academic menorrhagia research clinic.

Patient(S)

One hundred twenty-one women; 62 women complaining of heavy menstrual blood loss, 59 women who considered their menstrual blood loss to be normal.

Intervention(S)

Participants were asked to complete the menstrual pictogram through the period and collect their feminine hygiene products for an alkaline hematin assessment.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Percentage agreement between blood loss measured by the gold standard alkaline hematin method and the menstrual pictogram. Extraneous blood loss was measured using a semiquantitative pictorial method.

Result(S)

The menstrual pictogram had a high level of agreement for blood collected on feminine hygiene products compared with the alkaline hematin method. Some women also lose a significantly large amount of extraneous blood, which is not proportional to the alkaline hematin blood loss assessment.

Conclusion(S)

The menstrual pictogram provides a simple means of measuring menstrual blood loss. It is no longer appropriate to ignore extraneous blood loss, particularly as there is no correlation between extraneous blood loss and that measured on feminine hygiene products.

### Validation of a theoretically derived model for the management of massive blood loss in pediatric patients-a case report [^114dLrHx]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 5-year-old girl who was brought to hospital having suffered an intracranial bleed. She was found to have a large cerebral arteriovenous malformation which was unsuitable for coiling. Uncontrollable raised intracranial pressure refractory to all therapies necessitated surgery as a last resort. Massive hemorrhage eventuated during the procedure with the estimated loss of between five and six blood volumes, the majority occurring within the space of an hour and a half. We describe management using a locally developed protocol and correlate this with laboratory findings.

Resuscitation

Once significant postpartum hemorrhage has been recognized, resuscitation is performed in parallel to diagnostic efforts. The initial assessment of the patient should be conducted in much the same manner as per Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. Certainly, this should be tailored and should take into account what has been and is already underway; however, "ABCs" must be evaluated with interventions provided as needed. If not already in place, appropriate monitors should be attached and monitoring commenced: Continuous pulse oximetry, heart rate and blood pressure measurements (a minimum of every 5 minutes), and a foley catheter, if not in place, should be placed and utilized to monitor urine output. Initial lab studies should be ordered and repeated as needed and at least every 4 hours, to include type & cross for six units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), chemistry panel, complete blood count (CBC), coagulation panel, and fibrinogen. Unique to the postpartum patient, D-Dimer studies may be sent; however interpretation must take into account that pregnancy itself results in elevated values, therefore limiting its utility. At a minimum two large bore IVs (14 gauge) should be in place and if necessary, central intravenous access and arterial lines should be inserted for central venous pressure monitoring, additional fluid infusion, continuous blood pressure monitoring and ease of subsequent lab draws. Appropriate personnel in the blood bank should be notified early and a massive blood transfusion protocol initiated preemptively if blood transfusions are anticipated.

Fluids should be replaced with the goal of matching all previous losses within the first hour. The rate is then titrated to provide maintenance fluids and make up for continued losses so appropriate vital signs can be maintained. It is prudent to limit fluids to no more than 2 L of crystalloids, 1.5 L of colloid or 2 units of type O-negative blood prior to providing cross-matched blood to the patient. A more accurate assessment of volume loss can be assessed by calculating the patient's blood volume is (8.5–9% of a pregnant woman's body weight) and comparing it to estimated blood loss (determined by changes in pulse, systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure). If bleeding persists with blood loss greater than 40% of estimated patient blood volume, packed red blood cells should be transfused. Early consideration of PRBC transfusion in these patients is warranted due to their baseline moderate hemodilution.

### Massive transfusion of blood in the surgical patient [^117EQuoB]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Hemorrhage remains a leading cause of morbidity and death in both civilian and military trauma. Restoration of effective end-organ perfusion by stopping hemorrhage and restoring intravascular volume in such a way as to minimize acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, almost always requires the use of blood and/or blood-component therapy. The best method to manage life-threatening hemorrhage is to avoid the circumstance that prompted it or to mitigate blood loss early in the injury cycle; otherwise, blood replacement must suffice. This article reviews current understanding of massive transfusion, along with its attendant unintended consequences, in the management of patients with profound hemorrhage.

### Tranexamic acid for the prevention of blood loss after cesarean delivery [^117YT7o6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study TRAAP2 was published by Loïc Sentilhes and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Postpartum hemorrhage and Cesarean delivery. In the TRAAP2 study, the trial question was: what is the role of tranexamic acid in females undergoing Cesarean delivery? In the TRAAP2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TRAAP2 study, the population was: 4431 female patients. The inclusion criteria were females undergoing Cesarean delivery at ≥ 34 gestational weeks. The key exclusion criteria were previous episode of DVT or PE; increased risk of venous or arterial thrombosis or bleeding; history of epilepsy or seizure; prenatal hemoglobin level ≤ 9 g/dL in the week before delivery; autoimmune disease. In the TRAAP2 study, the interventions were: n = 2222 tranexamic acid (intravenous administration of prophylactic uterotonic agent and 1 g tranexamic acid) n = 2209 placebo (intravenous administration of prophylactic uterotonic agent and matching placebo). In the TRAAP2 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in postpartum hemorrhage (26.7% vs. 31.6%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94). In the TRAAP2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in gravimetrically estimated blood loss (689 mL vs. 719 mL; ARD -30.6, 95% CI -90.2 to 29) No significant difference in clinically significant postpartum hemorrhage according to health care provider (13.6% vs. 14.8%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.08) No significant difference in use of additional uterotonic agents for excessive bleeding (5.9% vs. 7.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.03). In the TRAAP2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in thromboembolic events. significant difference in vomiting or nausea in the operating room (43.0% vs. 36.3%). In the TRAAP2 study, the conclusion was: in females undergoing Cesarean delivery at ≥ 34 gestational weeks, tranexamic acid was superior to placebo with respect to postpartum hemorrhage.

A restrictive approach to blood transfusions is recommended by most current guidelines. Others suggest that in some patients a more liberal transfusion strategy may be beneficial. However, the extensive discussions regarding the appropriate transfusion threshold have not adequately addressed the potential impact of iatrogenic hemodilution on the hemoglobin (Hb) level during dynamic clinical conditions that necessitate fluid administration. This editorial will attempt to describe the frequent occurrence of iatrogenic hemodilution and its potential impact on decisions to transfuse blood.

### The effect of blood transfusion on compensatory reserve: a prospective clinical trial [^1131dbUz]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bleeding activates the body's compensatory mechanisms, causing changes in vital signs to appear late in the course of progressive blood loss. These vital signs are maintained even when up to 30% to 40% of blood volume is lost. Laboratory tests such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, lactate, and base deficit levels do not change during acute phase of bleeding. The compensatory reserve measurement (CRM) represents a new paradigm that measures the total of all physiological compensatory mechanisms, using noninvasive photoplethysmography to read changes in arterial waveforms. This study compared CRM to traditional vital signs and laboratory tests in actively bleeding patients.

Methods

Study patients had gastrointestinal bleeding and required red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (n = 31). Control group patients had similar demographic and medical backgrounds. They were undergoing minor surgical procedures and not expected to receive RBC transfusion. Vital signs, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and CRM were recorded before and after RBC transfusion or the appropriate time interval for the control group. Receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted and areas under the curves (AUCs) were compared.

Results

CRM increased 10.5% after RBC transfusion, from 0.77 to 0.85 (p < 0.005). Hemoglobin level increased 22.4% after RBC transfusion from 7.3 to 8.7 (p < 0.005). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate did change significantly. The AUC for CRM as a single measurement for predicting hemorrhage at admission was 0.79, systolic blood pressure was 0.62, for heart rate was 0.60, and pulse pressure was 0.36.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that CRM is more sensitive to changes in blood volume than traditional vital signs are and could be used to monitor and assess resuscitation of actively bleeding patients.

### Interventions to prevent iatrogenic anemia: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review [^111c9KGA]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Phlebotomy-related blood loss is even more profound and consequential in neonatal ICU patients: these infants lose 10 to 90% of circulating blood volume to phlebotomy in the first 2 weeks of life alone. Many ICU patients require transfusion, increasing the risks of infection, vascular overload, lung injury, sensitization, and transfusion reaction. Drugs that stimulate erythropoiesis and stringent transfusion guidance can reduce exposure to transfusions but not risks from anemia itself; the best strategy is to prevent the phlebotomy-driven anemia from the start.

Interventions to minimize phlebotomy blood loss include non-invasive testing, blood conservation devices and techniques, point of care testing (which requires less sample volume), and education or decision support tools to guide testing decisions. The uptake of these interventions varies among healthcare systems. Although individual studies have examined their efficacy, we found no previous synthesis of the evidence regarding these interventions. We conducted a systematic review of the efficacy of interventions to reduce phlebotomy-related blood loss and prevent iatrogenic anemia.

### Prognostic accuracy of clinical markers of postpartum bleeding in predicting maternal mortality or severe morbidity: a WHO individual participant data meta-analysis [^112bzWQV]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (excessive bleeding after birth) is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, there is no global consensus on which clinical markers best define excessive bleeding or reliably predict adverse maternal outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic accuracy of clinical markers of postpartum bleeding in predicting maternal mortality or severe morbidity.

Methods

In this individual participant data meta-analysis, eligible datasets were identified through a global call for data issued by WHO and systematic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and WHO trial registries (from database inception to Nov 6, 2024). Studies were eligible if they included at least 200 participants with objectively measured blood loss or other clinical markers of haemodynamic instability, and reported at least one clinical outcome of interest. Individual participant data were requested for all eligible studies. For each dataset, we computed the prognostic accuracy of each clinical marker to predict a composite outcome of maternal mortality or severe morbidity (blood transfusion, surgical interventions, or admission to intensive care unit). Five clinical markers were assessed: measured blood loss, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and shock index. Results were meta-analysed through two-level mixed-effects logistic regression models, with a bivariate normal model used to generate summary accuracy estimates. Clinical marker and threshold selections were informed by a WHO expert consensus process, which placed emphasis on maximising prognostic sensitivity (preferably > 80%) over prognostic specificity (preferably ≥ 50%). This meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (CRD420251034918).

Findings

We identified 33 potentially eligible datasets and successfully obtained and analysed full data for 12 datasets, comprising 312151 women. At the conventional threshold of 500 mL, measured blood loss had a summary prognostic sensitivity of 75.7% (95% CI 60.3–86.4) and specificity of 81.4% (95% CI 70.7–88.8) for predicting the composite outcome. The preferred sensitivity threshold was reached at 300 mL (83.9% [95% CI 72.8–91.1]), although at the expense of reduced specificity (54.8% [95% CI 38.0–70.5]). Prognostic performance improved with a decision rule that combined the use of either blood loss thresholds less than 500 mL (≥ 300 mL to ≥ 450 mL) and any abnormal haemodynamic sign (pulse rate > 100 beats per min, systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure < 60 mm Hg, or shock index > 1.0) or 500 mL or more of blood loss, with sensitivities ranging from 86.9% to 87.9% and specificities from 66.6% to 76.1%.

Interpretation

Measured blood loss below the conventional threshold, combined with abnormal haemodynamic signs, accurately predicts women at risk of death or life-threatening complications from postpartum bleeding and could support earlier postpartum haemorrhage diagnosis and treatment.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^114QVy2W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Initial management — initial triage/evaluation emphasizes comprehensive bedside assessment: "A thorough history and physical examination is needed to determine potential sources of bleeding and help identify patients at risk of severe bleeding and adverse outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality". History should cover "cardiovascular, oncologic, or renal comorbidities; GI surgeries; and associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, alteration in bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss". Examination should include "careful attention to vital signs and assessment for signs of hypovolemia", and "Careful rectal examination can help determine whether a bleeding source may be emanating from the anorectal region or indicate the presence of melena, which may increase the likelihood of an UGIB". Medication review should assess "NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants", and "findings such as a preceding history of decompensated liver disease or prior peptic ulcer disease… or visible stigmata of advanced liver disease may indicate the possibility of an upper GI source of bleeding in a patient with severe hematochezia".

Perioperative blood management — monitoring for coagulopathy: Monitoring for coagulopathy includes standard coagulation tests (e.g. INR, activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], fibrinogen concentration), as well as platelet count, with additional options including tests of platelet function and viscoelastic assays (e.g. TEG, ROTEM). An observational study of point-of-care aPTT and prothrombin time reported shorter times for obtaining test results with point-of-care monitoring and significant correlations with traditional laboratory tests (Category B2-B evidence). An observational study examining platelet count during cardiopulmonary bypass to predict excessive blood loss reports a sensitivity value of 83% (Category B2-B evidence). An RCT reported equivocal findings for blood loss and transfusion requirements when TEG is compared with standard laboratory coagulation tests (Category A3-E evidence), and an RCT reported equivocal findings with ROTEM versus non-fibrinolysis monitoring for RBC, FFP, and platelet transfusion requirements (Category A3-E evidence).

### Identification and basic management of bleeding disorders in adults [^111XxjR1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Adults with bleeding disorders may present to their family physician with minor bleeding symptoms or hematologic laboratory abnormalities discovered during evaluation for surgery or another purpose. Identifying the small proportion of adults who have an underlying bleeding disorder as the cause for such signs or symptoms may be challenging. In cases of asymptomatic hematologic laboratory abnormalities, the particular abnormality should narrow down the potentially affected hemostatic component(s), ideally streamlining subsequent investigation. In patients presenting with bleeding symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination are critical for first identifying bleeding as pathologic, then performing the appropriate diagnostic evaluation after excluding identifiable causes. Knowledge of the pathophysiologic processes contributing to impaired hemostasis in any given bleeding disorder ensures proper treatment and avoids therapies that are unnecessary or even contraindicated. Management is further determined by bleeding phenotype and, for invasive procedures, the anticipated risk for bleeding. Consultation with a hematologist may facilitate proper evaluation and treatment, particularly in adults with rare bleeding disorders or no identifiable cause for bleeding. This article reviews the diagnostic approach to hematologic laboratory abnormalities and abnormal bleeding in adults, as well as basic preventive care and hemostatic management of adults with bleeding disorders.

### The massively bleeding patient [^111SZnBz]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The resuscitation of the massively bleeding patient may seem superficially to be successful once the patient's vital signs have stabilized. The restoration of stable vital signs, however, does not confirm two critical elements of a thorough physiologic resuscitation: that there is truly adequate delivery of oxygen to all tissue beds and that physiologic disturbances that may have occurred because of massive transfusion during the resuscitation process have resolved. With respect to the adequacy of oxygen delivery, the current clinical endpoints, including mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac output, and serum lactate, reflect global perfusion and not regional oxygenation. Of these global measures, serum lactate is currently the best indicator as to whether some circulatory beds remain inadequately perfused. Serum lactate should be followed, and, in the event that elevated levels persist, measures to augment oxygen delivery (e.g., increasing cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation) should be undertaken. Gastric tonometry provides a method for specific examination of the splanchnic circulation. The current measurement techniques, however, require steady-state conditions and make it impractical in many physiologically dynamic situations. The physiologic disturbances associated with massive resuscitation (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypothermia) should be anticipated. Coagulation disturbances occur, especially when massive transfusion is accompanied by hypotension, hypothermia, or acidosis. Coagulation parameters should be measured with the loss of each one half of blood volume or after each 30-minute interval, whichever occurs first. Evaluation at blood volume intervals is relevant to the development of a strictly dilutional coagulopathy. The development of DIC, occurring because of tissue factor exposure or acidosis, however, is related more to the time lapsed than to the absolute volume lost or replaced.

### Proceedings from the society for advancement of blood management annual meeting 2017: management dilemmas of the surgical patient-when blood is not an option [^114u7b3J]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Vigilance is essential in the perioperative period. When blood is not an option for the patient, especially in a procedure/surgery that normally holds a risk for blood transfusion, complexity is added to the management. Current technology and knowledge has made avoidance of blood transfusion a realistic option but it does require a concerted patient-centered effort from the perioperative team. In this article, we provide suggestions for a successful, safe, and bloodless journey for patients. The approaches include preoperative optimization as well as intraoperative and postoperative techniques to reduce blood loss, and also introduces current innovative substitutes for transfusions. This article also assists in considering and maneuvering through the legal and ethical systems to respect patients' beliefs and ensuring their safety.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and blood transfusion in trauma patients with significant haemorrhage (CRASH-2): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115yiout]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

The study CRASH-2 was published by CRASH- trial collaborators and colleagues in 2010 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Traumatic hemorrhage. In the CRASH-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid in trauma patients with significant hemorrhage? In the CRASH-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CRASH-2 study, the population was: 20207 patients (3272 female, 16935 male). The inclusion criteria were adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding. The key exclusion criteria were a clear indication for tranexamic acid, or a clear contraindication to tranexamic acid treatment. In the CRASH-2 study, the interventions were: n = 10093 tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h IV) n = 10114 placebo (matching placebo of 0.9% saline IV). In the CRASH-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in all-cause death (14.5% vs. 16%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97). In the CRASH-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death due to bleeding (4.9% vs. 5.7%; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) No significant difference in death due to vascular occlusion (0.3% vs. 0.5%; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08) No significant difference in vascular occlusive events (1.7% vs. 2%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02). In the CRASH-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding, tranexamic acid was superior to placebo with respect to a all-cause death.

### Surgery without blood [^114ktUCM]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The principle aim of "bloodless surgery" is to minimize blood loss and to reduce or eliminate exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. The risks associated with blood transfusions have been well documented, and it is the goal of bloodless surgery centers to avoid complications and unnecessary use of blood. Blood transfusion is a significant adjunct to perioperative resuscitation. However, we aim to elucidate different approaches to minimizing blood loss and avoiding transfusion.

Design

In this document, we review the background and current status of bloodless surgery centers and then the different approaches to achieve the program goals.

Findings

There is no one single universal blood conservation strategy that is applicable to all patients and populations. Factors such as preexisting disease will alter the approach; however, it is the ability of any program to form a comprehensive strategy for blood conservation that is integral to the success of any such program.

Conclusion

The success of a bloodless surgery program requires both teamwork and careful cooperation between the blood bank, pharmacy, administration, hematologists, surgeon, and anesthesiologist to ensure that the goals of minimizing blood loss and avoiding transfusion are met.

### Angiography and embolization in the management of bleeding pelvic fractures [^114eQqes]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Indication for Angiography and Embolization

The use of angiography depends on several factors, including the patient's clinical scenario, vital signs, and continued need for resuscitation; angiographer availability; and physician experience. Although many institutions have similar algorithms and guidelines for the use of angiography, no standard protocol has been established.

The basic indication for angiography is the suspicion of an injured pelvic artery that is actively bleeding. However, complex clinical situations can lead to a dilemma in assessing whether a patient has pelvic arterial bleeding. For example, hemodynamic instability has been shown to be present in up to 25% of patients admitted with anterior-posterior compression (APC) type I and II pelvic fractures, making the source of blood loss less clear. Screening of a patient with pelvic trauma on arrival to the emergency department involves assessing vital signs to determine whether the patient is experiencing hemorrhagic shock without obvious bleeding from other sources. These patients have often sustained high-impact trauma and can have associated injuries that could be a source of bleeding. In multiple studies, the indication for angiography was not specifically mentioned or was stated simply as clinical suspicion of bleeding. As in the treatment of any patient showing signs of shock, immediate actions are to secure the airway and start resuscitation. A patient's failure to respond to the use of resuscitative fluids is an indication for investigation of possible hemorrhage. Miller et alfound that an inadequate response to initial resuscitation is 100% sensitive and 30% specific in predicting the presence of arterial bleeding on angiography.

### Blood transfusion and the anaesthetist: management of massive haemorrhage [^117R5nuD]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Management of haemostasis

The coagulopathy during massive haemorrhage is likely to evolve rapidly and regular clinical review and blood tests are required. It is important to anticipate and prevent haemostatic failure, but if haemostatic failure has occurred, standard regimens (e.g. FFP 15 ml·kg⁻¹) can be predicted to be inadequate and larger volumes of FFP are likely to be required.

Prevention of coagulopathy

Emerging evidence supports the early use of FFP to prevent dilutional coagulopathy. If an experienced clinician anticipates a blood loss of one blood volume, FFP should be infused to prevent coagulopathy. While FFP 15 ml·kg⁻¹ is appropriate for uncomplicated cases, increased volumes of FFP will be needed if a consumptive coagulopathy is likely or the patient has underlying liver disease.

A minimum target platelet count of 75 × 10⁹·l⁻¹ is appropriate in this clinical situation.

1:1:1 red cell:FFP:platelet regimens, as used by the military, are reserved for the most severely traumatised patient and are not routinely recommended.

### Major haemorrhage: past, present and future [^114Wvntd]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Red blood cells

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is indicated when 30–40% of circulating blood volume is lost (approximately 1500 mL in a 70 kg male, female equivalents are unknown) and is immediately required if more than 40% of blood volume is lost (1500–2000 ml). Red blood cell transfusion aims to improve oxygen delivery and recent guidelines recommend a target haemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 70–90 g·l⁻¹. Haemoglobin concentration is routinely used to guide transfusion; however, limitations in its interpretation include the confounding effects of resuscitation measures such as intravenous fluids. It is important to realise that initial Hb measurements (before fluid resuscitation) may be normal and not accurately reflect blood loss. This is also because patients lose whole blood and compensatory mechanisms that shift interstitial fluid take time (up to 1 h). In such cases, physiologic transfusion triggers such as haemodynamic compromise, ECG changes and acidaemia may be useful. In particular, lactate and/or base deficit are sensitive tests to estimate and monitor the severity of bleeding.

Red blood cells should be transfused through a warming device to minimise the risk of the patient developing hypothermia and rapid infuser devices may be required in life‐threatening bleeding. For immediate transfusion, group O RBCs should be issued after samples have been obtained for group and crossmatch. Group O Rhesus negative and Kell negative should be prioritised for females of childbearing potential.

### Prognostic accuracy of clinical markers of postpartum bleeding in predicting maternal mortality or severe morbidity: a WHO individual participant data meta-analysis [^116oNAjn]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

We calculated the prognostic accuracy measures at 50 mL incremental thresholds (above the median) for blood loss, at 10 beats per min for pulse rate, 10 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and 0.1 unit for shock index. We considered a clinical marker as predictive when the DOR was greater than 2 for at least one threshold. We also examined the prognostic accuracy of three predefined decision rules combining clinical markers, to investigate whether combinations of markers improved accuracy compared with any individual marker alone. These rules were developed a priori based on clinical rationale, expert consensus, and literature review, following recommended principles for constructing composite rules to evaluate combinations of imperfect tests in diagnostic research. In the first decision rule, women were classified as at high risk of death or severe morbidity if any one marker was abnormal (eg, blood loss above the target threshold, pulse rate > 100 beats per min (bpm) for tachycardia, systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure < 60 mm Hg for hypotension, or shock index score > 1). In the second decision rule, women were classified as at high risk of death or severe morbidity if blood loss and at least one other clinical marker were abnormal. The third decision rule consisted of a composite point scoring system that assigned 1 point for blood loss thresholds lower than 500 mL, a maximum of 1 point for any other abnormal haemodynamic marker (pulse rate > 100 bpm, systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure < 60 mm Hg, or shock index > 1), and 2 points for blood loss of 500 mL or more. Women were classified as at high risk if their total score was 2 points or more.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^114Yjidr]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Hb or Hct assays are part of the basic diagnostic work-up for trauma patients. Currently the use of Hb rather than Hct is widespread, and the latter is a calculated parameter derived from the Hb. However, most studies on which these recommendations are based analysed Hct rather than Hb. Because both parameters are used interchangeably in clinical practice, in these guidelines we refer to both parameters according to the parameter described by the literature to which we refer.

The diagnostic value of the Hb or Hct for detecting trauma patients with severe injury and occult bleeding sources has been a topic of debate. A major limit of the Hb/Hct's diagnostic value is the confounding influence of resuscitation measures on the Hb/Hct due to administration of i.v. fluids and erythrocyte concentrates. In addition, initial Hb or Hct may not accurately reflect blood loss because patients bleed whole blood and compensatory mechanisms that move fluids from interstitial space require time and may not be reflected in initial measurements. The concept of the low sensitivity of initial Hb/Hct for the detection of severe bleeding has been challenged. In a retrospective study of 196 trauma patients, Ryan et al. found that Hct at admission closely correlates with haemorrhagic shock. Other authors also recommended that the initial Hct play a greater role in the assessment of blood loss in trauma patients. In a retrospective analysis of 1492 consecutive trauma patients Thorson et al. found that the initial Hct is associated more strongly with the need for transfusion than other parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure or acidaemia, suggesting that fluid shifts are rapid after trauma and imply a more important role for Hct in the initial assessment of trauma victims. An initial low Hb level is one of the predictive criteria for massive transfusion using the TASH and Vandromme scores.

Thorson et al. analysed changes in Hct in two successive determinations and concluded that the change in Hct is a reliable parameter with which to detect blood loss. Two prospective observational diagnostic studies also showed the sensitivity of serial Hct measurements in the detection of patients with severe injury. Decreasing serial Hct measurements may reflect continued bleeding; however the patient with significant bleeding may maintain the serial Hct in the context of ongoing resuscitation and physiological compensatory mechanisms. Acute anaemia may play an adverse role in the clotting process because a low Hct may reduce platelet marginalisation with a potentially negative impact on platelet activation. Moreover Schlimp et al. demonstrated that levels of fibrinogen lower than 150 mg/dl are detected in as many as 73% of the patients with admission Hb lower than 10 g/dl.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^114u9aKe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Pre-hospital TXA guidance

TXA was added to the military Joint Trauma System Damage Control Resuscitation Clinical Practice Guideline (approved 10/2011) which currently recommends "The early use of TXA (ie, as soon as possible after injury but ideally not later than 3 hours postinjury) should be strongly considered for any patient requiring blood products in the treatment of combat-related hemorrhage and is most strongly advocated in patients judged likely to require massive transfusion (eg, significant injury and risk factors for massive transfusion)".

The European guidelines for management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma (box 1) recommend early TXA administration in bleeding trauma patients, and "suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)". A review of TXA as part of damage control resuscitation in the prehospital setting concluded that "High-level evidence supports its use in trauma and strongly suggests that its implementation in the prehospital setting offers a survival advantage to many patients, particularly when evacuation to surgical care may be delayed".

Box 1
Prehospital TXA recommendations from European guidelines (from Rossaint et al)

Antifibrinolytic agents (Recommendation 25)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered as early as possible to the trauma patient who is bleeding or at risk of significant hemorrhage at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 min, followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 g over 8 hours. (Grade 1A)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered to the bleeding trauma patient within 3 hours after injury. (Grade 1B)

We suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of tranexamic acid en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)

International Trauma Life Support (ITLS) recommends the following: "ITLS believes that there is sufficient evidence to support the use of TXA in the management of traumatic hemorrhage, pursuant to system medical control approval. Following initial resuscitation including control of external bleeding and stabilization of airway, consideration should be given to administration of TXA during early stages of transport. TXA should be considered in those patients who show signs of hemorrhagic shock, including tachycardia (> 110 bpm) and hypotension (SBP < 100) and are less than 3 hours from injury".

### Estimating allowable blood loss: corrected for dilution [^113hPcJV]. Anesthesiology (1983). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Maximum Allowable Blood Loss (MABL)" for perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery and colorectal surgery.

The Maximum Allowable Blood Loss (MABL) is a clinical calculator designed to estimate the maximum volume of blood that a patient can lose during surgery without requiring a blood transfusion. The MABL is calculated based on the patient's initial hemoglobin level, the lowest acceptable hemoglobin level (usually set at 6 g/dL), and the patient's estimated blood volume.

This calculator is applicable to all patient populations undergoing surgical procedures, particularly those at high risk for significant blood loss. It aids clinicians in planning for potential blood loss during surgery, managing perioperative blood transfusion, and optimizing patient safety.

However, the MABL should not be used in isolation to guide clinical decision-making. It does not account for individual patient factors such as comorbidities, tolerance to anemia, or the presence of ongoing bleeding. Therefore, clinical judgment should always be used in conjunction with the MABL to determine the need for blood transfusion.

### Triage tool for the rationing of blood for massively bleeding patients during a severe national blood shortage: guidance from the national blood transfusion committee [^115dPJob]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The emergency framework for rationing blood for patients predicted to need massive transfusion (see Appendices B and C)

Goal

To provide blood transfusions in an ethical, fair, and transparent way. All efforts should be made to minimise suffering and maximise the use of blood alternatives, as appropriate, for those who are triaged to 'no transfusion' due to insufficient resources.

Inclusion criteria

All patients needing, or predicted to need, massive transfusion due to massive haemorrhage during a red phase blood shortage, should be included. There is no agreed definition for massive transfusion, and traditional definitions (e.g. transfusion of ≥ 10 units of red cells in 24 h) may be inappropriate in acute clinical situations, and more dynamic definitions should be used. Examples include an expected blood loss of one blood volume in less than 24 h: 0.5× blood volume loss in 3 h, or transfusion of four or more units of red blood cells in 1 h.

All such patients should have access to all available blood conservation strategies as described in the local EBMA. These include (but are not limited to) intravenous/oral iron, blood components such as plasma and cryoprecipitate to manage severe haemorrhage, anti‐fibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid, erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents, intraoperative cell salvage, interventional radiological procedures, rapid access to endoscopy, and non‐invasive surgery. Early surgical intervention, correction of hypothermia, attention to the management of coagulopathy and intra‐operative cell salvage may be of value in patients with massive haemorrhage.

The initial aim should be the early identification of those patients who might need massive transfusion, and to triage them for transfusion support. Guidance and tools such as those developed by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Royal College of Physicians may be helpful for triaging patients. Triage is a dynamic process and patients should be actively re‐assessed based on the general and condition‐specific exclusion criteria.

Any decisions made to initiate, withdraw or withhold care must also comply with the shared decision‐making policies of the NHS. This means that these decisions should include the patient and their wishes (as much as is feasible for the given situation) and, if appropriate, the patient's carers.

### Management of bleeding diathesis in elective and orthopaedic trauma: a review [^113UdwxV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a general need among orthopaedic surgeons for practical advice on managing patients with bleeding disorders. Appropriate diagnosis and management of these disorders is paramount once discovered before, during, or after the patient's surgical course. Bleeding disorders disrupt the body's ability to control bleeding, commonly through platelet function and blood clotting. Normally, the vessel contracts and retracts once disruption of blood vessels occurs, limiting blood loss. Blood platelets adhere to exposed collagen, aggregate at the site, and obstruct blood loss. Because platelet aggregates are temporary, blood clotting is needed to back up the platelet plug and provide a milieu for the healing process that completes the hemostatic events. Disorders that interfere with any of these events can result in hemorrhage, drainage, or rebleeding. Bleeding disorders are a group of conditions, either hereditary or acquired, marked by abnormal or excessive bleeding and/or bruising. The most effective methods for assessing coagulation disorders include a detailed history and a series of blood tests. Clinical examination findings are notable but may be less specific. If a surgical patient has a bleeding disorder discovered preoperatively, postoperatively, or intraoperatively, treatments exist with medications, surgical management, interventional radiology procedures, and replacement therapy.

### Postpartum hemorrhage: prevention and treatment [^114LYC2h]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Postpartum hemorrhage is common and can occur in patients without risk factors for hemorrhage. Active management of the third stage of labor should be used routinely to reduce its incidence. Use of oxytocin after delivery of the anterior shoulder is the most important and effective component of this practice. Oxytocin is more effective than misoprostol for prevention and treatment of uterine atony and has fewer adverse effects. Routine episiotomy should be avoided to decrease blood loss and the risk of anal laceration. Appropriate management of postpartum hemorrhage requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. The Four T's mnemonic can be used to identify and address the four most common causes of postpartum hemorrhage (uterine atony [Tone]; laceration, hematoma, inversion, rupture [Trauma]; retained tissue or invasive placenta [Tissue]; and coagulopathy [Thrombin]). Rapid team-based care minimizes morbidity and mortality associated with postpartum hemorrhage, regardless of cause. Massive transfusion protocols allow for rapid and appropriate response to hemorrhages exceeding 1,500 mL of blood loss. The National Partnership for Maternal Safety has developed an obstetric hemorrhage consensus bundle of 13 patient- and systems-level recommendations to reduce morbidity and mortality from postpartum hemorrhage.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^112Mz4wJ]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Appendix 4 — adverse effects associated with transfusion describe acute intravascular hemolytic transfusion reactions occurring when red cells break down due to either a complement-mediated immune mechanism (usually secondary to ABO incompatibility) or to physical damage, with treatment consisting of stopping the blood transfusion, supportive measures to maintain blood pressure, and aggressive transfusion of platelets, FFP, and cryoprecipitate while maintaining oxygen carrying capacity through transfusion of type O red blood cells. Transfusion-associated acute lung injury is stated to be now the leading cause of transfusion-associated fatalities, with symptoms that occur within 6 h after the transfusion and treatment consisting of stopping the transfusion and instituting critical care supportive measures. Bacterial contamination of blood components is most often associated with platelet transfusion as platelets are stored at 20°–24°C, and there has been a significant decrease in fatalities associated with bacterial contamination since 2001 as processes to detect bacterial contamination in platelets have been implemented.

### Does liberal prehospital and in-hospital tranexamic acid influence outcome in severely injured patients? A prospective cohort study [^111XbQbp]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Early hemorrhage control and adequate blood product transfusion are important in trauma-related death prevention. Hemostatic resuscitation prevents ongoing blood loss, restores volume status and corrects coagulopathy development. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis and promotes the ability to sustain formed clots. The Clinical Randomization of an Anti-fibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage 2 (CRASH-2) trial showed statistically significant improvement in the rates of both overall mortality and in hemorrhage-caused mortality as a result of early administration of TXA in adults who sustained an injury within 8 h and had either significant hemorrhage, hypotension or who were considered to be at risk of significant hemorrhage. These results have led to widespread incorporation of TXA in damage control resuscitation with low thresholds to administer TXA, including in prehospital settings. However, concerns have been raised that indiscriminate widespread adoption might result in TXA administration in the wrong patients, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Data in the literature have been contradicting, however, with others reporting no significant differences or even decreased adverse effects. At present, it remains unclear what the exact mechanism behind TXA is and how it has reduced mortality in CRASH-2 trial, since there was no reduction in packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion between patients who received TXA and the ones who did not. Data are still lacking regarding which trauma patients might benefit most, optimal dosing and timing and potential complications in both prehospital and in-hospital setting.

Since most studies only focused on either prehospital or in-hospital TXA administration, we conducted a prospective population-based cohort study in polytrauma patients to investigate the indication of both pre- and in-hospital TXA administration and its relation to morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that neither prehospital nor in-hospital TXA administration was related to increased morbidity or mortality.

### Whole lot of blood: does more equal better for survival? [^1115bKEY]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Although we appreciate the work of Lammers and colleagues, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this single-institution retrospective study, which may be susceptible to bias and residual confounding. What is urgently needed are prospective randomized trials that can confidently demonstrate the effectiveness of whole-blood resuscitation and analyze the most optimal strategy for its use. Currently, a large multicenter trial is underway, focusing on in-hospital whole-blood resuscitation for trauma patients with severe hemorrhage. With randomized trials complementing the existing research, we anticipate a transformative shift toward whole-blood resuscitation as the cornerstone of treatment for critically injured patients experiencing severe hemorrhage.

Introduction

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading cause of early maternal death, accounting for about 300,000 deaths worldwide every year, and of morbidity related to anaemia, blood transfusion and haemorrhage-related ischaemic complications. PPH is poorly predictable, but its direct causes are mainly uterine atony, trauma to the genital tract and retained placenta. Accordingly, detailed guidelines have been issued for optimal use of obstetric interventions and uterotonic drugs. In contrast, haemostatic abnormalities in this setting have long been considered consequences of uncontrolled bleeding, not deserving of early specific treatment. Thus, haemostatic drugs are not routinely used as a first-line intervention in PPH.

This concept was recently challenged by the demonstration of a relationship between fibrinogen decrease and outcome. At the same time, it was recognized that extensive tissue injury can shift the haemostatic equilibrium toward increased fibrinolysis, contributing to coagulopathy and bleeding. Antifibrinolytic agents, mainly tranexamic acid (TA) and aprotinin, have been demonstrated to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements in various elective surgeries. Moreover, the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) study demonstrated that TA safely reduces the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients. In the field of obstetrics, three randomised, controlled trials have suggested that TA administration in women after vaginal or elective caesarean delivery reduces blood loss and the incidence of PPH, with a pooled relative risk for PPH of 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.64). However, such a strategy implies that the drug must be administered to every woman, an option that needs careful evaluation in terms of the benefit-risk ratio before it is widely implemented. A more efficient approach could be to administer TA after the onset of PPH, as recently suggested. However, no study has yet assessed the efficacy and risk of such a strategy.

Therefore, we designed a prospective, multicentred, randomised, controlled study to analyze the effects of TA administered intravenously at the time PPH is diagnosed. The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of TA in the reduction of blood loss in PPH, while secondary objectives were to assess the effect of TA on (1) duration of bleeding; (2) anaemia; (3) need for invasive procedures such as hysterectomy, surgical artery ligatures and embolisation; and (4) need for transfusion.

### Is thromboelastography (TEG)-based resuscitation better than empirical 1: 1 transfusion? [^116wuyLV]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

ATC from hemorrhage results in several defects of the coagulation system. The use of TEG (or similar assays) aids the earlier identification of these defects and can prompt clinicians on the optimum transfusion strategy. The use of a TEG-guided protocol appears to improve survival while reducing overall product use; trials are in progress, which will continue to inform the evidence base.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on postpartum bleeding in women with moderate and severe anaemia (WOMAN-2): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115dw6Po]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study WOMAN-2 was published by WOMAN- Trial Collaborators. and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Postpartum hemorrhage. In the WOMAN-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid on postpartum hemorrhage in women with moderate-to-severe anemia? In the WOMAN-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the WOMAN-2 study, the population was: 15068 female patients. The inclusion criteria were women with moderate-to-severe anemia. The key exclusion criteria were indication for or contraindication to tranexamic acid; allergy to tranexamic acid or its components; postpartum hemorrhage before the umbilical cord is cut or clamped. In the WOMAN-2 study, the interventions were: n = 7580 tranexamic acid (at an intravenous dose of 1 g as soon as possible but no later than 15 minutes after umbilical cord is cut or clamped) n = 7488 placebo (matching placebo intravenous injection). In the WOMAN-2 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage (7% vs. 6.6%; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19). In the WOMAN-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean estimated blood loss (309.8 mL vs. 310.8 mL; AD -0.95 mL, 95% CI -7.1 to 5.21) No significant difference in mean corrected 24-hour hemoglobin (82.2 g/L vs. 82.1 g/L; AD 0.12 g/L, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.5) No significant difference in death or near miss at 24 hours (1.6% vs. 1.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12). In the WOMAN-2 study, the conclusion was: in women with moderate-to-severe anemia, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage.

### Massive transfusion protocol in adult trauma population [^1168SWyf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute blood loss in trauma requires quick identification and action to restore circulating volume and save the patient. Massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) have become standard at Trauma Centers, in order to rapidly deliver blood products to bleeding patients. This literature review presents current standards of transfusion ratios, as well as insights into adjuncts during massive transfusions.

Methods

PubMED was searched for articles from 2005 to 2020 on MTPs, the article were assessed for single vs. multi-institutional, mechanism of injury, type of MTP, timing in which blood products should be administered, timing of delivery of blood products to trauma bay, pre-hospital treatment and adjuncts, and outcomes.

Results

Eleven studies addressed transfusion ratios. Seven studies looked at timing of blood products. Nine studies addressed MTP pre-hospital treatment and adjuncts. Prior to 2015, studies supported the benefits of a balanced transfusion ratio, which was then confirmed by the PROPPR randomized controlled trial. The shorter the time to blood product delivery the better the outcomes. New advances in technology have allowed us to measure different patterns of coagulation, allowing more individualized approaches to the bleeding patient.

Conclusion

Current massive transfusion protocols should utilize between 1:1:1 and 1:1:2 ratios of the 3 main products; plasma, platelets, and red blood cells. Massive transfusion protocols are effective in decreasing mortality. Better resuscitation efforts were seen when blood products were readily available in the trauma bay when the patient arrived and the faster the replacement of blood, the better the outcomes.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^116CZ7q3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 13: maintain acute normovolemic haemodilution to help minimise bleeding and transfusion. (Grade of recommendation: 1C)

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a blood conservation technique consisting in removal of whole blood from a patient immediately after induction of anesthesia, with maintenance of normovolemia using fluid replacement with crystalloid and/or colloid. The amount of blood removed typically varies between 1 and 3 units (450 to 500 mL = one unit), although 3 to 4 units may be withdrawn safely in selected patients.

The main factors determining the efficacy of hemodilution are (I) Initial red cell mass where patients with greater red cell masses can provide more blood and this is mainly determined by the initial hematocrit and the blood volume.

(II) The magnitude of hemodilution. In fact, if lower hematocrits are achieved and tolerated by the patients after hemodilution, less red cell loss will be lost during surgical procedures. However, the more dilution is high the more profound are hemodynamic and physio-metabolic consequences. Red blood cells are important for hemostasis, and the risk of anemia has to be considered.

(III) Intraoperative blood loss.

(IV) Intraoperative management. Normovolemia should be effectively reestablished and managed after autologous blood removal. If this does not happen potential benefits in terms of reducing red cell losses may be vanished. In fact, in the absence of hemodilution, operative blood loss would occur as per preoperative hematocrit level.

The intraoperative lower hematocrit may request additional cardiovascular monitoring.

ANH can be used as the sole blood conservation technique, but for better results, it can be combined with other strategies to minimize or avoid transfusion.

Meta-analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused and the number of patients transfused with allogeneic blood for major cardiac, orthopaedic, thoracic, or liver surgery. Additional meta- analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH combined with intraoperative red blood cell recovery compared with intraoperative red blood cell recovery alone is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused.

The most common contraindications for ANH are severe sepsis; acute respiratory insufficiency; acute renal failure and hemorrhagic shock secondary to trauma. Patients suffering from severe coronary arterial disease should only be assigned after careful assessments of the risks and benefits of this procedure. Patients with surgical emergencies need to be well clinically evaluated before the indication of ANH.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^115eVH4b]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

American Society of Anesthesiologists perioperative blood management — definitions and scope include that perioperative blood management refers to perioperative blood transfusion and adjuvant therapies. Perioperative blood transfusion addresses the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative administration of blood and blood components (e.g., allogeneic or autologous blood, red blood cells, platelets, cryoprecipitate, and plasma products, fresh-frozen plasma [FFP], PF24, or Thawed Plasma). Adjuvant therapies refer to drugs and techniques to reduce or prevent blood loss and the need for transfusion of allogenic blood. The purposes of these updated Guidelines are to improve the perioperative management of blood transfusion and adjuvant therapies.

### Massive hemorrhage protocol: a practical approach to the bleeding trauma patient [^116LvFyH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Damage-control resuscitation is the standard of care for the hemorrhaging trauma patient. This approach combines rapid hemostasis and early-ratio-based blood product administration. These patients often require initiation of a massive hemorrhage protocol to support the systematic and coordinated delivery of care during this critical phase of resuscitation. Emerging evidence supports that this includes more than blood product administration alone but rather a comprehensive suite of treatments. In this article, we review the existing evidence and provide a pragmatic framework, the 7 Ts of massive hemorrhage protocol, to guide the care of patients with life-threatening traumatic hemorrhage.

### Tranexamic acid for the prevention of blood loss after cesarean among women with twins: a secondary analysis of the TRAnexamic acid for preventing postpartum hemorrhage following a cesarean delivery randomized clinical trial [^114wkKaN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although prophylactic tranexamic acid administration after cesarean delivery resulted in a lower incidence of calculated estimated blood loss of > 1000 mL or red cell transfusion by day 2, its failure to reduce the incidence of hemorrhage-related secondary clinical outcomes (TRAnexamic Acid for Preventing Postpartum Hemorrhage Following a Cesarean Delivery trial) makes its use questionable. The magnitude of its effect may differ in women at higher risk of blood loss, including those with multiple pregnancies.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the effect of tranexamic acid vs placebo to prevent blood loss after cesarean delivery among women with multiple pregnancies.

Study Design

This was a secondary analysis of the TRAnexamic Acid for Preventing Postpartum Hemorrhage Following a Cesarean Delivery trial data, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial from March 2018 to January 2020 in 27 French maternity hospitals, that included 319 women with multiple pregnancies. Women with a cesarean delivery before or during labor at ≥ 34 weeks of gestation were randomized to receive intravenously 1 g of tranexamic acid (n = 160) or placebo (n = 159), both with prophylactic uterotonics. The primary outcome was a calculated estimated blood loss of > 1000 mL or a red blood cell transfusion by 2 days after delivery. The secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory blood loss measurements.

Results

Of the 4551 women randomized in this trial, 319 had a multiple pregnancy and cesarean delivery, and 298 (93.4%) had primary outcome data available. This outcome occurred in 62 of 147 women (42.2%) in the tranexamic acid group and 67 of 152 (44.1%) receiving placebo (adjusted risk ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–1.38; p = 0.86). No significant between-group differences occurred for any hemorrhage-related clinical outcomes: gravimetrically estimated blood loss, provider-assessed clinically significant hemorrhage, additional uterotonics, postpartum blood transfusion, arterial embolization, and emergency surgery (P > .05 for all comparisons).

Conclusion

Among women with a multiple pregnancy and cesarean delivery, prophylactic tranexamic acid did not reduce the incidence of any blood loss-related outcomes.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^111KY9r3]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Hb or haematocrit (Hct) assays are key parts of the basic diagnostic work-up for bleeding trauma patients. Both parameters are used interchangeably in clinical practice and here we refer to both parameters according to the parameter described by the literature cited. Recently, non-invasive Hb monitoring has also been tested and showed high precision compared with laboratory measurements.

The diagnostic value of the Hb or Hct for quantifying and/or detecting blood loss in trauma patients with severe injury and for occult bleeding sources has been a topic of debate. A major limitation of the diagnostic value is the confounding influence of resuscitation fluids and physiological shift of interstitial fluid into the vascular compartment. Low initial Hct or Hb levels in trauma patients closely correlate with haemorrhagic shock. In a retrospective analysis of 1492 consecutive trauma patients, Thorson et al. found that the initial Hct was associated more closely with the need for transfusion than other parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure or acidaemia. Serial measurements increase the sensitivity of these parameters to detect blood loss in patients with severe injury. Holstein and co-workers showed that a Hb level below 80 g/L in patients with pelvic trauma was associated with non-survival and there was also a close correlation between Hb and fibrinogen levels. Because initial Hb values close to the normal range may mask early-phase serious bleeding, repeated measurement is prudent.

In summary, initial Hct and Hb value changes over time represent simple and reliable bedside parameters with which to detect blood loss, despite several limitations.

Blood lactate and base deficit

Recommendation 10

We recommend blood lactate as a sensitive test to estimate and monitor the extent of bleeding and tissue hypoperfusion; in the absence of lactate measurements, base deficit may represent a suitable alternative (Grade 1B).

Perioperative blood management — transfusion avoidance, massive transfusion, and ordering practices — states: A protocol for avoidance of transfusion may be used as a strategy to reduce blood loss for patients in whom transfusion is refused or is not possible. A massive (i.e., hemorrhagic) transfusion protocol may be used when available as a strategy to optimize the delivery of blood products to massively bleeding patients. Use a maximal surgical blood order schedule, when available and in accordance with your institutional policy, as a strategy to improve the efficiency of blood ordering practices.

### Simplified treatment algorithm for the management of trauma-induced hemorrhage without viscoelastic testing [^117P8L1v]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Uncontrolled bleeding after major trauma remains a significant cause of death, with up to a third of trauma patients presenting with signs of coagulopathy at hospital admission. Rapid correction of coagulopathy is therefore vital to improve mortality rates and patient outcomes in this population. Early and repeated monitoring of coagulation parameters followed by clear protocols to correct hemostasis is the recommended standard of care for bleeding trauma patients. However, although a number of treatment algorithms are available, these are frequently complex and can rely on the use of viscoelastic testing, which is not available in all treatment centers. We therefore set out to develop a concise and pragmatic algorithm to guide treatment of bleeding trauma patients without the use of point-of-care viscoelastic testing. The algorithm we present here is based on published guidelines and research, includes recommendations regarding treatment and dosing, and is simple and clear enough for even an inexperienced physician to follow. In this way, we have demonstrated that treatment protocols can be developed and adapted to the resources available, to offer clear and relevant guidance to the entire trauma team.

However, controversy exists in the use of fixed blood component ratios. Assessing the extent of the coagulopathy through point-of-care testing might provide patients with product administration as needed, and avoid excessive transfusion and its associated complications.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^114ThdJy]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Haematocrit

Recommendation 10

We do not recommend the use of single Hct measurements as an isolated laboratory marker for bleeding. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

Hct assays are part of the basic diagnostic work-up for trauma patients. The diagnostic value of the Hct for detecting trauma patients with severe injury and occult bleeding sources has been a topic of debate in the past decade. A major limit of the Hct's diagnostic value is the confounding influence of resuscitative measures on the Hct due to administration of intravenous fluids and red cell concentrates. In addition, initial Hct does not accurately reflect blood loss because patients bleed whole blood and compensatory mechanisms that move fluids from interstitial space require time and are not reflected in initial Hct measurements. A retrospective study of 524 trauma patients determined a low sensitivity (0.5) of the initial Hct on admission for detecting those patients with traumatic hemorrhage requiring surgical intervention. The concept of the low sensitivity of initial Hct for the detection of severe bleeding has recently been challenged. In a retrospective study of 196 trauma patients, Ryan et al. found that Hct at admission closely correlates with haemorrhagic shock. However, this study included severe cases requiring emergency surgery only (most with penetrating injuries), and may not be applicable to the general trauma patient population. Two prospective observational diagnostic studies determined the sensitivity of serial Hct measurements for detecting patients with severe injury. Decreasing serial Hct measurements may reflect continued bleeding; however, the patient with significant bleeding may maintain his or her serial Hct.

Serum lactate and base deficit

Recommendation 11

We recommend either serum lactate or base deficit measurements as sensitive tests to estimate and monitor the extent of bleeding and shock. (Grade 1B)

### Is heart rate variability better than routine vital signs for prehospital identification of major hemorrhage? [^115Bq6Zf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

During initial assessment of trauma patients, metrics of heart rate variability (HRV) have been associated with high-risk clinical conditions. Yet, despite numerous studies, the potential of HRV to improve clinical outcomes remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate whether HRV metrics provide additional diagnostic information, beyond routine vital signs, for making a specific clinical assessment: identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion.

Methods

Adult prehospital trauma patients were analyzed retrospectively, excluding those who lacked a complete set of reliable vital signs and a clean electrocardiogram for computation of HRV metrics. We also excluded patients who did not survive to admission. The primary outcome was hemorrhagic injury plus different PRBC transfusion volumes. We performed multivariate regression analysis using HRV metrics and routine vital signs to test the hypothesis that HRV metrics could improve the diagnosis of hemorrhagic injury plus PRBC transfusion vs routine vital signs alone.

Results

As univariate predictors, HRV metrics in a data set of 402 subjects had comparable areas under receiver operating characteristic curves compared with routine vital signs. In multivariate regression models containing routine vital signs, HRV parameters were significant (P < .05) but yielded areas under receiver operating characteristic curves with minimal, nonsignificant improvements (+0.00 to +0.05).

Conclusions

A novel diagnostic test should improve diagnostic thinking and allow for better decision making in a significant fraction of cases. Our findings do not support that HRV metrics add value over routine vital signs in terms of prehospital identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive PRBC transfusion.

### Coronary artery surgery: cardiotomy suction or cell salvage? [^116kcEgK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Summary

We know that conventional CPB induces a systemic inflammatory response and results in microembolism to the brain and other organs. Salvage of shed blood by cardiotomy suction exacerbates the inflammatory response and increases the load of lipid emboli to the brain (and by implication, all other capillary beds). Discarding shed mediastinal blood will attenuate these adverse effects but at the cost of losing red cells mass. Cell salvage is an attractive alternative although current evidence suggests that the complications associated with reinfusing shed blood may be attenuated rather than eliminated.

We hope that we have demonstrated that there is good evidence that CABG can be safely performed without the use of cardiotomy suction, with red cell salvage, and without an increase in blood loss or blood usage. Despite this evidence, cardiotomy suction continues to be indiscriminately used during coronary artery bypass surgery, and although in the presence of rapid significant blood loss its use is justified, its continuous application in the operative field is not.

Tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding in medical contexts other than PPH

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a potent antifibrinolytic agent that exerts its effect by blocking lysine binding sites on plasminogen molecules and has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of the patient's own hemostatic mechanisms. Consequently, clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) is inhibited and bleeding is reduced. Results from previous trials have shown that TXA in planned surgery reduces the risk of blood transfusion, mean transfused volume, and need for re-operation due to bleeding, without increasing thrombotic events. The CRASH-2 trial (Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage) demonstrated that the administration of TXA reduced mortality in bleeding trauma patients in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Significant reductions in mean menstrual blood loss have been reported in women with menorrhagia treated with TXA, compared with control or placebo-treated women. This result is particularly significant since the efficacy of TXA in menorrhagia suggests that it can reduce uterine blood loss, even of low volume, and in a nonsurgical context.

Tranexamic acid for PPH

During delivery, when the placenta separates from the uterine wall, sequential physiologic and hemostatic changes occur and reduce bleeding, including strong myometrial contractions, increased platelet activity, and a massive release of coagulant factors; at the same time, however, fibrinolytic activity increases. While oxytocin administration enhances the first mechanism, TXA administration might be able to counter the latter and thus facilitate the hemostatic process. Finally, the close relation observed between reduced fibrinogen levels and outcome in cases of PPH further suggests that TXA might be effective in PPH.

Treatment of PPH

The only randomized controlled trial (multicenter open-label trial) to assess TXA for the treatment of PPH showed that a high dose of TXA reduces blood loss in women with PPH. Due to its limitations (small sample size, open design, issues regarding the harm-benefit ratio), and conflicting results from a before-and-after study using the same protocol, the use of TXA to treat PPH remains the object of debate. A pragmatic, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in women with a clinical diagnosis of PPH, the WOMAN trial, has been launched to rectify this clinical uncertainty. It is currently recruiting eligible women in hospitals in Africa and Europe, aiming to reach the target sample size of 15 000 women.

Back to Search Results Model Number JADA-1001 Device Problem Adverse Event Without Identified Device or Use Problem Patient Problem Appropriate Clinical Signs, Symptoms, Conditions Term / Code Not Available Event Date 05/28/2021 Event Type Injury. Event Description The patient was admitted via ambulance with significant vaginal bleeding. Patient was suspected of losing approximately 2 liters of blood by the time she arrived at the hospital, however this could not be verified by the site as the patient had arrived via ambulance. The patient was at 34 weeks and 3 days gestation and diagnosed previously with a. complete placenta previa. The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a c-section. At the time of the c-section delivery, the patient was administered methergine, txa and cytotec. Qbl at time of c-section was an additional 556 ml. A bakri balloon was placed through the hysterotomy and filled. with 304 mL of fluid.

An additional dose of methergine was given. The patient was diagnosed with developing coagulopathy and blood product replacements were administered. The bakri balloon was removed after 2 hours and 20 minutes due to breakthrough bleeding and jada was inserted. Jada remained in place and attached to suction for. 7 hours. A total of 100 mL of continued vaginal bleeding from the hemorrhage was noted as jada was being placed, and the patient had 250 mL out into the suction cannister during jada treatment. With jada in place and connected to suction, the patient was transferred to interventional radiology for a uterine. artery embolization. The provider noted there was concern for concealed bleeding as they were unable to feel a firm fundus as before and there was no blood coming from jada. The patient was transferred to the icu and jada was removed by the md, followed by manual extraction of 191 mL of blood clots. The.

patient continued to have some increased bleeding while in the icu and cumulative blood loss while the patient was under care at the site was 3230 mL with unknown qbl prior to hospital admission. The patient was transferred to the or for a hysterectomy and sent to the icu immediately after. The patient was transferred to the obstetrical unit on post op day 1. The patient recovered and was discharged home. Subsequent pathology report of the uterus: endometrium

### About heavy menstrual bleeding… [^116H2ETd]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What it is Heavy menstrual bleeding, or menorrhagia, is menstrual bleeding that is very heavy during your period. It can be menstrual bleeding that lasts more than 7 days. Untreated heavy or prolonged bleeding can stop you from living your life to the fullest. It also can cause anemia. Anemia is a common blood problem that can leave you feeling tired or weak. If you have a bleeding problem, it could lead to other health problems.

- Have menstrual periods lasting more than 7 days.
- Have a menstrual flow with blood clots the size of a quarter or larger.
- Have a heavy menstrual flow that keeps you from doing the things you would do normally.
- Have constant pain in the lower part of the stomach during your periods.
- Are tired, lack energy, or are short of breath. If you have this type of bleeding, you should see a healthcare provider.

Testing and diagnosis Finding out if a woman has heavy menstrual bleeding often is not easy, because each person might think of "heavy bleeding" in a different way. Usually, menstrual bleeding lasts about 4 to 5 days and the amount of blood lost is small. However, women who have heavy menstrual bleeding usually bleed for more than 7 days and lose twice as much blood. Drug therapy Iron supplements. To get more iron into your blood to help it carry oxygen, if you show signs of anemia. Ibuprofen. To help reduce pain, menstrual cramps, and the amount of bleeding. In some women, NSAIDS can increase the risk of bleeding. To reduce the amount of bleeding. Desmopressin nasal spray.

To stop bleeding in people who have certain bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease and mild hemophilia, by releasing a clotting protein stored in the lining of the blood vessels that helps the blood to clot and temporarily increasing the level of these proteins in the blood. Antifibrinolytic medicines. To reduce the amount of bleeding by stopping a clot from breaking down once it has formed. Hysterectomy. A major operation requiring hospitalization that involves surgically removing the entire uterus. After having this procedure, a woman can no longer become pregnant and will stop having her period.

Because of this, excess fluid and waste remain in the body and may cause health problems such as heart disease. Other health problems related to CKD include:

- Anemia or low number of red blood cells.
- Increased occurrence of infections.
- Low calcium levels, high potassium levels, and high phosphorus levels in the blood.
- Loss of appetite or eating less.
- Depression or lower quality of life.

CKD has varying levels of seriousness. It usually gets worse over time, though treatment has been shown to slow progression. CKD can progress to kidney failure or end-stage kidney disease. It also increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. When the kidneys stop working, dialysis or kidney transplant is needed for survival. Kidney failure treated with dialysis or kidney transplant is called end-stage kidney disease. Not all people with kidney disease progress to kidney failure. Reducing risk

- Every day, 360people begin dialysis treatment for kidney failure.
- In the United States, diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney failure, accounting for 2 out of 3 new cases.
- In 2022, treating Medicare beneficiaries with CKD cost $95. 7 billion, and treating people for dialysis cost $45. 3 billion. Keep ReadingChronic Kidney Disease: Common, Serious, and Costly.
