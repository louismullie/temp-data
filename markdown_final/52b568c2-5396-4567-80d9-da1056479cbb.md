## Question

Daily baby aspirin for longevity benefits

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether daily "baby aspirin" (low-dose aspirin, typically 75–100 mg) confers longevity or healthy-lifespan benefits in people without cardiovascular disease, and how to interpret the evidence and guidelines to answer that question clinically and safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly "longevity" and "healthy lifespan" mean in trials and guidelines. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence, especially ASPREE and its extensions, for all-cause mortality and disability-free survival. Next, I will examine cardiovascular outcomes, cancer outcomes, and functional endpoints like frailty, falls, and anemia. After that, I should review major guidelines and modeling to frame risk–benefit by age and bleeding risk. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line recommendation and outline practical, individualized considerations for those already taking aspirin or contemplating it for primary prevention.

> Let me first confirm definitions so I don't conflate terms. "Longevity" in this context typically refers to all-cause mortality, whereas "healthy lifespan" often refers to disability-free survival or composite outcomes capturing death, dementia, and persistent physical disability; ASPREE used the latter as its primary endpoint, which directly addresses whether aspirin extends healthy life in older adults without CVD, so I should anchor on that construct and its extended follow-up data [^115zFA7D] [^111ost5U].

> Now, I should review the pivotal randomized evidence. The ASPREE trial randomized 19,114 healthy older adults (median age 74) to 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin versus placebo for a median 4.7 years and found no reduction in disability-free survival and a higher all-cause mortality with aspirin, driven largely by cancer-related deaths; major hemorrhage was also more frequent with aspirin, which immediately raises concern about net harm in this population [^115zFA7D] [^1125SJyG]. Wait, let me verify the extended follow-up: ASPREE-XT, with a median 4.3 additional years, again showed no long-term benefit on the composite of death, dementia, or persistent disability and a persistent increase in major hemorrhage, reinforcing that aspirin did not improve healthy lifespan in this cohort [^111ost5U] [^111AFcoW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cardiovascular endpoints either. I initially thought ASPREE might have shown a modest reduction in "hard" CVD events, but I should double-check the magnitude and significance. The in-trial CVD composite showed a nonsignificant trend favoring aspirin (HR ~0.89–0.95), and extended follow-up found no long-term MACE benefit and even a signal for higher post-trial MACE in those initially assigned to aspirin, which tempers any residual hope for hidden cardioprotection in this primary prevention group [^115eRH8U] [^111AFcoW]. I need to ensure I'm not overinterpreting subgroup signals; none in ASPREE overturned the overall neutral or harmful findings for mortality or MACE in older adults without CVD.

> Next, I should review cancer outcomes carefully because that's where the mortality signal arose. ASPREE showed no reduction in incident cancer but a higher rate of cancer-related death in the aspirin arm, which was unexpected and remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive; mechanistic speculation about immune modulation in older adults has been proposed, but I should be cautious not to overstate causality here [^113fnGFX] [^116QFmB6]. But wait, what if longer-term follow-up outside ASPREE tells a different story? Meta-analytic and long-term follow-up data from vascular trials suggest that daily aspirin can reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality after about 5–10 years, yet those benefits emerge in different populations and time frames and do not obviously offset the early harm seen in ASPREE's elderly cohort; thus, extrapolating CRC prevention benefits to justify aspirin in healthy older adults is not straightforward [^117MS8do] [^117VNiYa] [^115EJ2ij].

> I will now examine functional and geriatric outcomes that might still matter for "healthy lifespan". Aspirin did not prevent frailty onset in robust older adults and did not reverse frailty in those who were prefrail or frail at baseline in ASPREE analyses, which argues against a hidden functional benefit in this age group [^113yjNXH] [^114Esrzt]. Let me also check hematologic and fall-related outcomes: aspirin increased incident anemia and accelerated ferritin decline independent of overt bleeding, and it increased serious falls without reducing fractures, further eroding any putative net benefit on healthy aging metrics in this population [^113fTaXC] [^111rHtH6].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The USPSTF 2022 gives a C recommendation for selective, individualized use in adults 40–59 years with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk who are not at increased bleeding risk, and a D recommendation against initiating aspirin for primary CVD prevention in adults 60 years or older; ACC/AHA 2019 similarly advises against routine aspirin in adults > 70 years and emphasizes individualized risk–benefit assessment in higher-risk but younger primary prevention populations [^112h5oKe] [^1126UTd9]. I should confirm that these recommendations explicitly incorporate bleeding risk, which they do, and they align with the observed harm signal in ASPREE's older cohort [^112h5oKe] [^1126UTd9].

> Let me consider dose and mechanism briefly to ensure I'm not missing a pharmacologic rationale for a different low-dose strategy. Low-dose aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1 and reduces platelet aggregation, which explains ischemic event reductions in secondary prevention, but it also increases gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding; importantly, there is no convincing evidence that doses above 75–100 mg improve antithrombotic efficacy, while higher doses do increase bleeding, reinforcing that 75–100 mg is the appropriate prophylactic range when aspirin is indicated [^115eRH8U] [^111zWgQn]. Hmm, wait a minute, could alternate-day regimens mitigate harm while preserving benefit? The Women's Health Study suggested a delayed CRC benefit with alternate-day aspirin, but overall CVD benefits were limited and bleeding risk persisted, so this does not rescue the case for routine primary prevention in older adults either [^117XzRnF].

> I should now synthesize the risk–benefit balance by age and baseline risk. In adults ≥ 70 years (and many ≥ 60) without CVD, the absolute ischemic benefit is small, while the absolute bleeding harm is substantial and rises with age; modeling and trial data converge on no net mortality or disability-free survival benefit, and in some analyses a signal toward harm, particularly for cancer mortality and major hemorrhage, making routine initiation inappropriate in this group [^112prQ3v] [^111ost5U] [^113fnGFX]. For adults 40–59 years at higher ASCVD risk and low bleeding risk, a modest CVD benefit may exist, but even there the net benefit is small and requires shared decision-making; importantly, this younger-primary-prevention context does not directly address "longevity" per se, and there is no evidence that aspirin extends life expectancy in this group either [^112h5oKe] [^1126UTd9].

> But wait, what if someone is already taking aspirin for primary prevention — should they stop? I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. For adults ≥ 60–70 without CVD, many guidelines support considering discontinuation, particularly as bleeding risk rises with age; however, abrupt cessation may theoretically increase short-term thrombotic risk in some contexts, so any discontinuation should be individualized, often with a plan to optimize other risk factors and, if needed, taper rather than stop abruptly in higher-risk patients, even though the strongest evidence for harm comes from continuation rather than cessation in this age group [^117FjWeB] [^116SLPuU] [^114ZxKPw]. I should confirm that this aligns with USPSTF and ACC/AHA language, which emphasize periodic reassessment and stopping when the balance becomes unfavorable with advancing age or evolving bleeding risk [^112h5oKe] [^1126UTd9].

> Bottom line, I should be precise. For generally healthy adults, especially those ≥ 60–70 years, daily low-dose aspirin does not improve longevity or healthy lifespan and is more likely to cause harm, chiefly via major bleeding and possibly higher cancer mortality in the elderly; therefore, it should not be initiated for primary prevention in this group, and those already on it should review continuation with their clinician in light of age, bleeding risk, and competing risks [^115zFA7D] [^113fnGFX] [^111ost5U] [^112h5oKe] [^1126UTd9]. For selected adults 40–59 years at higher ASCVD risk and low bleeding risk, a small CVD benefit may exist, but there is no evidence of improved life expectancy, so decisions should be individualized and anchored in shared decision-making rather than a longevity rationale [^112h5oKe] [^1126UTd9].

Daily baby aspirin (75–100 mg) is **not recommended for longevity** in healthy adults because it does not reduce all-cause mortality [^113fnGFX] and increases major bleeding risk [^115zFA7D] [^113UbwMn]. While low-dose aspirin modestly reduces nonfatal MI and stroke in primary prevention [^111oBoek] [^1125SJyG], the **bleeding risk outweighs these benefits**, especially in older adults [^112h5oKe] [^115zFA7D]. Aspirin may lower colorectal cancer risk with long-term use [^117MS8do], but this delayed benefit does not offset early bleeding harms in average-risk populations [^111aoo5o]. Current guidelines advise against routine aspirin for primary prevention in adults ≥ 60 years [^112h5oKe] and recommend individualized decisions for ages 40–59 with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk [^112h5oKe]. For longevity, prioritize lifestyle and evidence-based screenings; **aspirin is not a longevity drug** [^111ost5U].

## Cardiovascular benefits and risks

### Benefits

In primary prevention, low-dose aspirin produces a **modest reduction** in nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke [^111oBoek] [^1125SJyG]. However, **no significant reduction** in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality has been demonstrated in primary prevention populations [^111oBoek] [^1125SJyG].

---

### Risks

Low-dose aspirin significantly increases the risk of **major gastrointestinal bleeding** [^113UbwMn] and intracranial hemorrhage [^113UbwMn]. The **risk of bleeding increases with age**, particularly in adults ≥ 60 years [^113UbwMn] [^114DBJ9A].

---

## Cancer prevention

Colorectal cancer shows a **reduced incidence and mortality** with long-term aspirin use (≥ 5 years), particularly for proximal colon cancer [^117MS8do]. However, **delayed benefit** means the cancer prevention benefit emerges after several years of use and may not be realized in older adults with limited life expectancy [^117VNiYa] [^114q2WcX].

---

## All-cause mortality

The **ASPREE trial** found no reduction in all-cause mortality with aspirin use in healthy older adults; instead, there was a **slight increase in cancer-related mortality** [^113fnGFX] [^111ost5U]. These findings indicate that aspirin **does not extend lifespan** in healthy populations [^113fnGFX] [^111ost5U].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF 2022 | - Individualized decision for ages 40–59 with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk [^112h5oKe] <br/> - Do not initiate in adults ≥ 60 years [^113mY93p] |
| ACC/AHA 2019 | - Consider in select adults 40–70 years at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk [^1126UTd9] <br/> - Do not routinely use in adults > 70 years [^113HFECB] |
| AGA 2021 | Consider for CRC prevention in adults < 70 years with ≥ 10% CVD risk, ≥ 10-year life expectancy, and low bleeding risk [^114q2WcX] |

---

## Population-specific considerations

### Age

Younger adults (40–59 years) may have a **modest net benefit** if they have a high cardiovascular risk and low bleeding risk [^112h5oKe] [^1126UTd9], whereas **older adults (≥ 60 years)** have no net benefit due to increased bleeding risk and lack of mortality reduction [^112h5oKe] [^113fnGFX].

---

### Gender

Men and women experience **similar cardiovascular benefits and bleeding risks**, with no significant gender-specific differences observed [^111oBoek] [^113UbwMn].

---

### Existing health conditions

Patients with cardiovascular disease benefit from aspirin in **secondary prevention**, where benefits outweigh risks [^111oBoek] [^113nhQre]. In contrast, in **healthy individuals**, the risks generally outweigh the benefits in primary prevention [^111oBoek] [^112h5oKe].

---

## Alternative strategies for longevity

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular exercise, healthy diet, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation are effective strategies for increasing longevity [^notfound].

- **Regular screenings**: Routine health screenings and preventive care are essential for early detection and management of chronic conditions [^notfound].

- **Medications**: Statins, antihypertensives, and diabetes medications are evidence-based therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction and longevity [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Daily baby aspirin is **not recommended for longevity** in healthy adults. While it offers modest cardiovascular benefits and potential cancer prevention, the increased risk of major bleeding outweighs these benefits, particularly in older adults. Current guidelines recommend individualized decisions for primary prevention, prioritizing lifestyle modifications and evidence-based medications for longevity [^112h5oKe] [^1126UTd9].

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115eRH8U]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The lowest effective daily dose of aspirin for long-term antiplatelet prophylaxis ranges between 50 and 100 mg, with no evidence that higher doses are more effective, consistent with saturability of platelet COX-1 inactivation at low doses. This evidence is based on indirect comparisons of RCTs employing different aspirin dosing regimens, as well as on a limited number of head-to-head randomized comparisons of a lower vs. a higher dose, both in acute coronary syndromesand stable patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

There is also no convincing evidence that the dose requirement for the antithrombotic effect of aspirin varies in different clinical settings or as a function of body weight. Similarly, there is no evidence that the effect of aspirin on major vascular events is influenced by gender, age, concomitant treatments, or primary vs. secondary prevention. In the ASPREE trial involving 19 114 healthy elderly persons (median age, 74 years) who did not have known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significantly lower risk of CVD than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.08]. However, the widely cited message from ASPREE that low-dose aspirin is ineffective in old age is potentially misleading, for the following reasons: (i) CVD was not the primary endpoint of ASPREE; (ii) CVD, a pre-specified secondary endpoint, was a composite of platelet-dependent as well as platelet-independent events, i.e. fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure; and (iii) when the analysis was restricted to a traditional composite of fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, or fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, the rate of this endpoint was 7.8 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 8.8 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77–1.03). Such a moderate treatment effect is identical to that reported for younger subjects (< 65 years) in a setting of primary prevention, an effect that ASPREE failed to detect as statistically significant in a population at low cardiovascular risk (< 1.0% per year) because it was largely underpowered. Despite serious limitations, these results were published as a separate, stand-alone paper in the New England Journal of Medicine and named as one of the 12 'game changers' of 2018.

### Effect of aspirin on disability-free survival in the healthy elderly [^115zFA7D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Information on the use of aspirin to increase healthy independent life span in older persons is limited. Whether 5 years of daily low-dose aspirin therapy would extend disability-free life in healthy seniors is unclear.

Methods

From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling persons in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥ 65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or physical disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg per day of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo orally. The primary end point was a composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability. Secondary end points reported in this article included the individual components of the primary end point and major hemorrhage.

Results

A total of 19,114 persons with a median age of 74 years were enrolled, of whom 9525 were randomly assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. A total of 56.4% of the participants were women, 8.7% were nonwhite, and 11.0% reported previous regular aspirin use. The trial was terminated at a median of 4.7 years of follow-up after a determination was made that there would be no benefit with continued aspirin use with regard to the primary end point. The rate of the composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability was 21.5 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 21.2 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.11; P = 0.79). The rate of adherence to the assigned intervention was 62.1% in the aspirin group and 64.1% in the placebo group in the final year of trial participation. Differences between the aspirin group and the placebo group were not substantial with regard to the secondary individual end points of death from any cause (12.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.1 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group), dementia, or persistent physical disability. The rate of major hemorrhage was higher in the aspirin group than in the placebo group (3.8% vs. 2.8%; hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.62; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Aspirin use in healthy elderly persons did not prolong disability-free survival over a period of 5 years but led to a higher rate of major hemorrhage than placebo. (Funded by the National Institute on Aging and others; ASPREE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01038583 .).

### Aspirin and cancer [^117Ev6Rb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The place of aspirin in primary prevention remains controversial, with North American and European organizations issuing contradictory treatment guidelines. More recently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended "initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years". This recommendation reflects increasing evidence for a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other) cancer. The intent of this paper is to review the evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of aspirin, discuss its potential mechanism(s) of action, and provide a conceptual framework for assessing current guidelines in the light of ongoing studies.

### Aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117V5tck]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to aspirin for primary prevention, USPSTF 2016 guidelines recommend to initiate low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in 50–59 years old individuals with all of the following:

- ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk

- life expectancy of ≥ 10 years

- no increased risk of bleeding

- willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^115aFQvm]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115y349V]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Versus placebo

The clinical efficacy of aspirin as an antithrombotic agent has been evaluated in placebo-controlled RCTs addressing the whole spectrum of atherosclerosis, from apparently healthy, middle-aged, low-risk individuals to patients presenting with acute MI or acute ischaemic stroke. Moreover, aspirin trials have used variable follow-up, from as short as a few weeks to as long as 10 years.

In the Second International Study of Infarct Survival, once-daily dosing with low-dose aspirin (162.5 mg) started within 24 h of the onset of symptoms of a suspected MI produced highly significant reductions in 5 week vascular mortality (the primary endpoint) by 23%, non-fatal reinfarction by 49%, and non-fatal stroke by 46% in over 17 000 patients. Three smaller but longer-term (12 weeks to 2 years) placebo-controlled RCTs in ∼2600 patients with unstable coronary artery disease consistently showed that aspirin therapy (75 to 1300 mg daily) halved the probability of death or MI, independent of the aspirin dose. Two RCTs with a similar protocol, the International Stroke Trialand the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial, randomized approximately 40 000 patients within 48 h of the onset of symptoms of an acute ischaemic stroke to 2 to 4 weeks of daily aspirin therapy (300 and 160 mg, respectively) or placebo and showed more modest reductions in death or non-fatal stroke than reported in acute MI (Figure 6).

Figure 6
Absolute effects of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin on the risk of vascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or death from vascular causes) in five groups of high-risk patients. The figure is based on an analysis of data from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration. Reproduced from Patrono et al.with permission from the Massachusetts Medical Society

Based on a large number of placebo-controlled RCTs, long-term (2 to 3 year) aspirin therapy confers conclusive net benefit on the risk of subsequent MI, stroke, or vascular death among subjects at high risk of vascular complications (Figure 6). The proportional effects of long-term aspirin therapy on vascular events in these different clinical settings are rather homogeneous, ranging between 20% and 25% odds reduction based on an overview of all RCTs. The absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis in different categories of patients are detailed in Figure 6.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1125SJyG]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — benefits of preventive medication reports 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 161 680 participants; most trials used low-dose aspirin of 100 mg/d or less or aspirin every other day, with mean ages ranging from 53 years to 74 years. In pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin, decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was observed (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.96]) across 11 trials (n = 134 470) and decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke (Peto OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–1.00]) across 5 trials (n = 54 947). Low-dose aspirin was not associated with statistically significant effects on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality at 3.6 to 10.1 years of follow-up, and although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^115oPnCm]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality.1 For example, in 2000, it accounted directly for around 2 million deaths in the European Union. Worldwide, many people take aspirin daily in the belief that doing so helps to prevent CVD. This approach is established for the secondary prevention of recurrent vascular events. However, there has been some uncertainty about the place of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.6 In particular, there have been doubts about whether any benefits of aspirin in people with no history of CVD outweigh the risks (e.g. the fact that long-term low-dose aspirin therapy almost doubles the likelihood of gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Here we consider the place of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention of CVD.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^112xCoAw]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin prophylaxis recommendations and dosing — In recent trials, the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has exceeded observed risk during follow-up, supporting a lower class of recommendation with removal of a specific PCE threshold; accordingly, a Class IIb recommendation remains more suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the narrow balance of benefits and harms, there is limited justification to use aspirin at doses > 100 mg daily for primary prevention; meta-analyses suggest the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin is equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspirin, and low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best justified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.

Regarding preventative measures for rectal cancer, more specifically with respect to aspirin for primary prevention, USPSTF 2016 guidelines recommend to initiate low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in 50–59 years old individuals with all of the following:

- ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk

- life expectancy of ≥ 10 years

- no increased risk of bleeding

- willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112h5oKe]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: For adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use should be an individual one; evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small, and persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit (C recommendation). For adults 60 years or older, the USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD (D recommendation). The target population is adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD who are not at increased risk for bleeding. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112doaQz]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — The ACC/AHA recommends that low-dose aspirin use (75 to 100 mg/d) might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use.

Harms of preventive medication — low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/d) bleeding risks: Across CVD primary prevention trials, "The USPSTF reviewed 14 RCTs". For low-dose aspirin, a pooled analysis of "10 trials (n = 119 130)" found a "58% increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding (Peto OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.38–1.80])", and "a pooled analysis of 11 trials (n = 134 470) showed an increase in intracranial bleeds" (Peto OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.11–1.54]). Low-dose aspirin "was not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of fatal hemorrhagic stroke". Bleeding "occurs relatively quickly after initiating aspirin", with no differential relative bleeding risk by "age, sex, presence of diabetes, level of CVD risk, or race or ethnicity", but "the absolute incidence of bleeding… increases with age, and more so in adults 60 years or older".

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114ecFa4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin for primary prevention — net benefit by age and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit. Adequate evidence indicates low-dose aspirin has a small benefit to reduce risk for cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in adults 40 years or older at increased CVD risk, with absolute benefit increasing with higher 10-year CVD risk and greater lifetime benefit when started at a younger age; however, aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke, with harms small overall but increasing in older age groups, particularly in adults older than 60 years.

### Aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115Gejz6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and the 2007 recommendation on aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC).

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed 5 additional studies of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD and several additional analyses of CRC follow-up data. The USPSTF also relied on commissioned systematic reviews of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence and mortality and a comprehensive review of harms. The USPSTF then used a microsimulation model to systematically estimate the balance of benefits and harms.

Population

This recommendation applies to adults aged 40 years or older without known CVD and without increased bleeding risk.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years. (B recommendation) The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 60 to 69 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years are more likely to benefit. Persons who place a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms may choose to initiate low-dose aspirin. (C recommendation) The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults younger than 50 years. (I statement) The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 70 years or older.

### When is the use of aspirin for CVD prevention in women appropriate? [^113hTQ1Z]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Women age 65 and older without known cardiovascular disease (CVD), women of any age with established CVD, and women of any age with an estimated 10-year risk of CVD ≥ 10%, are likely to experience a net benefit from preventive low-dose aspirin therapy and should be considered for such therapy unless contraindicated.

### The role of aspirin in cancer prevention [^111aoo5o]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines for prophylactic aspirin use currently only consider the cardiovascular benefits of aspirin, weighed against the potential harm from aspirin-induced bleeding. Daily aspirin use has been convincingly shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and recurrence of adenomatous polyps, but in average-risk populations, these benefits alone do not outweigh harms from aspirin-induced bleeding. Recently published secondary analyses of cardiovascular trials provide the first randomized evidence that daily aspirin use may also reduce the incidence of all cancers combined, even at low doses (75–100 mg daily). This Review considers the general mechanism of action that defines aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a class, the specific advantages of aspirin over other NSAIDs for prophylactic use, the current evidence concerning the main health outcomes affected by aspirin use, and the hypothesis that inhibition of platelet activation may mediate both the cardioprotective and cancer-preventive effects of low-dose aspirin. It also considers how even a 10% reduction in overall cancer incidence beginning during the first 10 years of treatment could tip the balance of benefits and risks favourably in average-risk populations.

The use of low doses of aspirin on a daily basis has increased greatly in the past 20 years, based on observations that it can significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, aspirin can also cause severe damage to the stomach. A modified version of aspirin that releases nitric oxide has been developed that seems to offer important advantages over its 103-year-old parent — namely, improved protection for the heart without the unwanted effects on the stomach.

dose and duration

There is consistent evidence that long-term use of aspirin is necessary to achieve a cancer prevention benefit. This is most clearly seen in the RCTs where no benefit was seen in years 0–3, but incidence was reduced after 3 years of treatment, and mortality was reduced only after 5 years, but continued for as long as follow-up was available. This is supported by observational studies, especially for CRC where the reduced incidence is much clearer in long-term users. Reduced incidence and mortality have been seen for all daily doses above 75 mg, and there is no clear indication of a greater reduction with increasing dose in average-risk individuals. Some observational studies have suggested that doses < 300 mg/day are not effective and an RCT in high-risk individuals has shown efficacy at 600 mg daily dose. However, Baron et al. observed greater reductions in all or advanced colorectal adenomas with an 81 mg daily aspirin compared with a 325 mg daily dose. In a meta-analysis of colorectal adenoma prevention trials, similar reductions were observed with low- (81 or 160 mg daily) versus standard-dose (300 or 325 mg daily) aspirin, but reductions in advanced adenomas were greater with the higher dose. Of the alternate daily dosing trials WHS and PHS; PHS has not shown clear benefits, whereas WHS has shown a delayed post-treatment benefit in CRC incidence.

age and sex

In an overview of six RCTs of daily low-dose aspirin involving over 35 000 individuals and 1632 incident cancers, no difference has been seen between men and women, or between those aged < 60 years of age at randomisation versus older ages. These results appear robust, as ∼40% of these cancers occurred in women and 30% in individuals younger than 60 years of age at randomisation. Observational studies generally support this finding, but data are less complete. A possible exception to these findings is the smaller and late effect seen in the WHS, which investigated 100 mg aspirin on alternate days in women only.

### The benefit-risk consideration in long-term use of alternate-day, low dose aspirin: focus on colorectal cancer prevention [^117XzRnF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Evidence has recently showed that aspirin may provide prophylaxis for cancer, primarily colorectal cancer, but also gastric cancer as well as breast, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancer. It is reported that the benefits increase with use duration and an earlier effect was shown in trials using higher doses. However, these meta-analyses were limited to trials of daily aspirin use. Previous analyses from the Women's Health Study (WHS) found no effect of alternate-day low dose aspirin on cancer risk, including colorectal cancer, over a mean follow up of 10 years.

Recently, the WHS published a follow up for cardiovascular and cancer outcomes since its active drug intervention in 2004. The extended study primarily aimed to examine long-term, a median 18-year follow-up effects of alternate-day, low-dose aspirin on cancer risk, particularly colorectal cancer, in healthy women. 39,876 women aged 45 years or older were enrolled in a median 10-year intervention of aspirin or placebo, and 33,682 women were observed in a post-trial follow up through March 2012. Participants were sent annual supplies of monthly calendar packs containing aspirin or placebo in a blinded fashion during the intervention period. At 6 and 12 months and then yearly, participants were mailed questionnaires on drug adherence, adverse effects, non-study aspirin use, clinical endpoints, and risk factors. At the end of the active intervention, participants were opted in or out for further annual follow up. The results showed that over the entire follow-up period, aspirin had no effect on overall (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95%CI 0.92–1.03, P = 0.31), breast (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.90–1.07, P = 0.65), or lung (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.86–1.26, P = 0.67) cancer risk. However, colorectal cancer was reduced in the aspirin group (HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.67–0.97, P = 0.021), primarily proximal colon cancer (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.55–0.95, P = 0.022). The difference emerged after 10 years, with a post-trial reduction of 42% (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.42–0.80, P < 0.001). Among participants in the aspirin group, not using post-trial aspirin was associated with 33% lower rate of colorectal cancer (HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.43–1.02), while participants who continued to use aspirin had 43% lower cancer rate (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.35–0.93); the difference not being statistically significant. There was no extended effect on cancer deaths or colorectal polyps, when the analyses were restricted to participants having endoscopy at least once during overall follow up. More gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings (HR 1.14, 95%CI 1.06–1.22, P < 0.001) and peptic ulcers (HR 1.17, 95%CI 1.09–1.27, P < 0.001) occurred in the aspirin group. The between-group differences for GI bleeding and peptic ulcers were restricted to the trial period, with no further post-trial carry over effect. The authors concluded that long-term use of alternate-day, low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk for colorectal cancer, but it also increases the risk for GI bleeding.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^1151qMCU]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Novel druggable therapeutic targets and compounds for antiplatelet therapy are currently in pre-clinical development, and some appear to have a more favourable safety profile than currently approved drugs with regard to bleeding risk. Further development of non-invasive biomarkers of platelet activation, and research on disutility and decision analysis, may improve the uncertain balance of benefits and risks of antiplatelet therapy in a primary prevention setting.

Finally, the results of ongoing adjuvant trials of aspirin for cancer treatment and preventionmay lead to further understanding of the role of platelet activation in cancer development and progression and widen the scope of long-term antiplatelet therapy.

### Role of aspirin in cancer prevention [^112DGArN]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Since its first synthesis in 1897, several medicinal roles and mechanisms of action of aspirin have become apparent; the latest among these being its role in cancer prevention and treatment. A large body of evidence supports aspirin's effect in reducing cancer incidence and cancer mortality, but duration of use needs to be at least 5 years. The beneficial effects are particularly large for colorectal, oesophageal and gastric cancers, with apparently smaller reductions for breast, prostate and lung cancer. The major harm is gastrointestinal bleeding, but serious sequelae are minimal at ages < 70 years. It is very likely that use of prophylactic aspirin in the general population aged 50–70+ years will result in net overall benefit. Outstanding issues are: whether standard dose (~300 mg/day) can lead to greater net benefits than low dose (75–100 mg/day), the optimum duration of use, and appropriate ages for use in average-risk individuals.

### Individual and population benefits of daily aspirin therapy: a proposal for personalizing national guidelines [^116WnXHV]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines that help clinicians and patients to understand the magnitude of expected individual risks and benefits would help with patient-centered decision-making and prioritization of care. We assessed the net benefit from taking daily aspirin to estimate the individual and public health implications of a more individualized decision-making approach.

Methods and Results

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey representing all US persons aged 30 to 85 years with no history of myocardial infarction and applied a Markov model based on randomized evidence and published literature to estimate lifetime effects of aspirin treatment in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We found that treatment benefit varies greatly by an individual's cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Almost all adults have fewer major clinical events on aspirin, but for most, events prevented would be so rare that even a very small distaste for aspirin use would make treatment inappropriate. With minimal dislike of aspirin use (disutility, 0.005 QALY per year), only those with a 10-year cardiac event risk > 6.1% would have a net benefit. A disutility of 0.01 QALY moves this benefit cut point to 10.6%. Multiple factors altered the absolute benefit of aspirin, but the strong relationship between CVD risk and magnitude of benefit was robust.

Conclusions

The benefits of aspirin therapy depend substantially on an individual's risk of CVD and adverse treatment effects. Understanding who benefits from aspirin use and how much can help clinicians and patients to develop a more patient-centered approach to preventive therapy.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1173dGik]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that has been used in low doses (75–100 mg/d) for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Despite some recent unfavorable findings, it continues to be widely used for primary and secondary prevention of stroke. Its major adverse effect is an increased bleeding tendency.,

Information about the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of stroke is derived from meta-analyses and results of recent major trials, most of which have been conducted in populations with mean ages younger than 70 years. Despite some inconsistency, these reports suggest a trend toward reduced ischemic stroke counterbalanced by increased intracerebral and other intracranial hemorrhage, with little overall impact on total stroke incidence.

Clinical characteristics of older individuals include an increased inherent susceptibility to hemorrhage, which may be associated with increased fragility of small blood vessels. In addition, older individuals experience an increased susceptibility to major and minor trauma as a result of falls and other accidents. Together, these outcomes may alter the balance of risks and benefits of an antiplatelet drug, especially if given to individuals at low risk in a primary prevention setting. This concern is relevant given the high stroke risk in older individuals, worldwide increases in populations of older individuals, and the importance of evaluating preventive strategies in this age group.

The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial is the largest randomized controlled trial of low-dose aspirin focused on investigating the balance of risks and benefits of this therapy in an older age group. In addition to its large size, the ASPREE study design included independent adjudication of stroke and hemorrhagic events by independent expert panels. It was therefore ideally positioned to evaluate the balance of risks and benefits of low-dose aspirin in a primary prevention setting. In this study, we provide a comprehensive report on the incidence of first stroke and bleeding events occurring during the median 4.7 years of follow-up of the trial.

The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is inadequate that low-dose aspirin use reduces CRC incidence or mortality.

### Aspirin and healthy lifespan in older people: main outcome of the ASPREE-XT observational study [^111ost5U]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

Background

In the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) clinical trial, low-dose aspirin was not associated with survival free of dementia and persistent physical disability (a measure of a healthy lifespan); however, there was a small increased risk of death. Given the long pre-clinical phase of many ageing conditions, we aimed to examine the legacy effect (post-trial) and the longer-term effect of aspirin versus placebo through extended follow-up in the ASPREE-XT observational study.

Methods

Between March 10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014, 19114 community-dwelling people in Australia and the United States, aged predominantly 70 years and older, were randomly assigned to low-dose aspirin or placebo for a median of 4.7 years as part of the ASPREE trial. Post-trial observational follow-up continued for a median of 4.3 years (IQR 4.1–4.6). All components of the primary endpoint (ie, incident dementia, persistent physical disability, and death) were adjudicated by masked expert panels. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards models with intention-to-treat.

Findings

15633 participants (8836 [56.5%] were women, 6797 [43.5%] were men; 981 [6.3%] were not White) were eligible for and agreed to observational follow-up. There was no effect of randomisation to aspirin (34.37 events per 1000 person-years) versus placebo (33.68 per 1000 person-years) on the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02; 95% CI 0.94–1.11; p = 0.63) in the ASPREE-XT period. Similarly, over the period of both ASPREE and ASPREE-XT, no long-term effect of aspirin versus placebo was observed on the composite outcome of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability over almost a decade of follow-up (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.95–1.08; p = 0.65), including no long-term effect on deaths (1.06; 0.99–1.14; p = 0.10). No effect of aspirin on incident major haemorrhagic events as compared with placebo was found in ASPREE-XT; however, aspirin was associated with an increased hazard for incident major haemorrhagic events across both ASPREE and ASPREE-XT (1.24; 1.10–1.39).

Interpretation

Low-dose aspirin does not appear to be effective in promoting a healthy lifespan in initially healthy, community-dwelling older people.

### Low-dose aspirin and cancer mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115QTtE2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Low-dose aspirin is a common strategy for preventing cardiovascular disease and associated mortality. A recent individual patient data meta-analysis of 8 trials of low- and high-dose aspirin, with long-term follow-up, found important reductions in cancer mortality. We aimed to determine whether cancer mortality also is reduced by low-dose aspirin in the shorter term.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of 10 electronic databases up to December 2011. We conducted a meta-analysis using data from all randomized clinical trials evaluating low-dose (75–325 mg) daily aspirin. We extracted data on non-cardiovascular disease mortality and cancer mortality. We pooled studies using a random-effects model and conducted a meta-regression. We supplemented this with a cumulative meta-analysis and trial sequential monitoring analysis.

Results

Twenty-three randomized studies reported on nonvascular death. There were 944 nonvascular deaths of 41,398 (2.28%) patients receiving low-dose aspirin and 1074 nonvascular deaths of 41,470 (2.58%) patients not receiving aspirin therapy. The relative risk of nonvascular death was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.96, I(2) = 0%). Eleven trials included data evaluating cancer mortality involving 16,066 patients. There were 162 of 7998 (2.02%) and 210 of 8068 (2.60%) cancer deaths among low-dose aspirin users versus non-aspirin users, respectively, reported over an average follow-up of 2.8 years. The relative risk of cancer mortality was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63–0.95, I(2) = 0%). Studies demonstrated a significant treatment effect after approximately 4 years of follow-up. The optimal information size analysis showed that a sufficient number of patients had been randomized to provide convincing evidence of a preventive role of low-dose aspirin in nonvascular deaths.

Conclusion

Nonvascular deaths, including cancer deaths, are reduced with low-dose aspirin.

Estimate of magnitude of net benefit — USPSTF microsimulation modeling by age and risk: The USPSTF "commissioned a microsimulation model to estimate the net balance of benefits and harms from aspirin use", assuming that low-dose "(≤ 100 mg/d) aspirin use reduces the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, increases the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage, and has no effect on the risk of CVD mortality". Modeling stratified outcomes by initiation decade "(40–49 years, 50–59 years, 60–69 years, and 70–79 years)" and baseline 10-year CVD risk "(5% to 20%)". Results estimated that in adults "aged 40 to 59 years with 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk" aspirin "generally provides a modest net benefit", that in those "aged 60 to 69 years" QALYs "range from slightly negative to slightly positive… and life-years gained are generally negative", and that in those "aged 70 to 79 years" initiation "results in a loss of both quality-adjusted life-years and life-years at essentially all CVD risk levels modeled (ie, up to 20% 10-year CVD risk)".

### The effect of low-dose aspirin on reversing frailty status in older prefrail and frail adults: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomised clinical trial [^114Esrzt]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that daily low-dose aspirin did not significantly improve frailty status compared to placebo among older adults who were initially classified as prefrail or frail at enrolment into the ASPREE trial. These null findings were consistently supported across multiple analytic approaches and subgroups.

This study assessing the effect of aspirin on frailty reversal in the subset of ASPREE participants who were frail and prefrail at baseline complements our previous work evaluating the effect of aspirin on frailty prevention in the ASPREE participants who were robust at baseline. In that earlier study, we found no statistically significant difference in the development of frailty between the aspirin and placebo groups (FFP HR: 1.04, 95% CI 0.96–1.13, P = 0.39; FI HR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.97–1.10, P = 0.29), which aligns with the findings of the current study. Similar consistency was also observed in the analysis tracking frailty score change over time. The continuity of null findings across both preventive and interventional contexts suggests a lack of clinical benefit from low-dose aspirin on managing frailty in older adults regardless of their baseline frailty status. This has provided important evidence further supporting the current clinical guidelines discouraging routine low-dose aspirin use in adults aged 70 years or older who were free of CVD.

Aspirin — efficacy and dose context in high-risk patients is summarized as follows: On the basis of > 100 randomized trials in high-risk patients, aspirin reduces vascular death by ∼15% and nonfatal vascular events by ∼30%. Complete or near-complete inhibition of platelet COX-1 can be achieved with low doses of aspirin (75–150 mg) given once daily, whereas 10- to 100-fold higher daily doses are required when the drug is used as an antiinflammatory agent rather than as an antiplatelet agent, and the benefit/risk profile of aspirin depends on dose because its GI toxicity is dose dependent.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115tuZES]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for more than 1 in 4 deaths. Each year, an estimated 605 000 people in the US have a first myocardial infarction and an estimated 610 000 experience a first stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD. The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms (particularly bleeding) associated with aspirin use. The USPSTF also commissioned a microsimulation modeling study to assess the net balance of benefits and harms from aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD and CRC, stratified by age, sex, and CVD risk level.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD (including history of myocardial infarction or stroke) who are not at increased risk for bleeding (eg, no history of gastrointestinal ulcers, recent bleeding, other medical conditions, or use of medications that increase bleeding risk).

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. (D recommendation).

### Evaluation of aspirin use with cancer incidence and survival among older adults in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial [^111izBAH]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin is recommended for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in individuals aged 50 to 59 years with high risk for that disease, with the additional stated benefit of a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. However, for those aged 60 to 69 years, recommendations are based on personalized risk-benefit profiles, and there is limited data for individuals younger than 50 years or older than 70 years. Despite potential risks, between 25% and 50% of adults in the United States have reported taking aspirin daily or every other day, with usage increasing with age. Long-term aspirin use has been associated with decreased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer (particularly gastrointestinal cancers), and all-cause mortality. Recent research suggests that aspirin use may offer protection against the development of and mortality from other cancer types as well. However, the benefits and harms of taking low-dose aspirin in older individuals is still debated, particularly in light of data from the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study that indicated increased cancer-associated mortality — but not cancer incidence — with long-term aspirin use in individuals aged 65 years or older who were not taking aspirin before study enrollment.

### Low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in Japanese patients 60 years or older with atherosclerotic risk factors: a randomized clinical trial [^111FaTk7]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases is an important public health priority in Japan due to an aging population.

Objective

To determine whether daily, low-dose aspirin reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events in older Japanese patients with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Japanese Primary Prevention Project (JPPP) was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial. Patients (N = 14,464) were aged 60 to 85 years, presenting with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes mellitus recruited by primary care physicians at 1007 clinics in Japan between March 2005 and June 2007, and were followed up for up to 6.5 years, with last follow-up in May 2012. A multidisciplinary expert panel (blinded to treatment assignments) adjudicated study outcomes.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to enteric-coated aspirin 100 mg/d or no aspirin in addition to ongoing medications.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite primary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes (myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular causes), nonfatal stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic, including undefined cerebrovascular events), and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes included individual end points.

Results

The study was terminated early by the data monitoring committee after a median follow-up of 5.02 years (interquartile range, 4.55–5.33) based on likely futility. In both the aspirin and no aspirin groups, 56 fatal events occurred. Patients with an occurrence of nonfatal stroke totaled 114 in the aspirin group and 108 in the no aspirin group; of nonfatal myocardial infarction, 20 in the aspirin group and 38 in the no aspirin group; of undefined cerebrovascular events, 3 in the aspirin group and 5 in the no aspirin group. The 5-year cumulative primary outcome event rate was not significantly different between the groups (2.77% [95% CI, 2.40%-3.20%] for aspirin vs 2.96% [95% CI, 2.58%-3.40%] for no aspirin; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77–1.15]; p = 0.54). Aspirin significantly reduced incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (0.30 [95% CI, 0.19–0.47] for aspirin vs 0.58 [95% CI, 0.42–0.81] for no aspirin; HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.31–0.91]; p = 0.02) and transient ischemic attack (0.26 [95% CI, 0.16–0.42] for aspirin vs 0.49 [95% CI, 0.35–0.69] for no aspirin; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.32–0.99]; p = 0.04), and significantly increased the risk of extracranial hemorrhage requiring transfusion or hospitalization (0.86 [95% CI, 0.67–1.11] for aspirin vs 0.51 [95% CI, 0.37–0.72] for no aspirin; HR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.22–2.81]; p = 0.004).

Conclusions and Relevance

Once-daily, low-dose aspirin did not significantly reduce the risk of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal myocardial infarction among Japanese patients 60 years or older with atherosclerotic risk factors.

### A randomised controlled trial of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of fractures in healthy older people: protocol for the ASPREE-fracture substudy [^114yGxfQ]. Injury Prevention (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Disability, mortality and healthcare burden from fractures in older people is a growing problem worldwide. Observational studies suggest that aspirin may reduce fracture risk. While these studies provide room for optimism, randomised controlled trials are needed. This paper describes the rationale and design of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE)-Fracture substudy, which aims to determine whether daily low-dose aspirin decreases fracture risk in healthy older people.

Methods

ASPREE is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial designed to assess whether daily active treatment using low-dose aspirin extends the duration of disability-free and dementia-free life in 19000 healthy older people recruited from Australian and US community settings. This substudy extends the ASPREE trial data collection to determine the effect of daily low-dose aspirin on fracture and fall-related hospital presentation risk in the 16500 ASPREE participants aged ≥ 70years recruited in Australia. The intervention is a once daily dose of enteric-coated aspirin (100mg) versus a matching placebo, randomised on a 1:1 basis. The primary outcome for this substudy is the occurrence of any fracture-vertebral, hip and non-vert-non-hip-occurring post randomisation. Fall-related hospital presentations are a secondary outcome.

Discussion

This substudy will determine whether a widely available, simple and inexpensive health intervention-aspirin-reduces the risk of fractures in older Australians. If it is demonstrated to safely reduce the risk of fractures and serious falls, it is possible that aspirin might provide a means of fracture prevention.

Trial Registration Number

The protocol for this substudy is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000347561).

### Short-term effects of daily aspirin on cancer incidence, mortality, and non-vascular death: analysis of the time course of risks and benefits in 51 randomised controlled trials [^117VNiYa]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Daily aspirin reduces the long-term risk of death due to cancer. However, the short-term effect is less certain, especially in women, effects on cancer incidence are largely unknown, and the time course of risk and benefit in primary prevention is unclear. We studied cancer deaths in all trials of daily aspirin versus control and the time course of effects of low-dose aspirin on cancer incidence and other outcomes in trials in primary prevention.

Methods

We studied individual patient data from randomised trials of daily aspirin versus no aspirin in prevention of vascular events. Death due to cancer, all non-vascular death, vascular death, and all deaths were assessed in all eligible trials. In trials of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention, we also established the time course of effects on incident cancer, major vascular events, and major extracranial bleeds, with stratification by age, sex, and smoking status.

Results

Allocation to aspirin reduced cancer deaths (562 vs 664 deaths; odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.96, p = 0.008; 34 trials, 69,224 participants), particularly from 5 years onwards (92 vs 145; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49–0.82, p = 0.0005), resulting in fewer non-vascular deaths overall (1021 vs 1173; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–0.96, p = 0.003; 51 trials, 77,549 participants). In trials in primary prevention, the reduction in non-vascular deaths accounted for 87 (91%) of 96 deaths prevented. In six trials of daily low-dose aspirin in primary prevention (35,535 participants), aspirin reduced cancer incidence from 3 years onwards (324 vs 421 cases; OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66–0.88, p = 0.0003) in women (132 vs 176; OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59–0.94, p = 0.01) and in men (192 vs 245; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63–0.93, p = 0.008). The reduced risk of major vascular events on aspirin was initially offset by an increased risk of major bleeding, but effects on both outcomes diminished with increasing follow-up, leaving only the reduced risk of cancer (absolute reduction 3.13 [95% CI 1.44–4.82] per 1000 patients per year) from 3 years onwards. Case-fatality from major extracranial bleeds was also lower on aspirin than on control (8/203 vs 15/132; OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12–0.83, p = 0.009).

Interpretation

Alongside the previously reported reduction by aspirin of the long-term risk of cancer death, the short-term reductions in cancer incidence and mortality and the decrease in risk of major extracranial bleeds with extended use, and their low case-fatality, add to the case for daily aspirin in prevention of cancer.

### Identifying and reducing inappropriate aspirin use in primary care [^113ypTqE]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

The ARRIVE study was conducted in seven countries and assessed the efficacy of aspirin 100 mg daily in reducing the risk of major CV events for patients at moderate risk, defined as the presence of three or more cardiovascular risk factors in men aged 55 or older and women aged 60 or older. The authors found no significant difference in a composite endpoint of MI, stroke, CV death, unstable angina or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) but did find significantly more gastrointestinal bleeding events in the aspirin group. The ASCEND study evaluated patients with diabetes and included both high-risk and low-risk patient groups. Findings from the ASCEND study demonstrated a reduction in CV events but more frequent bleeding events. Lastly, the ASPREE study investigated the utility of aspirin in prolonging the lives of healthy community-dwelling older adults with no history of vascular disease. There was no difference in a composite endpoint of death, the onset of dementia and persistent physical disability, and the study was terminated early. Notably, this population had an increased risk of all-cause mortality, primarily cancer-related death. Though many types of cancer were observed, there was a higher rate of death from colorectal cancer.

In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released updated primary prevention guidelines recommending that providers carefully assess atherosclerotic CVD risk and weigh this against bleeding risk before prescribing aspirin for primary prevention. Furthermore, these guidelines explicitly recommend against low-dose aspirin use for adults aged 70 and older. Though not published at this pilot study initiation, the USPSTF published a draft recommendation in October 2021 encouraging providers to avoid initiating low-dose aspirin for primary CV prevention in patients 60 years and older. In April 2022, the USPSTF published its final recommendations. For adults 40–59 with an ASCVD risk of 10% or greater, aspirin use for primary prevention should be made on a case-by-case basis. For adults aged 60 years and older, aspirin should not be initiated for primary prevention of CVD. Based on the supporting evidence used to generate these recommendations, the USPSTF also highlights that while the benefit of aspirin use is cumulative with time, the net benefit becomes smaller with age due to the increased risk of bleeding and suggests that it may be reasonable to discontinue aspirin at age 75 years or older. The Task Force does highlight the need for long-term data assessing the effects of low-dose aspirin on bleeding risk and colorectal cancer risk and mortality.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^111AFcoW]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Guidelines recommend against routine initiation of low-dose aspirin in older adults for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. This study aimed to estimate long-term and post-trial effects of aspirin on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major haemorrhage using extended follow-up of participants from the ASPREE trial.

Methods

In-trial (2010–17) and post-trial (2017–22) data were analysed. At enrolment, participants were aged ≥ 70 years (≥ 65 years for US minorities) without prior cardiovascular events, dementia, or independence-limiting physical disability. Randomization was to daily low-dose aspirin or matching placebo for the 4.7 years of the trial.

Results

Of the 19 114 participants randomized (9525 aspirin, 9589 placebo), 15 668 without in-trial MACE consented to post-trial follow-up. No long-term benefit of randomization to aspirin was observed for MACE for the entire in-trial and post-trial period [hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) .94, 1.15]. However, during the post-trial period (median 4.3 years), there was a higher rate of MACE (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01, 1.36) in those randomized to aspirin compared with placebo. Over the entire period, a higher rate of major haemorrhage was observed in the randomized aspirin group compared with placebo (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10, 1.39).

Conclusions

The present study provides novel evidence concerning long-term MACE and haemorrhage following aspirin use in initially healthy older adults. The finding of no long-term MACE benefit needs to be considered in clinical decision-making if aspirin is being considered for use in this context.

### Aspirin therapy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis [^112wYM4j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the use of oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) has been abandoned in primary cardiovascular prevention due to lack of a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, the indications for aspirin use in this setting continue to be a source of major debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. Here, we review the evidence in favor and against aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on the evidence accumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, we argue for a pragmatic approach to using low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention and suggest its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥ 2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.

### Effect of aspirin vs placebo on the prevention of depression in older people: a randomized clinical trial [^111wy4yv]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Depression is associated with increased inflammation, which may precede its onset, especially in older people. Some preclinical data suggest potential antidepressant effects of aspirin, supported by limited observational data suggesting lower rates of depression in individuals treated with aspirin. There currently appears to be no evidence-based pharmacotherapies for the primary prevention of depression.

Objective

To determine whether low-dose aspirin (100 mg) reduces the risk of depression in healthy older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was a substudy of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial, which examined if aspirin increased healthy life span, defined as survival free of dementia and disability. The prespecified secondary outcome was depression. Individuals of all races/ethnicities older than 70 years in Australia, as well as white individuals older than 70 years and black and Hispanic individuals older than 65 years in the United States, were included.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to aspirin (100 mg daily) or placebo, with a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 4.7 (3.5–5.6) years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a proxy measure of major depressive disorder defined as a score of 8 or more on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 10-item (CES-D-10) scale.

Results

Of the 19 114 participants enrolled in the trial, 9525 received aspirin and 9589 received a placebo. The mean (SD) age was 75.2(4.0) years in the aspirin group and 75.1(4.5) years in the placebo group; 9531 (56.4%) were women. Participants' demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline were similar between groups. A total of 79 886 annual CES-D-10 measurements were taken, with a mean of 4.2 measurements per participant. There were no significant differences at annual visits in the proportions of CES-D-10scores of 8 or more between the aspirin and placebo groups. The incidence rate of new CES-D-10scores of 8 or more was 70.4 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 69.1 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96–1.08]; p = 0.54).

Conclusions and Relevance

Low-dose aspirin did not prevent depression in this large-scale study of otherwise healthy older adults.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^112N7nwi]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prior to 2018, there was insufficient evidence to reliably inform whether daily, low-dose aspirin offered a potential benefit in older persons without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized clinical trial (RCT) found that aspirin did not extend disability-free survival or significantly reduce CVD events over a median of 4.7 years, but increased the risk of major haemorrhage and cancer death. This evidence contributed to new recommendations in clinical guidelines against routine aspirin initiation in older adults for primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD events. Notwithstanding this, after the guidelines were updated, an estimated 23%–46% of older adults in the US population still regularly take low-dose aspirin for primary prevention.

We have previously reported the immediate effects of aspirin within the ASPREE trial, both as a randomized comparison with placebo(and according to actual use and non-use of aspirin) including a hazard ratio (HR) of.95 [95% confidence interval (CI).83, 1.08] for CVD events, a secondary endpoint. We also reported effects on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included the conditions related to ischaemia and thrombosis that are most likely to be affected favourably by low-dose aspirin. Concerning MACE, a HR of.89 (95% CI.77, 1.03) for effects of aspirin vs placebo was seen in-trial. This, while not statistically significant, was of a magnitude consistent with significant results in meta-analyses. Specifically, meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention both before and after ASPREE and two contemporary trials [A Study of Cardiovascular Events iN Diabetes (ASCEND) and Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events (ARRIVE) in patients at moderate risk of CVD] showed significant reductions in vascular event rates in those assigned aspirin. These meta-analyses also found that any reduction in vascular events was accompanied by significantly elevated risk of major haemorrhage and no significant benefit on either vascular or all-cause death. Thus, consideration of aspirin for use in the primary prevention of MACE must weigh up relatively small cardiovascular benefits against established bleeding risks. This balance is of particular importance in older adults for whom the risks of both CVD events and bleeding are substantially elevated and in whom the ASPREE study found an elevated risk of all-cause death with aspirin.

### Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials [^111oBoek]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Low-dose aspirin is of definite and substantial net benefit for many people who already have occlusive vascular disease. We have assessed the benefits and risks in primary prevention.

Methods

We undertook meta-analyses of serious vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and major bleeds in six primary prevention trials (95,000 individuals at low average risk, 660,000 person-years, 3554 serious vascular events) and 16 secondary prevention trials (17,000 individuals at high average risk, 43,000 person-years, 3306 serious vascular events) that compared long-term aspirin versus control. We report intention-to-treat analyses of first events during the scheduled treatment period.

Findings

In the primary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events (0.51% aspirin vs 0.57% control per year, p = 0.0001), due mainly to a reduction of about a fifth in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.18%vs 0.23% per year, p < 0.0001). The net effect on stroke was not significant (0.20%vs 0.21% per year, p = 0.4: haemorrhagic stroke 0.04%vs 0.03%, p = 0.05; other stroke 0.16%vs 0.18% per year, p = 0.08). Vascular mortality did not differ significantly (0.19%vs 0.19% per year, p = 0.7). Aspirin allocation increased major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds (0.10%vs 0.07% per year, p < 0.0001), and the main risk factors for coronary disease were also risk factors for bleeding. In the secondary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a greater absolute reduction in serious vascular events (6.7%vs 8.2% per year, p < 0.0001), with a non-significant increase in haemorrhagic stroke but reductions of about a fifth in total stroke (2.08%vs 2.54% per year, p = 0.002) and in coronary events (4.3%vs 5.3% per year, p < 0.0001). In both primary and secondary prevention trials, the proportional reductions in the aggregate of all serious vascular events seemed similar for men and women.

Interpretation

In primary prevention without previous disease, aspirin is of uncertain net value as the reduction in occlusive events needs to be weighed against any increase in major bleeds. Further trials are in progress.

### The benefit-risk consideration in long-term use of alternate-day, low dose aspirin: focus on colorectal cancer prevention [^115UKKNW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Opinion

The WHS, the elaborate observational follow up of a large randomized trial involving several thousands of healthy women finally showed the effect of alternate-day, low dose aspirin on colorectal cancer after a median follow up of 18 years. These results are compatible with other recent studies results supporting a delayed effect of daily aspirin on colorectal cancer. In a previous meta-analysis, allocation to aspirin reduced the 20-year risk of colon cancer (incidence HR 0.76, 95%CI 0.60–0.96, P = 0.02) by 24%, especially of proximal colon cancer (HR 0.45, 95%CI 0.28–0.74, P = 0.001) while the HR for colorectal cancer in this WHS is 0.80 (HR 0.73 for proximal colon cancer).

In this trial, the long-term use of every other day low dose aspirin was chosen with the expectation of decreasing its common adverse effects of GI bleeding. A meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials of aspirin using doses of 75 to 325 mg per day estimated a HR for major GI bleeding of 1.55 (95%CI, 1.27–1.90) compared with their inert control reagents. A latest systematic review which focused on the possible harm of prophylactic aspirin use in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and cancer in randomized controlled trials showed an increased relative risk for GI bleeding by 37% (RR 1.37, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.62) in the aspirin group. The numbers of bleeding events for 10,000 persons followed for 10 years were 117–182 for GI bleedings, 46–48 for all kinds of major bleedings, and 8–10 for hemorrhagic strokes.

### Gastrointestinal effects of aspirin [^114ZxKPw]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is being used as an effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent at doses > 325 mg daily. At low doses (75–325 mg daily), aspirin is the key antiplatelet drug in the pharmacological prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Topical and systemic effects of aspirin in the gastrointestinal mucosa are associated with mucosal damage in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin is increased with old age, male sex, ulcer history and concomitant medication with NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitors, corticosteroids or other antithrombotic agents. In some patients, the cardiovascular benefits of low-dose aspirin might be overcome by the risk of gastrointestinal complications, but withdrawal of aspirin therapy can precipitate a cardiovascular event. These patients will need concomitant therapy with antisecretory agents, especially PPIs, to reduce the gastrointestinal risk. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection might be an additional option in patients with a history of ulcer. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that long-term use of aspirin decreases the risk of colorectal cancer, even at low doses. As aspirin is one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide and its clinical impact is huge, physicians need to consider the benefits and harms for each individual patient in order to maximize the benefits of aspirin.

Regarding preventative measures for hypertension, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, USPSTF 2022 guidelines recommend to individualize the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of CVDs in adults aged 40–59 years with a ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk, particularly in individuals not at increased risk for bleeding and willing to take low-dose aspirin daily.

### Role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116abzZB]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits of aspirin therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease clearly outweigh the risks of bleeding, and low-dose aspirin is uniformly recommended in this setting. However, no clear consensus exists about whether, and if so in whom, aspirin therapy is appropriate for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Three trials of low-dose aspirin versus placebo in three populations at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the absence of established cardiovascular disease were reported in 2018. The ASPREE trial in elderly people was terminated early for futility because aspirin had no effect on disability-free survival but significantly increased the risk of major haemorrhage and, unexpectedly, all-cause mortality. In the ASCEND trial in patients with diabetes mellitus and no evidence of vascular disease, aspirin significantly reduced serious vascular events but increased major bleeding. In the ARRIVE trial in people with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, aspirin had no effect on major cardiovascular events but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this Review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and to appraise whether the new evidence is likely to enable the more targeted use of aspirin in particular individuals for whom the net benefit is both clinically worthwhile and statistically definite.

### Bleeding risks with aspirin use for primary prevention in adults: a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^114f49y7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The balance between potential aspirin-related risks and benefits is critical in primary prevention.

Purpose

To evaluate the risk for serious bleeding with regular aspirin use in cardiovascular disease (CVD) primary prevention.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2010 through 6 January 2015), and relevant references from other reviews.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; and meta-analyses comparing aspirin with placebo or no treatment to prevent CVD or cancer in adults.

Data Extraction

One investigator abstracted data, another checked for accuracy, and 2 assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

In CVD primary prevention studies, very-low-dose aspirin use (≤ 100 mg daily or every other day) increased major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk by 58% (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 [95% CI, 1.29 to 1.95]) and hemorrhagic stroke risk by 27% (OR, 1.27 [CI, 0.96 to 1.68]). Projected excess bleeding events with aspirin depend on baseline assumptions. Estimated excess major bleeding events were 1.39 (CI, 0.70 to 2.28) for GI bleeding and 0.32 (CI, -0.05 to 0.82) for hemorrhagic stroke per 1000 person-years of aspirin exposure using baseline bleeding rates from a community-based observational sample. Such events could be greater among older persons, men, and those with CVD risk factors that also increase bleeding risk.

Limitations

Power to detect effects on hemorrhagic stroke was limited. Harms other than serious bleeding were not examined.

Conclusion

Consideration of the safety of primary prevention with aspirin requires an individualized assessment of aspirin's effects on bleeding risks and expected benefits because absolute bleeding risk may vary considerably by patient.

### Estimates of benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population [^115tnTDd]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

There is also uncertainty about whether there is an upper age at which the harms outweigh the benefits. For example the balance of benefit–harm in usage above the age of 70 may be different since bleeding events become more common and serious after this age, but the cancer rates also become higher. Ongoing ASPREE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01038583) may help address the question of low-dose aspirin use in elderly. There is also more heterogeneity and consequent uncertainty in the results for women, with smaller effects seen in the WHS trial, than in other studies.

The optimum dose for cancer prevention is also uncertain. Indirect comparisons show little difference between low-dose (75–100 mg/day) and standard-dose (300–325 mg/day) aspirin, although there are no direct randomised comparisons. There is no clear indication that doses higher than 300–325 mg are more effective in general population, although they may be needed in the adjuvant setting or for high-risk populations.

Although at current H. pylori prevalence, screen and treat before starting prophylactic aspirin appears a reasonable strategy, it may not remain cost-effective with declining prevalence.

A 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial could address all three of these questions — low versus standard dose, 5 versus 10 years duration of use and H. pylori screen-and-treat versus symptom-directed management. However, separate trials could be done if deemed logistically more attractive.

Further research is also needed to identify additional (e.g. genetic) factors associated with the risk of bleeding. Reliable data on minor bleeding episodes in general population are sparse. These events have an important influence on acceptability and adherence, and research to gather such data are needed. Much still remains to be learned in special populations at high risk, such as those with Barrett's oesophagus, where placebo-controlled trials are ongoing. It is important that these are continued and completed.

In summary, analysis of benefits and harms in the general population in the developed world suggests a net benefit for a minimum 5 years of aspirin prophylaxis starting between ages 50 and 65, for both men and women, with larger benefits for 10 years of use. Continuing aspirin use for a longer duration also appears to be beneficial; however, there is uncertainty about the age at which it should be stopped.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114DBJ9A]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Bleeding risk factors and aspirin dosing: The risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke, with or without aspirin use, increases with older age, and other risk factors include male sex, diabetes, history of gastrointestinal issues (such as peptic ulcer disease), liver disease, smoking, and elevated blood pressure; certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants, increase the risk of bleeding. The benefits of aspirin for CVD prevention appear similar for low dose (≤ 100 mg/d) and for all doses studied in CVD prevention trials (50 to 500 mg/d), and a pragmatic approach would be to use 81 mg/d, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the US.

### Effect of aspirin on all-cause mortality in the healthy elderly [^113fnGFX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the primary analysis of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial, now published in the Journal, we report that the daily use of aspirin did not provide a benefit with regard to the primary end point of disability-free survival among older adults. A numerically higher rate of the secondary end point of death from any cause was observed with aspirin than with placebo.

Methods

From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling persons in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥ 65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. Deaths were classified according to the underlying cause by adjudicators who were unaware of trial-group assignments. Hazard ratios were calculated to compare mortality between the aspirin group and the placebo group, and post hoc exploratory analyses of specific causes of death were performed.

Results

Of the 19,114 persons who were enrolled, 9525 were assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. A total of 1052 deaths occurred during a median of 4.7 years of follow-up. The risk of death from any cause was 12.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.1 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.29). Cancer was the major contributor to the higher mortality in the aspirin group, accounting for 1.6 excess deaths per 1000 person-years. Cancer-related death occurred in 3.1% of the participants in the aspirin group and in 2.3% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.56).

Conclusions

Higher all-cause mortality was observed among apparently healthy older adults who received daily aspirin than among those who received placebo and was attributed primarily to cancer-related death. In the context of previous studies, this result was unexpected and should be interpreted with caution.

### Low-dose aspirin and progression of age-related hearing loss: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^117D1o6V]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Age-related hearing loss is common in an aging population, affecting communication and contributing to a worsened quality of life. It occurs as a result of cochlear degeneration and may be further exacerbated by inflammation and microvascular changes, as observed in animal models.

Objective

To compare the effect of daily low-dose aspirin vs placebo on the progression of age-related hearing loss in healthy older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prespecified secondary analysis was conducted of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized clinical trial. Participants were 279 healthy community-dwelling individuals living in Australia who were aged 70 years or older and free of overt cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and life-limiting illnesses. Participants were recruited between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, and followed up over 3 years. Statistical analysis was completed from June to December 2023.

Intervention

A 100-mg daily dose of enteric-coated aspirin or matching placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hearing measures were air conduction audiometry and binaural speech perception in noise. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 18 months, and 3 years. The change from baseline hearing measures were analyzed using an intention to treat approach. Aspirin and placebo were compared using mixed linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, and smoking.

Results

Of 279 participants, 154 (55%) were male, and the median age at baseline was 73.1 years (IQR, 71.5–76.2 years). A total of 98 of 138 participants (71%) in the aspirin group and 94 of 141 participants (67%) in the placebo group reported experiencing hearing loss at baseline. Compared with placebo, aspirin did not affect the changes in mean (SD) 4-frequency average hearing threshold from baseline to year 3 (aspirin: baseline, 27.8 [13.3] dB; year 3, 30.7 [13.7] dB; difference, 3.3 [3.9] dB; placebo: baseline, 27.5 [12.6] dB; year 3, 30.9 [13.8] dB; difference, 3.0 [4.8] dB; p = 0.55) nor any other tested frequencies. An increase in air conduction threshold indicates a deterioration in hearing. Similarly, for the mean (SD) speech reception threshold, there was no significant difference observed between the aspirin and placebo group at the year 3 follow-up assessment (aspirin: baseline, -9.9 [3.8] dB; year 3, -9.1 [3.8] dB; difference, 0.9 [2.9] dB; placebo: baseline, -10.5 [7.1] dB; year 3, -9.6 [4.1] dB; difference, 0.9 [5.9] dB; p = 0.86). The findings were consistent across sex, age groups, diabetic and smoking status.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial, low-dose aspirin did not affect the progression of age-related hearing loss. More investigation is warranted on whether a longer follow-up or the use of a more powerful anti-inflammatory agent might prove beneficial.

### Effect of low-dose aspirin versus placebo on incidence of anemia in the elderly: a secondary analysis of the aspirin in reducing events in the elderly trial [^113fTaXC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Daily low-dose aspirin increases major bleeding; however, few studies have investigated its effect on iron deficiency and anemia.

Objective

To investigate the effect of low-dose aspirin on incident anemia, hemoglobin, and serum ferritin concentrations.

Design

Post hoc analysis of the ASPREE (ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01038583).

Setting

Primary/community care in Australia and the United States.

Participants

Community-dwelling persons aged 70 years or older (≥ 65 years for Black persons and Hispanic persons).

Intervention

100 mg of aspirin daily or placebo.

Measurements

Hemoglobin concentration was measured annually in all participants. Ferritin was measured at baseline and 3 years after random assignment in a large subset.

Results

19114 persons were randomly assigned. Anemia incidence in the aspirin and placebo groups was 51.2 events and 42.9 events per 1000 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.12 to 1.29]). Hemoglobin concentrations declined by 3.6 g/L per 5 years in the placebo group and the aspirin group experienced a steeper decline by 0.6 g/L per 5 years (CI, 0.3 to 1.0 g/L). In 7139 participants with ferritin measures at baseline and year 3, the aspirin group had greater prevalence than placebo of ferritin levels less than 45 µg/L at year 3 (465 [13%] vs. 350 [9.8%]) and greater overall decline in ferritin by 11.5% (CI, 9.3% to 13.7%) compared with placebo. A sensitivity analysis quantifying the effect of aspirin in the absence of major bleeding produced similar results.

Limitations

Hemoglobin was measured annually. No data were available on causes of anemia.

Conclusion

Low-dose aspirin increased incident anemia and decline in ferritin in otherwise healthy older adults, independent of major bleeding. Periodic monitoring of hemoglobin should be considered in older persons on aspirin.

### Daily low-dose aspirin and incident type 2 diabetes in community-dwelling healthy older adults: a post-hoc analysis of efficacy and safety in the ASPREE randomised placebo-controlled trial [^114qsGUX]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. This study investigated the randomised treatment effect of low-dose aspirin on incident type 2 diabetes and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations among older adults.

Methods

ASPREE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily oral low-dose aspirin. The study population included community-dwelling individuals aged 70 years or older (≥ 65 years for US minority ethnic groups) in the United States and Australia who were free of cardiovascular disease, independence-limiting physical disability, or dementia. For the post-hoc analysis, we excluded participants with diabetes at baseline or with incomplete or missing incident diabetes data during follow-up. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to oral 100 mg daily enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. Incident diabetes was defined as self-reported diabetes, commencement of glucose-lowering medication, or a FPG concentration of 7.0 mmol/L or more assessed at annual follow-up visits among participants with no diabetes at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards models and mixed-model repeated measures to assess the effect of aspirin on incident diabetes and FPG concentrations in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed major bleeding in participants who had taken at least one dose of study medication.

Findings

Between March 10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014, a total of 16209 participants were included (8086 [49.9%] randomly assigned to aspirin and 8123 [50.1%] randomly assigned to placebo). During a median follow-up of 4.7 years (IQR 3.6–5.7), 995 (in 6.1% individuals) incident cases of type 2 diabetes were recorded (459 in the aspirin group and 536 in the placebo group). Compared with placebo, the aspirin group had a 15% reduction in risk of incident diabetes (hazard ratio 0.85 [95% CI 0.75 to 0.97]; p = 0.013) and a slower rate of increase in FPG concentration at year 5 (between-group difference estimate -0.048 mmol/L [95% CI -0.079 to -0.018]; p = 0.0017). Major bleeding (major gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and clinically significant bleeding at other sites) occurred in 510 (3.2%) of 16104 participants (300 [3.7%] in the aspirin group and 210 [2.6%] in the placebo group). Compared with placebo, the aspirin group had a 44% increase in risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio 1.44 [95% CI 1.21 to 1.72]; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Aspirin treatment reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes and slowed the increase in FPG concentration but increased major bleeding among community-dwelling older adults. Given the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes among older adults, the potential for anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin to prevent type 2 diabetes or improve glucose levels warrants further study with a comprehensive assessment of all potential safety events of interest.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^117Fasrx]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Aspirin is an antiplatelet therapy drug and has been shown to protect against atherothrombosis while increasing the risk of major bleeding.
The recent United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease reflect this clinical tradeoff as well as the persistent struggle to define a population that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin therapy.
Reliable methods for quantifying platelet activity, including light transmission aggregometry and platelet transcriptomics, could be considered to identify individuals at elevated (platelet mediated) cardiovascular risk.
Clinical studies are needed to investigate whether a platelet-guided precision-based medicine approach will identify individuals who will benefit (eg, benefit > risk) with aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke.

In October 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a draft statement updating its guidelines on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The USPSTF recommends the following: (1) low-dose aspirin should not be initiated for primary prevention in individuals ages 60 years or older, and (2) initiation of low-dose aspirin should be considered on an individualized basis in adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 10%. With the update, the USPSTF no longer recommends routine aspirin prescription for primary CVD prevention in any population, a position consistent with the most recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology. The shift reflects a longstanding struggle to identify a population in which aspirin's clinical benefit for primary CVD prevention exceeds its bleeding risk.

### Daily low dose aspirin halves incident type 2 diabetes in elderly subjects with prediabetes: a five-year longitudinal cohort study in a real-word population [^113AsqrE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

We are aware that the simultaneous increase in bleeding risk may represent a major limit to the use of aspirin for treatment of diabetes, however it is now well accepted that prediabetes is more than just a reading on a glycemic scale since it represents a condition in which cardiovascular risks became more pronounced when compared with normoglycemia especially in a population with pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Based on multiple clinical trials, the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on ASCVD primary prevention narrowed recommendations on preventive aspirin use to those at higher ASCVD risk and 70 years old or younger without increased bleeding risk. Further attention to reducing low-value aspirin use in patients 60 years and older is warranted given 2022 recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force which downgraded their recommendation on low-dose aspirin for primary CVD prevention based on an extensive systematic review concluding that the cumulated evidence for aspirin prevention against colorectal cancer was inconclusive and that primary prevention of CVD events closely matched bleeding harms. However, a recent meta-analysis showing that cardiovascular risks rose after stopping aspirin according to these recommendations has suggested that patients with a high risk of ASCVD might benefit from a daily low-dose aspirin when the advantages of preventing an initial cardiovascular event outweighed the harms associated with the chance of bleeding. Our findings may indicate that adults older than 70 years with prediabetes who are receiving low-dose aspirin to prevent ASCVD may also benefit from a slower progression to T2DM.

### Daily low-dose aspirin and risk of serious falls and fractures in healthy older people: a substudy of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^111rHtH6]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Falls and fractures are frequent and deleterious to the health of older people. Aspirin has been reported to reduce bone fragility and slow bone loss.

Objective

To determine if daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg) reduces the risk of fractures or serious falls (fall-related hospital presentations) in healthy older men and women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This substudy of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial studied older adult men and women in 16 major sites across southeastern Australia. The ASPREE-FRACTURE substudy was conducted as part of the Australian component of the ASPREE trial. Between 2010 and 2014 healthy (free of cardiovascular disease, dementia or physical disability), community-dwelling volunteers aged 70 years or older were recruited to participate in the ASPREE trial. Potentially eligible participants were identified by medical practitioners and trial personnel and were then sent a letter of invitation to participate. Interested participants were screened for suitability. Eligible participants with medical practitioner authorization and adherent to a 4-week run-in medication trial were randomized. Data were analyzed from October 17, 2019, to August 31, 2022.

Interventions

Participants in the intervention group received a daily dose of oral 100 mg enteric-coated (low-dose) aspirin. The control group received a daily identical enteric-coated placebo tablet.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome of ASPREE-FRACTURE was the occurrence of any fracture. The secondary outcome was serious fall resulting in hospital presentation.

Results

In total, 16 703 people with a median (IQR) age of 74 (72–78) years were recruited, and 9179 (55.0%) were women. There were 8322 intervention participants and 8381 control participants included in the primary and secondary outcome analysis of 2865 fractures and 1688 serious falls over the median follow-up of 4.6 years. While there was no difference in the risk of first fracture between the intervention and control participants (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87–1.06; p = 0.50), aspirin was associated with a higher risk of serious falls (total falls 884 vs 804; incidence rate ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03–1.33; p = 0.01). Results remained unchanged in analyses that adjusted for covariates known to influence fracture and fall risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this substudy of a randomized clinical trial, the failure of low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of fractures while increasing the risk of serious falls adds to evidence that this agent provides little favorable benefit in a healthy, White older adult population.

Trial Registration

This substudy is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000347561).

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^11241qmc]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention — evidence and absolute effects: An individual participant data meta-analysis includes 95,000 individuals (660,000 person-years, 3,554 vascular events) from six large trials, and doses of aspirin varied between 75 mg and 300 mg without an apparent difference in benefit or harm. In low-risk patients, aspirin use would be associated with six fewer myocardial infarctions (MIs) and four more major bleeding events per 1,000 treated over a 10-year period, and aspirin would be associated with six fewer total deaths, but the 95% confidence interval includes zero fewer deaths. For moderate- to high-risk patients, aspirin reduces nonfatal MI (19 fewer/1,000 treated and 31 fewer/1,000 treated, respectively) and increases major bleeding (16 more/1,000 treated and 22 more/1,000 treated, respectively), with a similar impact on total mortality (six fewer total deaths). Relative effects include a vascular mortality relative risk of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87–1.09) and a reduction in cancer mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.87), translating to ~20 fewer cancer deaths (30 fewer to eight fewer) per 1,000 treated for 10 years; the larger absolute cancer mortality effect reflects a higher 10-year cancer mortality risk of 60 per 1,000 in trials vs a low 10-year total mortality of 10 per 1,000 in a 50-year-old man. The overall quality of evidence is rated as moderate given the imprecision in the relative effect estimates for total mortality.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^11273tu4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Purpose

To update a systematic review about the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 40 years or older and to evaluate effect modification in subpopulations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2008 to January 2015), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently reviewed 3396 abstracts and 65 articles according to prespecified criteria. All included trials evaluated aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction

Two investigators assessed study quality; data were abstracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second.

Data Synthesis

Two good-quality and 9 fair-quality randomized, controlled trials were identified. In analyses of all doses, aspirin reduced the risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (relative risk [RR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.87]) but not nonfatal stroke; aspirin showed little or no benefit for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Benefits began within the first 5 years. Older adults achieved greater relative MI reduction, but no other effect modifications were found in analyzed subpopulations. In trials with aspirin doses of 100 mg or less per day, the reduction in nonfatal MI benefit persisted (absolute risk reduction, 0.15 to 1.43 events per 1000 person-years) and a 14% reduction in nonfatal stroke benefit was noted, but no benefit was found for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95 [CI, 0.89 to 1.01]) or cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.97 [CI, 0.85 to 1.10]).

Limitation

Evidence for aspirin in primary prevention is heterogeneous and limited by rare events and few credible subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

The beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is modest and occurs at doses of 100 mg or less per day. Older adults seem to achieve a greater relative MI benefit.

### Long-term effect of aspirin on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality: 20-year follow-up of five randomised trials [^117MS8do]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

High-dose aspirin (≥ 500 mg daily) reduces long-term incidence of colorectal cancer, but adverse effects might limit its potential for long-term prevention. The long-term effectiveness of lower doses (75–300 mg daily) is unknown. We assessed the effects of aspirin on incidence and mortality due to colorectal cancer in relation to dose, duration of treatment, and site of tumour.

Methods

We followed up four randomised trials of aspirin versus control in primary (Thrombosis Prevention Trial, British Doctors Aspirin Trial) and secondary (Swedish Aspirin Low Dose Trial, UK-TIA Aspirin Trial) prevention of vascular events and one trial of different doses of aspirin (Dutch TIA Aspirin Trial) and established the effect of aspirin on risk of colorectal cancer over 20 years during and after the trials by analysis of pooled individual patient data.

Results

In the four trials of aspirin versus control (mean duration of scheduled treatment 6.0 years), 391 (2.8%) of 14033 patients had colorectal cancer during a median follow-up of 18.3 years. Allocation to aspirin reduced the 20-year risk of colon cancer (incidence hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 0.60–0.96, p = 0.02; mortality HR 0.65, 0.48–0.88, p = 0.005), but not rectal cancer (0.90, 0.63–1.30, p = 0.58; 0.80, 0.50–1.28, p = 0.35). Where subsite data were available, aspirin reduced risk of cancer of the proximal colon (0.45, 0.28–0.74, p = 0.001; 0.34, 0.18–0.66, p = 0.001), but not the distal colon (1.10, 0.73–1.64, p = 0.66; 1.21, 0.66–2.24, p = 0.54; for incidence difference p = 0.04, for mortality difference p = 0.01). However, benefit increased with scheduled duration of treatment, such that allocation to aspirin of 5 years or longer reduced risk of proximal colon cancer by about 70% (0.35, 0.20–0.63; 0.24, 0.11–0.52; both p < 0.0001) and also reduced risk of rectal cancer (0.58, 0.36–0.92, p = 0.02; 0.47, 0.26–0.87, p = 0.01). There was no increase in benefit at doses of aspirin greater than 75 mg daily, with an absolute reduction of 1.76% (0.61–2.91; p = 0.001) in 20-year risk of any fatal colorectal cancer after 5-years scheduled treatment with 75–300 mg daily. However, risk of fatal colorectal cancer was higher on 30 mg versus 283 mg daily on long-term follow-up of the Dutch TIA trial (odds ratio 2.02, 0.70–6.05, p = 0.15).

Interpretation

Aspirin taken for several years at doses of at least 75 mg daily reduced long-term incidence and mortality due to colorectal cancer. Benefit was greatest for cancers of the proximal colon, which are not otherwise prevented effectively by screening with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^114b5ED1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Clinical Dilemma

Aspirin has been widely used as an antipyretic and analgesic for centuries and became a staple of CVD prevention during the second half of the 20th century. By irreversibly inhibiting COX-1 (cyclooxygenase-1), aspirin confers protection against platelet-mediated thrombotic events while increasing bleeding risk, setting up its clinical risk-benefit tradeoff. Low-dose aspirin therapy has net value in secondary CVD prevention, reducing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events by 21% and all-cause mortality by 13% in individuals with preexisting CVD, although the same individuals have more than double the odds of severe bleeding. However, despite the almost 30 million Americans who take aspirin to prevent a first CV event, it is increasingly recognized that this preventive approach should be reassessed. As for the majority of individuals, the clinical risk-benefit tradeoff skews toward higher bleeding risk, and this is increasingly apparent with improved clinical management of other CV risk factors, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In those without preexisting CVD, aspirin yields only modest protection against CV events (0.41% absolute risk reduction) that does not outweigh the associated increased risk of major bleeding (0.47% absolute risk increase). In the absence of broader evidence of aspirin's utility for primary CVD prevention, past trials have attempted to identify specific groups that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin use. Many trials were designed based on the assumption that aspirin's CV benefit increases and bleeding risk remains stable with increasing CV risk of the enrolled population. However, the point on the baseline CV risk spectrum at which aspirin's risk-benefit tradeoff becomes favorable remains unknown and is dependent upon bleeding risk (Figure 1). Meanwhile, atherosclerotic CVD is the leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 605 000 first heart attacks and 610 000 first strokes each year.

Past primary cardiovascular disease prevention trials of low-dose aspirin have attempted to characterize the clinical benefit (blue line) and risk (red dashed lines) of aspirin therapy by the baseline cardiovascular risks of enrolled populations. However, the clinical risk-benefit threshold, that is, the baseline cardiovascular risk at which the benefit of aspirin therapy exceeds the risk, remains unknown and is dependent upon bleeding risk.

### Low-dose aspirin for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism [^112UEpPj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

The study ASPIRE was published by Brighton TA and colleagues in 2012 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the ASPIRE study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose aspirin in patients who have had a first episode of unprovoked VTE and have a high risk of recurrence after anticoagulants are discontinued? In the ASPIRE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ASPIRE study, the population was: 822 patients (375 female, 447 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of unprovoked VTE. The key exclusion criteria were first unprovoked episode of VTE > 2 years before enrollment; indication or contraindication for the use of aspirin, other antiplatelet therapy, or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug; indication for continuing oral anticoagulation therapy; or other medical problems that would interfere with participation in the trial or limit life expectancy. In the ASPIRE study, the interventions were: n = 411 aspirin (100 mg PO once daily, for up to 4 years) n = 411 placebo (matching placebo PO once daily, for up to 4 years). In the ASPIRE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of recurrent VTE (4.8% / y vs. 6.5% / y; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05). In the ASPIRE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the incidence of major vascular events (5.2% / y vs. 8% / y; HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92) Significant decrease in the incidence of VTE, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding, or death (6% / y vs. 9% / y; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91). In the ASPIRE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding or serious adverse events. In the ASPIRE study, the conclusion was: in patients who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of unprovoked VTE, aspirin was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of recurrent VTE.

Enhancing the effectiveness of aspirin by tailoring administration regimens is an important question among health professionals. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the effects of different aspirin regimens in terms of timing (chronotherapy) or frequency of dosing in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Only two out of the 28 included studies reported long-term cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting an evidence gap that future research should address. The remaining 26 studies used surrogate outcomes.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117FjWeB]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention — Implementation specifies to consider the patient's age. For adults aged 40 to 59 years, estimate CVD risk using a CVD risk estimator and, in patients whose estimated CVD risk is 10% or greater, use shared decision-making to inform the decision about initiating aspirin. For patients initiating aspirin use, it would be reasonable to use a dose of 81 mg/d. For adults 60 years or older, do not initiate aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. For potential discontinuation, for patients who are eligible and choose to start taking aspirin, the benefits become smaller with advancing age, and data suggest that clinicians and patients should consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113x3yZC]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the rather convincing evidence for comparable bleeding risk associated with the use of P2Y 12 inhibitors and low-dose aspirin, it is surprising and scientifically unjustified that a number of relatively small RCTs, aimed at improving haemostatic safety shortly after percutaneous coronary intervention, recently tested the largely expected safety advantage of stopping aspirin vs. continuing DAPT, with inadequate statistical power to detect any plausible loss in cardioprotection. The overall risk of bleeding was reduced by ∼50% in these trials, a figure quite similar to the 40% reduction associated with earlier discontinuation of clopidogrel in older trials. However, these studies did not address the clinically more relevant question of the benefit and potential hazard of stopping the P2Y 12 inhibitor vs. stopping aspirin as compared with continuing DAPT.

Further evidence supporting the concept that GI bleeding caused by low-dose aspirin is largely due to its antiplatelet effect is provided by the results of the PERFORM trial, a head-to-head randomized comparison of terutroban, a TP receptor antagonist, vs. low-dose aspirin (Table 1). Terutroban does not inhibit COX-1 or COX-2 and therefore does not impair the cytoprotective function of GI prostanoids. Antagonism of the platelet TXA 2 receptor by terutroban yielded no significant difference in major or life-threatening bleedings vs. inactivation of platelet COX-1 by aspirin 100 mg daily. Intracranial haemorrhage occurred in < 2% of the 19 100 patients with cerebral ischaemic events, with no statistically significant difference between groups (terutroban 1.54% vs. aspirin 1.28%; HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.94–1.53). Most importantly, no difference in the occurrence of GI bleedings was reported, based on 621 events during a 28 month follow-up (3.2% vs. 3.3%; HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.83–1.13).

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116YP4zX]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, the ASPREE randomized clinical trial is the first large-scale trial to study the risks and benefits of aspirin in an exclusively older primary prevention population, in which an increased tendency to bleeding may alter the balance of risks and benefits of aspirin. This is particularly relevant to intracerebral events because intracranial hemorrhage is typically less treatable than ischemic events and more frequently fatal or disabling. With previous aspirin trials in mostly younger participants, an excess of intracerebral hemorrhagic events was frequently noted among individuals receiving active treatment, although numbers were small and in most cases did not approach statistical significance.

The principal finding of this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial was an increase in intracerebral hemorrhagic events, which in absolute terms outweighed a smaller and nonsignificant reduction in ischemic strokes. Despite the older age of the cohort, incidences of both types of events were low, with an overall rate of 5.8 per 1000 person-years of follow-up. The incidence of ischemic stroke was 0.5 incidents per 1000 person-years of follow-up lower, which was not statistically significant, while that of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.7 incidents higher, which was statistically significant.

### Estimates of benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population [^117RXEuZ]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence supports an effect of aspirin in reducing cancer incidence and mortality. Our analyses show that prophylactic aspirin use for a minimum of 5 years at doses between 75 and 325 mg/day appears to have favourable benefit–harm profile; longer use is likely to have greater benefits. Further research is needed to determine the optimum dose and duration of use.

Strategies and Evidence

Past Randomized Trials

Initial trials of low-dose aspirin therapy for primary CVD prevention — including the Physicians' Health Study, TPT (Thrombosis Prevention Trial), HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study), and Primary Prevention Project (PPP) — suggested that aspirin conferred modest CV protection, particularly against nonfatal myocardial infarction, in individuals without established CVD. – Similarly, while the Women's Health Study did not show a reduction in its primary end point of major CV events with aspirin, it did suggest a modest benefit in women ages 65 years and older. A meta-analysis of these early trials showed a 12 and 14% odds of reduction in CV events associated with aspirin therapy in women and men, respectively. These CV risk reductions accompanied significant increases in major bleeding risk (68% and 72% in women and men, respectively). Given this clinical tradeoff and the assumption that aspirin's benefit increases with a patient's baseline CV risk, newer studies were designed in the mid to late 2000s to study primary preventive aspirin therapy in high-risk groups. ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE enrolled subjects with diabetes, subjects with multiple CVD risk factors and without diabetes, and the elderly, respectively. – Their results cast further doubt on aspirin's role in primary CV prevention, as ARRIVE and ASPREE did not show significant CV benefit with aspirin, and ASCEND demonstrated CV benefit that was counterbalanced by a substantial increase in the risk of major bleeding. However, it is important to note that despite the intention of recent trials to study higher-risk primary prevention populations, the event rates in ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE were ≈1% per year, consistent with lower-risk populations. Thus, the power of these studies was lower than expected, and the translatability of these findings to higher-risk primary prevention populations is uncertain.

Aspirin dosing and bleeding risk in established coronary artery disease (CAD) indicate no added efficacy with higher doses and increased bleeding with very high doses. Across different daily doses of aspirin (50–1,500 mg vs 160–325 mg vs 75–150 mg vs < 75 mg), direct comparisons of high- vs low-dose aspirin found no significant differences, and uncertainty remains for aspirin < 75 mg versus ≥ 75 mg; indirect comparisons found no evidence that high doses (eg, ≥ 160 mg/d) are more effective than 75 to 160 mg. A 2007 systematic review identified eight prospective trials including nearly 10,000 patients taking aspirin 30 to 1,300 mg/d, in which a significant benefit of higher doses was not identified and, in most, the lowest event rates were seen in lower-dose groups. Regarding bleeding, a review including > 190,000 patients in 31 randomized controlled trials found aspirin > 200 mg associated with an ~30% increase in major bleeding compared with doses < 200 mg (P = 0.05), and nonmajor bleeding increased in patients receiving 100 to 200 mg of aspirin per day compared with < 100 mg/d; the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no difference in major extracranial bleed across < 75, 75–150, and 160–325 mg compared with placebo, and did not comment on > 325 mg. Taken together, these findings provide moderate-quality evidence to support the use of aspirin 75 to 100 mg/d for patients with established CAD.

### Is aspirin useful in primary prevention? [^112YLe5M]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

There is no evidence that aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, although it may change the way that they present. Indeed, there is no evidence that long-term aspirin should be given to patients even with known cardiovascular disease. Theoretical arguments that aspirin can prevent cardiovascular events by reducing the propagation of thrombus are countered by evidence that plaque haemorrhage from vasa vasorum may also cause plaque growth and instability. There is evidence that aspirin causes serious bleeding into the brain and the gut. Aspirin may also detract from the benefits of drugs that have definite cardiovascular benefits, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Meta-analysis is prone to multiple biases in favour of aspirin, including publication bias, bias due to trial and endpoint selection and bias due to interpretation. Meta-analysis should not be relied on in preference to adequately powered clinical trials. Unfortunately, the benefits of aspirin, if they exist, may be so small that a very large study indeed would be required to demonstrate that its benefits outweigh its risks. The evidence that aspirin might reduce cancer is intriguing but relies on data from trials conducted many decades ago using a wide range of aspirin doses. There is no reliable evidence that aspirin used in the current fashionable doses of 50–100 mg/day is of any benefit in any common clinical setting.

### Aspirin for primary cardiovascular risk prevention and beyond in diabetes mellitus [^113qRmqk]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Daily administration of low-dose aspirin has proved to be beneficial in preventing recurrent cardiovascular events. However, the role of aspirin for primary prevention in patients with no overt cardiovascular disease is more controversial. In fact, in lower risk patients, the modest benefit in reducing serious vascular events can be offset by the increased risk of bleeding, including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Diabetes mellitus has been associated with a substantially increased risk of both first and recurrent atherothrombotic events, which makes aspirin therapy of potential value in these subjects. Moving from general aspects of aspirin pharmacology and specific issues in diabetes mellitus, this article reviews the literature on the topic of aspirin for primary prevention in general, and in subjects with diabetes mellitus in particular, to culminate with arguments pro and con and a practical risk-based algorithm for aspirin initiation in daily practice.

### Aspirin: promise and resistance in the new millennium [^115gLMMt]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2008). Low credibility.

Although conceived at the end of the 19th century, aspirin remains the gold standard of antiplatelet therapy. Approximately 100 randomized clinical trials have established its efficacy and safety in the prevention of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and vascular death among high-risk patients treated for a few weeks, at one end of the spectrum, and in low-risk subjects treated up to 10 years at the other. Despite this wealth of data, several issues continue to be debated concerning the use of aspirin as an antiplatelet agent, and novel opportunities appear on the horizon for this 110-year-old drug. These issues include: (1) the optimal dose for cardiovascular prophylaxis; (2) the uncertain threshold of cardiovascular risk for its use in primary prevention; (3) the apparent gender-related difference in its cardioprotective effects; (4) the increasingly popular theme of aspirin "resistance"; (5) the opportunities of chemoprevention in colorectal cancer; and (6) the renewed interest in aspirin as an analgesic agent in osteoarthritic patients at high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this review is to address these issues by integrating our current understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of the drug with the results of clinical trials and epidemiological studies of aspirin as an antiplatelet drug.

### The benefit-risk consideration in long-term use of alternate-day, low dose aspirin: focus on colorectal cancer prevention [^112ZAwBP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Although there have been no similar clinical trial, the low risk (HR 1.14) for GI bleeding in this study might support the advantage of the alternate-day taking method in long-term aspirin use, without compromising the reduction in the colorectal cancer risk. However, the information on GI bleeding and peptic ulcers was only self-reported during the extended follow up, and the severity of GI bleedings was not described clearly.

Moreover, it would be better if the extended post-trial effect on colorectal cancer risk was sub-analyzed according to different age groups for a more accurate risk-benefit calculation; the risk of adverse events during long-term aspirin use being higher in the elderly, especially in those with significant baseline predisposing risk factors. The US Preventive Services task force recommended against the routine use of aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention in 2007, based on available data and largely due to concerns about the adverse consequences of long-term aspirin use.

This study has three more limitations. Post-trial ascertainment bias could not be ruled out because some women did not undergo extended follow up and there was a possibility to enroll women who were more likely to have had endoscopic screening in the placebo group. Moreover, enrollment of women who had been more adherent to study pills (aspirin/placebo) could make the preventive effects during the post-trial follow up more evident by removing the diluted data from the less adherent subjects. Finally, the authors arbitrarily defined post-trial aspirin use as more than 3 days per month, but it is not clear what the scientific basis for the definition is.

Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study updates the current knowledge by suggesting that the use of even low doses of aspirin on alternate days could prevent colon carcinogenesis. A clear risk-benefit reconsideration in low risk populations should be determined in future studies.

### Effect of daily aspirin on long-term risk of death due to cancer: analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials [^115EJ2ij]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment with daily aspirin for 5 years or longer reduces subsequent risk of colorectal cancer. Several lines of evidence suggest that aspirin might also reduce risk of other cancers, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract, but proof in man is lacking. We studied deaths due to cancer during and after randomised trials of daily aspirin versus control done originally for prevention of vascular events.

Methods

We used individual patient data from all randomised trials of daily aspirin versus no aspirin with mean duration of scheduled trial treatment of 4 years or longer to determine the effect of allocation to aspirin on risk of cancer death in relation to scheduled duration of trial treatment for gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal cancers. In three large UK trials, long-term post-trial follow-up of individual patients was obtained from death certificates and cancer registries.

Results

In eight eligible trials (25570 patients, 674 cancer deaths), allocation to aspirin reduced death due to cancer (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92, p = 0.003). On analysis of individual patient data, which were available from seven trials (23535 patients, 657 cancer deaths), benefit was apparent only after 5 years' follow-up (all cancers, hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 0.50–0.87; gastrointestinal cancers, 0.46, 0.27–0.77; both p = 0.003). The 20-year risk of cancer death (1634 deaths in 12659 patients in three trials) remained lower in the aspirin groups than in the control groups (all solid cancers, HR 0.80, 0.72–0.88, p < 0.0001; gastrointestinal cancers, 0.65, 0.54–0.78, p < 0.0001), and benefit increased (interaction p = 0.01) with scheduled duration of trial treatment (≥ 7.5 years: all solid cancers, 0.69, 0.54–0.88, p = 0.003; gastrointestinal cancers, 0.41, 0.26–0.66, p = 0.0001). The latent period before an effect on deaths was about 5 years for oesophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer, but was more delayed for stomach, colorectal, and prostate cancer. For lung and oesophageal cancer, benefit was confined to adenocarcinomas, and the overall effect on 20-year risk of cancer death was greatest for adenocarcinomas (HR 0.66, 0.56–0.77, p < 0.0001). Benefit was unrelated to aspirin dose (75 mg upwards), sex, or smoking, but increased with age-the absolute reduction in 20-year risk of cancer death reaching 7.08% (2.42–11.74) at age 65 years and older.

Interpretation

Daily aspirin reduced deaths due to several common cancers during and after the trials. Benefit increased with duration of treatment and was consistent across the different study populations. These findings have implications for guidelines on use of aspirin and for understanding of carcinogenesis and its susceptibility to drug intervention.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1123TAAF]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

These data extend previously reported findings on stroke outcomes in ASPREE by focusing on first stroke and bleeding events and by directly comparing the potential benefit of aspirin on ischemic stroke prevention with risks of intracranial bleeding. Findings relate to a relatively healthy older population with extensive levels of blood pressure and lipid management and without preexisting cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. No subgroups were identified in which the effect of aspirin was substantially different from the mean.

The lack of an effect of aspirin in reducing ischemic stroke was notable given the higher age-related risk in this population and reported efficacy of aspirin in secondary stroke prevention. Of strokes occurring in the trial, 78.4% were adjudicated as ischemic in origin, and among etiological subtypes, the largest differences between individuals assigned to aspirin or placebo were in strokes caused by small vessel occlusion (11 cases fewer) and those of presumed cardioembolic origin (9 cases fewer). However, there was little difference in ischemic strokes of large-vessel origin in which an antiplatelet like aspirin may be anticipated to be most effective. The lack of benefit in this subgroup may be due to chance with small numbers. However, the finding is in keeping with the results of an early randomized placebo-controlled trial of aspirin (325 mg/d) in 372 individuals with a 50% or greater asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis, which showed no evidence of benefit over 2 years of follow-up.

### In healthy older adults, low-dose aspirin increases all-… [^111k6Dbj]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does low-dose aspirin reduce all-cause mortality in generally healthy older adults. Bottom Line The findings are completely unexpected. Although recent studies by this group and other groups of researchers have failed to find a cardiovascular benefit, likely because of better control of other cardiovascular risk factors, this study found increased all-cause mortality, primarily due to increased cancer-related mortality. Other studies, such as the individual patient meta-analysis by Rothwell and colleagues: 31–41), found the opposite. A Bayesian thinker would urge caution in interpreting these results, considering the existing body of research concluding the opposite regarding cancer-specific mortality. Synopsis This is one of three reports of the same study in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine; this one focuses on all-cause mortality.

The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly trial randomized 19, 114 community-dwelling adults to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. The study was conducted in the United States and Australia, with patients recruited between 2010 and 2014. Participants were 70 years or older, had no serious comorbidity that would be expected to limit their life expectancy to less than five years, and no known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, dementia, high bleeding risk, or contraindication to aspirin. All-cause mortality was higher in the aspirin group. The likelihood of cancer death was also higher in the aspirin group, with the increased risk beginning after approximately three years of aspirin use.

### Aspirin and cancer in older people-NCI… [^116QFmB6]. NCI (2020). Medium credibility.

Regular Aspirin Use May Increase Older People's Risk of Dying from Cancer, by Carmen Phillips Numerous studies have suggested that people who regularly take low doses of aspirin may have reduced risks of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer. But new findings from a randomized clinical trial, called ASPREE, suggest that the same may not hold true for older adults. The study included approximately 19, 000 generally healthy people who were 70 years of age or older. Those who took 100 mg of aspirin daily were no more likely than those who took a placebo to be diagnosed with cancer. They did, however, have a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with an advanced cancer and of dying from cancer, the ASPREE research team reported August 11 in. Following the Trail of Earlier Research The prospect that a cheap and relatively safe drug like aspirin could help reduce cancer risk has enticed researchers for decades.

Low-dose, or baby, aspirin is already widely used to lower the chances of heart-related events in people who have heart disease or who are otherwise at high risk of cardiac events. Included among those trials were those in people with Lynch syndrome, a condition that greatly heightens the likelihood of developing some cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. In one such trial, people with Lynch syndrome who regularly took high-dose aspirin daily for at least 2 years cut their colorectal cancer risk by more than a third. Several trials have also shown that aspirin reduces the risk of developing precancerous colon polyps. Initial results from ASPREE, published 2 years ago, showed that participants who had been randomly assigned to take daily low-dose aspirin had a modestly increased risk of dying from any cause compared with those who took a placebo.

The increased risk was due almost entirely to a higher number of cancer-related deaths among those who took aspirin. Is Age the Critical Factor. The findings raise a critical question, Dr. Ford said: Why would aspirin use lead to even a small increase in the risk of advanced cancer in older people. Studies linking aspirin use to decreased risks of cancer and dying from cancer were, she noted, largely done in younger populations. It could be because older people's biology is different than that of younger people, the study team proposed. For example, older people often already have weaker immune systems. And aspirin, they wrote, may be disrupting the immune system response that is "critical to controlling later stage growth and spread".

### Aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular… [^114FkGAU]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

CRC Prevention. Colorectal cancer prevention plays an important role in the overall health benefit of aspirin, but this benefit is not apparent until 10 years after aspirin therapy is started. Patients need to take aspirin for at least 5 to 10 years to realize this potential benefit, 6, 7 and persons with shorter life expectancy are less likely to benefit. Tables 2 and 3 present the USPSTF's estimated lifetime number of nonfatal MIs, ischemic strokes, and cases of CRC prevented, stratified by 10-year CVD risk level, age, and sex, among adults aged 50 to 69 years. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the greatest net benefit to be gained is by adults aged 50 to 59 years whose 10-year CVD risk is 10% or greater. The USPSTF recommends that persons in this age and risk group start taking aspirin.

Adults aged 60 to 69 years may also benefit from starting aspirin use, although the net benefit is smaller due to the increased risk for GI bleeding and decreased benefit in CRC prevention in this age group. TREATMENT AND DOSAGE The optimal dose of aspirin to prevent CVD events is not known. Primary prevention trials have demonstrated benefits with various regimens, including doses of 75 and 100 mg per day and 100 and 325 mg every other day. A dose of 75 mg per day seems as effective as higher doses. The risk for GI bleeding may increase with the dosage. A pragmatic approach consistent with the evidence is to prescribe 81 mg per day, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the United States. SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE REGARDING THE I STATEMENTS Potential Preventable Burden. Evidence from primary prevention trials on the benefits of initiating aspirin use in adults younger than 50 years is limited.

The potential benefit is probably lower than in adults aged 50 to 69 years because the risk for CVD events is lower. 8 Adults younger than 50 years who have an increased 10-year CVD risk may gain significant benefit from aspirin use; how much benefit is uncertain.

The task force also stated that the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and colorectal cancer in adults ages 60 to 69 with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one; that individuals in this group who were not at increased risk for bleeding, had a life expectancy of at least 10 years and were willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years were more likely to benefit; and that people who placed a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms might choose to initiate low-dose aspirin. Because fatal cardiovascular events were less common, pooled analyses that followed patients for between 3. 6 years and
10. 1 years showed that low-dose aspirin use was not associated with a statistically significant effect on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality or all-cause-mortality.

While evidence did not suggest that the relative effect of aspirin on CVD outcomes is modified by baseline CVD risk, the task force stated that the absolute magnitude of the benefit of effect is greater in those at higher CVD risk. Data from the modeling study, meanwhile, indicated that aspirin use in both men and women ages 40 to 50 years with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk generally provides a modest net benefit in quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained. In people ages 60 to 69, aspirin use provided slightly negative to slightly positive results based on CVD risk level, while in individuals ages 70 to 79, initiation of aspirin use resulted in a. loss of both quality-adjusted life years and life-years at virtually every CVD risk level modeled.

When examining the net lifetime benefit of continuous aspirin use until stopping at age 65, 70, 75, 80 or 85 years, the modeling data also suggested that there is generally little incremental lifetime net benefit in continuing aspirin use beyond the range of 75 to 80 years. A draft version of the recommendation statement was posted on the USPSTF website for public comment from Oct. 12, 2021, to Nov. 8, 2021. "For years, the message from doctors was to take a baby aspirin daily to help prevent a heart attack and stroke, especially if at increased risk, " Fisher added. "Now we know that the majority of patients who have not had a stroke or heart attack should not be taking a daily baby aspirin due to increased risks from bleeding".
