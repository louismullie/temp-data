## Question

What about multiple polyps

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about multiple polyps, specifically how to define them, how to risk-stratify them, how to manage them endoscopically and surgically, and how to surveil them afterward. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and thresholds that distinguish "multiple" from "polyposis". Then, I should verify the histologic types and their malignant potential. Next, I will risk-stratify based on number, size, histology, and multiplicity. After that, I need to check guideline-based surveillance intervals and when to consider hereditary syndromes. Finally, I will outline endoscopic and surgical management, special populations, and quality metrics that influence outcomes, making sure I cite high-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify patients. In routine practice, "multiple polyps" generally means more than two neoplastic lesions at a single colonoscopy, whereas "polyposis" implies a large burden such as 10 or more cumulative adenomas or 20 or more serrated polyps, which should trigger evaluation for hereditary syndromes and more intensive management, and I should remember that the exact thresholds vary by guideline and context, so I need to double-check the specific criteria before labeling someone as polyposis [^114nijRw] [^112BbLiz] [^116gR6q7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about histology. I need to classify the polyps because risk and surveillance hinge on type. Adenomas follow the traditional adenoma–carcinoma sequence, serrated polyps (hyperplastic, sessile serrated, traditional serrated) can progress via the CpG island methylator phenotype/BRAF pathway, and hamartomatous polyps such as juvenile polyps suggest syndromic risk when multiple, so I should confirm the mix of histologies on pathology before planning next steps [^1153LQ8t] [^113cCVtL] [^111XCVCa].

> Next, I should review risk stratification by number, because multiplicity independently predicts metachronous advanced neoplasia. Patients with three or more adenomas have higher recurrence risk than those with one or two, and having five or more neoplastic polyps of any type confers an approximately 2.6-fold increased odds of metachronous high-risk colorectal neoplasia, with risk rising to over 50% when more than 10 polyps are present, so I need to ensure I document the exact count and integrate it into the surveillance plan [^111CH4So] [^112B3Ewf] [^115YdyRg].

> I will now examine size and histology, since advanced features modify risk. Polyps 10 mm or larger, those with villous or tubulovillous histology, and those with high-grade dysplasia are high risk and warrant shorter surveillance intervals, and I should confirm that sessile serrated polyps with dysplasia or traditional serrated adenomas carry comparable risk to advanced adenomas, supporting a 3-year interval in many guidelines [^113WoS1w] [^116mTe62] [^112AgnjW].

> But wait, what if the patient has both adenomas and serrated polyps? I should double-check because mixed pathways reflect a more aggressive colonic phenotype with higher odds of advanced polyps, so even if individual lesions are small, the coexistence of serrated and adenomatous polyps should lower my threshold for closer surveillance and careful endoscopic technique to avoid interval cancers [^117P1JEX] [^114N618u].

> Let me think about surveillance intervals next, and I should verify guideline concordance. For 1–2 small adenomas without advanced features, 5–10 years is reasonable; for 3–4 adenomas under 10 mm, 3–5 years; for 5–10 adenomas or any advanced adenoma, 3 years; for more than 10 adenomas, consider 1–3 years and evaluate for polyposis; for 3–4 small sessile serrated polyps, 3–5 years; for 5–10 serrated polyps, 3 years; and for serrated polyps 10 mm or larger or with dysplasia, 3 years, noting that some data suggest even 1-year intervals for very high polyp burdens, though evidence quality varies and I should individualize based on endoscopic quality and patient factors [^112dkiMT] [^116mTe62] [^113HCVVy].

> Hold on, I should verify when to suspect hereditary syndromes because that changes everything. Ten or more cumulative adenomas, especially before age 60, or 20 or more at any age, should prompt germline testing for APC, MUTYH, and related genes; 20 or more serrated polyps or meeting WHO 2019 serrated polyposis criteria should prompt SPS evaluation; and multiple juvenile polyps should trigger SMAD4/BMPR1A testing, with management tailored to syndrome-specific cancer risks and extracolonic features [^114nijRw] [^112BbLiz] [^111XCVCa].

> I need to ensure endoscopic quality is addressed because missed lesions drive interval cancers. High-definition white light, adequate withdrawal time, and careful inspection behind folds are essential, and in patients with numerous or diminutive serrated lesions, chromoendoscopy can improve detection; if the prep is poor or the exam incomplete, I should repeat within 3 months to avoid undercounting and undertreatment [^11438B9H] [^117Ew5ky] [^115pRn9W].

> Next, I should review management principles. Remove all polyps feasible at index colonoscopy, prioritize larger or suspicious lesions for complete excision, and consider tattooing or photo documentation for difficult segments; for patients with very high polyp burdens where complete clearance is not possible, segmental colectomy may be indicated, and in confirmed FAP or MAP, prophylactic colectomy is often recommended given near-inevitable cancer risk if untreated [^116pnXmA] [^117875Kh] [^115RpysF].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, multiple juvenile polyps raise concern for JPS and warrant genetic counseling and age-appropriate surveillance; in patients with gallbladder polyps, multiple small polyps are usually cholesterol and benign, but size greater than 6–10 mm or solitary polyps carry higher malignancy risk and may justify cholecystectomy; and in gastric polyposis, especially fundic gland polyps in young patients, I should consider FAP and evaluate the colon accordingly [^111XCVCa] [^116q154c] [^113B4yHf].

> I should double-check that my surveillance plan aligns with evolving evidence. Some contemporary data suggest that total polyp number may outperform size and histology for predicting metachronous high-risk neoplasia, supporting shorter intervals for those with five or more polyps even if individually small, but I must balance this against guideline conservatism and the need for stronger prospective evidence before universally shortening intervals [^112B3Ewf] [^115YdyRg] [^113EWcz1].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are precise. I should record exact polyp counts, sizes, locations, histology, and dysplasia grade; communicate clear surveillance intervals; and, when polyposis is suspected, coordinate genetic counseling and family screening, because cascade testing can prevent cancer in relatives and refine risk for the index patient [^114nijRw] [^112BbLiz] [^116gR6q7].

Multiple polyps are defined as **three or more colorectal polyps** detected in a single colonoscopy or over a patient's lifetime [^112dkiMT]. They are clinically significant because they increase the risk of colorectal cancer, especially when there are five or more polyps or when polyps are large (> 10 mm), villous, or have high-grade dysplasia [^112B3Ewf] [^113WoS1w]. Management includes **complete polypectomy**, histopathology of all polyps, and risk-based surveillance intervals (typically 3 years for high-risk features, 5–10 years for low-risk) [^116mTe62] [^112dkiMT]. Patients with 10 or more cumulative adenomas or 20 or more serrated polyps should be evaluated for hereditary polyposis syndromes (FAP, MAP, SPS) and referred for genetic counseling [^114nijRw] [^112BbLiz]. High-quality colonoscopy with adequate bowel prep and experienced endoscopists is essential to minimize missed lesions and recurrence [^11438B9H] [^115pRn9W].

## Definition and classification

Multiple polyps are **typically defined as the presence of three or more colorectal polyps** in a single colonoscopy or cumulatively over a patient's lifetime [^notfound]. Polyps are classified by histology, size, and number, which guide risk stratification and management [^1176rL6E]:

- **Histology**: Adenomatous (tubular, tubulovillous, villous), serrated (hyperplastic, sessile serrated, traditional serrated adenoma), hamartomatous (juvenile, Peutz-Jeghers), and inflammatory polyps [^1153LQ8t].
- **Size**: Polyps are categorized as diminutive (< 5 mm), small (6–9 mm), or large (≥ 10 mm) [^notfound].
- **Number**: The risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia increases with the number of polyps, particularly when five or more are present [^112B3Ewf].

---

## Clinical significance and risk of malignancy

Multiple polyps are clinically significant because they **increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)** [^1153LQ8t]. The risk depends on the number, size, histology, and dysplasia grade:

- **Number**: Patients with five or more polyps have a significantly higher risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia than those with fewer polyps [^112B3Ewf].
- **Size**: Polyps ≥ 10 mm are associated with higher risk of advanced histology and malignancy [^notfound].
- **Histology**: Villous or tubulovillous adenomas and traditional serrated adenomas carry higher malignant potential than tubular adenomas [^notfound].
- **Dysplasia**: High-grade dysplasia markedly increases cancer risk [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnostic evaluation of multiple polyps includes:

- **Colonoscopy**: Gold standard for detection, characterization, and polypectomy [^1169GALX].
- **Histopathology**: Essential for all polyps to determine histology, dysplasia, and guide surveillance [^117GUqaK].
- **Genetic testing**: Indicated for patients with 10 or more cumulative adenomas, 20 or more serrated polyps, or a family history suggestive of hereditary polyposis syndromes (FAP, MAP, SPS) [^114nijRw] [^112BbLiz].

---

## Management strategies

Management of multiple polyps centers on **complete polypectomy** of all detected lesions, with histopathology guiding subsequent surveillance:

- **Polypectomy**: Complete removal of all polyps, with tattooing of difficult sites or piecemeal resections for large lesions [^117YXQCC].
- **Surveillance**: Risk-based intervals — typically 3 years for high-risk features (≥ 3 adenomas, ≥ 1 advanced adenoma, or ≥ 5 serrated polyps) and 5–10 years for low-risk features [^116mTe62] [^112dkiMT].
- **Genetic counseling**: For patients meeting criteria for hereditary polyposis syndromes [^114nijRw].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up colonoscopy intervals are determined by the **number, size, histology, and dysplasia** of polyps:

| **Risk category** | **Findings** | **Recommended surveillance interval** |
|-|-|-|
| Low risk | 1–2 small (< 10 mm) tubular adenomas without high-grade dysplasia | 5–10 years [^1169GALX] |
| Intermediate risk | 3–4 small adenomas or 1–2 adenomas with villous features or high-grade dysplasia | 3 years [^1169GALX] |
| High risk | ≥ 5 adenomas, ≥ 1 advanced adenoma (≥ 10 mm, villous, or high-grade dysplasia), or ≥ 5 serrated polyps | 3 years [^116mTe62] [^112AgnjW] |
| Hereditary syndromes | FAP, MAP, SPS | Annual colonoscopy or prophylactic colectomy [^114nijRw] [^116pnXmA] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Hereditary syndromes**: FAP, MAP, and SPS require genetic counseling, family screening, and individualized management plans [^114nijRw] [^112BbLiz].
- **Quality of colonoscopy**: High-quality colonoscopy with adequate bowel preparation and experienced endoscopists is critical to minimize missed lesions and recurrence [^11438B9H] [bc7a6171].
- **Patient education**: Patients should be informed about the significance of multiple polyps, the need for surveillance, and lifestyle modifications to reduce recurrence risk [^notfound].

---

Multiple polyps are defined as **three or more colorectal polyps** and carry an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Management includes complete polypectomy, histopathology, and risk-based surveillance, with genetic evaluation for high-risk patients. High-quality colonoscopy and patient education are essential to optimize outcomes.

Purpose Of Review

The goal of this review is to help providers recognize, diagnose and manage gastrointestinal (GI) polyposis syndromes.

Recent Findings

Intestinal polyps include a number of histological sub-types such as adenomas, serrated, hamartomas among others. Over a quarter of individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy are expected to have colonic adenomas. Although it is not uncommon for adults to have a few GI polyps in their lifetime, some individuals are found to have multiple polyps of varying histology throughout the GI tract. In these individuals, depending on polyp histology, number, location and size as well as extra-intestinal features and/or family history, a polyposis syndrome should be considered with appropriate testing and management.

Summary

Diagnosis and management of polyposis syndromes has evolved with advent of multigene panel testing and new data on optimal surveillance strategies. Evidence-based recommendations and current practice guidelines for polyposis syndromes are reviewed here. Areas of uncertainty and future research are also highlighted.

Adenomatous polyps are found on screening colonoscopy in 22.5% to 58.2% of the adult population and therefore represent a common problem. Patients with multiple adenomatous polyps are of unique interest because a proportion of these patients have an inheritable form of colorectal cancer. This article discusses the history and clinical features, genetic testing, surveillance, and treatments for the condition.

### Colon polyps… [^115bXHTX]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Colon Polyps A colon polyp is a growth protruding into the lumen from the colonic mucosa. The two main categories of polyps are neoplastic and nonneoplastic. Hyperplastic polyp is the most common nonneoplastic polyp. Common neoplastic polyps include adenomas and serrated polyps. HYPERPLASTIC POLYPS Hyperplastic polyps, which account for up to 50% of sigmoid and rectal polyps, are typically small, sessile polyps that measure 1 to 5 mm in size. 13 Because small hyperplastic polyps in the rectum and sigmoid rarely exhibit dysplasia or develop into colon cancer, colonoscopy may be repeated in 10 years if they are the only finding. 16 Although all adenomas are dysplastic, the degree of dysplasia is classified as low or high grade. High-grade dysplasia suggests that the polyp is evolving toward malignancy.

An adenoma that is 10 mm or larger, has villous elements, or has high-grade dysplasia, or the presence of three or more adenomas during a single examination, has a strong association with advanced neoplasia on future colonoscopies. 6, 17–19. SERRATED POLYPS Sessile serrated polyps are thought to be the principal precursor of hypermethylated gene cancers; 20% to 30% of colorectal cancers can arise from this pathway. HIGH-RISK POLYPS High-risk polyps include three to 10 tubular adenomas found during a single colonoscopy, at least one tubular adenoma or serrated polyp that is 10 mm or larger, at least one adenoma with villous features or high-grade dysplasia, a sessile serrated polyp with cytologic dysplasia, or a traditional serrated adenoma. Surveillance colonoscopy is recommended at three years for high-risk polyps.

MUTYH mutation analysis or genetic consultation should also be considered to evaluate for MUTYH-associated polyposis, an autosomal recessive disease associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. 23 The U. S. Multi-Society Task Force has also released guidelines on the genetic evaluation and management of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition and the most common cause of inherited colorectal cancer.

### The clinical significance of serrated polyps [^114yu3V6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disorder than arises via multiple distinct pathways, such as the serrated pathway, in which serrated polyps (including variants of hyperplastic polyps) are the precursor lesions. Approximately 15–20% of all CRCs arise via the serrated pathway, and these serrated carcinomas are clinically, morphologically, and molecularly distinct from conventional CRCs. The prevention of serrated carcinomas represents an important clinical challenge. Gastroenterologists need to recognize and remove potential precursor lesions and implement a post-polypectomy surveillance program when appropriate. This article focuses on the characteristics and significance of clinically relevant serrated polyps and addresses implications for CRC prevention practices.

### Hyperplastic polyposis of the colon and rectum [^113VmmpB]. Colorectal Disease (2002). Low credibility.

The significance of multiple hyperplastic polyps in relation to the risk of colon cancer is unknown although recent investigation suggests a causative link. We have prospectively identified a small but distinct group of patients that also suggests an association. These patients have either numerous (usually more than twenty, in sites other than the rectosigmoid alone) or large (greater than 1 cm) hyperplastic polyps, in association with either adenomatous polyps, polyps of mixed pathology or carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Additionally, there is frequently a first or second degree family history of colorectal carcinoma.

### Determinants of polyp size in patients undergoing screening colonoscopy [^116FheDN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that polyp size is related to several factors including race, and gender and that there appears to be a nearly linear relationship between polyp size and age. The strongest risk factor for increasing polyp size over time was the presence of multiple polyps. Our findings suggest that small polyps will require several decades before attaining clinically significant size. The study augments existing information about determinants of polyp size and can help adjust screening recommendations based upon individual patient parameters.

### Total polyp number may be more important than size and histology of polyps for prediction of metachronous high-risk colorectal neoplasms [^112B3Ewf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the presence of multiple neoplastic polyps (5 or more) was an independent risk factor for metachronous HR-CRN in patients who underwent colorectal polyp removal. Our results suggest that the total polyp number may be considered just as important, if not more important than the complex information about the size and histologic features of the polyps in determining the surveillance interval after colorectal polypectomy. To draw robust conclusions about surveillance colonoscopy at 1 year is beneficial in these high-risk patients, further prospective studies in a large cohort are needed.

Multiple polyps and FAP — In the setting of multiple hyperplastic or adenomatous polyps, we suggest systematic sampling of the surrounding nonpolypoid gastric mucosa to assess for H pylori and metaplastic atrophic gastritis. We suggest sampling and, when feasible, resection of large gastric polyps in patients with FAP to confirm histology and to assess for dysplasia.

### Hyperplastic polyps of the colorectum-innocent or guilty? [^116DKrxc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperplastic polyps have traditionally been regarded as nonneoplastic polyps lacking malignant potential. The demonstration of genetic alterations within these lesions indicates an underlying neoplastic cause. There is evidence that hyperplastic polyps are heterogeneous. Most are innocuous, but subsets may have malignant potential. Risk factors for neoplastic progression include multiple, large, and proximally located polyps. Aberrant methylation resulting in the silencing of cancer genes may be an important underlying mechanism, particularly in pathways progressing to tumors with DNA microsatellite instability. Lesions intermediate between hyperplastic polyp and cancer include admixed polyps and serrated adenomas. Currently, pathologists have different thresholds for diagnosing serrated adenomas, including the distinction from large hyperplastic polyps. Reasons for over looking this pathway in the past may include rapid tumor progression and the fact that proximally located hyperplastic polyps may be flat and not especially numerous. Management of the serrated pathway of colorectal neoplasia may require novel approaches to screening, early detection, and prevention.

### Colonic polyp histopathology and location in a community-based sample of older adults [^111conLB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Number of polyps

Polyps were classified as single or multiple in the registry. The prevalence of multiple polyps was higher in men (n = 2,735; 35.5%) than in women (n = 1,978; 32.0%), p < .0001. Multiple polyps were also more common with increasing age: age 50–59 years, 32.3%; 60–69 years, 34.3%; 70–79 years, 36.5%; and 80+ years, 35.7% (p = .001). Using age 50–59 years and sex as referent categories, the odds of having multiple (vs single) polyps was higher at older age, while female sex had lower odds relative to males (Table 4). Both age and sex effects were significant; an age by sex interaction was not found.

### How many polyps need to be histologically assessed when multiple polyps are submitted for the bowel cancer screening program? [^117GUqaK]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Since 2020 there has been an increase in the number of polyps removed from patients scoped for the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) of England. General cellular pathology workload also continues to increase disproportionately ahead of consultant pathologist numbers in the United Kingdom. The Optical Diagnosis initiative for BCSP patients has not yet, and may not be, implemented at every hospital in England. The following study therefore aimed to determine whether only a certain number of removed polyps need to be histologically assessed to consistently guide a BCSP patient's post-polypectomy management, and whether all remaining smaller polyps beyond that number could then be discarded.

Methods

This retrospective study considered all BCSP specimens/cases submitted to the Cellular Pathology department of a large English teaching hospital from 2016 to 2024. Only cases with six or more resected polyps, for which the endoscopic report stated individual sizes, were included in the final study cohort.

Results

Of the 8066 BCSP cases submitted to the aforementioned department, there were six or more polyps for 345 cases. Analysis of the final study cohort of 135 cases showed that assessment of the seven largest polyps measured endoscopically was sufficient to correctly guide follow-up management of the BCSP patient as per the 2020 British Society of Gastroenterology post-polypectomy guidelines.

Conclusions

When colonoscopy of a BCSP patient leads to removal of multiple polyps, only the seven largest polyps need to be assessed histologically and the remaining smaller polyps could be discarded with no impact to the patient's BCSP-related management.

### Are the site, diameter, and number of endometrial polyps related with symptomatology? [^11385Tc9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to evaluate the relationship among polyp site, number, diameter, and symptomatology in endometrial polyps in reproductive and postmenopausal women.

Study Design

One hundred fifty-five subjects with endometrial polyps were evaluated retrospectively. Sociodemographic characteristics, endometrial thickness, polyp number, diameter, and site were reviewed, and their relations with abnormal uterine bleeding were tested.

Results

A total of 36.1% of the patients in the postmenopausal group and 44.4% of the patients in the reproductive-aged group were asymptomatic. In addition, 37.3% of polyps in the reproductive-aged and 29.2% in the postmenopausal group were multiple. Polyp number, diameter, and site were not different among the 2 groups (P = 0.282, P = 0.469, and P = 0.485, respectively). When patients were evaluated as a whole, symptomatology was not related with polyp number, diameter, and site (P = 0.677, P = 0.334, and P = 0.699, respectively).

Conclusion

Many endometrial polyps are asymptomatic and multiple in nature. Polyp site, number, and diameter do not correlate with symptomatology.

### The endoscopist's guide to serrated polyposis [^112Zqq4w]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

Serrated polyposis is a condition of the colon characterized by multiple serrated polyps. This review aims to provide a practical guide to the day-to-day management of serrated polyposis, including diagnosis, endoscopic identification of serrated polyps, surveillance, the role of endoscopic and surgical management and the screening of family members.

Method

The literature was searched using PubMed and MEDLINE databases for the terms "serrated polyp", "serrated polyposis" and "hyperplastic polyposis". English-language abstracts were read and the full article was retrieved if relevant to the review. Expert opinion from the authors was also sought.

Results

Advances in our knowledge of the molecular pathways involved in serrated polyposis and an improved clinical picture of the disease from retrospective studies have led to better understanding of its pathogenesis and natural history. However, there are still areas not answered by the literature, and hence empirical management or expert opinion has to be followed.

Conclusion

Improvements in our understanding of serrated polyposis, together with improvements in endoscopic equipment and technique, have enabled the endoscopist to be at the forefront of managing this condition from diagnosis to endoscopic surveillance and control of the polyps.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^116Rjkb7]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

New papers since 2005 with surveillance outcomes after baseline colonoscopy — by category and number of studies: Exposure to colonoscopy (risk of colorectal cancer [CRC] and risk of proximal vs distal CRC) — 6 (18–22, 52); Exposure to colonoscopy: rate of CRC within 10 y — 4 (18, 20, 21, 52); No polyps at baseline: rates of advanced neoplasia — 6 (14, 47–51); Small adenomas < 10 mm — 7 (7, 14, 51, 64–67); Advanced adenomas — 3 (7, 14, 66); Serrated polyps — 2 (72, 73); Multiple rounds of surveillance — 3 (67, 77, 78).

### Endoscopy in pediatric polyposis syndromes: why, when and how [^115bRcg3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Single or multiple polyps are frequently encountered during colonoscopy among children and adolescents and may be indicative of hereditary polyposis syndrome (HPS). The management of children with single or multiple polyps is guided by the number of polyps, their distribution and the histological findings. Children with HPS carry a high risk of complications, including intestinal and extra-intestinal malignancies. The goals of surveillance in pediatric HPS are to treat symptoms, monitor the burden of polyps and prevent short- and long-term complications. Therefore, the management of children with HPS is based on therapeutic endoscopy. The strategy of therapeutic endoscopy is a careful assessment and characterization of the polyps and performing polypectomies using advanced endoscopic techniques. A multidisciplinary approach, comprising clinical, interventional endoscopy, cancer surveillance and support of familial and emotional aspects is essential in the management of children with HPS.

### Redefining familial adenomatous polyposis: competition, cooperation, and the path to monoclonality [^112otLby]. Familial Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by germline mutations in the APC gene that result in the development of hundreds of premalignant adenomas throughout the colon and rectum. Prophylactic surgery remains the primary intervention strategy, as there are currently no pharmacological treatment options for FAP patients. Previous therapeutic approaches have predominantly focused on reducing polyp size rather than preventing their initiation, thereby missing a key opportunity for early intervention. Crucially, to effectively target the earliest stages of tumour development requires a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying adenoma formation. In this review, we evaluate the latest models and methods employed to investigate the origin of FAP adenomas. We describe how mutant cells expand from their initial emergence within the intestinal epithelium and how they compete with normal cells within intestinal crypts. In addition, we discuss how multiple mutant crypts cooperate to collectively form polyclonal adenomas, and how these polyclonal lesions gradually transition towards monoclonality as adenomas progress towards colorectal cancer. Finally, we highlight how these insights inform the development of targeted cancer prevention strategies for individuals with FAP.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of premalignant and malignant conditions of the stomach [^114hG9aK]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Gastric polyps management — We recommend solitary gastric polyps undergo biopsy or be resected when possible. We suggest polypectomy of fundic gland polyps 1 cm or larger, hyperplastic polyps 0.5 cm or larger, and adenomatous polyps of any size. We suggest surveillance endoscopy 1 year after removing adenomatous gastric polyps. In the setting of multiple polyps, we recommend biopsy or resection of the largest polyps and representative biopsy specimens be taken from others.

### Total polyp number may be more important than size and histology of polyps for prediction of metachronous high-risk colorectal neoplasms [^113HCVVy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis reported that there was no significant difference in the risk of metachronous ACRN between patients with serrated polyps and those with conventional adenomas. However, because most studies included in this meta-analysis had not reported the results according to size or number of serrated polyps, this meta-analysis could not assess the comparative risk of metachronous ACRN between ACRN and ASP. In keeping with this, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommends a 3-year surveillance interval not only for both ACRN and ASP, but also in cases with 5–10 adenomas and 5–10 serrated lesions. In the present study, ACRN and ASP were not found to be independent risk factors for metachronous HR-CRN when surveillance colonoscopy was performed mostly within 3 years of the index colonoscopy. Therefore, applying the current U.S. recommendations for ACRN and ASP to Korean subjects seems reasonable. It is not clear whether one of these two main categories of advanced neoplastic polyps should be prioritized over the other. Nevertheless, as the risk for metachronous HR-CRN was higher in patients with multiple polyps (5 or more) regardless of the size and histology of each polyp, more intensive surveillance (at intervals shorter than 3 years) deserves consideration for patients who have 5 or more polyps when counted by combining adenomas and serrated lesions. However, because no trend in the proportion of patients who had metachronous HR-CRN was observed depending on the time interval of surveillance colonoscopy in the 1–3-year range, it is still unclear whether surveillance colonoscopy at 1 year is beneficial in these high-risk patients. Evidence for 1 year follow-up for multiple adenomas (more than 10) in the current U.S. guideline stems from a Korean study. However, in the present study, when we performed additional analysis, the presence of more than 10 polyps was not found to be a statistically significant independent risk factor for metachronous HR-CRN. Although, given that metachronous HR-CRN was found in 57% of patients with more than 10 neoplastic polyps, our study also suggests that shorter surveillance intervals are considerable for this patient group.

Multiple colorectal adenomas

​ We suggest an individualised approach to germline testing of patients with MCRA (defined as having 10 or more metachronous adenomas). Consider this testing for:

Patients under 60 years of age with lifetime total of ≥ 10 adenomas; or
Patients from 60 years of age with lifetime total of: ≥ 20 adenomas, or ≥ 10 adenomas and an FHCC or polyposis

(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)

Consensus reached: 91% agreement.

We suggest that patients with a finding of 10 or more polyps (adenomas or serrated lesions) should, at their next colonoscopy, have a high-quality colonoscopic assessment with pancolonic dye spray in order to accurately define the multiple polyp phenotype.

(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak)

Consensus reached: 89% agreement.

We suggest that the endoscopic management of patients with 10 or more metachronous adenomas, without MUTYH or APC gene mutations, should be individualised according to phenotype.

(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak)

Consensus reached: 91% agreement.

We suggest annual colonoscopic surveillance for patients with 10 or more metachronous adenomas after the colon has been cleared of all lesions > 5mm in size. If no polyps 10mm or greater in size are identified at subsequent surveillance examinations the interval can be extended to 2 yearly.

(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak)

Consensus reached: 80% agreement.

Patients with multiple adenomas but without classical familial adenomatous polyposis are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Approximately 1.1% of patients undergoing colonoscopy in the English bowel cancer screening programme have 10 or more adenomas. There is an association of adenoma multiplicity with metachronous advanced adenoma and/or CRC risk, with the degree of risk correlating with increasing adenoma number and size. With less than three adenomas as reference, Cubiella et al (n = 5401) reported a statistically increased risk for AN when three or four adenomas (14.8%), and also when five to nine adenomas (18.4%), were present at index colonoscopy.

### Total polyp number may be more important than size and histology of polyps for prediction of metachronous high-risk colorectal neoplasms [^115YdyRg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There are two main types of neoplastic polyps that have the malignant potential to progress to colorectal cancer — conventional adenomatous polyps and serrated polyps. Adenomatous polyps can be further categorized according to the following features: size, degree of dysplasia, and proportion of villous components. Serrated polyps can be further categorized into hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated lesions, and traditional serrated polyps. Many guidelines use these intrinsic factors and the number of polyps to suggest the adequate follow-up interval for surveillance colonoscopy after colorectal polypectomy. However, in clinical practice, determining the proper follow-up interval for each patient is not so straightforward. For example, many patients have both adenomatous polyps and serrated polyps. In case of a patient with both advanced adenomatous polyps and advanced serrated polyps, it is difficult to determine which polyp poses a higher risk of metachronous neoplasm and should therefore be prioritized for determining the follow-up interval of surveillance colonoscopy. In addition, it is also unclear whether the risk of metachronous colorectal neoplasm is as high in patients with multiple (≥ 3) but small (< 10 mm in size) adenomatous polyps without any high-risk histologic features as in patients with advanced adenomatous polyps. Therefore, we compared the risk of metachronous HR-CRN among the ACRN, ASP, and HRP groups and found that it was not significantly different among the three groups. Instead, the number of total polyps, regardless of size and other histologic features of each polyp, was independently associated with the risk of metachronous HR-CRN. The percentage of patients who had metachronous HR-CRN increased as the total number of polyps at index colonoscopy increased — metachronous HR-CRN was found in more than half (57%) of patients with more than 10 polyps. After adjusting for other factors, patients with multiple polyps (5 or more) had a higher risk of metachronous HR-CRN (OR 2.575). This result corresponds very well with that of a recent Spanish study, in which the presence of multiple polyps (3 or more adenomas and/or serrated polyps) was found to be a strong predictor of HR-CRN after index polypectomy. The study also did not find any histological characteristics that increased the risk of metachronous HR-CRN. However, contrary to our study, bowel preparation was not evaluated.

### Determinants of polyp size in patients undergoing screening colonoscopy [^115SQofm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

These comparatively small studies imply that polyp growth rates are inconsistent and that in some cases polyps diminish in size over time. Data from a modeling exercise based on the national polyp data postulated that a regression in polyp size could explain the discrepancy between the large number of polyps in the population and the observed incidence of colorectal cancer.

In our study, mean differences in polyp size were present for study variables in most age groups and were initially observed in the youngest patient groups. Size differences were particularly striking for the number of polyps: in both univariate and multivariate analysis multiplicity of polyps, present in about one-third of patients, was the strongest risk factor for polyp size. The size of the largest polyp in patients with multiple polyps was approximately 50% larger than the largest polyp found in patients with only a single polyp. This finding suggests that either the growth pattern of multiple polyps is more aggressive than single polyps, or that initial polyp formation in patients with multiple polyps begins considerably earlier than in patients with a single polyp. This finding provides strong evidence supporting the recommendation that the screening interval in patients with multiple polyps be shorter than for patients with single polyps.

This study confirms and extends the previously reported findings from the CORI database relating to age and race as determinants of polyp size. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, these two variables were strongly associated with polyp size in all age groups. In addition, gender, polyp location, and number of polyps were also found to be associated with polyp size.

Information about life style factors are not routinely collected in the CORI data set. Polyp formation has been related to factors such as smoking, alcohol and obesity and these factors could be important for polyp growth. Additional studies need to be performed to determine the relationship between factors that predict polyp size reported here and environmental and genetic factors. Factors such as age, gender, polyp location and polyp multiplicity along with environmental factors are likely to affect mutational rates of crypt cells causing differences in the growth rates of polyps. Genetic factors which lead to genetic instability and which affect the growth rate of precursors of colorectal cancer undoubtedly play an important role. Smoking and alcohol drinking are more prevalent in males and might explain the male/female differences in polyp size. It is of interest that a recent report based on colonoscopy screening in a different cohort found that smoking was significantly related to polyp size.

### Further defining the 2012 multi-society task force guidelines for surveillance of high-risk adenomas: is a 3-year interval needed for all patients? [^112QAnZo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Goals

We set out to determine whether variation from this 3-year follow-up interval was associated with the finding of subsequent high-risk adenoma (HRA).

Background

HRAs include the following: (1) an adenoma measuring ≥ 10mm, (2) ≥ 3 adenomas found during a single procedure, and (3) an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or villous architecture. The current Multi-Society Task Force guideline for timing of surveillance colonoscopy after removal of a HRA is 3 years.

Study

In 2016, we analyzed 495 patients who had a HRA removed during a 2008 colonoscopy. We compared the frequency of finding another HRA at follow-up intervals. We used the current guidelines as our referent group and performed logistical regression to identify whether any patient characteristics, procedural factors, or type of HRA predicted the development of HRAs on follow-up colonoscopy.

Results

Individuals who followed-up at a median of 4.5 years did not have more HRA on follow-up compared with those who followed-up at 3 years (25.2% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.062). These groups had similar baseline characteristics. Older individuals, male gender, having a history of polyps, and piecemeal resection of an HRA predicted future HRAs. The removal of ≥ 3 adenomas in 2008 as well as a combination of multiple, large, and advanced polyps showed a higher risk of future HRAs.

Conclusions

The 2012 Multi-Society Task Force recommendation of 3-year follow-up after removal of HRAs may not apply to all patients. We showed that a combination of patient demographics, procedural factors, and pathology best determines the surveillance colonoscopy interval.

### Gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes for the general gastroenterologist [^111P8GMs]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The occurrence of colonic polyps is a common phenomenon; however, where there are numerous adenomas or other polyps, and/or the patient is at a relatively young age, an inheritable form of gastrointestinal polyposis should be considered. Patients can present via different referral routes, for example, at colonoscopy where multiple polyps are detected, following a personal diagnosis of colorectal cancer, or by family screening. This article outlines the important considerations in the diagnosis of a polyposis syndrome and key diagnostic features to consider. It will also describe the underlying genetic factors associated with the common polyposis syndromes, including classical familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated FAP, MUTYH-associated adenomatous polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, Cowden syndrome and serrated polyposis, and the subsequent management of each condition.

### Frequent co-occurrence of high-grade dysplasia in large flat colonic polyps (> 20 mm) and synchronous polyps [^1145rJ8U]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations of the study

The majority of large flat polyps in our cohort was detected by primary or secondary (gastroenterological) centers and then referred to our institution for removal. This might introduce a selection bias towards polyps that are most difficult to resect, due to their morphology or location, e.g. in the proximal colon. In some cases, there was documented removal of small, synchronous polyps by external gastroenterologists prior to admission. We must therefore assume that the fraction of patients with synchronous polyps and the number of polyps per patients are underestimated by our study. In addition, a considerable proportion of colonoscopies could not be included in our analysis of synchronous polyps, as they were considered incomplete. This may introduce a selection bias, but comparison of clinic-pathological characteristics of polyps between the complete and incomplete colonoscopy group did not reveal significant differences (data not shown). Due to the retrospective design, there was no predefined scheme for the documentation of polyp morphology. In some cases, polyp morphology was determined by post hoc review of endoscopic images which is prone to inter-observer variation and thus imprecise. Furthermore, quality of bowel preparation and polyp detection rate of endoscopists were not documented in a standardized manner. Therefore, these parameters could not be comprehensively assessed in our retrospective approach. In addition, this study includes data from a period of ten years. During this time, improvements to endoscopy imaging technologies have been introduced which partially increased adenoma detection rates. In summary, these limitations indicate that the rate of synchronous polyps is likely underestimated due to our retrospective approach.

Clinical impact

What is the impact of this finding for clinical practice? First, our data underlines the importance of a complete colonoscopy prior to removal of large polyps, especially if high grade dysplasia or malignancy is highly suspected due to the presence of "red flags" (advanced age, localization in the rectosigmoid, large size). Secondly, surveillance after resection should always include a complete colonoscopy and not be restricted to the site of the large polyp. This is of particular importance as the incidence of metachronous cancer is higher in patients with synchronous polyps. Lastly, our data supports that endoscopic instead of surgical removal of large polyps should be considered first. Surgical removal of large polyps is associated with a considerable level of post-operative complications and may not be ideal to remove synchronous or metachronous adenomas at multiple sites. In contrast, endoscopic resection allows for repetitive and multilocal removal. If endoscopic removal fails, surgery can still be performed without compromising oncological outcome.

European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Other risk factors

The group recognises that other factors probably make gallbladder malignancy more likely. Some studies suggest that solitary gallbladder polyps, for example, are more likely to be malignant than multiple polyps, although the increased risk of malignancy in the systematic review by Bhatt et al. was only 2.05. Other studies, however, have shown this not to be significant on multivariate analysis. There are no robust data, to our knowledge, that suggest asymptomatic multiple polyps are less likely to be malignant than asymptomatic solitary polyps. The group concluded that a solitary polyp should not be included as a specific risk factor.

People of Indian ethnicity, as described above, appear to have increased risk of malignancy in gallbladder polyps. Other ethnic groups, for example East Asians, also appear to be at high risk of gallbladder cancer. To the best of our knowledge, however, there are no studies that have directly compared the prevalence of malignancy in gallbladder polyps in ethnic groups other than Indian. As such, whilst it may be that polyps in other ethnic groups are more likely to be malignant, this has not been fully established and as such was not included in the guidelines. This is again an area for future research.

Some authors have suggested that the presence of gallstones may be a risk factor for malignancy in gallbladder polyps. Aldouri et al. for example, demonstrated that the presence of gallstones was an independent risk factor but with borderline significance. Park et al. however, found that gallstones were not an independent risk factor on multivariate analysis. Again the evidence level in this area is low. The group concluded that there was insufficient evidence to include gallstones as a strong risk factor in the guidelines, but note that some of these patients are likely to be symptomatic and as such will undergo cholecystectomy anyway.

### Determinants of polyp size in patients undergoing screening colonoscopy [^111nxuDG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-existing polyps, especially large polyps, are known to be the major source for colorectal cancer, but there is limited available information about factors that are associated with polyp size and polyp growth. We aim to determine factors associated with polyp size in different age groups.

Methods

Colonoscopy data were prospectively collected from 67 adult gastrointestinal practice sites in the United States between 2002 and 2007 using a computer-generated endoscopic report form. Data were transmitted to and stored in a central data repository, where all asymptomatic white (n = 78352) and black (n = 4289) patients who had a polyp finding on screening colonoscopy were identified. Univariate and multivariate analysis of age, gender, performance site, race, polyp location, number of polyps, and family history as risk factors associated with the size of the largest polyp detected at colonoscopy.

Results

In both genders, size of the largest polyp increased progressively with age in all age groups (P < .0001). In subjects ≥ 80 years the relative risk was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.35–1.79) compared to subjects in the youngest age group. With the exception of family history, all study variables were significantly associated with polyp size (P < .0001), with multiple polyps (≥ 2 versus 1) having the strongest risk: 3.41 (95% CI, 3.29–3.54).

Conclusions

In both genders there is a significant increase in polyp size detected during screening colonoscopy with increasing age. Important additional risk factors associated with increasing polyp size are gender, race, polyp location, and number of polyps, with polyp multiplicity being the strongest risk factor. Previous family history of bowel cancer was not a risk factor.

### AGA clinical practice update on high-quality upper endoscopy: expert review [^112iXmGu]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA high-quality upper endoscopy — gastric polyps biopsy approach — Polyps should be biopsied or preferably resected to definitively establish a histologic diagnosis, particularly if there is only a solitary polyp; if multiple polyps, then the largest polyp(s) should be resected, and representative samples taken from the remaining polyps. Biopsy specimens of intervening mucosa for gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and H pylori should be considered if clinical suspicion for hyperplastic or adenomatous polyps, and polypectomy of larger polyps can provide more accurate histology because histologic features may be patchy within a lesion.

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^1176rL6E]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer — evidence review and recommendation development used PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome) questions and database searches of PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and The Cochrane Collaboration; English language articles since January 1, 2012 were retrieved; searches were run on March 30, 2017 and identified a total of 49 unique articles; the literature search was repeated through September 2018 to identify additional articles; criteria used for inclusion/exclusion of titles, abstracts, and articles are outlined in Table 1; titles were reviewed by a single author, abstracts by 2 authors with potentially relevant articles selected for full review, and included articles reviewed in detail by the same 2 authors; references relevant to final recommendations were identified through joint consensus. Background framing states that risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia is associated with findings on prior colonoscopy, that after high-quality colonoscopy patients with no neoplasia are at the lowest risk and those with polyps are risk-stratified by histology, number, location, and size, and that the aim was to review newly available evidence and update recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy with or without polypectomy.

### Polygenic risk score is a predictor of adenomatous polyps at screening colonoscopy [^115dSCx8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective analysis of screening colonoscopy data from 1769 patients at a community-based, high volume healthcare system involving four hospital-based gastroenterology labs and two free-standing endoscopy units, we developed and characterized a SNP-based, odds ratio-weighted and population-standardized polygenic genetic risk score (GRS). Our results demonstrated the GRS was significantly higher for patients who had adenomatous polyps on colonoscopy compared to those who did not (Table 1). Furthermore, this novel association was independent of age, gender, BMI and family history on multivariable analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the proportion of cases with adenomatous polyps trended up in patients stratified by three tertiles of GRS, which is similar to previous studies.

Based on our findings, higher GRS risk groups have an earlier diagnosis of adenomatous polyps (Fig. 2). Kaplan–Meier time-to-event analysis from birth (time = zero) to first screening colonoscopy identifying an adenomatous polyp(s) differed significantly among the three GRS risk groups based on the Log rank test. The time-to-event analysis is justified for germline predictors such as GRS because they can be measured at age zero. Since the probability of finding a polyp increases with age, this analysis demonstrates the predictive nature for adenomatous polyps across GRS risks at any given age. Furthermore, in order to reconcile the possibility that the lower GRS group simply includes older subjects when they underwent first colonoscopy, we calculated mean age at colonoscopy for the three GRS groups: 59.0, 60.4, and 60.6 years for subjects with low, intermediate and high GRS with p = value 0.51. Therefore, this observation is unlikely driven by age at first colonoscopy.

Furthermore, the predictive value of GRS for adenomatous polyps versus no adenomatous polyps was primarily driven by polyps measuring greater than or equal to 0.5 cm (Table 2). For polyps > 1 cm (i.e. advanced adenomas), our data shows a trend toward similar predictive value which is consistent with prior studies. The lack of statistical significance is presumably related to small sample size; only 126 of the total 1769 patients had advanced adenomas in our study population. Table 2 also suggests that GRS was predictive of a single polyp, but not of multiple polyps. Thus, higher GRS increases the susceptibility to initiation of any polyps (any number, size and/or location). Likewise, as seen with other types of cancer, GRS may therefore be associated with susceptibility to cancer, not the aggressiveness of cancer.

### Polyp characteristics of nonsyndromic and potentially syndromic juvenile polyps: a retrospective cohort analysis [^11687Pz8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

JPs are predominantly isolated hamartomatous lesions with a low risk of recurrence. They are the most frequent explanation for painless hematochezia in children and can give rise to abdominal pain and anemia. JPs are thought to harbor very low risk of progression to colorectal cancer unless syndromic, but there is ambiguity on the precise number of polyps in the defining syndromic JPs. The incidence of JPS in children has been estimated at 1:100,000 to 1:160,000. The polyps associated with JPS are frequently multiple and tend to a more distal colonic distribution.

Isolated larger distal lesions are the most common phenotype of nonsyndromic JP. Patients with small polyp burden have historically been considered low risk for polyp recurrence and there have been no evidence-based pediatric guidelines for surveillance colonoscopy in these patients. Previous reports suggest that recurrent polyp formation is common in JPs, and can occur even with solitary polyps. In our cohort, recurrence of polyps was related to initial polyp burden even in the subgroup of patients traditionally thought of as not harboring a syndromic pattern of disease (2–4 polyps; Table 2). Older age does not relate to increased polyp burden, arguing against a cumulative burden effect over time.

The accepted paradigm for the development of colorectal cancer CRC — adenocarcinoma in pediatric and most adult patients is a dysplastic evolution from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. CRC accounts for 1% of all childhood malignancies and has an incidence of approximately 1 per million. The pathogenesis of development of pediatric CRC is still not well understood. Pediatric CRC may arise in the setting of predisposing conditions, such as polyposis syndromes and inflammatory bowel disease, but it more frequently develops in children without known predisposing factors.

Adenomatous transformation within JP has traditionally been considered a characteristic of syndromic JP and separately, is suspected to be an intermediary in the progression toward CRC; however, adenomatous foci have been reported in sporadic JP and adenocarcinoma of the colon has been reported in both children and adults with nonsyndromic JP. The significance of adenomatous transformation in nonsyndromic JP is unknown. In the largest cohort of pediatric patients with CRC available to date, Hill et al reported that 17 out of the 77 patients with CRC had 1 or more polyps identified at the time of operation. Nine patients had single polyps, 6 of which were JPs. Other studies have shown the presence of immunohistochemical markers associated with progression through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in subjects with syndromic JPs, and solitary JPs.

### Increased risk of colorectal cancer in patients with multiple serrated polyps and their first-degree relatives [^111xwXTV]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

We investigated whether patients with multiple serrated polyps, but not meeting the World Health Organization criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome, and their relatives have similar risks for colorectal cancer (CRC) as those diagnosed with serrated polyposis.

Methods

We collected data from patients with more than 10 colonic polyps, recruited in 2008–2009 from 24 hospitals in Spain for a study of causes of multiple colonic polyps. We analyzed data from 53 patients who met the criteria for serrated polyposis and 145 patients who did not meet these criteria, but who had more than 10 polyps throughout the colon, of which more than 50% were serrated. We calculated age- and sex-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for CRC in both groups, as well as in their first-degree relatives.

Results

The prevalence of CRC was similar between patients with confirmed serrated polyposis and multiple serrated polyps (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–2.82; P = 0.40). The SIR for CRC in patients with serrated polyposis (0.51; 95% CI, 0.01–2.82) did not differ significantly from the SIR for CRC in patients with multiple serrated polyps (0.74; 95% CI, 0.20–1.90; P = 0.70). The SIR for CRC also did not differ significantly between first-degree relatives of these groups (serrated polyposis: 3.28, 95% CI, 2.16–4.77; multiple serrated polyps: 2.79, 95% CI, 2.10–3.63; P = 0.50). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no differences in the incidence of CRC between groups during the follow-up period (log-rank, 0.6).

Conclusions

The risk of CRC in patients with multiple serrated polyps who do not meet the criteria for serrated polyposis, and in their first-degree relatives, is similar to that of patients diagnosed with serrated polyposis.

### Pathways of carcinogenesis are reflected in patterns of polyp pathology in patients screened for colorectal cancer [^117P1JEX]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There are multiple genetic routes to colorectal cancer, including chromosomal instability, mismatch repair dysfunction, and global hypermethylation. Few consider the possibility that multiple pathways are synchronously active.

Objective

This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that multiple synchronous carcinogenic pathways would result in an enhanced neoplastic phenotype.

Setting

This study took place during outpatient screening colonoscopy.

Patients

Patient were included who were undergoing colonoscopies for average and familial risk for colorectal cancer.

Design

Adenomas were evidence of chromosomal instability or DNA mismatch repair dysfunction, and serrated polyps of CpG island hypermethylation. Patients with 1 or 2 polyps were compared with those with > 2 polyps, with polyps more than 10-mm diameter (advanced) as the end point.

Results

There were 1408 patients: 524 at average risk (41%) and 884 (59%) with a family history. Polyps were found in 47.7% of the average-risk patients and in 45.9% of patients with a family history. Adenoma detection rates were 33.8% and 30.4%, and serrated polyp detection rates were 24.8% and 23.9%. There were more advanced polyps in all patients with > 2 polyps than in those with 1 or 2 (36.2% vs 13.6%, P < .002), as well as in the subgroup of patients having average-risk screening (50% vs 11.1%, P < .001). Having a combination of > 2 adenomas and serrated polyps in the same colon increased the risk of finding advanced polyps compared with adenomas or serrated polyps alone (serrated polyps, 12.7%; > 2 adenomas, 17.7%; both, 27.1%; P = 0.02).

Limitations

Serrated polyps were not subclassified by histology.

Conclusion

Coexistence of serrated and adenomatous polyps reflects a colon prone to advanced polyps, and potentially cancer.

### Serrated polyposis syndrome: defining the epidemiology and predicting the risk of dysplasia [^115EnXA3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is characterised by multiple serrated lesions throughout the colorectum, and carries 19.9% risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Prevention of CRC involves timely detection and removal of serrated lesions, however little understood about the aetiology and predictors of SPS.

SPS is the most common colonic polyposis syndrome, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 111 in screening populations. SPS is characterised by multiple colorectal serrated lesions, which include hyperplastic polyps (HPs), sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs). These lesions arise throughout the colorectum via the serrated neoplasia pathway. SPS likely represents a disease spectrum with a high degree of heterogeneity, influenced by genetic predisposition and environmental factors. As no definite genetic aetiology for SPS has been identified, clinicians must solely rely upon the World Health Organisation's (WHO) clinical criteria, defined by accumulative presence of:

≥ 5 serrated lesions proximal to the rectum, all being ≥ 5 mm in size, with ≥ 2 being ≥ 10 mm in size and/or > 20 serrated lesions of any size distributed throughout the large bowel, with ≥ 5 being proximal to the rectum.

Despite its neoplastic potential, SPS is suspected to be underdiagnosed, due to unavailability of previous pathology, endoscopy reports, and failure of clinicians to correctly apply the diagnostic criteria. Understanding the clinical and endoscopic risk factors of SPS, will assist clinicians to avoid underdiagnosis. However, to date there is a lack of data regarding the prevalence of SPS globally. A significant limitation of most studies assessing clinical factors are the small sample sizes, inconsistent nomenclature, and changing endoscopic practices.

SSLs pose a significant challenge to clinicians for several reasons. Firstly, a disproportionate number of interval CRC is linked to the serrated neoplasia pathway. Secondly, SSLs have been shown to be difficult to detect, due to their inconspicuous colour, flat or sessile morphology, paucity of surface vessels, and camouflaging mucus cap. This has led to variation in detection rates among endoscopists. Histopathologists are also challenged due to microscopic similarities shared with other serrated lesions. Finally, due to their difficult to demarcate and indistinct boarders, SSLs are often incompletely resected.

Hereditary cancer/polyposis risk

Management of patients with a higher than average risk of CRC due to hereditary CRC syndromes, serrated polyposis syndrome and other high familial CRC risk are covered in separate guidelines that have been developed by the BSG, ACPGBI and UK Cancer Genetics Group (UKCGG) (in press), and are not addressed within this guideline. Clinicians should refer to those guidelines in the following situations:

More than 20 serrated polyps of any size distributed throughout the large bowel, with at least five proximal to the rectum included in the final polyp count. The polyp count is cumulative over multiple colonoscopies.

### Association of gallbladder diseases with risk of gastrointestinal polyps [^113k5uiq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The presence of gallbladder polyps is significantly associated with colorectal polyps and gastric plus colorectal polyps. Therefore, screening endoscopy should be considered for patients with gallbladder polyps, especially for those with gallbladder polyps ≥ 0.5 cm or multiple gallbladder polyps and for female patients.

Malignant colorectal polyp — tumor budding: Tumor budding is "defined as foci of isolated cancer cells or a cluster of 5 or fewer cancer cells at the invasive margin of the polyp", and multiple studies associate it with lymph node metastasis (LNM). A meta-analysis of "13 other studies (n = 7066)" reported tumor budding as an independent LNM risk factor (OR, 4.59; 95% CI, 3.44–6.13). In 290 surgically resected malignant polyps, tumor budding was present in "42%" of LNM-positive tumors vs "18%" of LNM-negative tumors (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1–5.0). International consensus statements specify that budding is best assessed as "a single tumor cell or a cell cluster consisting of 4 or fewer tumor cells" and that tumor budding "should be assessed in addition to other" factors.

### Defining phenotypes and cancer risk in hyperplastic polyposis syndrome [^111dG5Qu]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperplastic polyposis syndrome is a rare syndrome of colorectal cancer predisposition. Patterns of inheritance of hyperplastic polyposis syndrome are not obvious and the clinical definition is relatively arbitrary. We hypothesize that there are multiple phenotypes included in what is currently called hyperplastic polyposis syndrome. We performed this review of a large series of patients who presented with multiple serrated polyps to look for clinical patterns that may confirm our hypothesis.

Methods

Hereditary colorectal cancer, colonoscopy, and clinical databases from a single institution were queried for patients meeting the following criteria: 1) ≥ 20 serrated colorectal polyps; 2) ≥ 5 serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid; 3) ≥ 2 serrated polyps ≥ 10 mm in size; 4) any serrated polyps in a person with at least one first-degree relative who has hyperplastic polyposis syndrome. Records were reviewed for demographics, polyp details, and personal or family history of colorectal extracolonic malignancy.

Results

One-hundred fifteen patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 62 years and 56% were male. Ninety-seven percent were white. Twenty-five percent of patients had a personal history and 38% had a family history of colorectal cancer. Twenty-eight percent of patients had a personal history and 54% had a family history of extracolonic cancer. Phenotype analysis identified 3 patterns: relatively few large, right-sided polyps (n = 55), many small left-sided polyps (n = 18), and a combination of both left- and right-sided polyps (n = 42). The right-sided phenotype had more sessile serrated polyps and tended to develop colorectal cancer at a younger age.

Conclusions

There are at least 3 different but overlapping clinical phenotypes within hyperplastic polyposis. Recognizing this clinical heterogeneity is important in defining underlying genetic causes.

Categorization of polyp numbers reported

Information on polyp numbers was summarized in three categories: "few", "multiple", and "massive". "Few" encompasses descriptions such as "few", "some", or 1–4 polyps; "multiple" such as "multiple", "numerous", "several", "many", or 5–99 polyps; and "massive" containing "massive", "diffuse", "carpeted", "lots", or ≥ 100 polyps.

Statistical methods

Statistical comparison of patients' features, encompassing phenotypic characteristics and molecular status, was done using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables (e.g. gender, presence of symptoms), or Student's t test for continuous variables (e.g. age at diagnosis), with all of the probabilities reported as two-tailed P values, considering p < 0.05 to be statistically significant. All calculations were done either in Microsoft Excel 2016 or Stat View v.4.5 (Abacus Concepts).

### Chromoscopy versus conventional endoscopy for the detection of polyps in the colon and rectum [^117Ew5ky]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although conventional colonoscopy is the most sensitive test available for the investigation of the colorectum for polyps, there are data that raise concerns about its sensitivity. Chromoscopy may be one way of enhancing the ability for colonoscopy to detect polyps particularly diminutive flat lesions that may be otherwise difficult to detect.

Objectives

To determine whether the use of chromoscopy enhances detection of polyps and neoplasia during endoscopic examination of the colon and rectum.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases were searched (April 2010) along with a hand search of abstracts from relevant meetings. Search terms included randomised trials containing combinations of the following: 'chromoscopy' 'colonoscopy' 'dye-spray' 'chromo-endoscopy' 'indigo-carmine' 'magnifying endoscopy'.

Selection Criteria

All prospective randomised trials comparing chromoscopic with conventional endoscopic examination of the lower gastrointestinal tract were included. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or polyposis syndromes were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trials. Outcome measures included the detection of polyps (neoplastic and non-neoplastic), the detection of diminutive lesions, the number of patients with multiple neoplastic lesions and the extubation time.

Main Results

Five trials were included in this update, and although there were some methodological drawbacks and differences in study design, combining the results showed a significant difference in favour of chromoscopy for all detection outcomes. In particular, chromoscopy is likely to yield significantly more patients with at least one neoplastic lesion (OR 1.67 (CI 1.29–2.15)) and significantly more patients with three or more neoplastic lesions (OR 2.55 (CI 1.49–4.36)). Not surprisingly the withdrawal times were significantly slower for the chromoscopy group.

Authors' Conclusions

There appears to be strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of neoplasia in the colon and rectum. Patients with neoplastic polyps, particularly those with multiple polyps, are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Such lesions, which presumably would be missed with conventional colonoscopy, could contribute to the interval cancer numbers on any surveillance programme.

### Germline mutations incould be associated with serrated polyposis syndrome [^112V16xC]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide with a significant associated mortality. Aside from lung cancer, with an avoidable environmental cause, CRC is responsible for more deaths than any other malignancy in Western countries. The vast majority of CRC cases develop through an adenoma-carcinoma sequence. In recent years, another carcinogenesis pathway has been identified: the serrated pathway, starting from a different precancerous lesion, the serrated polyp. Although serrated polyps were previously considered indolent, current evidence estimates they are the precursor lesion for up to 30% of CRC cases.

Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is a clinical condition characterised by the presence of multiple and/or large serrated polyps in the colon, as well as an associated higher risk of CRC. The following criteria were established by the WHO in 2010 in order to help identifying SPS patients: (1) at least five serrated lesions/polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon with two or more of these being > 10 mm, (2) any number of serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon in an individual who has a first-degree relative with serrated polyposis and (3) > 20 serrated polyps of any size but distributed throughout the colon. This arbitrary definition is not based on any genetic alteration and has been considered somehow restrictive, leading to underdiagnosis of this syndrome. Recently, it was updated to not include the second criterion. Also, new criterion I includes polyps proximal to the rectum and polyps now have to be ≥ 5 mm. The updated criterion II now explicitly states that ≥ 5 of the serrated polyps should be located proximal to the rectum. Although its prevalence in the population is unknown, it could be higher than expected according to data from CRC screening. It is also probably underrecognised due insufficient knowledge in the medical community, the difficult endoscopic detection of serrated lesions/polyps (small size and flat morphology), the lack of understanding regarding germline predisposition and the absence of associated symptoms.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^113B4yHf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Gastric epithelial polyps — fundic gland polyps (FGPs) management includes that biopsy of the flat mucosa surrounding the gastric polyp and Sydney protocol biopsies are indicated, unless the polyp is clearly an FGP. Sporadic FGPs are typically small, hyperemic, sessile with a smooth surface contour, occur exclusively in the gastric fundus and corpus, may develop after long-term PPI use, and are not associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma; the risk of progression for these patients is essentially nil. Multiple FGPs (> 50) in young patients, especially those not taking PPIs, should raise suspicion for FAP and other polyposis syndromes, and these patients should be referred for genetic evaluation and colonoscopy; approximately one-third of FGPs in patients with FAP have surface dysplasia, but most do not progress except in GAPPS.

### Colon polyp surveillance: separating the wheat from the chaff [^113EWcz1]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

One goal of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is to prevent CRC incidence by removing precancerous colonic polyps, which are detected in up to 50% of screening examinations. Yet, the lifetime risk of CRC is 3.9%-4.3%, so it is clear that most of these individuals with polyps would not develop CRC in their lifetime. It is, therefore, a challenge to determine which individuals with polyps will benefit from follow-up, and at what intervals. There is some evidence that individuals with advanced polyps, based on size and histology, benefit from intensive surveillance. However, a large proportion of individuals will have small polyps without advanced histologic features (ie, "nonadvanced"), where the benefits of surveillance are uncertain and controversial. Demand for surveillance will further increase as more polyps are detected due to increased screening uptake, recent United States recommendations to expand screening to younger individuals, and emergence of polyp detection technology. We review the current understanding and clinical implications of the natural history, biology, and outcomes associated with various categories of colon polyps based on size, histology, and number. Our aims are to highlight key knowledge gaps, specifically focusing on certain categories of polyps that may not be associated with future CRC risk, and to provide insights to inform research priorities and potential management strategies. Optimization of CRC prevention programs based on updated knowledge about the future risks associated with various colon polyps is essential to ensure cost-effective screening and surveillance, wise use of resources, and inform efforts to personalize recommendations.

### Using the results of a baseline and a surveillance colonoscopy to predict recurrent adenomas with high-risk characteristics [^112hZ7fs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Suggested intervals for postpolypectomy surveillance colonoscopy are currently based on the adenoma findings from the most recent examination.

Objective

To determine the risk for clinically significant adenoma recurrence on the basis of the results of 2 previous colonoscopies.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Academic and private centers in North America.

Patients

Participants in an adenoma chemoprevention trial in which all participants had 1 or more adenoma found on complete colonoscopy at entry. For this analysis, only participants whose qualifying adenoma was their first were included. All participants then underwent second and third study colonoscopies at roughly 3-year intervals.

Measurements

Proportion of patients with high-risk findings at the third study colonoscopy — either at least 1 advanced (≥ 1 cm or advanced histology) adenoma or multiple (≥ 3) adenomas.

Results

Fifty-eight of 564 participants (10.3%) had high-risk findings at the third study examination. If the second examination showed high-risk findings, then results from the first examination added no significant information about the probability of high-risk findings on the third examination (18.2% for high-risk findings on the first examination vs. 20.0% for low-risk findings on the first examination; P = 0.78). If the second examination showed no adenomas, then the results from the first examination added significant information about the probability of high-risk findings on the third examination (12.3% if the first examination had high-risk findings vs. 4.9% if the first examination had low-risk findings; P = 0.015).

Limitation

This observational study cannot specifically examine adenoma recurrence risk at intervals suggested for patients with low-risk adenomas (for example, 5 years vs. 10 years).

Conclusion

Information from 2 previous examinations may help identify low-risk populations that benefit little from intense surveillance. Surveillance guidelines might be tailored in selected patients to use information from 2 previous examinations, not just the most recent one.

### A practice guideline from the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors: referral indications for cancer predisposition assessment [^111XCVCa]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Juvenile polyposis syndrome (OMIM 174900) is caused by mutations in SMAD4 (20%) and BMPR1A (20%) and involves juvenile-type hamartomatous polyps throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; cancer risk in affected families ranges from 9 to 50%, and extraintestinal features can include valvular heart disease (11%), telangiectasia or vascular anomalies (9%, all in SMAD4 carriers), and macrocephaly (11%). Referral should be considered for individuals with a personal history of or first-degree relative with three to five cumulative histologically proven juvenile GI polyps, any number of juvenile GI polyps with a positive family history of juvenile polyposis syndrome, or multiple juvenile polyps located throughout the GI tract; the term juvenile polyp refers to the histologic type, not age at diagnosis.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^116q154c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

SAGES laparoscopic biliary surgery — gallbladder polyps: Polypoid lesions can be found in about 1–5% of adults on ultrasound in Western populations and 9.6% in Asian populations; gallbladder polyps are most frequently cholesterol polyps, usually small (less than 1cm) and multiple, and tend to remain stable. In Western patients, size is the only reliable indicator for malignant potential, with all malignancies found in polyps greater than 6mm, though non-Western populations may develop malignancies in smaller polyps. There are no randomized studies to direct decisions, and management remains controversial; a reasonable approach would include laparoscopic cholecystectomy for larger, especially single, polyps or those with associated symptoms with watchful waiting for small (< 5mm) asymptomatic polyps.

### Risk factors for metachronous colorectal cancer or advanced lesions after endoscopic resection of serrated polyps: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112AgnjW]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Serrated polyps (SPs) are precursors to 15% to 20% of colorectal cancers (CRCs). However, there are uncertainties regarding which SPs require surveillance and at what intervals, with recommendations adapted from those for adenomas in the absence of solid evidence. Our aim was to assess which SP risk characteristics relate to a higher risk of metachronous CRC or advanced polyps.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for cohort studies, case-control studies, and clinical trials from inception to December 31, 2023, of CRC or advanced polyps (advanced adenoma [AA] or advanced SP) incidence at surveillance stratified by baseline SP size, dysplasia, location, and multiplicity. We defined advanced SPs as those ≥ 10 mm or with dysplasia. CRC and advanced polyp incidence per 1000 person-years were estimated. We performed a meta-analysis by calculating pooled relative risks (RRs) using a random-effects model.

Results

A total of 5903 studies were reviewed, and 14 were included with 493,949 patients (mean age, 59.5 years; 55% men). The mean follow-up was 4.9 years. CRC incidence per 1000 person-years was 2.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–2.90) for advanced SPs, 1.52 (95% CI, 0.78–2.25) for SPs of ≥ 10 mm, 5.86 (95% CI, 2.16–9.56) for SPs with dysplasia, 1.18 (95% CI, 0.77–1.60) for proximal SPs, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.08–1.12) for ≥ 3 SPs, 0.50 (95% CI, 0.35–0.66) for nonadvanced SPs, and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.41–0.46) for normal colonoscopy findings. Metachronous CRC risk was higher in advanced SPs versus nonadvanced SPs (RR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.11–3.04) and versus normal colonoscopy findings (RR, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.26–3.77), in SPs of ≥ 10 mm versus < 10 mm (RR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.43–4.77) and versus normal colonoscopy findings (RR: 3.52; 95% CI, 2.17–5.69); and in SPs with dysplasia versus normal colonoscopy findings (RR: 2.71; 95% CI, 2.00–3.67). No increase in CRC or advanced polyp risk was found in patients with proximal versus distal SPs, nor in ≥ 3 SPs versus 1 or 2 SPs.

Conclusions

CRC risk is significantly higher in patients with baseline advanced SPs after 4.9 years of follow-up, with risk magnitudes similar to those described for AA, supporting the current recommendation for 3-year surveillance in patients with advanced SPs.

### DNA-methylation variability in normal mucosa: a field cancerization marker in patients with adenomatous polyps [^1169rwLG]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). Medium credibility.

Targeted nature of DNA methylation dysregulation in patients with adenomas

To investigate whether DNA methylation dysregulation in AP patients is genome-wide or targeted to specific CpG sites, we compared classifiers using aDVMC-based DNA methylation outliers to those using 1) randomly selected CpGs and 2) 5% of the most variable CpGs in healthy tissue (Supplementary Figures 3 and 6, available online, Methods). The aDVMC-based classifier consistently outperformed the others, indicating targeted CpG site dysregulation rather than a genome-wide effect. We thus hypothesize that DNA methylation dysregulation at these CpG sites, aDVMCs, may play an important role in early neoplastic development.

Polyp multiplicity association with increasing aDVMC dysregulation

To assess aDVMC-related DNA methylation outliers' relevance in neoplastic development, we examined if the fraction of DNA methylation outliers was elevated in patients with more severe polyp manifestations. We found that the fraction of DNA methylation outliers was significantly higher in patients with multiple polyps in the cecum, ascending colon, or throughout the right-sided colon compared to those with only one polyp in a similar segment during colonoscopy (Figure 2, F). This suggests that aDVMC-related outliers are associated with an increased risk of developing multiple polyps. However, there was no significant difference in patients with larger polyps in the right colon, indicating no size association, and between patients with nonadvanced and advanced adenomas, likely indicating a link to polyp formation rather than progression; these results are to be considered with caution due to a small advanced adenoma sample size (n = 48) (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Figure 7, available online). Our findings that greater field defects may predict the development of multiple polyps align well with recent reports suggesting that polyp multiplicity may predict high-risk neoplasia development more effectively than polyp size and histology.

### Surveillance after positive colonoscopy based on adenoma characteristics [^1144dP1W]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with adenomatous polyps are at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer based on the characteristics and number of polyps, but less is known about the individual and combined contribution of these factors. This study aimed to better characterize the risk of advanced adenoma and cancer in patients with positive baseline colonoscopy.

Methods

Patients who had polyps at baseline colonoscopy were included in this retrospective cohort study (N = 1165) and were categorized into 6 groups: (1) 1–2 non-advanced adenomas (NAA's), (2) ≥ 3 NAA's, (3) advanced tubular adenoma, (4) small tubulovillous adenoma (TVA), (5) large TVA and (6) multiple advanced adenomas (MAA's). Findings at surveillance colonoscopy were documented in each group.

Results

The combined incidence of advanced adenoma, ≥ 3 NAA's, and colorectal cancer at surveillance colonoscopy was significantly higher in the baseline large TVA (29.2%) than small TVA groups (13.5%, P < 0.001), as well as in the MAA's group (44.1%) compared with large TVA group (P = 0.02). The incidence of colorectal cancer, however, was not significantly different between the groups.

Conclusions

The size of the polyp and the number of advanced lesions are more important than its histology for predicting the risk of high-risk metachronous lesions at follow-up.

### Guidelines for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): challenges in defining clinical management for a rare disease [^115ju6aE]. Familial Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The ACG and NCCN permit a low adenoma burden of > 10 cumulative colorectal adenomas. Other guidelines recommend higher, or more complex thresholds, given the trade-off between diagnostic yield, resource and effectiveness.

The BSG/ACPGBI guidelines recommend an individualised approach to germline testing in the case of multiple colorectal adenomas (MCRA), which they define as presence of 10 or more metachronous colon/rectal adenomas, which reflect a burgeoning but limited evidence base. Where the formal clinical criteria of FAP is not fulfilled, they advise consideration of genetic testing in the instance of a lifetime total of ≥ 10 colonic adenomas under the age of 60, or a lifetime total of ≥ 20 adenomas (or ≥ 10 adenomas plus a family history of either colorectal cancer or polyposis). The JSCCR takes the view that "typical FAP" can be diagnosed from clinical symptoms lone and that genetic testing is not routinely necessary, but that genetic testing (including APC) instead can be carried out in the circumstance that either attenuated FAP (AFAP) has to be differentiated from MUTYH -associated polyposis (MAP) and polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis (PPAP), or that a patient prefers to undergo genetic testing (to either inform their own treatment or for the purpose of diagnosis in relatives). (see Table 1).

Summary of FAP clinical diagnostic criteria and recommended genetic testing of ACG, NCCN, ESGE, BSG/ACPGI, and JSCCR

a Typical FAP can be diagnosed from clinical symptoms; if a patient prefers to undergo genetic testing for their own treatment/diagnosis in their relatives genetic testing of APC is considered, OR if attenuated FAP (AFAP) has to be differentiated from MUTYH -associated polyposis (MAP) and polymerase proofreading- associated polyposis (PPAP) then genetic testing (including APC, MUTYH, POLE, POLD1) can be considered

### Guidelines for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): challenges in defining clinical management for a rare disease [^1119Xiet]. Familial Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant Mendelian cancer syndrome that is typically characterised by the development of multiple (classically hundreds to thousands) adenomas in the colon and rectum. The phenotype usually manifests from the second decade of life, with early-age colorectal cancer (CRC) in almost all individuals with the condition if it is not identified/treated at an early stage. In modern practice, following the widespread adoption of prophylactic colonic surgery, it is uncommon for patients with FAP to present with CRC, however, there has been wider recognition of phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution in clinical challenges in an aging population reflected in recent clinical guidelines.

Within the last decade, updated management guidelines have been published by professional bodies internationally. These guidelines still rely largely on limited data by which clinical management recommendations may be formulated, and are underpinned predominantly by expert opinion. This challenge has been acknowledged in rare diseases through establishment of a database and sharing platform for selection, quality evaluation and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines in rare diseases by organisations such as Orphanet; and, dedicated frameworks for guideline development in rare conditions have been applied to practice guidelines outside of hereditary gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes (e.g. haemophilia A, sickle cell anaemia) with some success.

### Risk of advanced neoplasia after removal of colorectal adenomas with high-grade dysplasia [^117ScB9Q]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Our analyses revealed that synchronous low-risk polyps and high-risk polyps were independent risk factors for AN. In our cohort, approximately 52% of patients had synchronous polyps at baseline. Compared with adenoma with HGD alone, the risk of AN was 1.8-fold higher in patients with synchronous low-risk polyps and 4-fold higher in patients with synchronous high-risk polyps. Previous studies also indicated that multiplicity of polyps at baseline colonoscopy is associated with increased AN risk. Our study provides additional evidence to support this view. It is reasonable to suggest that patients with multiple polyps at baseline may be more susceptible to developing recurrent polyps and subsequent AN. Undeniably, the association between synchronous polyps and increased postoperative AN risk may be related to the missed lesions at baseline. A previous study confirmed that multiple polyps at baseline can be associated with a higher probability of missed lesions. However, all colonoscopies in our cohort were performed by experienced endoscopists with high technical proficiency, and the withdrawal time for each colonoscopy exceeded 6 min. And lesions found within 6 months after baseline were classified as baseline lesions rather than newly developed lesions. We believe that the impact of missed lesions at baseline on our results is relatively minor. Additionally, patients with synchronous high-risk polyps had a higher risk of AN compared to those with synchronous low-risk polyps. This can be attributed to the fact that high-risk polyps themselves increase the risk of postoperative AN. Therefore, when both high-risk polyps and adenomas with HGD coexist, the combined effect of these two risk factors further increases AN risk.

### Management and follow-up of gallbladder polyps: updated joint guidelines between the ESGAR, EAES, EFISDS and ESGE [^116oTKHp]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Guideline recommendations

A summary of the revised recommendations is provided within a management algorithm in Fig. 1. The recommendations below are based on the use of TAUS. Recommendations 1 to 7 have changed from the previous guidance, whereas recommendation 8 is unchanged. In cases of multiple polyps, the measurement of the largest polyp should be recorded and used to decide subsequent management.

Fig. 1
Management algorithm

As reported in the original guidelines, a gallbladder polyp is defined as an elevation of the gallbladder wall that protrudes into the gallbladder lumen (Fig. 2). The polyp should not be mobile or demonstrate posterior acoustic shadowing, features that are consistent with a calculus. A polyp can be sessile or pedunculated. If clear reverberation or 'comet tail artefact' is present, the lesion should be described as a pseudo-polyp (focal adenomyomatosis or a cholesterol polyp), in which case these guidelines do not apply. Again, it must be noted that not all pseudo-polyps demonstrate these ultrasound findings. An infiltrating or large mass should be considered as a gallbladder cancer, rather than a polyp.

### Is the phenotype mixed or mistaken? Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and hyperplastic polyposis syndrome [^115HFUt2]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is a hereditary syndrome defined by personal and family history of colorectal and other cancers. Some patients with this condition have multiple serrated polyps, which are the hallmark of hyperplastic polyposis syndrome, a rare colorectal cancer syndrome characterized by multiple hyperplastic/serrated polyps and an increased risk of colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that this may represent a unique group of patients, and this study investigates a possible association between the two syndromes.

Methods

A hereditary colorectal cancer registry was reviewed for patients who fit hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial colorectal cancer and hyperplastic polyposis syndrome criteria.

Results

Twelve patients from seven families were identified. Four families had more than one person meeting the criteria. All patients were white, and four were women. Ten of 12 patients fit Amsterdam criteria, and two were designated with familial colorectal cancer. The median cumulative number of hyperplastic polyps resected per patient was 6, half of which were located in the right colon. Seven of the 12 patients developed colorectal cancer. Ten patients had personal or family history of other cancers: prostate, breast, testicular, salivary gland, lung, and Hodgkin's disease.

Conclusions

Patients meeting criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer may also carry a diagnosis of hyperplastic polyposis syndrome. Possible explanations include: 1) two hereditary syndromes are present in the same patient, 2) serrated polyps are part of the phenotype of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or 3) hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is potentially misdiagnosed in some families who do, in fact, have hyperplastic polyposis.

The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of gastric findings

Fundic gland polyps are common in patients with FAP (26–88%), even in children(Figures 5, 6). Limited evidence suggests that there may be a higher risk of gastric cancer in FAP patients with fundic gland polyposis, with 50% of these polyps showing dysplasia or a second-hit APC gene mutation. One surveillance protocol suggests endoscopic removal of multiple fundic gland polyps using a cold snare technique for larger pathology samples. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend different treatment modalities for fundic gland polyps in FAP patients compared to the general population.

Gastric adenomas are becoming increasingly clinically significant in FAP, as reflected in the rising incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma in FAP. However, gastric cancers often arise within a background of carpeting fundic gland polyposis. Removal of suspicious gastric adenomas is crucial to prevent progression to adenocarcinoma. Optical diagnosis of gastric adenoma is preferred, and routine biopsies are avoided to minimize the risk of fibrosis complicating definitive endoscopic resection. Studies suggest that polyps < 5 mm are unlikely to exhibit HGD, making size a presumptive indicator of HGD risk.

Management of small intestinal findings including post upper gastrointestinal surgery

After prophylactic duodenal surgery, adenomas can develop both in the duodenal bulb and in the remaining jejunum, after a median of 55 months from surgery (range 22–84 months). Such polyps tend to be small and adenomatous, but they may rarely develop into carcinoma (2.4%).

There is conflicting evidence on the extent and severity of jejuno-ileal polyposis in FAP. Jejuno-ileal polyps are usually small (< 5 mm), adenomatous and located in the proximal jejunum. The presence and severity of duodenal adenomas generally predicts the presence and severity of small bowel polyps (P = 0.001). Capsule endoscopy is superior to MRI and barium studies in the identification of jejuno-ileal polyps. There is no comparative study of video capsule endoscopy versus single-/double-balloon enteroscopy. After colorectal surgery, capsule endoscopy is safe, provided that patients do not experience obstructive symptoms. Nevertheless, a patency capsule may be considered as a safe precaution. There are not enough data to report on the efficacy and safety of capsule endoscopy after pancreato-duodenectomy.

### Colon polyps: updates in classification and management [^1153LQ8t]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on colorectal polyps:

- **Definition**: Colorectal polyps are abnormal growths originating from the colonic or rectal mucosa. They can be classified into several types, including adenomatous, hyperplastic, serrated, hamartomatous, and inflammatory polyps, each with varying potential for malignant transformation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The development of colorectal polyps is a complex process involving the abnormal proliferation of epithelial cells in the colon or rectum. This can be driven by various genetic and epigenetic changes, such as chromosomal instability and MSI pathways, leading to the disruption of normal cell growth and differentiation processes. Some polyps, particularly adenomatous polyps, have the potential to progress to CRC through a process known as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of colorectal adenomas in individuals aged > 50 years is estimated at 20–60% in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal polyps, including age (> 40 years), male sex, a family history of CRC or polyps, certain genetic syndromes, IBD, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, and a diet high in red meat (for rectal polyps).
- **Disease course**: Most colorectal polyps are asymptomatic and are often detected incidentally during routine colonoscopies. Occasionally, large polyps can cause symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for patients with colorectal polyps is generally good, especially when the polyps are detected and removed early. Most polyps are benign and can be completely removed during a colonoscopy. However, some polyps can progress to CRC if left untreated, and the risk increases with the size and number of polyps. Adenomatous polyps are the most common type and have the highest risk of progressing to CRC, and polyps > 1 cm or with villous histology are more likely to be malignant.

Serrated polyposis syndrome — associations with smoking and familial risk are reported, including that in a small study of 32 SPS patients the rate of current smoking was 47% compared with colonoscopy controls at 17% and population controls at 12%, and in another cohort of patients with multiple serrated polyps, 51 of 88 (58%) were ever smokers. The text notes that family history of colorectal and other cancers is common and even increased in SPS, that some suggest this supports a hereditary etiology, and that nongenetic causes, referral bias, and chance occurrence should not be overlooked as substantial factors.

### Infectious polypoid colitis… [^116CvHhf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The colon is a relatively frequent site for multiple polyps of the mucosa with and without chronic ulceration. The true polyp is composed of hyperplastic glandular mucous membrane projecting into the lumen of the bowel. In the literature are recorded cases of so-called pseudopolyposis lymphatica, 1 in which the mucosal projections are caused by underlying hyperplastic lymph follicles, but no cited instance has been found simulating the case to be reported, in which nodular polypoid projections into the colon were caused by a peculiar granulation. tissue composed mostly of large mononuclear cells filled with what appears to be a specific infectious micro-organism. 2 It has not been possible to cultivate the bacillus associated with the lesion, but it is hoped that a record of the case may lead to an earlier recognition of the disease, so that its bacteriology may be studied with care.

### Individuals with sessile serrated polyps express an aggressive colorectal phenotype [^114N618u]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Sessile serrated polyps are precursors of colorectal cancer arising from molecular pathways distinct from conventional adenomas. The association between sessile serrated polyps and conventional adenomas is not well known.

Objective

We hypothesize that individuals who have coexistent sessile serrated polyps and conventional adenomas express a more severe phenotype than those harboring lesions from only one pathway. We compare colorectal phenotypes among individuals with sessile serrated polyps, those with conventional adenomas, and those expressing both.

Design

This investigation is a retrospective cross-sectional study of 3 cohorts.

Settings

This study was conducted in multiple centers within 1 health care system.

Patients

Individuals with sessile serrated polyps and/or conventional adenomas on first lifetime colonoscopy were included in the study.

Main Outcome Measures

The demographics and polyp characteristics were compared among 3 cohorts to determine the differences in phenotypic expression.

Results

Two hundred sixty individuals with sessile serrated polyps and 173 with only conventional adenomas were included. The disease phenotype was most severe in individuals with coexistent sessile serrated polyps and adenomas. The sessile serrated polyps in this cohort were larger (P = 0.01) than in the serrated-only cohort. The conventional adenomas in this cohort were more numerous (P = 0.035) and more advanced (P = 0.046) than in the adenoma-only cohort. Synchronous colorectal cancers were found exclusively in the cohorts with sessile serrated polyps, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06).

Limitations

Cross-sectional design precluded the ability to assess for metachronous lesions. Sessile serrated polyps, but not all polyps, were reviewed.

Conclusions

Individuals who coexpress sessile serrated polyps and conventional adenomas have an aggressive colorectal phenotype. They harbor larger sessile serrated polyps and more numerous and advanced adenomas than individuals with only sessile serrated polyps or adenomas. Synchronous colorectal cancers were found exclusively in cohorts with sessile serrated polyps. Individuals with sessile serrated polyps, especially with coexistent conventional adenomas, appear to be a high-risk group, which needs to be accounted for when calculating postpolypectomy surveillance intervals.

### Colorectal cancer risk following polypectomy in a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study: an evaluation of the 2020 UK post-polypectomy surveillance guidelines [^1134UZwE]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides unique data on long-term post-polypectomy CRC incidence by baseline characteristics and a vitally important examination of the 2020 UK surveillance guidelines. Through investigation of 21 318 patients who underwent colonoscopy with polypectomy and were followed-up for a median of 10.1 years, we found that CRC incidence in most patients was similar to or lower than that in the general population. We demonstrated that the new UK guidelines are accurate at identifying and discriminating between those at increased risk of CRC who require surveillance, and those at low risk who can be managed by population-based non-invasive CRC screening instead.

We identified several baseline risk factors for CRC, including older age (≥ 55 years) and presence of multiple (≥ 2) PMPs, adenomas with tubulovillous/villous/unknown histology or high-grade dysplasia, proximal polyps and a baseline visit spanning 2–90 days. This is in line with our previous studies which found associations between these factors and increased CRC incidence when this same cohort was stratified into risk groups following the 2002 UK guidelines, and other studies describing these as risk factors for metachronous advanced neoplasia. However, compared with the general population, CRC incidence was higher only among those with adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or ≥ 2 PMPs, of which ≥ 1 was advanced at baseline (29% of our cohort). This is important because in a resource-constrained setting, and given the serious, although rare, complications of colonoscopy due to its invasive nature, surveillance should be directed towards patients at higher CRC risk than the general population after polypectomy.

Multiple endobronchial polyps are a rare finding. We describe a case of multiple benign endobronchial polyps in a 60-year-old woman who presented with a chronic cough and occasional hemoptysis. Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral basal cylindrical bronchiectasis, with filling defects in both main bronchi. Bronchoscopy revealed the presence of polyps in the distal trachea, both main bronchi, and in the lobar and segmental bronchi of all lobes of both lungs, with lesions from 2 to 10 mm in diameter. Larger lesions were treated with argon plasma coagulation. Histopathology was consistent with benign fibroepithelial polyps. Culture from bronchial washings isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin followed by a prolonged course of azithromycin. Symptoms improved, and repeat bronchoscopy at 3 and 6 months revealed complete resolution of all polyps.

### The dark side of the colon: current issues surrounding the significance, prevalence, detection, diagnosis and management of serrated polyps [^113cCVtL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperplastic polyps, once considered to have no malignant potential, are now recognized to be part of a larger group of polyps known as serrated polyps. Serrated polyps can progress to CRC through an epigenetic pathway known as CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP), characterized by hypermethylation of specific DNA regions such as the promoter regions of the DNA mismatch repair genes like MLH1. The CIMP pathway is tightly linked with mutations of the oncogene BRAF. There are three subtypes of serrated polyps - hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs). TSAs harbor cytologic dysplasia whereas hyperplastic polyps and SSPs are nondysplastic lesions. Currently, only SSPs and TSAs are believed to progress to CRC whereas hyperplastic polyps are thought to be benign with no malignant potential. This article will review the current evidence while highlighting some of the issues regarding serrated polyps.

Recent Findings

One challenge has been pathologically distinguishing hyperplastic polyps from SSPs, which is an important distinction, given the potential for progression of SSPs to CRC. Other challenges regarding serrated polyps include adequate detection and resection. Surveillance guideline recommendations for some serrated polyps have been changed in current guidelines to reflect the malignant potential, recommending closer surveillance intervals than the 10-year follow-up that has been traditionally provided for hyperplastic polyps.

Summary

Given the difficulties in diagnosing as well as resecting, it is important for endoscopists to know how to detect, resect and manage follow-up in patients with serrated polyps.

### Distinct responsiveness to intravitreal ranibizumab therapy in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy with single or multiple polyps [^112yCnFJ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To understand the prognosis of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) by evaluating the responsiveness to intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) monotherapy according to the presence of a single or multiple polyps.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

We included 48 treatment-naïve eyes of 48 patients who received IVR monotherapy at the Medical Retina Division Clinic, Keio University Hospital between March 2009 and January 2013 and attended the clinic for at least 12 months. All patients received 3 monthly IVR injections followed by pro re nata injections and were divided into single polyp and multiple polyps groups according to indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings. The outcome measures included changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and OCT findings over 2 years after initial IVR.

Results

At baseline, the multiple polyps group exhibited a poorer BCVA, larger greatest linear dimension, and higher prevalence of fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment compared with the single polyp group. Over 2 years, the multiple polyps group showed no improvement in BCVA, although the central retinal thickness (CRT) decreased in both groups. The multiple polyps group exhibited a significantly greater CRT at 1 year and required more injections in the first year compared with the single polyp group; furthermore, it included a higher number of nonresponders judged either by BCVA or fundus findings at 1 year and fundus findings at 2 years.

Conclusions

We propose that the stratification of PCV lesions according to the presence of single or multiple polyps may be valuable to understand the prognosis.

Quality and advanced endoscopic imaging in colonoscopic surveillance

We recommend that colonoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic and preventative method of surveillance for people with hereditary risk of CRC. (GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
We recommend that all surveillance colonoscopies are performed by endoscopists who consistently achieve BSG colonoscopy KPI (key performance indicators) minimum standards, specifically caecal intubation rate, adenoma/polyp detection rate and comfort score. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: strong)
We suggest high-quality, high-definition white light endoscopy as the preferred modality for colonoscopy surveillance. Chromoendoscopy (virtual or dye-based) does not offer a clear advantage over high definition white light examination for colonoscopic surveillance, apart from in the context of determining the multiple polyp phenotype. (GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: weak)
We suggest a repeat colonoscopy performed by an expert endoscopist is indicated in the event of a previously failed colonoscopy, with efforts made to both improve patient experience and to ensure procedure completion, given the advantages of colonoscopic surveillance. If colonoscopy is not possible then consider CT colonography. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
We suggest that if the bowel preparation for colonoscopy is inadequate or if the examination is incomplete then a repeat colorectal surveillance procedure should be arranged within 3 months. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
There is insufficient evidence to recommend other methods of surveillance for those with familial CRC risk such as FIT (faecal immunochemical test), MR or CT colonography. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: strong)

### Serrated polyps of right colon: guilty or innocent? [^115RpysF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS)

This syndrome, previously known as hyperplastic polyposis syndrome, is characterized by the presence of multiple serrated (typically SSA/Ps and/or HPs) colorectal polyps. Actually, it was studies in patients with this syndrome that indicated that SSA/Ps may be precursors of CRC.

Recently, WHO published the updated criteria for determining this syndrome and diagnosis can be made if any of the following three criteria is met: 1) at least 5 serrated polyps located proximal of sigmoid colon, two of them must be larger than 10 mm; 2) any number of serrated polyps located proximal of sigmoid colon in person with first-degree relatives with diagnosed SPS; or 3) > 20 serrated polyps distributed throughout the colon.

SPS has been associated with increased incidence of CRC. In published studies, almost 25–70% of patients with SPS had CRC at diagnosis or during follow up. In larger series with patients who met the WHO criteria for SPS, 35% had CRC (28.5% in first endoscopy and 6.5% during mean follow up of 5.6 years). In these studies, the increased number of polyps and the presence of SSA/Ps or TSAs were associated with the presence of CRC. Also, first-degree relatives of patients with SPS presented increased risk of developing CRC and SPS in comparison to the general population.

The presence of this syndrome does not seem to differ between the two sexes. The median age at diagnosis is 44–62 years and ranges from 10 to 90 years. Also, these patients commonly develop synchronous conventional adenomas.

It must be emphasized that this syndrome is perhaps underdiagnosed since many small serrated lesions may be missed during colonoscopy; NBI and chromoendoscopy seem to significantly reduce polyp miss rates in patients with SPS.

The surveillance of these patients can be performed according to the following model: 1) colonoscopy with chromoendoscopy every 1–2 years with endoscopic removal of all polyps; 2) if the removal of all polyps is not possible because of their size or number, or if cancer is found, then colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis should be performed; and 3) in first-degree relatives of patients with SPS screening colonoscopy with chromoendoscopy, if possible, should be offered every 1–2 years from 10 years younger than the index case.

### Long term outcomes of colon polyps with high grade dysplasia following endoscopic resection [^111CH4So]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Adenoma number ≥ 3 has been shown to increase the risk of recurrent advanced adenoma. Relative risk for this parameter is between 1.5 and 5.0, using a single adenoma as reference. Our findings agree with previous studies in terms of an odds ratios of 2.45 (1.22–4.93) upon univariate analysis and 2.11 (1.00–4.43) on multivariate analysis, respectively, when comparing adenoma number ≥ 3 to adenoma number ≤ 2. Male gender is also associated with advanced adenoma recurrence in his study, with an odds ratio of 3.09. This is consistent with Zhang's study.

The natural history of colonic adenoma is still elusive. Two longitudinal follow-up studies on small polyps (6–9 mm) using computed tomography found a tumor progress rates of 22% and 35% during follow-up periods of 8 and 3 years, respectively. Advanced disease was seen in 47% of progressive polyps, which is similar to the rate of 40% in our patient group with baseline adenoma number ≥ 3. The high incidence rate of recurrent and advanced adenoma in patients with multiple lesions is hard to explain solely based on incomplete resection. Multiple small polyps not detected at baseline colonoscopy might progress slowly to become detectable at surveillance colonoscopy. Multiplicity or polyclonicity in patients with adenoma number ≥ 3 is a reasonable explanation, but a longer observation period with other non-invasive study modalities such as computed tomography or capsule endoscopy to detect missed adenomas may be required to elucidate the natural history of recurrent adenomas. The surveillance period recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is 3 years after removal of advanced adenoma, traditional serrated adenoma, or advanced sessile serrate adenoma. The European guidelines recommend a more aggressive surveillance at 1 year for high-risk polyps (≥ 20 mm). For treatment with piecemeal resection, Walsh et al. found a rate of 14% polyp recurrence after at least one negative examination, and the rate of CRC development was 17% among 65 patients with large, flat polyps. A second look examination for patients who undergo piecemeal resection or suspected incomplete resection may be warranted.

We suggest that if the bowel preparation for colonoscopy is inadequate or if the examination is incomplete then a repeat colorectal surveillance procedure should be arranged within 3 months.

(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: weak)

Consensus reached: 95% agreement.

We suggest high-quality, high-definition white light endoscopy as the preferred modality for colonoscopy surveillance. Chromoendoscopy (virtual or dye-based) does not offer a clear advantage over high definition white light examination for colonoscopic surveillance, apart from in the context of determining the multiple polyp phenotype.

(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: weak)

Consensus reached: 89% agreement.

High quality colonoscopy has been recognised as a core element of successful cancer prevention in sporadic patients. There are limited data that this may also be relevant to cancer prevention in LS. Therefore colonoscopic quality indicators in endoscopists performing surveillance in LS patients should at least reach if not exceed the KPIs required for sporadic colonoscopy, using validated measures, in particular caecal intubation rate, adenoma/polyp detection rate and, given that patients may require serial colonoscopic procedures, comfort score.

### Clinicopathological determinants of vaginal and premalignant-malignant cervico-vaginal polyps of the lower female genital tract [^117J11yh]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish pathology frequencies for polyps in the vagina and cervix and to identify determinants of vaginal polyps and premalignant-malignant cervico-vaginal polyps.

Materials and Methods

The pathology reports of all cervico-vaginal polyps examined for 6 years at a single institution were classified, and frequencies were calculated. In 2 separate case-control studies, clinical and pathological variables of vaginal cases were compared with cervical controls, and premalignant-malignant cases were compared with benign controls. Differences in variables that were abstracted from patients' chart and pathology reviews were tested for significance.

Results

There were 4,402 polyps; 4,340 cervical (98.6%), 62 vaginal (1.4%), 4,268 benign (97.0%), 62 premalignant-malignant (1.4%) (CIN, endometrial hyperplasia, and carcinoma), and 72 unsatisfactory (1.6%). Age was a significant determinant of vaginal and premalignant-malignant polyps, and polyp size and number were significant determinants of vaginal polyps. Vaginal polyps were 3 times more frequent among women 40 years and younger and twice as frequent among those 60 years and older (p < .001). Premalignant-malignant polyps were twice as frequent among women 40 years and younger (p = .04), and malignant polyps were 6 times more frequent in those 60 years and older, which approached statistical significance (p = .09). Multiple polyps were 2 times more frequent (p = .04) and greater than 2 cm was 4 times (p = .01) more frequent among vaginal polyps.

Conclusions

Vaginal polyps and premalignant-malignant cervico-vaginal polyps are rare. Vaginal polyps are larger and multiple and cervico-vaginal polyps in younger and older women are at greater risk of premalignant-malignant changes.

Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome — genetic findings and management considerations include a duplication 40 kb upstream of the GREMI gene locus at chromosome 15 found in two individuals with HMPS, with a hypothesis that this duplication interacts with the GREM1 promoter causing increased GREM1 expression and a predisposition to multiple colorectal polyps; genetic testing for GREMI mutation and expression might be considered in relevant families, and management should probably be similar to that for FAP depending on polyp features.

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer — scope and risk framework for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy notes that colonoscopy is used for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, evaluation, and surveillance, and colonoscopists are expected to provide follow-up recommendations; follow-up after normal colonoscopy among age-eligible individuals and post-polypectomy among individuals with polyps are common scenarios needing guidance. Risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia is associated with prior colonoscopy findings; after high-quality colonoscopy, patients with no neoplasia are at the lowest risk, and polyp findings are used to risk-stratify by histology, number, location, and size. The stated aim is to review newly available evidence and update recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy with or without polypectomy.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^111B2Jq6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Gastric manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) include gastric polyps occurring in 23 to 100% of FAP patients; in the gastric fundus and body, the polyps are multiple sessile lesions, most 1 to 10 mm in diameter; adenomatous polyps occur in the stomach of ~10% of patients with FAP; and the lifetime risk for gastric cancer in FAP is ~0.6%.

### How many polyps are there? [^112FV9EM]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Frequently, there is disagreement between consecutive endoscopies about the true number of mucosal lesions.

Objective

To develop a simple means to estimate the total number of mucosal lesions and the number of lesions missed during consecutive endoscopies.

Design

Probability modeling of endoscopic outcomes.

Patients

Subjects undergoing 2 consecutive endoscopies.

Main Outcome Measurements

Total number of mucosal lesions and number of missed lesions.

Results

If a represents the number of lesions seen by the first endoscopist, b the number of lesions seen by the second endoscopist, and c the number of identical lesions seen by both, then the total number of lesions is given by T = ab/c, and the number of lesions missed by both is given by M = (a - c)(b - c)/c. The estimated numbers for all lesions and for missed lesions increase as the number of identical lesions seen by both endoscopists decreases. If the number of identical lesions seen by both endoscopists matches the number of lesions found by any one endoscopist, the numbers of estimated and found polyps are identical and the number of missed polyps equals zero.

Limitations

The analysis assumes that both endoscopists work independently of each other and are equally qualified. The formulas also fail to account for varying characteristics of similar lesions.

Conclusion

The analysis presents a simple, unbiased means to estimate the total number of mucosal lesions if 2 consecutive endoscopies yield slightly conflicting results.

### FAP, gastric cancer, and genetic counseling featuring children and young adults: a family study and review [^112mZtnV]. Familial Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Familial adenomatous polyposis is a highly complex and multifaceted colorectal cancer prone disorder which is often significantly confounded by extracolonic cancers inclusive of gastric cancer, a significant problem in the Orient. Gastric cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis is heavily influenced by fundic gland polyps which are often so voluminous as to defy effective endoscopic surveillance. This study involves more than two decades of investigation of an attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis family where gastric cancer posed an early diagnostic problem because it was obscured by multiple fundic gland polyps. Fundic gland polyps are common in familial adenomatous polyposis and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis and, if voluminous, may interfere with effective endoscopic gastric cancer surveillance. This family is believed to be the first of its type reported with focus upon education and genetic counseling in the setting of a family information service. Cancer control in familial adenomatous polyposis may be partially resolved through use of familial colorectal cancer registries, with greater attention to family history and its interpretation, genetic counseling, and clinical translation for diagnosis and management.

### Appropriateness of colonoscopy in Europe (EPAGE II). Surveillance after polypectomy and after resection of colorectal cancer [^1169GALX]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

To summarize the published literature on assessment of appropriateness of colonoscopy for surveillance after polypectomy and after curative-intent resection of colorectal cancer (CRC), and report appropriateness criteria developed by an expert panel, the 2008 European Panel on the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, EPAGE II.

Methods

A systematic search of guidelines, systematic reviews and primary studies regarding the evaluation and management of surveillance colonoscopy after polypectomy and after resection of CRC was performed. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was applied to develop appropriateness criteria for colonoscopy for these conditions.

Results

Most CRCs arise from adenomatous polyps. The characteristics of removed polyps, especially the distinction between low-risk adenomas (1 or 2, small [< 1 cm], tubular, no high-grade dysplasia) vs. high-risk adenomas (large [≥ 1 cm], multiple [> 3], high-grade dysplasia or villous features), have an impact on advanced adenoma recurrence. Most guidelines recommend a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy for high-risk adenomas and a 5-year colonoscopy for low-risk adenomas. Despite the lack of evidence to support or refute any survival benefit for follow-up colonoscopy after curative-intent CRC resection, surveillance colonoscopy is recommended by most guidelines. The timing of the first surveillance colonoscopy differs. The expert panel considered that 56% of the clinical indications for colonoscopy for surveillance after polypectomy were appropriate. For surveillance after CRC resection, it considered colonoscopy appropriate 1 year after resection.

Conclusions

Colonoscopy is recommended as a first-choice procedure for surveillance after polypectomy by all published guidelines and by the EPAGE II criteria. Despite the limitations of the published studies, colonoscopy is also recommended by most of the guidelines and by EPAGE II criteria for surveillance after curative-intent CRC resection.

### Multiple polyposis… [^112hvQ9S]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Present knowledge concerning multiple polyposis indicates the seri ousness of this disease and an almost invariable termination in single or multiple carcinomas. Ideally, therefore, it would seem best therapeutically to remove the entire colon. Because of the consideration of the patient's comfort, his social life, and the adverse mental reaction of some patients having an ileostomy, it seems necessary to deviate, if safely possible, from the absolute ideal. We are concerned with the success of such a deviation. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS In the group of cases studied, the patients had been treated surgically by ileosigmoidostomy and entire removal of all of the colon proximal to the anastomosis. The surgeon's effort had been to make the ileosigmoidal stoma low enough in the sigmoid so that the residual portion of the colon could be thoroughly observed through a sigmoidoscope and any polyps fulgurated through such an.

### MAP… [^112EBJqQ]. seer.cancer.gov (2018). Low credibility.

Name MAP This definition applies to All SEER websites where this term appears Definition. A rare, inherited disorder in which multiple polyps form on the inner walls of the colon and rectum. People with MAP usually develop fewer than 100 colon polyps, and polyps may also occur in the stomach and small intestine. People with MAP have a high risk of developing colorectal cancer. They may also be at increased risk of developing cancers of the stomach, small intestine, ovary, endometrium, bladder, liver, thyroid, and skin. MAP is caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is a type of hereditary cancer syndrome.

Serrated polyposis syndrome

Diagnosis

​ We recommend a diagnosis of SPS should be made in accordance with the new WHO 2019 criteria for SPS. Since causative gene pathogenic variants for SPS have not been identified, a definitive diagnosis of SPS should be phenotype-driven.

(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)

Consensus reached: 95% agreement.

Other intestinal polyposis syndromes may present with serrated lesions. If (i) the patient is under 50 or (ii) there are multiple affected individuals within a kindred or (iii) there is dysplasia within any of the polyps, then other polyposis syndromes should be excluded by gene panel testing before making a definitive diagnosis of SPS.

(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak)

Consensus reached: 90% agreement.

We recommend the cumulative number of serrated polyps from all endoscopic examinations should be used when applying the WHO 2019 diagnostic criteria for SPS.

We recommend the cumulative number of serrated polyps from all endoscopic examinations should be used when applying the WHO 2019 diagnostic criteria for SPS.

(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)

Consensus reached: 94% agreement.

SPS most probably comprises a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases. The phenotypic criteria for a diagnosis of SPS have recently been revised by the WHO in 2019 to include the following: (1) at least five serrated polyps proximal to the rectum, all > 5 mm in size with at least two > 10 mm in size; (2) at least 20 serrated polyps (of any size) with at least five located proximal to the rectum. Fulfilment of either criterion is sufficient for a diagnosis of SPS. Importantly, the previous WHO 2010 criterion 2, which required the presence of just one serrated lesion in a patient who has an FDR with SPS, has been removed. Given that the prevalence of serrated lesions in the Western population may be up to 39%, most of which will be sporadic, the chances of a false positive diagnosis using this criterion were high.

### Sporadic polyps of the colorectum [^1176j4qb]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Colorectal polyps are common, and their diagnosis and classification represent a major component of gastrointestinal pathology practice. The majority of colorectal polyps represent precursors of either the chromosomal instability or serrated neoplasia pathways to colorectal carcinoma. Accurate reporting of these polyps has major implications for surveillance and thus for cancer prevention. In this review, we discuss the key histologic features of the major colorectal polyps with a particular emphasis on diagnostic pitfalls and areas of contention.

### Serrated polyposis syndrome in a young adolescent patient [^115R5ykw]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Serrated polyps are pathological neoplastic lesions in the colon with subtle gross morphology leading to underreporting during colonoscopy. While detection rates are increasing in average-risk adult screening colonoscopy, the rate of detection during pediatric colonoscopy is unknown. Serrated polyposis syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple serrated polyps in the colon and an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Cancer prevention relies on early recognition, endoscopic clearance of all polyps > 5mm, and continued interval surveillance or prophylactic colectomy. We report the diagnosis and management of serrated polyposis syndrome in a young adolescent patient and highlight the subtle features of serrated polyps that may go unrecognized leading to underreporting in childhood.
