## Question

What's the max dose of spironolactone?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the maximum dose of spironolactone is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the absolute highest labeled doses and in which indications they occur. Then, I should verify typical upper limits for common uses like heart failure and hypertension. Next, I will need to check renal impairment constraints, especially in ESRD. After that, I should review formulation-specific caveats, particularly for CaroSpir. Finally, I will synthesize a practical "ceiling" framework and safety monitoring plan, while correcting any mechanistic misstatements that might have slipped in earlier reasoning.

> Let me first confirm the absolute ceiling. For cirrhotic ascites due to portal hypertension, guidelines and labeling consistently allow up-titration of spironolactone to a maximum of 400 mg/day, typically starting at 100 mg/day and increasing every 72 hours if there is inadequate diuresis, with the strong caveat that initiation and titration should occur with close monitoring, often in a hospital setting for decompensated presentations [^111LpQpW] [^114uyW1L] [^116o2i9m] [^112o6eMr].

> I need to verify whether any other indication reaches that 400 mg/day mark. Primary aldosteronism managed medically, especially in inoperable adrenal adenoma, also permits maintenance doses up to 400 mg/day in labeling; this is another context where higher spironolactone doses are sometimes required to antagonize mineralocorticoid excess, with vigilant electrolyte and renal monitoring during titration [^1178zUi9] [^111s2jPT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for heart failure. In HFrEF (NYHA III–IV), both trial evidence and labeling center on 25–50 mg/day, with RALES starting at 25 mg and allowing up-titration to 50 mg if needed; much higher doses are not standard due to hyperkalemia risk and lack of added benefit in this population [^1124VLQT] [^116E4HKq]. For HFpEF, TOPCAT used 15–45 mg/day and the labeled range is 7.5–50 mg/day, reinforcing that the practical upper bound is well below 100 mg/day in this cohort [^1112ouQR] [^112HHTqY] [^112RMVNt].

> Next, I should review hypertension. I should confirm the dose–response plateau. Labeling indicates typical effective doses of 20–75 mg/day, and doses above 75–100 mg/day generally do not provide additional blood pressure reduction; therefore, exceeding 100 mg/day for hypertension is seldom justified and may only magnify adverse effects without further benefit [^115kdYMB] [^113fUZCr] [^116LZFuv].

> I will now examine renal impairment constraints. In dialysis-dependent ESRD and peritoneal dialysis, a conservative maximum of 25 mg/day is advised due to hyperkalemia risk, with small RCTs and meta-analyses emphasizing careful monitoring and showing hyperkalemia risk rising with higher doses such as 50 mg/day in hemodialysis cohorts [^113dwyv5] [^114Xj9EG] [^111aEACS]. For moderate CKD without dialysis, even lower starting doses and slow titration with frequent labs are prudent, aligning with labeling cautions.

> Wait, let me verify formulation-specific issues. CaroSpir (oral suspension) is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone tablets; doses greater than 100 mg of the suspension can lead to higher than expected exposures, and labeling recommends using another formulation if more than 100 mg/day is needed, which is crucial when targeting high doses for ascites or primary aldosteronism [^114uyW1L].

> I should confirm the general safety ceiling concept. Across indications outside of cirrhotic ascites and primary aldosteronism, the practical ceiling is usually 50–100 mg/day because hyperkalemia, renal function shifts, and endocrine side effects become more frequent without proportional efficacy gains; TOPCAT showed roughly a doubling of hyperkalemia versus placebo, and labeling emphasizes checking serum potassium within one week of initiation or up-titration and regularly thereafter [^1112ouQR] [^116osiB2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially noted that "afferent arteriole vasoconstriction reduces GFR" under spironolactone, but I should correct this. Hold on, I should verify the mechanism. RAAS blockade classically causes efferent arteriolar vasodilation with ACE inhibitors or ARBs rather than afferent vasoconstriction; spironolactone does not directly cause afferent vasoconstriction, and the creatinine increases observed with spironolactone in trials like TOPCAT likely reflect diuretic effects, neurohormonal interactions, and concurrent RAAS therapy rather than a primary afferent vasoconstrictive mechanism, so I need to correct that earlier mechanistic misstatement [^1112ouQR] [^116K1ha6].

> Let me consider other, often off-label, high-dose contexts to ensure completeness. Dermatologic and endocrine uses such as acne, hirsutism, hidradenitis suppurativa, and gender-affirming care sometimes employ 50–200 mg/day, with reports up to 200–300 mg/day in select scenarios; however, many of these are off-label and should be approached with individualized risk–benefit assessment and monitoring, noting that suggested ranges appear in secondary sources and small studies rather than core FDA labeling [^1112mbNC] [^112akuK6] [^116AEXjw].

> I should double-check monitoring and implementation. Best practice is to assess serum potassium and creatinine at baseline, again within 3–7 days and at one week after any dose change, and then periodically, increasing frequency with CKD, diabetes, or concomitant ACEi/ARB or NSAID use; real-world data show that inadequate follow-up is associated with more hyperkalemia and discontinuations, underscoring the need for a structured lab schedule [^116K1ha6] [^1134Pu2R] [^115jxk7d].

> Putting it all together, I need to ensure the final clinical answer is concise and accurate. The maximum dose of spironolactone is 400 mg/day in specific contexts, namely cirrhotic ascites and medically managed primary aldosteronism under close monitoring; for most other indications the typical upper bound is 50–100 mg/day, while in dialysis-dependent ESRD the prudent ceiling is 25 mg/day, and when using CaroSpir, avoid doses above 100 mg/day due to disproportionate exposure, favoring tablet formulations if higher dosing is necessary [^111LpQpW] [^116o2i9m] [^1178zUi9] [^111s2jPT] [^1124VLQT] [^1112ouQR] [^113dwyv5] [^114uyW1L].

---

The maximum recommended dose of spironolactone is **400 mg/day** for ascites/edema in cirrhosis [^111LpQpW] and primary aldosteronism [^111s2jPT], with titration every 72 hours as needed. For hypertension, doses above **100 mg/day** are not recommended due to limited additional benefit [^115kdYMB]. In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the maximum is **50 mg/day** [^1124VLQT]. In dialysis-dependent patients, it is **25 mg/day** with close monitoring [^113dwyv5]. Always monitor potassium and renal function, and adjust or discontinue therapy if hyperkalemia or renal impairment occurs [^116K1ha6].

---

## Maximum recommended doses by indication

| **Indication** | **Maximum recommended dose** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ascites/edema in cirrhosis | 400 mg/day [^111LpQpW] | - Titrate every 72 hours <br/> - Monitor potassium and renal function |
| Primary aldosteronism | 400 mg/day [^111s2jPT] | Titrate based on response and potassium levels [^1178zUi9] |
| Hypertension | 100 mg/day [^115kdYMB] | Higher doses generally do not provide additional benefit [^116LZFuv] |
| Heart failure (HFrEF) | 50 mg/day [^1124VLQT] | Higher doses increase hyperkalemia risk |
| Dialysis-dependent patients | 25 mg/day [^113dwyv5] | Close monitoring required [^111aEACS] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting maximum doses

- **Ascites/edema in cirrhosis**: EASL and BASL/BSG guidelines support up to 400 mg/day, titrated every 72 hours, with close monitoring [^111LpQpW] [^112o6eMr].
- **Primary aldosteronism**: FDA labeling supports up to 400 mg/day, titrated to response and potassium [^111s2jPT] [^1178zUi9].
- **Hypertension**: Doses above 100 mg/day generally do not add benefit and increase adverse effects [^115kdYMB].
- **Heart failure (HFrEF)**: RALES and FDA labeling support 25–50 mg/day; higher doses increase hyperkalemia risk.
- **Dialysis-dependent patients**: Meta-analyses support a maximum of 25 mg/day with close monitoring [^113dwyv5].

---

## Risks and adverse effects at higher doses

Higher doses increase the risk of:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Dose-dependent and potentially life-threatening.
- **Renal impairment**: Higher doses can worsen renal function [^116K1ha6].
- **Gynecomastia**: Dose-dependent and may require discontinuation [^116K1ha6].
- **Hypotension**: Especially with other antihypertensives.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing maximum dose

Patient-specific factors should guide the maximum dose, including **impaired renal function**, which increases **hyperkalemia risk** and warrants **dose adjustment** with **close monitoring** [^1112ouQR]. Electrolyte abnormalities such as baseline hyperkalemia or hyponatremia require caution and enhanced monitoring [^116K1ha6]. Comorbid heart failure, liver disease, and hypertension necessitate individualized dosing and monitoring [^111LpQpW].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment strategies

Monitoring should include **serum potassium** and **renal function** checked within 1 week of initiation or dose titration, then monitored regularly [^116K1ha6]. Adjust the dose or discontinue therapy if hyperkalemia or renal impairment occurs [^116K1ha6]. Provide patient education on recognizing signs of hyperkalemia and when to seek care [^116K1ha6].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring dose reduction or discontinuation

- **Hyperkalemia**: Potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L.
- **Renal impairment**: Significant decline in renal function [^116yqGtf].
- **Gynecomastia**: Severe or persistent [^116K1ha6].
- **Hypotension**: Symptomatic or severe.

---

The maximum recommended dose of spironolactone is **400 mg/day** for ascites/edema in cirrhosis and primary aldosteronism, with lower limits in hypertension, heart failure, and dialysis-dependent patients. Dosing should be individualized, with close monitoring of potassium and renal function to minimize adverse effects.

### Safety and cardiovascular efficacy of spironolactone in dialysis-dependent ESRD (SPin-D): A randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dosage trial [^111aEACS]. Kidney International (2019). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of spironolactone are uncertain in end-stage renal disease. We randomized 129 maintenance hemodialysis patients to placebo (n = 51) or spironolactone 12.5 mg (n = 27), 25 mg (n = 26), or 50 mg (n = 25) daily for 36 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dosage trial to assess safety, tolerability, and feasibility and to explore cardiovascular efficacy. The primary safety endpoints were hyperkalemia (potassium > 6.5 mEq/L) and hypotension requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalization. Diastolic function was assessed by Doppler echocardiography.

Of the participants, 125 (97%) completed dose escalation, with no significant difference in permanent study drug discontinuation between the groups (27.5% in placebo versus 16.7% in the combined spironolactone groups and 28% in the 50 mg group). Hyperkalemia frequency was similar between spironolactone and placebo (0.49 versus 0.50 events per patient-year) but demonstrated a significant linear trend due primarily to an increased event rate at the 50 mg dose (0.89 events per patient-year). The primary hypotension outcome was infrequent and similar with spironolactone and placebo (0.11 versus 0 events per patient-year). Gynecomastia was rare and did not differ significantly between groups.

Changes in diastolic function were similar with spironolactone and placebo. Spironolactone appears safe in carefully monitored maintenance hemodialysis patients but did not affect cardiovascular parameters in this small study. Hyperkalemia occurs more frequently as dosage increases to 50 mg daily.

### Carospir [^116LZFuv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

**Hypertension**: Studies on hypertension treatment were conducted using a spironolactone formulation that is not therapeutically equivalent to Carospir [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In a study involving 24 patients with essential hypertension, only eight completed the study assessments. The average systolic blood pressure reduction was 10 mmHg for the 25 mg dose and 20 mmHg for the 100 mg dose of spironolactone. Doses greater than 100 mg per day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1112ouQR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists improve the prognosis for patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. This study evaluates the effects of spironolactone in patients with heart failure and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 3,445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or more to receive either spironolactone (15 to 45 mg daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure.

- **Results**: With a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 320 of 1,722 patients in the spironolactone group (18.6%) and 351 of 1,723 patients in the placebo group (20.4%) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.04; P = 0.14). Of the components of the primary outcome, only hospitalization for heart failure had a significantly lower incidence in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (206 patients [12.0%] vs. 245 patients [14.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99, P = 0.04). Neither total deaths nor hospitalizations for any reason were significantly reduced by spironolactone.

	- Treatment with spironolactone was associated with increased serum creatinine levels and a doubling of the rate of hyperkalemia (18.7% vs. 9.1% in the placebo group) but reduced hypokalemia. With frequent monitoring, there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events.

### Aldactone [^116E4HKq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A total of 1,663 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either spironolactone or a placebo. The study population consisted of 87% white, 7% black, and 2% Asian patients, with 73% being male. The median age was 67 years, and the median ejection fraction was 26%. Moreover, 70% of patients were classified as NYHA class III, while 29% were class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55% and non-ischemic in 45% of patients. Additionally, there was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, hypertension in 24%, and diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL, and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline, 100% of patients were taking a loop diuretic, and 95% were on an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

- **Primary endpoint**: RALES focused on the time to all-cause mortality. The study was terminated early due to a significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% compared to placebo (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval of 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also decreased the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval of 18% to 41%).

The survival curves by treatment group are shown in Figure 1.

### Diuretic and renal effects of spironolactone and heart failure hospitalizations: a TOPCAT Americas analysis [^116yqGtf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to determine whether spironolactone reduced heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial through potential diuretic or other effects. We examined the effects of spironolactone on weight, diuretic use, and renal function, and their subsequent impact on outcomes.

- **Methods and results**: We analyzed data from TOPCAT Americas, which included 1,767 patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction (886 in the spironolactone group and 881 in the placebo group). We employed mixed-effects models for serial data and shared frailty models to identify determinants of recurrent HF hospitalizations among baseline and serial parameters. There were 800 HF hospitalizations following a median of 3.0 years. Initially, spironolactone resulted in more weight loss; however, weight trajectories overlapped after 12 months. Daily furosemide dose decreased with spironolactone (time-averaged Δ: -4.8% vs. +11.6%, P < 0.001) as did thiazide use (-4.3% vs. +1.7%; P = 0.003). Conversely, ACEI/ARB use decreased (-13.1% vs. -7.3%; P = 0.004). Serum creatinine increased more with spironolactone (+12.5% vs. +3.5%; P < 0.001). In time-updated models, loop diuretic dose [hazard ratio (HR) per doubling 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.32; P < 0.001], creatinine (HR per doubling 1.28; 95% CI 1.04–1.40; P = 0.019), and ACEI/ARB use (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.67–1.00; P = 0.048) were associated with HF hospitalizations. Despite these associations, the effect of spironolactone on HF hospitalizations persisted (HR 0.77).

### Efficacy and safety of spironolactone in acute heart failure: The ATHENA-HF randomized clinical trial [^112Rhmx3]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

Persistent congestion is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (AHF). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists administered at high doses may relieve congestion, overcome diuretic resistance, and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation in AHF.

- **Objective**: To assess the effect of high-dose spironolactone and usual care on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels compared with usual care alone.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This double-blind and placebo (or low-dose)-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 22 US acute care hospitals. It involved patients with AHF who were previously receiving no or low-dose (12.5 mg or 25 mg daily) spironolactone and had NT-proBNP levels of 1000 pg/mL or more or B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 250 pg/mL or more, regardless of ejection fraction.

- **Interventions**: High-dose spironolactone (100 mg) vs placebo or 25 mg spironolactone (usual care) daily for 96 hours.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was the change in NT-proBNP levels from baseline to 96 hours. Secondary endpoints included the clinical congestion score, dyspnea assessment, net urine output, and net weight change. Safety endpoints included hyperkalemia and changes in renal function.

- **Results**: A total of 360 patients were randomized. The median age was 65 years, 129 (36%) were women, 200 (55.5%) were white, 151 (42%) were black, 8 (2%) were Hispanic or Latino, 9 (2.5%) were of other race/ethnicity, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 34%.

### Eplerenone for hypertension [^116c6gYm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Eplerenone is an aldosterone receptor blocker that is chemically derived from spironolactone. In Canada, it is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality for heart failure patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II systolic chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is also used as adjunctive therapy for patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction. Additionally, it is indicated for the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension for patients who cannot be treated adequately with other agents. It is important to determine the clinical impact of all antihypertensive medications, including aldosterone antagonists, to support their continued use in essential hypertension. No previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of eplerenone on cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and magnitude of blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of eplerenone monotherapy versus placebo for primary hypertension in adults. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular events (fatal or non-fatal strokes), adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 3 March 2016. We handsearched references from retrieved studies to identify any studies missed in the initial search.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose spironolactone for chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes [^114GN7js]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although adding spironolactone to renin-angiotensin system blockers reduces albuminuria in adults with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, it increases the risk of hyperkalemia.

- **Objective**: To assess whether a lower dose of spironolactone (12.5 mg/d) reduces the risk of hyperkalemia while maintaining its effect on reducing albuminuria.

- **Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

- **Setting**: This study was conducted from July 2016 to November 2020 in ambulatory care at three diabetes medical institutions in Japan.

- **Patients**: We enrolled 130 Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/gCre), estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and serum potassium level < 5.0 mEq/L.

- **Interventions**: The participants were randomly assigned to the spironolactone-administered and control groups.

- **Main outcome measures**: Changes in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline over the 24-week interventional period.

The spironolactone group showed a significant reduction in UACR from baseline (mean decrease, 103.47 ± 340.80 mg/gCre) compared with the control group, which showed an increased UACR (mean increase, 63.93 ± 310.14 mg/gCre; p = 0.0007, Wilcoxon rank-sum test and t-test). Although the spironolactone group had a statistically significant increase in serum potassium levels, none of the participants had a potassium level ≥ 5.5 mEq/L at 24 weeks. Further, participants with a higher initial serum potassium level tended to have a smaller increase (estimate, -0.37, analysis of covariance).

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose spironolactone in management of diabetic kidney disease in a real-world setting [^114LiCJz]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a lower dose (12.5 mg/day) of spironolactone in lowering albuminuria and improving renal function in Iranian adults with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Due to known risks of hyperkalemia with higher doses, the researchers specifically assessed whether a reduced dose would preserve clinical benefit without increasing adverse effects. Given that spironolactone is low-cost and readily available, proving its efficacy and safety at a lower dose might offer a feasible, low-cost strategy for enhancing renal outcomes in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Additionally, the study examined whether low-dose add-on therapy with spironolactone could have additive effects when combined with conventional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, with or without sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is).

### Carospir [^114h8E2y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In this study, 1663 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either spironolactone or a placebo. Of the participants, 87% were White, 7% were Black, and 2% were Asian. The study population was 73% male with a median age of 67 years and a median ejection fraction of 26%. Regarding the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, 70% were classified as class III and 29% as class IV. The etiology of heart failure was determined to be ischemic in 55% of the cases and non-ischemic in 45%. Additionally, 28% of patients had a history of myocardial infarction, 24% had hypertension, and 22% had diabetes. The median baseline serum creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dL, and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

- **Baseline medication use**: At the beginning of the study, all patients (100%) were taking a loop diuretic and 95% were on an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

- **Study outcomes**: The primary endpoint for the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) was the time to all-cause mortality. RALES was terminated early due to a significant mortality benefit observed during a planned interim analysis. Compared to the placebo group, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (including worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

- **Subgroup analysis**: Mortality hazard ratios for subgroups were analyzed, showing that spironolactone's beneficial effect on mortality was similar for both genders and across all age groups, except for patients younger than 55.

The survival curves by treatment group are illustrated in Figure 1.

### Spironolactone in left-sided heart failure: How does it fit in [^1123H2Eo]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The familiar diuretic spironolactone has taken on new life as a treatment for left-sided congestive heart failure. Spironolactone has been shown to decrease mortality in patients who are classified as New York Heart Association class IV. It can be used in addition to agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers, which also decrease mortality, as well as diuretics and digoxin, which are useful in treating symptoms. Spironolactone is safe, easy to use, and reasonably priced. More research is necessary to determine the order and combinations of these medications in slowing the progression of this disease.

### Prognostic importance of changes in cardiac structure and function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the impact of spironolactone [^1164eK9T]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). High credibility.

Limited data exist regarding the impact of aldosterone antagonist therapy on cardiac structure and function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and on the prognostic relevance of changes in cardiac structure and function in such patients.

- **Methods and results**: Cardiac structure and function were assessed by quantitative echocardiography at baseline and at 12- to 18-month follow-up in 239 patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (left ventricular [LV] ejection fraction [LVEF] ≥ 45%) enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial. The impact of spironolactone therapy on measures of cardiac structure and function was assessed in the study population overall. Change in echocardiographic measures was associated with the subsequent occurrence of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest. Spironolactone was not associated with alterations in cardiac structure and function compared with placebo. A decrease in left atrial volume at follow-up was associated with a lower risk of subsequent occurrence of the primary outcome.

- **Conclusions**: Twelve to eighteen months of spironolactone therapy was not associated with alterations in cardiac structure or function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Reduction in left atrial volume at follow-up was associated with a lower risk of subsequent occurrence of the primary composite outcome.

### Concerns regarding renal function claims in low-dose spironolactone study [^1174zQFY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Recent evidence from the FIDELITY pooled analysis of finerenone trials demonstrates that cardiovascular and kidney benefits were maintained regardless of acute eGFR changes at month 1, with similar efficacy across patients experiencing > 10% eGFR decline, stable eGFR, or eGFR increases. This confirms that early eGFR changes do not correlate with long-term hard outcomes. We suggest focusing on clinically meaningful endpoints rather than over-interpreting short-term eGFR fluctuations.

We recommend the authors consider adopting more conservative language regarding renal function changes and acknowledge the limitations of short-term eGFR monitoring. Future studies would benefit from incorporating confirmatory measurements, longer follow-up periods, and mechanistic assessments to better characterize true renal function changes with low-dose spironolactone therapy.

### Spironolactone dose in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: findings from TOPCAT [^113PpUPA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Spironolactone up-titration may be limited by side effects, which could be minimized at lower than target doses, but whether these lower doses remain efficacious is unknown. In TOPCAT, spironolactone (or placebo) was started at 15 mg/day and increased up to a maximum of 45 mg/day. The prognostic implications related to spironolactone dose are yet to be reported. We aimed to assess the average spironolactone/placebo doses provided during the trial overall and within high-risk subgroups (e.g. elderly, renal dysfunction, high potassium), discontinuation rates, and the efficacy of lower than target doses in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

- **Methods and results**: Overall, 1767 patients from 'TOPCAT-Americas' were included. Linear, logistic, and Cox regressions were applied. Patients randomized to spironolactone received lower doses than those on placebo: 22.5 mg/day (15.0–27.5 mg/day) vs. 27.5 mg/day (17.5–27.5 mg/day). Patients with renal dysfunction or potassium levels > 4.5 mmol/L received lower spironolactone doses (median ≈ 20 mg/day). This pattern of dose differences was not observed in patients taking placebo, where the between-subgroup placebo doses were similar (spironolactone-placebo by subgroup P interaction < 0.05). Among patients taking spironolactone, 25.4% discontinued the drug during the first year, compared with 18.3% of the patients taking placebo. Discontinuation rates in the aforementioned high-risk subgroups reached 30% during the first year. Spironolactone reduced the primary outcomes.

### Serious adverse events experienced by patients with chronic heart failure taking spironolactone [^1156WGHA]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic heart failure, the addition of spironolactone to conventional treatment may result in serious and occasionally fatal hyperkalemia. In some cases, this adverse effect occurs because spironolactone induces diarrhea. Four cases involving men with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure are presented. These cases revealed that close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after beginning spironolactone treatment. Patients should be advised to discontinue spironolactone immediately if diarrhea develops.

### Spironolactone-induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure [^114AAF12]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone.

- **Methods**: We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) > 5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr ≥ 2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared.

- **Results**: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls.

- **Conclusions**: Spironolactone-ind

### Safety of spironolactone use in ambulatory heart failure patients [^115NtECE]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Since the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), the use of spironolactone is recommended in systolic heart failure (HF) patients who have been in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV. There is limited information on the use, side effects, and withdrawal rate of spironolactone in routine clinical practice.

- **Hypothesis**: Side effects related to spironolactone use are more common than reported in clinical trials.

- **Methods**: Patients who had moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) under optimized medical therapy were included. We introduced spironolactone in those with serum potassium (K+) ≤ 5.5 meq/L, and discontinued it if serum creatinine (Cr) increased more than 30%-50% of the baseline value, and/or if the patient had gynecomastia.

- **Results**: We selected 134 patients followed in an HF clinic. In our sample, 56.7% of the patients (76 out of 134) were currently or had formerly been on spironolactone therapy. The rate of spironolactone withdrawal was 25% (19 out of 76). Reasons for suspension were hyperkalemia (17.1%), renal function deterioration (14.5%), gynecomastia (5.3% of males), and other reasons (1.3%).

- **Conclusion**: Spironolactone side effects are common and are mostly related to effects on the angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Our results reinforce the need to closely monitor serum K+ and Cr levels in patients treated with spironolactone, as its side effects are more common than reported in clinical trials.

### Efficacy of low-dose spironolactone in subjects with resistant hypertension [^111xmw5e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Previous reports have demonstrated the antihypertensive efficacy of high doses of spironolactone in subjects with primary aldosteronism and, to a lesser degree, subjects with resistant hypertension.

- **Methods**: In the analysis, we examined the antihypertensive benefit of adding low-dose spironolactone to multidrug regimens that included a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in subjects with resistant hypertension, with and without primary aldosteronism. Subjects referred for resistant hypertension were evaluated with early morning plasma renin activity and 24-hour urinary aldosterone and sodium during high dietary salt ingestion. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was confirmed with a renin activity of 12 µg/24 h and urinary sodium > 200 mEq/24 h. After biochemical evaluation, spironolactone (12.5 to 25 mg/d) was added to each subject's antihypertensive regimen. If blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled, the dose of spironolactone was titrated up to 50 mg/d. Follow-up BP was determined at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

- **Results**: A total of 76 subjects were included in the analysis, 34 of whom had biochemical primary aldosteronism. Low-dose spironolactone was associated with an additional mean decrease in BP of 21 ± 21/10 ± 14 mm Hg at 6 weeks and 25 ± 20/12 ± 12 mm Hg at the 6-month follow-up. The BP reduction was similar in subjects with and without primary aldosteronism and was additive to the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics.

### Spironolactone and resistant hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114EU3pK]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone should be the preferred fourth-line antihypertensive treatment in resistant hypertension (RHTN). Whether spironolactone improves blood pressure (BP) control in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and RHTN is unknown.

- **Methods**: We identified patients with RHTN, defined as baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 140 and 160 mm Hg on three or more medications, in the Americas cohort of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist trial, where patients with HFpEF were randomized to spironolactone versus placebo. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone versus placebo on BP reduction in this group and related it to the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for heart failure.

- **Results**: We identified 403 participants in the Americas with RHTN. Compared to people without RHTN, those with RHTN were more frequently women, non-White, diabetics, with higher left ventricular ejection fraction and body mass index, and a lower hemoglobin concentration. In the RHTN group, spironolactone resulted in a decrease of SBP: -6.1 (-8.9, -3.3); P < 0.001 and diastolic BP: -2.9 (-4.6, -1.2); P = 0.001 mm Hg during the first 8 months. BP became controlled after 4 weeks in 63% of patients receiving spironolactone versus 46% receiving placebo (P = 0.003), with similar responses at 8 weeks, and at 4 and 8 months. Patients with RHTN derived similar overall benefit from spironolactone.

### Incidence, predictors and clinical management of hyperkalaemia in new users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^111UrRph]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

We examined the prescribed doses in the last spironolactone prescription prior to hyperkalaemia. The most commonly prescribed dose was 25 mg/day (in 65% of participants), followed by 50 mg/day (23% of participants). Dosages exhibited a weak association with the patient's underlying kidney function. Daily MRA doses of 50 mg were more common among moderate and severe hyperkalaemia cases compared to mild ones.

- **Distribution of spironolactone dosages**: Prescribed at index hyperkalaemia and in relation to kidney function. eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.

After hyperkalaemia occurrence, 53% of participants continued MRA therapy, while 47% discontinued. Among those who remained on therapy, 10% reduced the prescribed MRA dose. Discontinuation of concomitant ACEi/ARB use occurred in 282 (23%) of cases, being slightly more common among those who discontinued MRA (28%) compared to those who continued (19%). As many as 45% of participants received de novo diuretics, and 1.6% started SPS. MRA discontinuation or dose reduction was slightly more common after moderate/severe compared to mild hyperkalaemias. Likewise, more participants received diuretics or SPS following a moderate/severe event compared to mild events.

Timing of therapy also influenced prescription patterns. Hyperkalaemias occurring within the first 3 months of MRA therapy were more often followed by MRA discontinuation, MRA dose reductions, and prescription of diuretics or SPS compared to later events.

### CaroSpir [^114uyW1L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **General considerations**: CaroSpir is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone. Follow dosing instructions given here. In patients requiring a dose greater than 100 mg, use another formulation. Doses of the suspension greater than 100 mg may result in spironolactone concentrations higher than expected [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. CaroSpir can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Treatment of heart failure**: In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m², initiate treatment at 20 mg (4 mL) once daily. Patients who tolerate 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage increased to 37.5 mg (7.5 mL) once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage reduced to 20 mg (4 mL) every other day [see Warning and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m², consider initiating treatment at 10 mg (2 mL) because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Treatment of essential hypertension**: The recommended initial daily dose is 20 mg (4 mL) to 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses > 75 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

- **Treatment of edema associated with hepatic cirrhosis**: In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] and Clinical Pharmacology.

### Concerns regarding renal function claims in low-dose spironolactone study [^117SySqk]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

We read with interest the study by Amini et al. on low-dose spironolactone in diabetic kidney disease. While we appreciate the authors' investigation of safety at reduced dosing, we believe some aspects of their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) interpretation need clarification from a nephrology perspective.

The authors report a statistically significant increase in eGFR from 71.83 ± 19.09 to 74.25 ± 17.81 mL/min/1.73 m² (p = 0.042) and describe this as renal function improvement. This interpretation warrants careful consideration:

- **Creatinine variability**: Creatinine measurement has inherent analytical variability, and small changes in calculated eGFR may not reflect true kidney function changes. The magnitude of change (3.4%) falls within the expected coefficient of variation for creatinine-based eGFR calculations. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 37 studies with 2770 participants demonstrates that eGFR fluctuations of 5.0%–5.2% likely represent analytical noise rather than a clinically meaningful change. Such small variations should be interpreted cautiously without confirmatory measurements.

- **Serum creatinine decrease**: The decrease in serum creatinine (1.08 ± 0.23 to 1.01 ± 0.23 mg/dL) is difficult to explain mechanistically, as spironolactone does not enhance creatinine clearance or reduce creatinine generation. Furthermore, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists characteristically reduce GFR through hemodynamic effects, including afferent arteriole vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration pressure. An increase in eGFR contradicts established pharmacological mechanisms.

### Complications of inappropriate use of spironolactone in heart failure: When an old medicine spirals out of new guidelines [^116ZNvtH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

This study was designed to investigate the appropriateness and complications associated with the use of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) in clinical practice. Spironolactone was reported by one prospective randomized trial to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV HF. With this report, known as the Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study (RALES) trial, there was a marked increase in the widespread use of spironolactone in patients with HF. However, long-term outcome data concerning the safety and utilization of this medication in HF are not available.

To investigate the use of spironolactone for HF in a clinical setting, we analyzed the application of the RALES trial protocol to the care of 104 patients, who were identified as being started on spironolactone for HF after the prerelease of the RALES trial. We found broader use, less intensive follow-up, and increased complications with spironolactone treatment compared with the RALES trial. Cardiologists provided more appropriate care than primary care providers.

These data suggest that spironolactone is being widely used in HF without consideration of the NYHA class and ejection fraction, and without the optimization of background treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Clinical follow-up does not adhere to the RALES trial guidelines, resulting in higher complications. We conclude that long-term studies with further safety and efficacy data are needed.

### Usefulness of spironolactone in a specialized heart failure clinic [^112yFFjx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Several case series published after the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) have focused on the adverse effects of spironolactone when prescribed to participants outside of clinical trials and the appropriateness of these prescribing practices; however, there is a paucity of data on potential benefits for these patients. We examined data from a prospective cohort study of 1,037 patients with heart failure seen at the University of Alberta Heart Function Clinic. The median age was 69 years, 66% were men, 75% had systolic dysfunction, and the mean ejection fraction was 33%. Only 40% of the 136 patients prescribed spironolactone had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms, and 6 mmol/L. Cox's proportional hazards analysis confirmed the association between the use of spironolactone and increased survival rate (relative risk 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.39), even though 78% of our patients did not fulfill the RALES eligibility criteria. Thus, although the complication rate was higher, the benefits of spironolactone seen in RALES extended to participants not in a trial who were treated with similar doses and followed closely in a clinic specializing in heart failure.

### Spironolactone use in heart failure patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis: is it safe [^112u18aq]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but it is contraindicated in renal dysfunction due to the risk of hyperkalemia. It is not known if patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis are at the same risk for hyperkalemia. The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence evaluating the incidence of hyperkalemia with spironolactone use in ESRD patients on hemodialysis.

- **Hypothesis**: Spironolactone use in ESRD patients on hemodialysis may not lead to a greater incidence of hyperkalemia.

- **Methods**: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and PubMed databases up to January 2010 for English-language, human-subject clinical trials that evaluated the rate of hyperkalemia with spironolactone use in ESRD patients on hemodialysis. Search terms included "spironolactone", "eplerenone", "aldosterone antagonist", "heart failure", "kidney failure", "hemodialysis", "dialysis", and "renal replacement therapy".

- **Results**: Six prospective trials demonstrated that spironolactone use was safe in ESRD patients on hemodialysis. The incidence of hyperkalemia with spironolactone treatment in these studies was similar to control groups. The studies involved a small population of compliant subjects who were at low risk for hyperkalemia.

- **Conclusions**: Small pilot studies demonstrated that spironolactone treatment in ESRD patients on hemodialysis did not result in higher hyperkalemia rates. Larger studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results before spironolactone is routinely considered in hemodialysis patients.

### Spironolactone metabolite concentrations in decompensated heart failure: Insights from the ATHENA-HF trial [^111J73ws]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). High credibility.

In the Aldosterone Targeted Neurohormonal Combined with Natriuresis Therapy in Heart Failure (ATHENA-HF) trial, high-dose spironolactone (100 mg daily) did not improve efficacy endpoints over usual care, which included either placebo or continued low-dose spironolactone (25 mg daily) in patients already receiving spironolactone, for the treatment of acute heart failure (HF). It was hypothesized that low concentrations of the long-acting active metabolites of spironolactone, canrenone and 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), in the high-dose group could have contributed to these neutral results.

In the methods and results, patients randomized to high-dose spironolactone who had not been previously treated with spironolactone (high-dose-naïve, n = 112) showed increased concentrations of canrenone and 7α-TMS at 48 and 96 hours compared to baseline, and between 48 and 96 hours (all P < 0.005), signifying that steady-state concentrations had not been reached by 48 hours. For patients previously on low-dose spironolactone, who were then given high-dose spironolactone (high-dose-previous, n = 37), concentrations of canrenone increased at both 48 and 96 hours compared to baseline (P < 0.0005), with a marginal increase between 48 and 96 hours (P = 0.0507). At 48 hours, both high-dose groups exhibited higher concentrations of both metabolites than the low-dose spironolactone group (P < 0.0001).

Moreover, concentrations of both metabolites were higher in high-dose-previous compared to high-dose-naïve patients (P < 0.01), indicating significant impact from previous spironolactone use and that steady-state was not achieved in high-dose-naïve patients by 48 hours. There was limited and inconsistent evidence of correlation between these findings.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): Rationale and design [^112Qh78D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). High credibility.

- **Intervention, study visits and follow-up**: Patients are randomized 1:1 to open-label mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment (either spironolactone or eplerenone) plus usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to MRA receive a prescription to be filled and paid for out of pocket. In both Sweden and the US, spironolactone can be obtained for approximately 10 US cents per day. In Sweden, patients pay out of pocket for prescription medications up to an annual maximum of approximately 250 Euro, after which additional medication costs are covered by the government.

- **Dosage and administration**: Spironolactone is more potent than eplerenone; however, the initial dose in guidelines and clinical practice is generally 25 mg/day for both drugs and is the dose recommended in SPIRRIT-HFpEF. A dose of 25 mg every other day or 25 mg, half a tablet every day, may be prescribed at the investigator's discretion for patients judged to be at higher risk of hyperkalemia or kidney dysfunction. Patients who, at baseline, are known not to tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or who prefer eplerenone will be prescribed eplerenone. Eplerenone is relatively inexpensive, although more costly than spironolactone. Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is recommended to be increased to a target dose of 50 mg daily if tolerated.

Most previous registry-based randomized controlled trials (RRCTs) in Sweden have involved one-time interventions (i.e. not chronic therapy) without the need for monitoring during follow-up. Spironolactone is familiar to all clinicians but is associated with a risk of hyperkalemia and worsening kidney function; therefore, there are no required in-person follow-up visits in the trial.

### The effect of spironolactone on cardiovascular function and markers of fibrosis in people at increased risk of developing heart failure: The heart 'omics' in ageing (HOMAGE) randomized clinical trial [^113nJ7oB]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Many people with cardiovascular disease will develop heart failure, leading to substantial disability, demands on health services, and mortality. Early identification of cardiac dysfunction and therapeutic targeting of specific pathways of disease progression, such as myocardial and vascular fibrosis, might delay or prevent the onset of heart failure.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) improve cardiac structure, function, and prognosis in patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure (HFrEF), and perhaps also when LVEF is preserved (HFpEF). MRAs also reduce serum markers of collagen synthesis in patients with a range of cardiovascular diseases, including HFrEF and HFpEF, which might reflect favorable effects on fibrosis. Galectin-3 is a proposed marker of fibrotic activity and, in experimental models, a mediator of aldosterone-induced fibrosis. In the general population, higher plasma concentrations of galectin-3 predict the development of heart failure and, subsequently, a worse outcome.

Accordingly, we investigated whether spironolactone had favorable effects on serum markers of collagen metabolism in people at increased risk of developing heart failure and whether the effect was greater in patients with higher serum concentrations of galectin-3.

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112RMVNt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The TOPCAT study, published by Pitt B and colleagues in 2014 in The New England Journal of Medicine, investigated the effect of spironolactone in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 3,445 patients, comprising 1,775 females and 1,670 males. The inclusion criteria encompassed patients with HFpEF, while the key exclusion criteria included severe systemic illness with a life expectancy of less than three years, severe renal dysfunction, and specific coexisting conditions, medications, or acute events.

- **Interventions**: The interventions included 1,722 patients receiving spironolactone (15–45 mg/day) and 1,723 patients receiving a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference was found in death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for heart failure (18.6% vs. 20.4%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04).

- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant decrease in hospitalization for heart failure was observed (12% vs. 14.2%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). There was no significant difference in cardiovascular death (9.3% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12) or aborted cardiac arrest (0.2% vs. 0.3%; HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.5).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant differences were found in serious adverse events, serum creatinine level ≥ 3.0 mg/dL, or dialysis. However, there was a significant difference in hyperkalemia (18.7% vs. 9.1%) and hypokalemia (16.2% vs. 22.9%).

In conclusion, the TOPCAT study provided valuable insights into the effects and safety of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF.

### Spironolactone use at discharge was associated with improved survival in hospitalized patients with systolic heart failure [^112qerda]. American Heart Journal (2010). High credibility.

The RALES trial demonstrated that spironolactone improved the prognosis of patients with heart failure (HF). However, it is unknown whether the discharge use of spironolactone is associated with better long-term outcomes among hospitalized systolic HF patients in routine clinical practice. We examined the effects of spironolactone use at discharge on mortality and rehospitalization by comparing with outcomes in patients who did not receive spironolactone.

- **Methods**: The JCARE-CARD prospectively studied the characteristics and treatments in a broad sample of patients hospitalized with worsening HF. Outcomes were followed with an average of 2.2 years of follow-up.

- **Results**: A total of 946 patients had HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< 40%), among whom spironolactone was prescribed at discharge in 435 patients (46%), but not in 511 patients (54%). The mean age was 66.3 years, and 72.2% were male. The etiology was ischemic in 39.7%, and the mean LVEF was 27.1%. After adjustment for covariates, discharge use of spironolactone was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.612, P = 0.020) and cardiac death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.524, P = 0.013).

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with HF hospitalized for systolic dysfunction, spironolactone use at the time of discharge was associated with long-term survival benefit. These findings provide further support for the idea that spironolactone may be useful in patients hospitalized with HF and reduced LVEF.

### Appropriateness of spironolactone prescribing in heart failure patients: A population-based study [^115jxk7d]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) established the safety and benefit of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) patients with systolic dysfunction. However, recent data have raised concerns regarding hyperkalemia secondary to spironolactone use and suggest it occurs more commonly in routine practice.

- **Methods and results**: We explored factors potentially associated with hyperkalemia from spironolactone therapy in a population-based cohort of 9,165 HF patients hospitalized in Ontario, Canada, between 1999 and 2001. Compared with patients enrolled in RALES, community-based patients were older (mean age 75 years versus 65 years) and had worse renal function at baseline. Hyperkalemia occurred in 24% of patients during hospitalization, and 23% were discharged on potassium supplements. Although only 8% of patients had serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, many patients had stage III (53.1%), stage IV (12.8%), or stage V (3.9%) chronic renal insufficiency according to glomerular filtration rate.

- **Conclusion**: Spironolactone was often prescribed to inappropriate HF candidates because of the presence of relative or absolute contraindications. These findings highlight the need for more careful patient selection when prescribing spironolactone to minimize potential life-threatening hyperkalemia.

### Patiromer use in patients with heart failure: Lessons and clinical considerations from the DIAMOND trial [^11646Fin]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

The choice of target doses of the intervention in the DIAMOND trial was based on what was believed to be the best evidence for spironolactone and eplerenone. In the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial, patients were started on spironolactone 25 mg/day with an option to down-titrate to 25 mg every other day if there was an increase in serum potassium, or to up-titrate to 50 mg/day after 8 weeks if there were signs of worsening heart failure without hyperkalemia. While the average dose of spironolactone was 26 mg/day, a 50 mg/day dose was thought to be more effective based on the finding of lower atrial natriuretic hormone levels in the RALES dose-finding study.

The EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) used a starting dose of 25 mg/day with the option to up-titrate to 50 mg/day. While many patients did not achieve this dose, this dosing strategy was chosen in line with the pivotal trials, based on a judgment that higher doses were not assessed in earlier trials precisely due to the risk of hyperkalemia despite better surrogate improvement at higher doses. Thus, while not guideline-recommended, using best judgment based on the totality of evidence may be an option when designing trials.

### Spironolactone treatment and clinical outcomes in patients with systolic dysfunction and mild heart failure symptoms: a retrospective analysis [^113CHfAd]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

The effect of spironolactone on clinical outcomes in patients with mild heart failure is unclear.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a retrospective analysis of 482 consecutive patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% and New York Heart Association I-II symptoms. Major cardiac event (MCE) was defined as death, left ventricular assist device implantation, or United Network of Organ Sharing 1 cardiac transplantation. Proportional hazards analysis was used to determine predictors of MCE and to derive an adjusted hazard for spironolactone therapy. Spironolactone was prescribed to 279 (58%) patients, and mean follow-up was 1029 days. After controlling for predictors of clinical events, spironolactone treatment was associated with a trend for lower risk of MCE or heart failure rehospitalization (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.43–1.07; p = 0.095). Exploration of interaction terms between medications revealed that treatment with the combination of spironolactone and thiazide diuretics was associated with lower risk of clinical events (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12–0.89; p = 0.029).

- **Conclusion**: In subjects with mild heart failure treated with a thiazide diuretic, the use of spironolactone is associated with reduced risk of MCE or heart failure rehospitalization. A randomized controlled trial is necessary to accurately define the clinical effects of spironolactone in patients with mild heart failure.

### Low-dose spironolactone in the management of resistant hypertension: A surveillance study [^115JnSFj]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

We conducted an open observational study on the use of spironolactone at doses of 25–50 mg for managing patients with resistant hypertension. This medication was recommended for 133 patients who were already on an angiotensin-blocking drug in addition to other therapies.

Of these patients, three defaulted from follow-up and 11 could not tolerate spironolactone, resulting in outcome data for 119 patients. The addition of spironolactone, with a median dose of 25 mg, was associated with a significant mean (SD) reduction in systolic blood pressure of 21.7 mmHg (24.0; P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure of 8.5 mmHg (14.9; P < 0.001). Spironolactone had to be discontinued in two patients due to an increase in serum potassium levels above 6.0 mmol/l, although the overall mean increase in serum potassium was just 0.3 mmol/l.

With careful monitoring of plasma electrolytes, spironolactone at a low dose is an effective adjunctive medication in patients with hypertension resistant to a regime that includes an angiotensin-blocking agent.

### Incidence, predictors and clinical management of hyperkalaemia in new users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^116osiB2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone and eplerenone, are recommended by hypertension and heart failure clinical guidelines due to their capacity to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality in large randomized, placebo-controlled trials. However, MRAs may induce hyperkalaemia, and fear of hyperkalaemia likely limits their use.

Randomized controlled trials of MRAs report rates of hyperkalaemia that may not reflect the heterogeneous reality of clinical practice. 'Real-world' observational studies show suboptimal MRA use, dose titration, and poor clinical follow-up that may increase hyperkalaemia risk. Management of hyperkalaemia is most often centered on eliminating modifiable causes, such as lowering dietary potassium (K+) intake and/or discontinuing or lowering the dose of hyperkalaemia-inducing medications. Some of these measures involve therapeutic compromises, as the cessation of MRAs deprives patients of their beneficial cardiovascular effects. Understanding the extent of this practice and identifying patients at risk of MRA discontinuation is clinically important. However, rates of MRA discontinuation after hyperkalaemia in real-world settings have been poorly quantified.

Studies with broader coverage, such as those derived from healthcare records, may be relevant to inform clinical practice. We constructed a large, contemporary, and region-representative cohort of unselected new users of MRA to estimate the 1-year incidence of hyperkalaemia and related factors.

### Beneficial effects of adding spironolactone to recommended antihypertensive treatment in diabetic nephropathy: a randomized, double-masked, cross-over study [^112mUHFk]. Diabetes Care (2005). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and short-term effect of adding spironolactone to conventional antihypertensive treatment, including diuretics and maximally recommended doses of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), on albuminuria and blood pressure in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.

Twenty-one type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy were enrolled in a randomized, double-masked, cross-over study. Patients were treated in random order with spironolactone 25 mg once daily and a matched placebo for 8 weeks each, in addition to ongoing antihypertensive treatment, including diuretics and maximally recommended doses of an ACE inhibitor and/or an ARB. At the end of each treatment period, albuminuria, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined.

During the addition of placebo, values were as follows: albuminuria (geometric mean [range]) 1,566 [655–7,762] mg/24 h, ABP (mean ± SE) 138 ± 3/71 ± 1 mmHg, and GFR (mean ± SE) 74 ± 6 ml/min per 1.73 m². During the addition of spironolactone, albuminuria was reduced by 33% (95% CI 25–41) (P < 0.001), fractional clearance of albumin by 40% (24–53) (P < 0.001), and 24-hour ABP by 6 mmHg (2–10) for systolic and 4 mmHg (2–6) for diastolic (P < 0.001 for both). The change in albuminuria did not correlate with the change in systolic 24-hour ABP (r = 0.19, P = 0.42) or diastolic 24-hour ABP (r = 0.01, P = 0.96). Spironolactone treatment induced an insignificant reversible reduction in GFR.

### Spironolactone for hypertension [^114tVnfi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, considered fourth-line therapy for hypertension in patients already treated with multiple medications.

- **Objectives**: Primary: to determine the effect of spironolactone on patient mortality and morbidity, and to quantify the magnitude of the blood pressure-lowering effect of spironolactone monotherapy. Secondary: to determine the prevalence of adverse reactions observed with spironolactone monotherapy and to ascertain if there is a blood pressure-lowering dose response with spironolactone.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (3rd Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (2005 - Sept. 2009), and EMBASE (2007 - Sept. 2009). References from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any studies missed in the initial search. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected RCTs studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary or gestational hypertension and studies where patients were receiving multiple antihypertensives.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. Data synthesis and analysis were performed using RevMan 5.

- **Main results**: Meta-analysis of the 5 cross-over studies found a reduction in SBP of 20.09 mmHg (95% CI: 16.58–23.06, p < 0.00001) and a 6.75 mmHg (95% CI: 4.8–8.69, p < 0.00001) reduction in DBP. These results were statistically significant.

### Incident hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, and clinical outcomes during spironolactone treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^114vy5Ek]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF) randomized in the Americas as part of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial, treatment with spironolactone enhanced the risk of hyperkalemia but reduced the risk of hypokalemia. We examined the clinical correlates and prognostic implications of incident hypo- and hyperkalemia during study follow-up.

- **Methods**: We defined the region-specific incidence of hypokalemia (potassium [K+] < 3.5 mmol/l) and hyperkalemia (K+ ≥ 5.5 mmol/l) among both placebo- and spironolactone-assigned patients in TOPCAT. Factors associated with incident hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, and the relationship between incident K+ abnormalities and the risk of subsequent mortality were analyzed in multivariable regression models restricted to the Americas.

- **Results**: In the Americas, assignment to spironolactone increased risk for hyperkalemia (hazard ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 2.46–4.20, p < 0.001) and reduced the risk of hypokalemia (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.34–0.55, p < 0.001). Assignment to spironolactone, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, higher baseline K+, diabetes, and lower hemoglobin were associated with incident hyperkalemia, whereas assignment to placebo, lower K+, younger age, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and use of diuretics at baseline were associated with hypokalemia.

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^116fW1hy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

- **Figure 1**: Scatterplot showing the relationship between baseline aldosterone levels and the highest MRA dose reached, in spironolactone equivalent, to achieve unsuppressed renin levels. The "r" value is 0.52, indicating a moderate correlation. MRA stands for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

Over the course of treatment, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 148.0 (SD 18.4) to 125.8 (SD 11.8) mm Hg and mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 81.2 (SD 17.5) to 71.6 (SD 11.6) mm Hg (P < 0.001 for both). Mean plasma renin activity (PRA) increased from 0.49 (SD 0.22) to 4.66 (SD 5.58) ng/ml/h (P < 0.001). Changes in individual patients' blood pressure and renin levels are shown in Figure 2. The mean aldosterone-to-renin ratio decreased from 55.0 (SD 63.2) to 22.7 (SD 38.0) (P < 0.001). The majority (24/39; 61.5%) of patients had at least one baseline anti-hypertensive medication stopped during the course of MRA up-titration. Mean potassium levels increased from 4.18 (SD 0.48) to 4.66 (SD 0.41) mEq/dl (P < 0.001). Mean eGFR decreased from 71.9 (SD 19.9) to 61.9 (SD 21.1) ml/min/1.73 m² (P < 0.001).

- **Figure 2**: Changes in systolic blood pressure (a), diastolic blood pressure (b), and plasma renin activity (c) at the individual patient level.

In the subgroup of 32 (82.1%) patients who achieved unsuppressed PRA, the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased from 144.9 (SD 14.6) and 78.8 mm Hg (SD 14.9) at baseline to 125.3 (SD 11.5) and 71.4 mm Hg (SD 11.1), respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The mean number of anti-hypertensive medications decreased from 3.4 (SD 1.3) at baseline to 2.4 (SD 1.5) after achievement of unsuppressed PRA (P < 0.001).

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): Rationale and design [^1156CLXw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). High credibility.

The benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in heart failure with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HFmrEF) have not been established. Conventional randomized controlled trials are complex and expensive. The Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT‐HFpEF) is a unique pragmatic registry‐based randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: SPIRRIT‐HFpEF is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint trial conducted on platforms in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) and the United States (US) Trial Innovation Network. Patients with HFpEF/HFmrEF are randomized 1:1 to spironolactone (or eplerenone) in addition to usual care, versus usual care alone. The primary outcome is the total number of cardiovascular deaths and hospitalizations for heart failure. Outcomes are collected from Swedish administrative complete coverage registries and a US call center and subsequently adjudicated. Simple eligibility criteria were based on data available in SwedeHF: heart failure as outpatient or at discharge from the hospital, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide > 300 ng/L (in sinus rhythm) or > 750 ng/L (in atrial fibrillation), with pre-specified adjustment for elevated body mass index, and chronic loop diuretic use. Power and sample size assessments were based on an event‐driven design, allowing enrolment over approximately 6 years, and application of hazard ratios from the TOPCAT trial, Americas subset.

### Cardiovascular profile of pharmacological agents used for the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^116WKvj9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

**Antiandrogens – Spironolactone**: Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that binds to the testosterone receptor and is used in PCOS for the reduction of hirsutism. In patients with established cardiovascular disease and heart failure, spironolactone has been shown to be beneficial. In a number of small studies, spironolactone therapy was shown to decrease triglycerides, increase HDL, and decrease IR in patients with PCOS, and normalize endothelial dysfunction. However, in combination with an OCP, there were no cardiovascular risk advantages. Spironolactone may therefore have some cardioprotective benefit, but there are no medium to long-term clinical trials to advise on this in PCOS, though it may be of clear benefit in heart failure patients.

### The adequacy of laboratory monitoring in patients treated with spironolactone for congestive heart failure [^1134Pu2R]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

This study was designed to determine the adequacy of monitoring patients receiving spironolactone, as well as spironolactone's relationship to hyperkalemia. After the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) demonstrated a 30% mortality benefit for treating severe heart failure patients with spironolactone, the acceptance of this drug was overwhelming. Hyperkalemia and worsening renal function were rare in RALES, but laboratory monitoring was frequent. In clinical practice, the incidence of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function and adequacy of follow-up is unknown.

We reviewed the monitoring of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients with spironolactone initiation after the publication of RALES. All potassium and creatinine determinations at baseline and within three months following therapy initiation were assessed. Increased potassium was defined as any [K] ≥ 5.5 mEq/l and severe hyperkalemia as any [K] ≥ 6.0.

A total of 840 patients had new prescriptions for spironolactone. Of these, 91% had baseline laboratory values, but 34% did not have any serum potassium or creatinine determined within three months. Patients seen in the cardiology clinic were more likely to have appropriate follow-up.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^1112mbNC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Spironolactone versus placebo**: Three trials evaluated this comparison. One trial provided useful data for a 200 mg daily dose in a crossover trial examining 29 women. For the inflamed lesion count, the mean difference (MD) in favor of spironolactone was 26.1 lesions fewer, despite baseline imbalance in favor of the placebo (p < 0.00001; per-protocol population of 21, both phases combined). Data for the first phase, which would be free of any potential carryover effects, were not reported. Combined data from both phases showed that 18 out of 21 women taking spironolactone, compared with 5 out of 21 taking placebo, reported improvement (risk ratio (RR) 3.6, 95% CI 1.64–7.89; p = 0.001) and 15 out of 20 versus 4 out of 20 had at least a 50% reduction in inflamed lesion count (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.51–9.34; p = 0.005).

	- In a mixed gender randomized controlled trial (RCT), 24 out of 30 participants receiving spironolactone (50 mg/day, including 27 women) improved, compared with 2 out of 25 receiving placebo (per-protocol population). Separate data were unavailable for females. A similar issue arose in the third trial, which also included males. Data could not be extracted for three women receiving the 50 mg dose, but 6 out of 9 women receiving doses of 100–200 mg/day improved, irrespective of which outcome measures were used (per-protocol population). In neither mixed-gender trial was the extent of improvement quantified.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^117CmhVS]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

This pre-specified analysis evaluated AMBER primary and secondary endpoints according to heart failure (HF) status, as determined by patient medical history. The primary endpoint was the difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients remaining on spironolactone at week 12. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the difference between treatment groups in the change in systolic automated office blood pressure (AOBP) from baseline to week 12, or to the last available measurement before the addition of any new antihypertensive medications or an increase in any of the baseline antihypertensive medications.

- **Post hoc analyses of other endpoints according to HF status included**: Differences in cumulative spironolactone dose, Kaplan–Meier estimated time to discontinuation of spironolactone, percent of patients receiving spironolactone 50 mg once daily, daily dose of patiromer, rate of discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia, Kaplan–Meier estimate of the time to serum potassium (K⁺) ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, and serum potassium levels over time.

- **Safety assessments**: Conducted through vital signs, reports of adverse events (AEs), changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline to week 12, and changes in laboratory parameters, including N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and urine albumin/creatinine ratio.

Patiromer releases calcium as it binds to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, and it may bind other cations such as magnesium. Therefore, laboratory assessments included serum calcium (normal range 2.12–2.62 mmol/L) and magnesium (normal range 0.74–0.99 mmol/L) levels over time, and the number of patients with pre-specified serum calcium and magnesium levels.
