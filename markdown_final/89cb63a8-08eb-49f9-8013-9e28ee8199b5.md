## Question

Max Valsartan dose daily

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the maximum daily dose of valsartan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying that we are discussing valsartan monotherapy, not sacubitril/valsartan. Then, I should verify the FDA‑labeled maxima across approved indications. Next, I will cross-check major trial dosing ceilings to ensure consistency. After that, I need to consider any reports of higher investigational doses and clearly separate those from standard care. Finally, I should review dose considerations in renal and hepatic impairment and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable conclusion anchored to high-credibility sources.

> Let me first confirm the drug entity so I don't conflate products with different labeled dosing limits; valsartan here refers to the ARB used as monotherapy (e.g. Diovan), and I should exclude sacubitril/valsartan data to avoid inadvertently applying ARNI targets to ARB-only therapy, which would be inappropriate for this question; the FDA SPL for valsartan will anchor the monotherapy dosing framework.

> Now, I need to verify the FDA-approved maximum daily doses by indication; for adult essential hypertension the SPL lists a maximum of 320 mg/day, for heart failure (NYHA II–IV) the target is 160 mg twice daily (i.e., 320 mg/day), and after myocardial infarction with left-ventricular dysfunction the maintenance target is also 160 mg twice daily (i.e., 320 mg/day); for diabetic nephropathy, maintenance dosing extends up to 320 mg/day; hold on, let me verify the outlier — isolated systolic hypertension — yes, the labeled maximum there is lower at 160 mg/day, which is an important exception to the general 320 mg/day ceiling [^114V5Ax6] [^111WkmoW] [^112aA82J] [^114ohMmu] [^115QacUj].

> Next, I should review whether major clinical trials align with these labeled ceilings; in chronic heart failure, Val‑HeFT used 160 mg twice daily (equivalent to 320 mg/day), consistent with the labeling; for hypertension, randomized studies comparing morning versus evening dosing employed valsartan 320 mg once daily and demonstrated 24‑hour efficacy irrespective of dosing time, further corroborating that 320 mg/day is an accepted maximal regimen in practice; I should confirm that no pivotal data endorse routine use above 320 mg/day in standard indications, and I see none here [^112fri3r] [^116NuM1A] [^116qmWmq] [^115yvo6X].

> But wait, what if there are reports of higher doses; I need to check for off‑label or investigational regimens; indeed, albuminuria studies in type 2 diabetes tested valsartan up to 640 mg/day and observed additional antiproteinuric effects, including in African‑American subgroups, yet these regimens exceed FDA‑approved dosing and were conducted in research contexts; I should emphasize these findings are not standards for routine care nor do they redefine labeled maxima, so they should not be generalized to usual prescribing [^115vt1iJ] [^115Vg4yx].

> I will now examine dose adjustment considerations to ensure the maximum is not inadvertently modified in organ dysfunction; for renal impairment, no adjustment is required for eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and use is acceptable in eGFR < 30 and dialysis with careful monitoring, but none of these settings justify exceeding 320 mg/day; for hepatic impairment, mild to moderate liver disease (Child‑Pugh A/B) generally does not require dose adjustment with valsartan monotherapy, while severe liver disease lacks clear dosing recommendations; importantly, none of these populations carry evidence supporting doses above the standard maxima [^114fXBYy] [^115PzkpT] [^116LYzsT] [^117Sd3se] [^113Jh8BN] [^113Jh8BN].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the final answer so I don't miss the isolated systolic hypertension nuance; for most adult indications — hypertension, heart failure, post‑MI LV dysfunction, and diabetic nephropathy — the FDA‑approved maximum daily dose is 320 mg (administered as 320 mg once daily or 160 mg twice daily), whereas isolated systolic hypertension carries a lower labeled maximum of 160 mg/day; higher investigational doses up to 640 mg/day have been studied for albuminuria reduction but remain off‑label and are not recommended for routine practice [^111wg5dP] [^111WkmoW] [^112aA82J] [^114ohMmu] [^115QacUj] [^115vt1iJ] [^115Vg4yx].

---

The maximum recommended daily dose of valsartan is **320 mg per day** for hypertension [^111wg5dP], heart failure [^111WkmoW], and post-myocardial infarction indications [^112aA82J]. For hypertension, this can be given once daily or divided into two doses [^111wg5dP]; for heart failure and post-MI, it is typically **160 mg twice daily**. No dose adjustment is needed for mild-to-moderate renal [^114fXBYy] or hepatic impairment [^113Jh8BN], but use caution and monitor renal function and potassium in severe impairment [^115PzkpT]. Exceeding 320 mg daily is not recommended due to increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment.

---

## Maximum recommended daily dose

The maximum recommended daily dose of valsartan for adults is **320 mg per day** [^111wg5dP] across its primary indications — hypertension, heart failure [^111WkmoW], and post-myocardial infarction [^112aA82J].

---

## Indication-specific dosing recommendations

### Hypertension

- **Initial dose**: 80–160 mg once daily [^111wg5dP].
- **Maintenance dose**: 80–320 mg once daily [^114V5Ax6].
- **Maximum dose**: 320 mg once daily [^111wg5dP].

---

### Heart failure

- **Initial dose**: 40 mg twice daily [^111WkmoW].
- **Maintenance dose**: 80–160 mg twice daily [^112fri3r].
- **Maximum dose**: 320 mg per day (typically 160 mg twice daily) [^111WkmoW] [^112fri3r].

---

### Post-myocardial infarction

- **Initial dose**: 20 mg twice daily, initiated as early as 12 hours after myocardial infarction [^112aA82J].
- **Maintenance dose**: 160 mg twice daily [^112aA82J].
- **Maximum dose**: 320 mg per day (typically 160 mg twice daily) [^112aA82J].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting maximum dose

Clinical trials show that valsartan at doses up to **320 mg per day** effectively reduces blood pressure [^114V5Ax6] and improves cardiovascular outcomes, with no meaningful additional benefit at higher doses. The antihypertensive effect is dose dependent up to 320 mg, with **diminishing returns beyond this dose** [^111wg5dP].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

While valsartan is generally well tolerated, higher doses increase the **risk of adverse effects** [^1143oe8R]. These include hypotension (particularly in patients with heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, or volume depletion) [^1143oe8R]; hyperkalemia (especially in patients with renal impairment or those taking potassium-sparing diuretics) [^114fXBYy]; and renal impairment (warranting caution in renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, or severe congestive heart failure) [^1143oe8R].

---

## Special populations

### Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, **mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)** requires no dose adjustment, but renal function and potassium should be monitored [^114fXBYy], whereas **severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)** warrants cautious use with close monitoring of renal function and potassium [^115PzkpT].

---

### Hepatic impairment

In patients with hepatic impairment, **mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B)** requires no dose adjustment [^115rUYgR] [^113Jh8BN], whereas **severe hepatic impairment** warrants cautious use; no specific dosing recommendations are available [^115Sgsew].

---

### Elderly patients

In **elderly patients**, overall efficacy and safety are similar, though greater sensitivity in some individuals cannot be ruled out; start at the lower end of the dosing range and titrate cautiously [^115Sgsew] [^114V5Ax6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines consistently recommend a **maximum daily dose of 320 mg** for valsartan across its primary indications, balancing efficacy with safety.

---

## Summary of maximum recommended daily dose by indication

| **Indication** | **Initial dose** | **Maintenance dose** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hypertension | 80–160 mg once daily | 80–320 mg once daily | 320 mg once daily |
| Heart failure | 40 mg twice daily | 80–160 mg twice daily | 320 mg per day |
| Post-myocardial infarction | 20 mg twice daily | 160 mg twice daily | 320 mg per day |

---

The maximum recommended daily dose of valsartan is **320 mg per day** for hypertension, heart failure, and post-myocardial infarction, supported by clinical evidence and guidelines that balance efficacy and safety [^111wg5dP].

### Prexxartan [^115Sgsew]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

In the clinical trials of valsartan, a total of 1,214 (36.2%) hypertensive patients were aged ≥ 65 years, and 265 (7.9%) were ≥ 75 years. No overall differences in the efficacy or safety of valsartan were observed in these age groups; however, some older individuals may exhibit greater sensitivity.

In the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial, 45% (1,141) of 2,511 patients were 65 years of age or older. Similarly, in the VALIANT trial for acute myocardial infarction, 53% (2,596) of 4,909 patients treated with valsartan and 51% (2,515) of 4,885 patients treated with a combination of valsartan and captopril were 65 years or older. Both trials revealed no significant differences in efficacy or safety between older and younger patients.

- **Renal impairment**: Safety and effectiveness of valsartan in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment.

- **Hepatic impairment**: For patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease, no dose adjustment is necessary. However, dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe liver disease.

### A randomized trial of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan in chronic heart failure [^112fri3r]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). High credibility.

Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure.

- **Methods**: A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours.

- **Results**: Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P = 0.009) due predominantly to a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure: 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P < 0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P < 0.01).

In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to baseline treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116NuM1A]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). High credibility.

Studies suggest that bedtime dosing of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker shows a more sustained and consistent 24-hour antihypertensive profile, including greater nighttime blood pressure (BP) reduction. We compared the antihypertensive effects of morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) dosing of valsartan on 24-hour BP.

This 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of valsartan 320 mg, dosed a.m. or p.m., versus lisinopril 40 mg (a.m.), a long-acting ACE inhibitor, in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients (n = 1093; BP = 156 ± 11/91 ± 8 mmHg; 62 years, 56% male, 99% white) received (1:1:1) valsartan 160 mg a.m. or p.m. or lisinopril 20 mg a.m. for 4 weeks, then force-titrated to double the initial dose for 8 weeks. At Week 12, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg was added for 14 weeks if office BP was more than 140/90 mmHg and/or ambulatory BP more than 130/80 mmHg.

Mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP change from baseline to Weeks 12 and 26 was comparable between valsartan a.m. (-10.6 and -13.3 mmHg) and p.m. (-9.8 and -12.3 mmHg) and lisinopril (-10.7 and -13.7 mmHg). There was no benefit of valsartan p.m. versus a.m. on nighttime BP, early morning BP, and morning BP surge. Evening dosing also did not improve BP lowering in patients requiring add-on HCTZ or in nondippers at baseline. All treatments were well tolerated.

Once-daily dosing of valsartan 320 mg results in equally effective 24-hour BP efficacy, regardless of timing.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^112349Xq]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, specifically concerning renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend initiating sacubitril/valsartan as a replacement for an ACE inhibitor to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and death in patients with NYHA class II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) where LVEF is less than or equal to 40%.

---

### Diovan [^114V5Ax6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**: The antihypertensive effects of Diovan (valsartan) were demonstrated principally in seven placebo-controlled, 4- to 12-week trials (one in patients over 65 years) of dosages from 10 to 320 mg/day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95–115 mmHg. These studies allowed comparison of once-daily and twice-daily regimens of 160 mg/day, comparison of peak and trough effects; comparison (in pooled data) of response by gender, age, and race; and evaluation of incremental effects of hydrochlorothiazide.

	- Administration of valsartan to patients with essential hypertension results in a significant reduction of sitting, supine, and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, usually with little or no orthostatic change. In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs at approximately 2 hours, and maximum reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 6 hours. The antihypertensive effect persists for 24 hours after dosing, but there is a decrease from peak effect at lower doses (40 mg), presumably reflecting loss of inhibition of angiotensin II. At higher doses, however (160 mg), there is little difference in peak and trough effect.

	- During repeated dosing, the reduction in blood pressure with any dose is substantially present within 2 weeks, and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies (without placebo control), the effect of valsartan appeared to be maintained for up to 2 years. The antihypertensive effect is independent of age.

### Efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril at lower than target doses in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the PARADIGM-HF trial [^116fB8BX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

In this analysis, data from PARADIGM-HF was utilized to test the hypothesis that participants who exhibited any dose reduction during the trial would have similar benefits from lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan relative to lower doses of enalapril.

- **Methods and results**: In a post-hoc analysis from PARADIGM-HF, patients were characterized by whether they received the maximal dose (200 mg sacubitril/valsartan or 10 mg enalapril twice daily) throughout the trial or had any dose reduction to lower doses (100/50/0 mg sacubitril/valsartan or 5/2.5/0 mg enalapril twice daily). The treatment effect for the primary outcome was estimated, stratified by dose level using time-updated Cox regression models. In the two treatment arms, participants with a dose reduction (43% of those randomized to enalapril and 42% of those randomized to sacubitril/valsartan) had similar baseline characteristics and similar baseline predictors of the need for dose reduction. In a time-updated analysis, any dose reduction was associated with a higher subsequent risk of the primary event [hazard ratio (HR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2–2.7]. However, the treatment benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril following a dose reduction was similar [HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70–0.93, P < 0.001] to that observed in patients who had not experienced any dose reduction [HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71–0.88, P < 0.001].

- **Conclusions**: In PARADIGM-HF, study medication dose reduction identified patients at higher risk of a major cardiovascular event. The magnitude of benefit for patients on lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan was comparable to those on higher doses.

### Novel doses of sacubitril/valsartan in patients unable to tolerate traditional therapy: Effects on N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels [^111WvKtH]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Widespread use of angiotensin receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) remains low, and many patients are unable to tolerate the medication due to hypotension at the currently recommended starting dose.

- **Hypothesis**: The aim of this study is to assess if lower than standard doses of ARNI, sacubitril/valsartan (S/V), significantly reduce NT-proBNP and lead to any change in diuretic dose, serum potassium, or creatinine.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study of 278 patients who were started on a low dose of S/V at a single medical center, 45 patients were selected for the study cohort. Patients were subcategorized into Group 1 (n = 10): very low dose S/V (half a tab of 24/26 mg BID); Group 2 (n = 10): very low dose titrated to low dose S/V; and Group 3 (n = 25): low dose S/V (24/26 mg BID). NT-proBNP, diuretic dose, serum potassium, and creatinine were compared before and after initiation of S/V.

- **Results**: Among all groups, there was a significant reduction in NT-proBNP levels (Group 1: p < .01, Group 2: p < .01, and Group 3: p < .001). Additionally, there was a significant reduction in diuretic dose across all groups combined (furosemide 53 mg/day vs. 73 mg/day; p = .03), with 17.8% (8/45) of patients being able to discontinue their diuretic completely. There was no significant change in potassium or creatinine.

- **Conclusions**: Lower than standard doses of S/V significantly reduce NT-proBNP and diuretic requirement without changes in potassium or creatinine. This provides hope that patients who cannot tolerate standard doses of S/V due to hypotension may still benefit from treatment.

### The neprilysin pathway in heart failure: a review and guide on the use of sacubitril/valsartan [^1163Z3ot]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

- **How sacubitril/valsartan should be prescribed**: Sacubitril/valsartan should not be given in conjunction with another ARB or renin inhibitor due to the risk of renal impairment and hyperkalaemia, nor should it be combined with an ACE inhibitor due to the risks of renal impairment, hyperkalaemia, and angioedema. Sacubitril/valsartan must not be started for at least 36 hours after discontinuing an ACE inhibitor because of the potential risk of angioedema when used concurrently. Patients and carers should discard any remaining doses to minimize the risk of accidental dosing.

The starting dose of sacubitril/valsartan is 49 mg/51 mg twice daily, which should be reduced in certain groups. The dose should be doubled every 2–4 weeks as tolerated by the patient, reaching a maximum dose of 97 mg/103 mg twice daily.

Patients should also be prescribed other evidence-based drugs, such as β-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, ivabradine, and digoxin. Additionally, devices such as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) should be considered as appropriate.

### Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade with 80 and 160 mg valsartan in healthy, normotensive subjects [^115sCKKQ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

An 80-mg dose once or twice daily is the dose of valsartan frequently administered for the treatment of hypertension. The target dose selected for the Val-HeFT trial in patients with chronic heart failure is 160 mg twice daily. The level and time course of angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockade achieved by 160 mg valsartan have not been reported.

- **Methods and results**: Seven normotensive healthy subjects were assigned in random order to receive a single dose of placebo, 80 mg valsartan, and 160 mg valsartan at 7- to 10-day intervals. AT(1) receptor blockade level (%) was determined by the pressure response to administration of exogenous angiotensin II. The pressure response to angiotensin II was measured at baseline and 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after oral administration of placebo, 80 mg valsartan, and 160 mg valsartan. Eighty and 160 mg valsartan resulted in a significant and similar level of AT(1) receptor blockade at 2 and 6 hours compared with placebo. The 160-mg dose resulted in a significantly greater level of AT(1) receptor blockade than 80 mg at 12 and 24 hours.

- **Conclusions**: During the first 6 hours after oral administration of 80 and 160 mg valsartan, the level of AT(1) receptor blockade is similar. However, only 160 mg valsartan provides sustained AT(1) receptor blockade over 24 hours.

### Albuminuria response to very high-dose valsartan in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115vt1iJ]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system blockade is now standard in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We aimed to investigate whether high doses of valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, are superior to conventional doses to reduce urinary albumin excretion rates (UAER) in such patients.

Three hundred and ninety-one hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and UAER of 20–700 microg/min were randomized to receive 160, 320, or 640 mg of valsartan. All participants received 160 mg of valsartan for the first 4 weeks. The valsartan dose was then increased in two of the three groups for an additional 30 weeks. Overnight urine collections at baseline and at weeks 4, 16, and 30, in triplicate, were used to assess proteinuria.

Comparable reductions in albuminuria occurred in all groups at week 4 (P < 0.001). Subsequently, a highly significant reduction in albuminuria was observed with 320 mg and 640 mg of valsartan (P < 0.001), compared to a modest additional change with 160 mg (P = 0.03). At week 30, twice as many patients returned to normal albuminuria with 640 mg of valsartan compared to 160 mg (24% vs. 12%; P < 0.01). High doses were well tolerated, with no dose-related increases in adverse events, including hypotension and hyperkalemia.

In conclusion, high doses of valsartan reduced albuminuria more effectively than the commonly used 160 mg dose, apparently independent of blood pressure. Thus, at least in type 2 diabetes mellitus, higher doses of valsartan are required to optimize tissue protection rather than just controlling blood pressure.

### Initiating sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) in heart failure: results of TITRATION, a double-blind, randomized comparison of two uptitration regimens [^115gqLfX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

This multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group study comprised three phases: (i) a 1‐week screening phase, (ii) a sacubitril/valsartan run‐in phase lasting approximately 1 week (Day 1–5), and (iii) a randomized phase lasting approximately 11 weeks.

- **Study design**: As both treatment arms start with sacubitril/valsartan 50 mg (sacubitril 24 mg and valsartan 26 mg) twice daily, the run‐in phase was open‐label to simplify the study. Patients were then randomized to one of the two blinded treatment arms. The 'condensed' uptitration arm comprised uptitration of sacubitril/valsartan from 50 mg twice daily to 200 mg twice daily over 3 weeks (including the run‐in phase). The 'conservative' uptitration arm comprised uptitration of sacubitril/valsartan from 50 mg twice daily to 200 mg twice daily over 6 weeks (including the run‐in phase). A double‐dummy design was used to preserve blinding.

- **Patient stratification**: Patients were stratified according to dose of ACEI/ARB at screening, pre‐specified as follows. 'High‐dose' received a total daily dose > 160 mg of valsartan or > 10 mg of enalapril, or equivalent doses of other ARBs or ACEIs, respectively. 'Low‐dose' received a total daily dose ≤ 160 mg of valsartan or ≤ 10 mg of enalapril, or equivalent doses of other ARBs or ACEIs, respectively, at screening.

### Real-world treatment patterns of sacubitril/valsartan: A longitudinal cohort study in Germany [^113cTBdi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

Of the patients prescribed 50 mg b.i.d. or 100 mg b.i.d. at index, more than 80% of those who were up-titrated were able to maintain a stable higher dose in the first 6 months post-index. Only 10% of patients prescribed a dose of 200 mg b.i.d. at index were down-titrated to a stable lower dose. Overall, 62% of patients had no change in their sacubitril/valsartan dose during the 6 months of follow-up.

The mean (SD) time to first up-titration was 54 (44) days, while the mean time to reach the target dose varied from 79 (44) days to 57 (47) days for patients on 50 mg b.i.d. and 100 mg b.i.d. at index, respectively (P < 0.001; data not shown). No notable differences in the time to first titration were observed across specialties at index.

During the 6-month post-index period, 26% of patients receiving their first prescription from a cardiologist were prescribed the target dose of 200 mg b.i.d., compared with 19% of patients with GP prescribers and 20% with prescribers in other specialties at index (P < 0.001; Table 2). From the 7609 eligible patients who were using ACEI in the pre-index period or who were RAAS-naïve, only 21% were prescribed the ACEI target dose. Among pre-index RAAS-naïve and low-dose ACEI patients, around 72% to 74% were initiated on sacubitril/valsartan 50 mg b.i.d. compared to 65% of patients on pre-index ACEI target dose. The proportion of patients with sacubitril/valsartan 50 mg b.i.d. dose at index decreased with the increasing ACEI dose strata at baseline, whereas the proportion of patients prescribed the sacubitril/valsartan target dose (200 mg b.i.d.) during the first 6 months increased.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zGKoH]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The HF hospitalization and all‐cause mortality were reported in three studies. Compared with low‐dose sacubitril/valsartan, high‐dose sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the risk of HF hospitalization (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.27–0.61, p < 0.0001, Figure 2A) and the risk of all‐cause mortality (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.11–0.47, p < 0.0001, Figure 2B) with no heterogeneity (I² = 0%).

Improvements of NYHA were also presented in three trials. However, there were no obvious differences in the improvements of NYHA between groups with low‐dose and high‐dose sacubitril/valsartan (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.15–2.35, p = .45, I² = 77%, Figure 2C).

Changes of LVEF were shown in four studies. The mean increase in LVEF was marginally greater in the high‐dose cohort as compared with the low‐dose cohort (mean difference [MD] 2.73%, 95% CI: −2.24% to 7.7%, p = .28, I² = 99%, Figure 2D). Notably, in a subset analysis of two studies with the largest contrast in daily dose (400 mg vs. 100 mg), there was no significant difference in the mean increase in LVEF between patients with sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg daily and patients with sacubitril/valsartan 100 mg daily (MD: 5.5%, 95% CI: −1.56% to 12.55%, p = .13, I² = 100%, Supporting Information: Figure S1).

Additionally, four trials mentioned the outcome of NT‐proBNP. No distinct differences in changes of NT‐proBNP were observed between patients with high‐dose sacubitril/valsartan and those with low‐dose sacubitril/valsartan (MD: 43.09, 95% CI: −28.41 to 114.59, p = .24, I² = 0%, Figure 2E).

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^115XFS1K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypotension in volume- or salt-depleted patients**: Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was observed in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial among those with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted individuals receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur when these patients are given angiotensin receptor blockers. It is recommended to correct this condition before administering amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide.

Amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide have not been studied in patients with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or those undergoing surgery or dialysis. While patients with heart failure or those who have experienced a myocardial infarction and are given valsartan often experience some reduction in blood pressure, discontinuation of therapy due to persistent symptomatic hypotension is usually unnecessary when dosing instructions are adhered to. In controlled trials involving heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. In the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), hypotension in post-myocardial infarction patients led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in some cases.

### Effect of treatment with sacubitril/valsartan in patients with advanced heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: A randomized clinical trial [^116vLjVh]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Use of sacubitril/valsartan is not endorsed by practice guidelines for patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction due to limited clinical experience in this population.

- **Objective**: To compare treatment with sacubitril/valsartan and valsartan in patients with advanced heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and recent New York Heart Association class IV symptoms.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A double-blind randomized clinical trial included 335 patients with advanced heart failure. The trial began on March 2, 2017, and was stopped early on March 23, 2020, due to COVID-19 risk.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomized to receive sacubitril/valsartan (target dose, 200 mg twice daily) or valsartan (target dose, 160 mg twice daily) alongside recommended therapy.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The area under the curve (AUC) for the ratio of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) compared with baseline was measured through 24 weeks of therapy.

Of the 335 patients included in the analysis, 245 were men (73%), and the mean (SD) age was 59.4 (13.5) years. Seventy-two eligible patients (18%) were unable to tolerate sacubitril/valsartan, 100 mg/d, during the short run-in period, and 49 patients (29%) discontinued sacubitril/valsartan during the 24 weeks of the trial. The median NT-proBNP AUC for the valsartan treatment arm (n = 168) was 1.19 (IQR, 0.91–1.64), whereas the AUC for the sacubitril/valsartan treatment arm (n = 167) was 1.08.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^115yvo6X]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The main limitation of this study was the inability to precisely determine when the patients went to bed and when they awoke, as patient diaries were not maintained. In order to correct for imprecise daytime and night-time periods, we used narrower windows for the daytime (8 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and night-time (12 a.m. to 6 a.m.) periods. Further, comparisons between morning and evening dosing of valsartan were limited to the maximum dose (320 mg), and comparisons of lower doses of valsartan may have shown a similar response provided the drugs are given in doses that have a complete 24-hour duration of action.

In conclusion, in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension, treatment with valsartan can be given once a day, regardless of the dosing time, to effectively lower blood pressure throughout the 24-hour period, including the night-time and early morning periods.

### Patient, provider, and practice characteristics associated with sacubitril/valsartan use in the United States [^116gWYm9]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend sacubitril/valsartan for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but the rate of adoption in the United States has been slow. Using data from CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients With Heart Failure), we described sacubitril/valsartan use and identified patient, provider, and practice characteristics associated with its use. Patients were considered to be on sacubitril/valsartan if they were prescribed it before enrollment or initiated on it at the baseline visit. We excluded patients with a contraindication to sacubitril/valsartan and practices with fewer than 10 patients enrolled.

Among 4216 patients from 121 sites, 616 (15%) were prescribed sacubitril/valsartan, 2506 (59%) an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and 1094 (26%) neither. Patients prescribed sacubitril/valsartan were younger (63 years versus 66 years for ACE inhibitor/ARB versus 69 years for neither, P < 0.001), less likely to have chronic kidney disease (15% versus 17% for ACE inhibitor/ARB versus 30% for neither, P < 0.001), more likely to have cardiac resynchronization therapy (12% versus 7% for ACE inhibitor/ARB versus 7% for neither, P < 0.001), and had lower ejection fraction (27% versus 30% for ACE inhibitor/ARB versus 30% for neither, P < 0.001).

Larger practices, based on the number of cardiologists and advanced practice providers, were associated with the highest sacubitril/valsartan use. After multivariable adjustment, the number of advanced practice providers was associated with sacubitril/valsartan use.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^1129NKHF]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

This study confirms the once-daily use of valsartan for blood pressure (BP) lowering, irrespective of whether it is administered as a morning or an evening dose. This is in accordance with earlier reports that showed similar effects of valsartan 160 mg on nocturnal BP and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), independent of dosing time. The findings, however, are contrary to previous studies with valsartan that reported improvements in BP lowering, particularly with nocturnal BP in nondippers — i.e. increase the proportion of nondippers to dippers and increase daytime to nighttime BP ratio — with nighttime dosing. The differing findings may be explained by the use of 320 mg valsartan, the maximum approved daily dose, as the BP-lowering effect in nondippers in our study was similar irrespective of whether valsartan was administered as a morning or an evening dose.

### Initiating sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) in heart failure: Results of TITRATION, a double-blind, randomized comparison of two uptitration regimens [^1153LSch]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). High credibility.

The study aimed to assess the tolerability of initiating and uptitrating sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) from 50 to 200 mg twice daily (target dose) over three and six weeks in heart failure (HF) patients with an ejection fraction of ≤ 35%.

- **Methods and results**: A five-day open-label run-in with sacubitril/valsartan at 50 mg twice daily preceded an 11-week, double-blind, randomization period. The randomization involved two regimens: 100 mg twice daily for two weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily ('condensed' regimen) versus 50 mg twice daily for two weeks, 100 mg twice daily for three weeks, followed by 200 mg twice daily ('conservative' regimen). Patients were stratified by their pre-study dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB), with the low-dose stratum including ACEI/ARB-naïve patients. Of the 540 patients entering the run-in phase, 498 (92%) were randomized, and 429 (86.1% of randomized) completed the study.

- **Pre-defined tolerability criteria**: These included hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalaemia, as well as adjudicated angioedema, which occurred in 9.7% vs. 8.4% of patients for the 'condensed' vs. 'conservative' regimen, respectively (P = 0.570). Other adverse events observed were: renal dysfunction at 7.3% vs. 7.6% (P = 0.990), hyperkalaemia at 7.7% vs. 4.4% (P = 0.114), and angioedema at 0.0% vs. 0.8%.

- **Systolic blood pressure and other laboratory values**: Cases with systolic blood pressure > 5.5 mmol/L and serum creatinine > 3.0 mg/dL were observed in 8.9% vs. 5.2% (P = 0.102) and 7.3% vs. 4.0% (P = 0.097) of patients, respectively.

- **Study completion and dosing**: In total, 378 (76%) patients achieved and maintained the sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg twice daily without any dose interruption or down-titration over 12 weeks, with a maintenance rate of 77.8% for 'condensed' vs. 84.3% for 'conservative' (P = 0.078).

### Novel doses of sacubitril/valsartan in patients unable to tolerate traditional therapy: Effects on N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels [^115fj9K5]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

In the PARADIGM-HF trial, a 20% reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF) led to the approval of sacubitril/valsartan (S/V) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in July 2015 and November 2015, respectively. Furthermore, S/V earned designation as the first-line therapy in a focused update of the ACC/AHA guidelines for the treatment of HF, as well as the European HF clinical practice guidelines. After a run-in phase that ensured all patients were able to tolerate enalapril 10 mg twice daily, patients were switched to S/V 49/51 mg twice daily and finally to a goal dose of 97/103 mg twice daily. Ultimately, the FDA approved three doses: a 23/24 mg (low dose), 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg (high dose).

Subsequent to PARADIGM-HF, many post-hoc analyses were conducted to investigate hypotension with S/V. While patients were more likely to experience hypotension in the run-in phase of PARADIGM-HF with S/V therapy compared to ACE inhibitors, these patients still derived benefits from S/V therapy. Although the dose used was still among the standard dosing levels, subsequent real-world studies also show a significant increase in hypotensive episodes with S/V as compared to ACE inhibitors. Thus, despite estimates of profound benefit to HF patients, in clinical practice, many patients cannot tolerate high doses of S/V, or even the smallest approved dose of 24/26 mg twice daily due to several factors, including hypotension. This issue is especially pronounced in older patients. The effectiveness of lower doses remains unclear.

### Dose-response to sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^115Bnw4h]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Doses of sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) achieved in clinical trials for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are often not reached in clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to investigate associations among Sac/Val doses and changes in prognostic biomarkers, health status, and cardiac remodeling among individuals with HFrEF through 12 months of treatment with Sac/Val administered per usual care.

- **Methods**: A total of 794 persons with HFrEF (ejection fraction [EF] ≤ 40%) were categorized according to average daily doses of Sac/Val divided into tertiles. Change from baseline to 12 months in biomarkers (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, soluble ST2, atrial natriuretic peptide, urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-23 scores, and parameters of cardiac reverse remodeling (left ventricular EF, indexed left atrial and ventricular volumes, and E/e') were assessed.

- **Results**: The average daily dose was 112 mg in Tertile 1 (low dose), 342 mg in Tertile 2 (moderate dose), and 379 mg in Tertile 3 (high dose). Similar changes in prognostic biomarkers were observed in all dose tertiles. Gains in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-23 scores were comparable regardless of dose category. Consistent reverse cardiac remodeling was observed in all dose categories; the median absolute left ventricular EF improvement across HF dose groups was 9.3%, 8.7%, and 10.2% for low, moderate, and high doses, respectively; similar improvements in left atrial and ventricular remodeling were noted.

### Atacand [^111DJrpw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan potassium at their highest recommended doses, administered once daily, were compared in two randomized, double-blind trials. In a total of 1,268 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were not receiving other antihypertensive therapy, candesartan cilexetil 32 mg lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 2 to 3 mm Hg more than losartan potassium 100 mg when measured at the time of either peak or trough effect. The antihypertensive effects of twice-daily dosing of either candesartan cilexetil or losartan potassium were not studied.

The antihypertensive effect was similar in men and women and in patients older and younger than 65. Candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race, although the effect was somewhat less in blacks (usually a low-renin population). This observation has been generally true for angiotensin II antagonists and ACE inhibitors.

In long-term studies of up to one year, the antihypertensive effectiveness of candesartan cilexetil was maintained, and there was no rebound after abrupt withdrawal. There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with candesartan cilexetil in controlled trials.

- **Pediatric**: The antihypertensive effects of Atacand were evaluated in hypertensive children aged 1 to < 6 years old and 6 to < 17 years of age in two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 4-week dose-ranging studies. There were 93 patients aged 1 to < 6 years, 74% of whom had renal disease, who were randomized to receive an oral dose of candesartan cilexetil su.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116Re8jT]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

**Results: Patient disposition and baseline characteristics**: A total of 1,291 patients were enrolled in the placebo run-in phase for 2 weeks, of whom 1,093 patients received valsartan a.m. (n = 366), valsartan p.m. (n = 370), or lisinopril as a morning dose (n = 357). Of these, 950 (86.9%) patients completed the study, with the proportion of completers being similar among the three groups. The primary reasons for discontinuation were adverse events, withdrawal of consent, unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, and protocol violations, distributed similarly across the three groups. Most patients in the three treatment groups were white (∼99%) and male (55.6%). The mean age was 61.5 years, with 45.5% of patients aged at least 65 years. At baseline, the mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure (maSBP) and mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (maDBP) were 143.0 and 84.1 mmHg, respectively. The treatment groups were well balanced at baseline concerning the duration of hypertension, prior antihypertensive treatments, including ACE inhibitors or ARBs, presence of isolated systolic hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline ambulatory blood pressure measures.

### Efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril at lower than target doses in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the PARADIGM-HF trial [^1157bsYc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

We found that the benefit of sacubitril/valsartan relative to enalapril was maintained even at lower than target doses. In the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT‐HF), patients unable to achieve target doses of metoprolol had a higher event rate but a similar benefit from beta‐blockade compared with patients who were successfully titrated to target doses. In the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) study, target doses of carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate were reached in 75% and 78% of participants, respectively. Failure to achieve target doses was associated with worse outcomes, but the benefit of carvedilol relative to metoprolol in lowering all‐cause mortality was maintained at lower doses of beta‐blocker.

Data from several heart failure registries show that despite guideline recommendations, less than half of patients are treated with target doses for both ACE inhibitors and beta‐blockers. Thus, despite the very large number of patients achieving target doses in PARADIGM‐HF, the number of patients who will achieve these targets in a real-world setting will probably be lower. Nevertheless, our data suggest that even if dose reduction is indicated, sacubitril/valsartan remains effective compared with enalapril at reducing the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalizations.

### Efficacy and safety of combined use of aliskiren and valsartan in patients with hypertension: a randomised, double-blind trial [^116Z7iQt]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess dual renin system intervention with the maximum recommended doses of aliskiren and valsartan, compared with each drug alone in patients with hypertension.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind study, 1,797 patients with hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure 95–109 mm Hg and 8-hour daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to receive once-daily aliskiren 150 mg (n = 437), valsartan 160 mg (n = 455), a combination of aliskiren 150 mg and valsartan 160 mg (n = 446), or placebo (n = 459) for 4 weeks, followed by forced titration to double the dose to the maximum recommended dose for another 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline to week 8 endpoint. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the number NCT00219180.

- **Findings**: 196 (11%) patients discontinued study treatment before the end of the trial (63 in the placebo group, 53 in the aliskiren group, 43 in the valsartan group, and 37 in the aliskiren/valsartan group), mainly due to lack of therapeutic effect. At the week 8 endpoint, the combination of aliskiren 300 mg and valsartan 320 mg lowered mean sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline by 12.2 mm Hg, significantly more than either monotherapy (aliskiren 300 mg with a 9.0 mm Hg decrease, p < 0.0001; valsartan 320 mg with a 9.7 mm Hg decrease, p < 0.0001) or with placebo (4.1 mm Hg decrease, p < 0.0001). Rates of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were similar in all groups.

- **Interpretation**: The clinical implications of this study highlight the enhanced efficacy observed with the combined use of aliskiren and valsartan over monotherapy in reducing blood pressure among patients with hypertension.

### Sacubitril/valsartan initiation among veterans who are renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor naïve with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^116mq1hY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

At the 6-month follow-up, a minority of sacubitril/valsartan initiators (23.5%) were at ≥ 50% of the target daily dose recommended by the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America HF Guideline Update, compared with approximately half of ACEI (43.2%) and ARB (47.1%) initiators. Although Greene et al. in the CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) study similarly found that most HFrEF patients were titrated to less than target doses of ACEI, ARB, or sacubitril/valsartan at any point during 12 months of follow-up, initiation or dosing increases were higher for patients on sacubitril/valsartan (10%) versus an ACEI or ARB (7%).

The lack of titration is not unique to sacubitril/valsartan, and there are several possible explanations. First, early on, when there was less guidance for healthcare providers, it may have been common to prescribe lower than target doses. Our exploratory analysis examined whether provider specialty seen on the index date, a proxy for provider familiarity with sacubitril/valsartan, was related to sacubitril/valsartan dose. Our results suggest that veterans seen in primary care, where there may be lower familiarity with sacubitril/valsartan (versus cardiology), were prescribed lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan at baseline and follow-up.

Second, lower sacubitril/valsartan doses may have been chosen because of perceived benefit at lower doses, as supported by evidence from a post hoc PARADIGM-HF analysis. However, any dose reduction from the target dose in the post hoc analysis, regardless of the reason, would likely result in suboptimal outcomes.

### Effect of valsartan added to background ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure: results from Val-HeFT [^112WQSbc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate the effect of valsartan in the Valsartan-Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) alone in patients with heart failure (HF), subjects in Val-HeFT receiving ACEi but not a beta-blocker at baseline were analyzed. A total of 1,532 participants were assigned to valsartan and 1,502 to placebo. Primary outcome events (all-cause mortality, hospitalization for adjudicated heart failure, sudden death with resuscitation, and need for > 4 hours of parenteral therapy for worsening heart failure) were monitored.

Mortality was not affected by valsartan, but morbidity endpoints were significantly reduced (36.3% in placebo, 31.0% in valsartan, p = 0.002) in patients receiving an ACEi but no beta-blocker. Quality of life (QOL) was significantly improved, ejection fraction (EF) significantly increased, left ventricular (LV) diameter significantly reduced, and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine, and aldosterone levels significantly reduced with valsartan compared to placebo. The morbidity benefit was significant in patients on ACEi doses below the median (22% reduction, p = 0.003) and not statistically significant in those receiving ACEi doses above the median (14% reduction, p = 0.143).

Valsartan reduces heart failure hospitalizations and slows LV remodeling in patients treated with an ACEi in the absence of beta-blockade, particularly in those on lower doses of ACEi.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^1125n87P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets were studied in two placebo-controlled and four active-controlled trials in hypertensive patients.

- **Clinical studies**: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 1012 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension received treatments with three combinations of amlodipine and valsartan (5/80 mg, 5/160 mg, 5/320 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg), valsartan alone (80, 160, or 320 mg), or placebo. All doses, except the 5/320 mg dose, were initiated at the randomized dose. The high dose was titrated to the 5/320 mg following a week at a dose of 5/160 mg. At week 8, the combination treatments demonstrated statistically significant superiority over their monotherapy components in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressures.

In another double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 1246 patients with mild to moderate hypertension received treatments with two combinations of amlodipine and valsartan (10/160 mg, 10/320 mg), or amlodipine alone (10 mg), valsartan alone (160 or 320 mg), or placebo. With the exception of the 10/320 mg dose, treatment was initiated at the randomized dose. The high dose was initiated at a dose of 5/160 mg and titrated to the randomized dose after one week. At week 8, the combination treatments were statistically significantly superior to their monotherapy components in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressures.

### Diovan HCT [^1113xfL6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Dose once daily. Titrate as needed to a maximum dose of 320/25 mg. May be used as add-on or switch therapy for patients not adequately controlled on any of the components (valsartan or HCTZ). May be substituted for titrated components.

- **General considerations**: The usual starting dose is Diovan HCT 160/12.5 mg once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 320/25 tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Maximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2 to 4 weeks following a change in dose.

- **Add-on therapy**: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with valsartan (or another ARB) alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to combination therapy with Diovan HCT. A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to Diovan HCT containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to Diovan HCT should be subsequently evaluated, and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 320/25 mg.

- **Replacement therapy**: Diovan HCT may be substituted for the titrated components.

- **Initial therapy**: Diovan HCT is not recommended as initial therapy in patients with intravascular volume depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^1147HnY8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks. Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

- **Hypertension treatment**: This combination may be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy. Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets containing a lower dose of that component. It may also be substituted for titrated components.

When used as initial therapy, initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily.

- **General considerations**: Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose. Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

- **Add-on therapy**: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another ARB) alone may be switched to combination therapy with Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets. A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^113qJUBw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Elimination of amlodipine from the plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.

- **Valsartan**: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations are reached in 2 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability is about 25% (ranging from 10% to 35%). The steady state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is 17 L, indicating that valsartan does not distribute extensively into tissues. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (95%), mainly serum albumin.

Valsartan shows biexponential decay kinetics following intravenous administration, with an average elimination half-life of about 6 hours. The recovery is mainly as unchanged drug, with only about 20% of the dose recovered as metabolites. The primary metabolite, accounting for about 9% of the dose, is valeryl 4-hydroxy valsartan. In vitro metabolism studies involving recombinant CYP450 enzymes indicated that the CYP2C9 isoenzyme is responsible for the formation of valeryl-4-hydroxy valsartan. Valsartan does not inhibit CYP450 isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations; therefore, CYP450 mediated drug interaction between valsartan and coadministered drugs is unlikely due to the low extent of metabolism.

### Efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril at lower than target doses in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: The PARADIGM-HF trial [^1119NR94]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Participants were categorized according to whether or not they received the target dose of the study drug for the entire duration of the double-blind portion of follow-up. Baseline characteristics were compared between participants who experienced a study medication dose reduction and those who were maintained on target study medication doses throughout the duration of the study, regardless of treatment assignment. Characteristics were also compared among participants with a dose reduction between treatment arms. Between-group assessments were performed using t-tests for continuous variables and χ² or Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate, for categorical variables.

Two time-updated covariates were constructed. The first time-updated covariate indicated any prior dose reduction, updated when a dose change occurred from the maximum dose to any other lower dose level, and was used to distinguish those patients with sustained maximum dosage from patients with any reduction in dose. The second time-updated covariate represented the 'cumulative average' dose received, updated daily after randomization.

Risk factors for the likelihood of receiving a subtarget dosage at any point during follow-up were determined with a forward stepwise selection process using the following baseline characteristics: age, sex, geographic region, body mass index, NT-proBNP, EF, eGFR, NYHA functional class, history of diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, beta-adrenergic blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and diuretics at screening.

### Antihypertensive effects of double the maximum dose of valsartan in African-American patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and albuminuria [^115Vg4yx]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

The blood pressure (BP)-lowering response to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in hypertensive African-Americans is typically less than in whites. This study aimed to determine whether higher than conventional doses of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade can improve BP reduction in African-American patients.

- **Methods**: Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria were enrolled: 110 African-Americans (BP = 150/87 mmHg, aged 57.5 ± 11 years) and 281 non-African-Americans (BP = 151/89 mmHg, aged 57.7 ± 11 years). All patients received valsartan 160 mg once daily in the morning for 4 weeks, after which patients were randomized to receive one of three valsartan doses: 160, 320, or 640 mg/day (double the maximal recommended dose) for 26 weeks. If at week 6, the target BP (< 130/80 mmHg) was not achieved, additional antihypertensives were permitted.

- **Results**: The predominant BP (ΔSBP/ΔDBP) reduction was observed within 4 weeks and was lesser in African-Americans (7.8 ± 15/4.5 ± 9 mmHg) than in non-African-Americans (8.9 ± 14/6.6 ± 1 mmHg, P < 0.05). A greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion was observed with higher doses (320 or 640 mg); however, the responses were similar between African-Americans and non-African-Americans. The use of add-on antihypertensives was higher in African-American patients (56%) compared to non-African-American patients (36%), with a similar rate across the three valsartan doses. From weeks 4 to 26, reduction in BP was lesser (P < 0.05) for African-American patients than for non-African-American patients at the 160-mg dose, but not with the 320 and 640 mg doses.

### Real-world treatment patterns of sacubitril/valsartan: A longitudinal cohort study in Germany [^112KxiS7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

Patients on the pre-index target ACEI dose presented slightly higher rates of down-titration following up-titration to target dose compared to patients with low pre-index ACEI doses (90% vs. 84%) and similar to that observed in RAAS-naïve patients (89%). Patients who were on the pre-index ACEI target dose had a marginally shorter time to the first sac/val dose titration and time to individual maximum dose compared to those with low ACEI doses (< 50% target dose) [mean (SD): 51.9 (43.8) days vs. 55.3 (44.2) days and 60.7 (46.6) days vs. 64.4 (47.1) days, respectively]. Times to first sac/val up-titration and to the individual maximum dose observed in pre-index ACEI target dose patients are very similar to those observed in RAAS-naïve patients [mean (SD): 53.6 (40.5) days and 60.8 (42.8) days, respectively].

- **Persistence and compliance analyses**: Among the 22,275 patients with 12 months of pre-index activity, sac/val persistence at 12 months was estimated to be 71% (Figure 2). In the majority of cases where discontinuation of sac/val therapy was observed, this happened within the first 90 days after index. Persistence at 12 months was similar across the different specialties prescribing sac/val at index, while time to discontinuation was shorter for patients prescribed sac/val 50 mg b.i.d. at index (77 days) than those prescribed 100 mg b.i.d. and 200 mg b.i.d. at index (110 days and 111 days).

### Effect of sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril on changes in heart failure therapies over time: The PARADIGM-HF trial [^114ya8iq]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Sacubitril/valsartan improves morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Whether the initiation of sacubitril/valsartan limits the use and dosing of other elements of guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF is unknown. We examined the effects of sacubitril/valsartan, compared with enalapril, on β-blocker and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use and dosing in a large randomized clinical trial.

- **Methods and results**: Patients with full data on medication use were included. We examined β-blocker and MRA use in patients randomized to sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril through 12-month follow-up. New initiations and discontinuations of β-blocker and MRA were compared between treatment groups. Overall, 8398 (99.9%) had full medication and dose data at baseline. Baseline use of β-blocker and MRA at any dose was 87% and 56%, respectively. Mean doses of β-blocker and MRA were similar between treatment groups at baseline and at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. New initiations through 12-month follow-up were infrequent and similar in the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups for β-blockers [37 (9.0%) vs. 42 (10.2%), P = 0.56] and MRA [127 (7.6%) vs. 143 (9.2%), P = 0.10]. Among patients on MRA therapy at baseline, there were fewer MRA discontinuations in patients on sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril at 12 months [125 (6.2%) vs. 187 (9.0%), P = 0.001]. Discontinuations of β-blockers were not significantly different between groups in follow-up (2.2% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.26).

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116qmWmq]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The mean hourly ambulatory blood pressure (BP) profile for the three treatment groups at baseline and Week 12 for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were analyzed. The office BP values in the treatment groups at Weeks 12 and 26 were also not different among the three treatment groups. Changes in daytime and nighttime BP, daytime/nighttime BP ratio, early morning BP, morning BP surge, and BP variability were similar across the three treatment groups.

The proportion of patients who were uncontrolled on monotherapy and required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) at Week 12 (poor responders) was similar across the treatment groups: valsartan a.m. 44.2%, valsartan p.m. 46.3%, and lisinopril 42.2%. The reduction in mean ambulatory SBP (maSBP) at Week 12 in poor responders was similar between treatments. The addition of HCTZ resulted in similar additional reductions in BP across the three treatment groups at the end of the study (Week 26). The addition of HCTZ in poor responders resulted in similar BP lowering at the end of the study compared with those patients who were responders to monotherapy. Poor responders had similar baseline characteristics (age, body weight, duration of hypertension) as responders, but had higher baseline office and ambulatory BP and a higher percentage of patients were categorized as nondippers.

In patients classified as nondippers at baseline (55.2% in valsartan a.m., 49.4% in valsartan p.m., and 50.5% in lisinopril), the reduction in nighttime maSBP was similar across the treatments at Week 12 and at the end of the study. There was a reduction in the percentage of nondippers due to similar effects across the treatment regimens.

### Prexxartan [^111uQJKH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Valsartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. An oral dose of 80 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 80% at peak, with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. No information on the effect of larger doses is available. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and a consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after the administration of valsartan; very little effect on serum potassium was observed.

In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients with stable renal insufficiency and patients with renovascular hypertension, valsartan had no clinically significant effects on glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, creatinine clearance, or renal plasma flow. In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: For an equivalent dose, Prexxartan has an 86% higher peak concentration (Cmax) and a 25% higher area under the plasma concentration over time curve (AUC) for valsartan compared to Diovan. AUC and Cmax of valsartan increase approximately linearly with increasing dose over the clinical dosing range. Valsartan does not accumulate appreciably in plasma following repeated administration.

- **Absorption**: Prexxartan Cmax is achieved 0.7 to 3.7 hours after dosing.

- **Effect of food**: A high-fat, high-calorie meal decreased the AUC of Prexxartan.

### Efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril at lower than target doses in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the PARADIGM-HF trial [^114Pdgvx]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

In the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM‐HF) trial, sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization compared with enalapril in patients with chronic heart failure. Sacubitril/valsartan, a complex containing the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the ARB valsartan, augments endogenous compensatory vasoactive peptides by inhibiting their breakdown, and additionally, blocks the renin–angiotensin system.

The active run‐in phase ensured all patients were titrated to a target dose of enalapril 10 mg twice daily and then sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg twice daily before randomization. The majority of patients remained on target doses after randomization, with final mean achieved doses of 375 mg daily and 18.9 mg daily respectively. Nevertheless, not all patients were maintained on target doses of study medication during long‐term follow‐up. Whether sacubitril/valsartan confers benefit at lower than target doses, similar to those taking lower than target doses of enalapril, is unknown.

We utilized data from PARADIGM‐HF to test the hypothesis that participants who exhibited any dose reduction during the trial would have similar benefits from lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan relative to lower doses of enalapril.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^111aXC7h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- **Amlodipine**: Peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached 6 to 12 hours after administration of amlodipine alone. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64% and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine is not altered by the presence of food. The apparent volume of distribution of amlodipine is 21 L/kg. Approximately 93% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism, with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Elimination of amlodipine from the plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.

	- **Valsartan**: Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2 to 4 hours. Absolute bioavailability is about 25% (range 10% to 35%). Food decreases the exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%. The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is 17 L, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (95%), mainly serum albumin.

### Diovan [^113QPHt4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Valsartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. An oral dose of 80 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 80% at peak, with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. No information on the effect of larger doses is available. The removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a two- to three-fold rise in plasma renin and a consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: In healthy volunteers, the valsartan peak plasma concentration is reached 2 to 4 hours after dosing. Valsartan shows bi-exponential decay kinetics following intravenous administration, with an average elimination half-life of about 6 hours. The absolute bioavailability for Diovan is about 25% (range 10% to 35%). The bioavailability of the suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] is 1.6 times as great as with the tablet. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan increase approximately linearly with increasing dose.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^112ZwXAK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures. Even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension. For example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients. Many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects, such as on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease. These considerations may guide the selection of therapy. Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension.

Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on either monotherapy. They may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.

The choice of Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks. This includes whether the patient is likely to tolerate the lowest dose of Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116em1Sr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The efficacy results demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the blood pressure (BP) control rate at the end of the study (Week 26) between patients receiving valsartan 320 mg as a morning dose (40.7%) or an evening dose (39.7%). Furthermore, there was no significant difference when compared with lisinopril 40 mg (43.3%, P = 0.4989 for lisinopril versus valsartan a.m.). Similarly, the percentage of patients achieving BP control at Week 12 was comparable irrespective of the time of dosing of valsartan (36.7% a.m. versus 35.0% p.m. P = 0.6752) or when compared with lisinopril treatment (39.5%, P = 0.4641 versus valsartan a.m.).

The change in mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure (maSBP) from baseline to Week 12 showed no difference between the valsartan a.m. and p.m. groups [−10.6 versus −9.8, P = 0.4219, 95% confidence interval (CI): −2.30 to 0.96, with no adjustment for multiplicity] and between the valsartan a.m. and lisinopril groups (−10.6 versus −10.7, P = 0.8966, 97.5% CI, adjusted for multiplicity: −1.76 to 1.98). The confidence interval limits were well within the noninferiority margins of ± 4 mmHg. The mean hourly systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values were also comparable among the three treatment groups at Week 12, with the circadian BP profile being similar for the morning and evening dosing of valsartan. Additionally, the change from baseline in maSBP and mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (maDBP) at the end of the study (Week 26) was also similar between the valsartan a.m. and p.m. dosing groups.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116JgBwq]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

BP exhibits considerable variation during the day and follows a circadian rhythm, with SBP and DBP falling during sleep and rising rapidly with the start of morning activity. If a once-daily antihypertensive agent is given in the morning, it is important that it maintains BP control throughout the daytime and nighttime periods, particularly towards the end of the dosing interval, to cover the critical early morning hours. To better ensure coverage during the nighttime and early morning periods, dosing of antihypertensive agents, particularly ARBs, at bedtime has been recommended, with a number of studies providing support. Despite the clinical evidence, the pharmacologic rationale for this recommendation with an antihypertensive that has previously demonstrated effective 24-hour BP lowering is not clear. We conducted a randomized, multicentre clinical trial in over 1000 patients with hypertension to test this hypothesis. We demonstrated that it did not matter whether valsartan was given in the morning or nighttime period, as it resulted in similar BP control and BP lowering in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension with additional cardiovascular risks, even when compared with the long-acting ACE-inhibitor lisinopril.

Over the 24-hour period, valsartan demonstrated effective BP reductions, comparable to that produced by lisinopril 40 mg, regardless of whether valsartan was dosed in the morning or at night. This was also true for nighttime BP lowering and for limiting the early morning BP rise. Other ABPM measures, including day/night BP ratio and morning BP surge, were consistent across dosing times.

### Potential implications of expanded US Food and Drug Administration labeling for sacubitril/valsartan in the US [^112tVUJC]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded labeling for sacubitril/valsartan for use in individuals with chronic heart failure (HF) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) lower than normal. The population-level implications of the implementation of sacubitril/valsartan at higher LVEF ranges are unknown. While the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global Outcomes in HF With Preserved Ejection Fraction (PARAGON-HF) trial did not meet its primary endpoint, the trial may provide useful information in projecting expected clinical events among treated individuals.

The objective was to quantify newly eligible treatment candidates for sacubitril/valsartan under the expanded FDA labeling and to apply treatment effects and the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one worsening HF event derived from subgroups of the PARAGON-HF trial who fall under the revised FDA label.

Newly eligible treatment candidates were estimated by mapping the LVEF distribution from 559,520 adult patients hospitalized between 2014 and 2019 in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry to adults self-identifying with HF in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2015 to 2018). The NNT with three years of treatment for three endpoints of interest — total HF hospitalizations, total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, and total HF hospitalizations and urgent HF visits and cardiovascular death — were estimated from the PARAGON-HF trial. Data were analyzed from February to June 2021.
