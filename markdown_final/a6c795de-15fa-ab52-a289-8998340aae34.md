## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a person would need a transplant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which organ system is involved and the clinical context. Then, I should verify disease-specific indications and absolute or relative contraindications. Next, I will review severity scoring systems and thresholds that trigger referral or listing. After that, I need to check the multidisciplinary evaluation process and timing considerations. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like COVID-19, living donation, and pediatric or elderly patients, and then synthesize a practical decision framework with examples.

> Let me first confirm the organ and context, because "need a transplant" is organ-specific and depends on whether we are dealing with liver, kidney, lung, heart, or another organ, and whether the presentation is acute, chronic, or acute-on-chronic decompensation. I should also distinguish referral from listing, since early referral can change outcomes even if listing occurs later, and I need to ensure I am not conflating different organs' criteria or timelines [^40f94fac] [^a61a3fd0] [^a06726f2].

> For liver disease, I need to check the core indications: decompensated cirrhosis with ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, or jaundice; acute liver failure; selected hepatocellular carcinoma within or downstaged to Milan/UNOS criteria; and acute-on-chronic liver failure with multi-organ failure. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds that prompt action, because MELD alone can under-recognize sick patients with low MELD but high mortality, and UK guidance uses UKELD ≥ 49 as an equipoise point for listing, while EASL advises daily reassessment in ACLF with > 3 organ failures or CLIF-C ACLF > 64, and AASLD supports referral at first decompensation even with lower MELD, so I should not wait for a high MELD if the patient is clinically decompensated [^a61a3fd0] [^d84f4ee8] [^5335185f] [^4b68d264].

> Wait, let me verify contraindications before concluding "needs a transplant", because active untreated malignancy, uncontrolled sepsis, severe cardiopulmonary disease with high perioperative risk, and ongoing substance use can be absolute or strong relative contraindications depending on the program and reversibility. I should also confirm that age alone is not a contraindication, as physiologic age and comorbidity burden drive candidacy more than chronologic age, and EASL explicitly advises against disqualifying based on age alone, which matters when counseling older adults [^f1e2ddb2] [^93fe6014] [^b5bac865].

> For kidney disease, I should confirm that transplantation is the preferred modality for suitable patients with ESKD or advanced CKD approaching ESKD, and that pre-emptive transplant is favored when feasible. Hold on, I should verify candidacy modifiers: active malignancy, severe cardiopulmonary disease, and unmodifiable high immunologic risk can delay or preclude transplant, and combined liver–kidney evaluation is warranted when cirrhosis is present or when kidney failure is likely irreversible, so I need to ensure these are screened early in the process [^c088b524] [^2cd69738] [^33397b6b].

> For lung disease, I need to check disease-specific triggers: in COPD, very severe disease with BODE 7–10 plus hypercapnic exacerbitations, pulmonary hypertension, or FEV1 < 20% with low DLCO supports transplant consideration; in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a DLCO < 40% predicted or a 6-minute walk distance < 250 meters are red flags; and in cystic fibrosis, frequent exacerbations, rising oxygen needs, or declining lung function despite maximal therapy should prompt referral. I should double-check that these align with ISHLT and GOLD consensus statements before recommending listing [^82d5aa07] [^59c991bb] [^d01f6066].

> Next, I should review the evaluation process and timing, because delays can convert a transplant candidate into someone too sick to benefit. Let me think about the multidisciplinary domains: disease severity and prognosis, surgical and anatomic feasibility, cardiac and pulmonary risk, malignancy screening, infection risk and vaccination, psychosocial readiness and support, and financial coverage. I need to ensure that for ACLF or ALF, the team is engaged within 24–48 hours when possible, and that for low-MELD decompensated cirrhosis, referral is not deferred simply because MELD is low, as this is a known pitfall [^a6631fbb] [^0cbdf688] [^4b68d264].

> I will now examine special scenarios that can shift the calculus. In COVID-19, I should confirm that transplant programs may pause or modify activity based on resource constraints and recipient risk, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection carries higher mortality in transplant recipients, so vaccination and timing of transplant relative to infection matter. But wait, what if the patient is already infected? Many programs require recovery and negative testing before proceeding, so I need to check local policy and current epidemiology before concluding candidacy [^c3db5118] [^0f4f33df] [^d75c08e5].

> For alcohol-related liver disease, I should confirm evolving practices around early transplant without a fixed 6-month abstinence rule in carefully selected severe alcoholic hepatitis nonresponders, balancing psychosocial assessment and relapse risk. Let me reconsider the traditional abstinence requirement; contemporary data and guidelines increasingly support early transplant in defined scenarios, but I need to ensure robust addiction support and informed consent are in place [^cf22d1fd] [^bd670190].

> For pediatrics, I need to check that growth failure, portal hypertension complications, and metabolic liver disease are common indications, and that early referral is emphasized to prevent irreversible complications. I should confirm that immunization catch-up and developmental assessments are integral to the evaluation, and that living donor options are considered when timely deceased-donor transplant is unlikely [^963fe70b] [^0ef19c12].

> For older adults, I should double-check that chronological age is not a barrier, and that frailty, sarcopenia, and cardiopulmonary reserve drive decisions. EASL recommends comprehensive geriatric and functional assessments rather than age cutoffs, and AASLD similarly supports physiologic-age–based candidacy, so I need to avoid reflexively excluding patients over 70 who are otherwise fit [^aeda46d4] [^93fe6014].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will sanity-check each step against guidelines. First, identify the failing organ and the clinical syndrome. Second, match indications and contraindications for that organ. Third, quantify severity using validated scores and clinical decompensation features. Fourth, assess reversibility of the precipitant and the urgency of referral. Fifth, initiate multidisciplinary evaluation without undue delay. Sixth, consider living donation or exception points where applicable. And seventh, revisit candidacy continuously as the patient's condition evolves, because timing and trajectory can change the net benefit of transplant [^40f94fac] [^a61a3fd0] [^a06726f2].

> Example 1: A 55-year-old with alcohol-related cirrhosis develops tense ascites, encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding with MELD-Na 18. I should confirm that this is decompensated cirrhosis and refer immediately for transplant evaluation, even though MELD is not extremely high, because decompensation itself signals high short-term mortality and a survival benefit with transplant. I need to ensure addiction services are engaged and assess for early transplant candidacy if severe alcoholic hepatitis is present and refractory to medical therapy [^a61a3fd0] [^cf22d1fd].

> Example 2: A 62-year-old with CKD stage 5 on dialysis, no active malignancy, and reasonable cardiopulmonary status. I should confirm that kidney transplantation is indicated and discuss pre-emptive options if a living donor is available, while screening for infections, malignancy, and immunologic compatibility. If the patient has cirrhosis or suspected portal hypertension, I need to arrange combined liver–kidney evaluation to avoid missing the need for dual organ transplant [^c088b524] [^2cd69738].

> Example 3: A 45-year-old with IPF and DLCO 35% predicted, declining exercise tolerance. I should confirm that this meets ISHLT criteria for referral and that the patient has been optimized on oxygen and antifibrotic therapy, and I need to act promptly because IPF can progress unpredictably, risking the patient from becoming too frail for transplant [^a06726f2].

> In summary, I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing "need a transplant" without anchoring to organ-specific indications, severity thresholds, and contraindications, and I must emphasize early referral and continuous reassessment. If you tell me the organ system and the clinical scenario, I can verify the exact indications, scoring thresholds, and next steps tailored to that patient, because transplant need is a dynamic, context-dependent determination rather than a binary label [^40f94fac] [^a61a3fd0] [^a06726f2].

It depends on the organ and disease severity. Transplant is generally considered when **life expectancy without transplant is under 1–2 years** or when **quality of life is severely impaired** by organ failure despite optimal medical therapy [^40f94fac] [^d84f4ee8]. For liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis, acute liver failure, or HCC within Milan criteria are key indications [^a61a3fd0] [^0945ed23]; for kidneys, ESRD with poor dialysis tolerance or complications is typical [^c088b524]; for lungs, advanced COPD, IPF, or pulmonary hypertension with low lung function or high mortality risk are indications [^82d5aa07] [^59c991bb]. Each case requires a multidisciplinary evaluation to confirm candidacy, exclude contraindications, and weigh risks and benefits [^a6631fbb].

---

## General indications for transplantation

Transplantation is considered when:

- **Life expectancy**: Anticipated life expectancy without transplant is under 1–2 years [^notfound].
- **Quality of life**: Severe impairment from organ failure despite optimal medical therapy [^notfound].
- **Failure of alternatives**: Other treatments have failed or are unsuitable [^a61a3fd0].

- **Dialysis complications**: Poor tolerance, recurrent infections, or cardiovascular complications [^notfound].
- **Preemptive transplantation**: Before dialysis when a suitable donor is available [^c088b524].

---

### Lung transplantation

Indications include:

- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 < 20% predicted), hypercapnia, or pulmonary hypertension [^59c991bb].
- **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**: Progressive disease with low lung function and high mortality risk [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Refractory to medical therapy with poor prognosis [^notfound].

---

## Contraindications to transplantation

Absolute contraindications include:

- **Active malignancy**: Most cancers exclude patients from transplant [^f1e2ddb2].
- **Severe cardiovascular disease**: Untreatable or high-risk cardiac conditions [^notfound].
- **Uncontrolled infection**: Active sepsis or unmanageable infection [^0cbdf688].
- **Severe psychiatric illness**: Untreated or unstable, impairing adherence [^notfound].

Relative contraindications include:

- **Advanced age**: Physiological, not chronological, age is considered [^93fe6014].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, obesity, or other conditions increasing surgical risk [^notfound].
- **Substance abuse**: Active or recent without rehabilitation [^d84f4ee8].

---

## Evaluation process

The evaluation process is **multidisciplinary** and includes:

- **Medical assessment**: Disease severity, comorbidities, and organ function [^a6631fbb].
- **Psychosocial evaluation**: Support system, adherence, and mental health [^a6631fbb].
- **Laboratory and imaging tests**: Extensive testing to confirm candidacy [^a6631fbb].
- **Patient education**: Informed consent and understanding of risks and benefits [^notfound].

---

## Timing of transplantation

Timing is critical: **early referral** improves outcomes, whereas delays can lead to patients becoming too sick for transplant [^d84f4ee8]. Urgent cases — such as acute liver failure or ACLF — require rapid evaluation and listing [^0cbdf688] [^5335185f].

---

## Conclusion

Transplant is considered when organ failure is advanced, life expectancy is limited, and quality of life is poor despite optimal care. Indications and contraindications vary by organ and must be assessed through a multidisciplinary evaluation. Early referral and timely listing are essential to optimize outcomes [^40f94fac].

Implications of the spread of COVID-19 for the transplant community are innumerable, and the unprecedented nature of the pandemic has left physicians without guidance in many of their management choices. Balancing resource constraints, patient safety and life-saving organs demand is difficult during COVID-19 pandemic. With the present report we aim to reflect on the open challenges for the transplant community. A summary of actions to be undertaken is summarized, reflecting on advantages and dangers related to each (Table 1).

### Transplantation in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic: how should transplant patients and programs be handled? [^0f4f33df]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, transplant programs worldwide have been severely impacted with dwindling numbers of transplantations performed and a complete halt in several areas. In this review we examine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection presents differently in transplant recipients, whom and how we should test, how susceptible the transplant population is to overt infection and describe the range of outcomes. From retrieved published reports on SARS-CoV-2infections in 389solid organ transplant recipients reported in the literature, the overall mortality rate was 16.7% (n = 65); however for those with mild or moderate Covid-19 disease this was 2.9% and 2.3% respectively; conversely, for those with severe infection the mortality rate was 52.2%. We then address questions regarding halting transplantation programs during this pandemic, whether all human tissues being considered for transplantation are capable of transmitting the infection, and if we should alter immunosuppressive medications during the pandemic.

### Precision transplant medicine: biomarkers to the rescue [^e981a0a5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The concept that individuals with the same disease and a similar clinical presentation may have very different outcomes and need very different therapies is not novel. With the development of many innovative tools derived from the omics technologies, transplant medicine is slowly entering the era of precision medicine. Biomarkers are the cornerstone of precision medicine, which aims to integrate biomarkers with traditional clinical information and tailor medical care to achieve the best outcome for an individual patient. Here, we discuss the basic concepts of precision medicine and biomarkers, with a specific focus on progress in renal transplantation. We delineate the different types of biomarkers and provide a general assessment of the current applications and shortcomings of previously proposed biomarkers. We also outline the potential of precision medicine in transplantation. Moving toward precision medicine in the field of transplantation will require transplant physicians to embrace the increased complexity and expanded decision algorithms and therapeutic options that are associated with improved disease nosology.

### FDA approves new use of transplant drug based on real-world… [^bca00f04]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new use for Prograf based on a non-interventional study providing real-world evidence of effectiveness. FDA approved Prograf for use in combination with other immunosuppressant drugs to prevent organ rejection in adult and pediatric patients receiving lung transplantation. Prograf, originally approved to prevent organ rejection in patients receiving liver transplants, was later approved to prevent organ rejection for kidney and heart transplants as well. The drug has also been routinely used in clinical practice for patients receiving lung transplants. Today's action marks the first approval of an immunosuppressant drug to prevent rejection in adults and pediatric patients who receive lung transplants. Prograf is the only approved immunosuppressant drug product for this population.

This approval reflects how a well-designed, non-interventional study relying on fit-for-purpose real-world data, when compared with a suitable control, can be considered adequate and well-controlled under FDA regulations. Specifically, the non-interventional study supporting approval for this new indication used RWD from the U. S. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, supported by the Department of Health and Human Services. The data were collected on all lung transplants in the U. S. and were supplemented by information from the Social Security Administration's Death Master File as a trusted repository of mortality data. A dramatic improvement in outcomes was observed among lung transplant patients receiving Prograf as part of their immunosuppression medications compared to the well-documented natural history of a transplanted drug with no or minimal immunosuppressive therapy.

In addition to the RWE from the non-interventional study, randomized controlled trials of Prograf used in other solid organ transplant settings provided confirmatory evidence of effectiveness. Additional clinical trial evidence from research publications supports the independent contribution of Prograf as part of a multidrug immunosuppressive regimen. Prograf should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant and patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. Prograf is associated with increased risk of developing lymphoma and other malignancies and is associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal, including opportunistic infections. FDA granted the approval to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.

### COVID-19: a global transplant perspective on successfully navigating a pandemic [^f6952fff]. American Journal of Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly evolved and changed our way of life in an unprecedented manner. The emergence of COVID-19 has impacted transplantation worldwide. The impact has not been just restricted to issues pertaining to donors or recipients, but also health-care resource utilization as the intensity of cases in certain jurisdictions exceeds available capacity. Here we provide a personal viewpoint representing different jurisdictions from around the world in order to outline the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on organ transplantation. Based on our collective experience, we discuss mitigation strategies such as donor screening, resource planning, and a staged approach to transplant volume considerations as local resource issues demand. We also discuss issues related to transplant-related research during the pandemic, the role of transplant infectious diseases, and the influence of transplant societies for education and disseminating current information.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^40f94fac]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

KDIGO kidney transplant candidate evaluation — introduction emphasizes that transplantation is the kidney replacement therapy of choice for suitable patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), that estimation of risk is therefore a key part of the transplant candidate evaluation, and that the guideline examines current evidence concerning the risks of transplantation associated with specific conditions while providing recommendations as to how clinicians may wish to deal with specific risk factors in isolation.

### Trials&tribulations of liver transplantation-are trials now prohibitive without surrogate endpoints? [^cb24eb93]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

During the past 5 decades, liver transplantation has moved from its pioneering days where success was measured in days to a point where it is viewed as a routine part of medical care. Despite this progress, there are still significant unmet needs and outstanding questions that need addressing in clinical trials to improve outcomes for patients. The traditional endpoint for trials in liver transplantation has been 1-year patient survival, but with rates now approaching 95%, this endpoint now poses a number of significant financial and logistical barriers to conducting trials because of the large numbers of participants required to demonstrate only an incremental improvement. Here, we suggest the following solutions to this challenge: adoption of validated surrogate endpoints; bigger and better collaborative multiarm, multiphase studies; recognition by funders and institutions that work on larger collaborative research projects is potentially more important than smaller, self-led bodies of work; ringfenced areas of research within trial frameworks where individuals can take a lead; and fair funding structures using both industry and public sector money across national and international borders.

### International guidelines for the selection of lung transplant candidates: 2006 update – a consensus report from the pulmonary scientific council of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^ab57b6f1]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

Disease-specific lung transplantation considerations — there are no prospective, randomized, well-powered studies in lung transplantation to support the recommendations, and therefore the guidelines are for the most part a combination of recommendations based on small and/or retrospective and/or registry studies and expert opinion consensus; in the bulleted list of criteria at the end of each section, unless otherwise specified, any one of the bullets suffices to recommend referral or transplantation, but the need increases with the number of criteria met by the patient.

### Clinical best practice advice for hepatology and liver transplant providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: AASLD expert panel consensus statement [^a8ff1338]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is rapidly spreading throughout the world. Hospitals and healthcare providers are preparing for the anticipated surge in critically ill patients, but few are wholly equipped to manage this new disease. The goals of this document are to provide data on what is currently known about COVID-19, and how it may impact hepatologists and liver transplant providers and their patients. Our aim is to provide a template for the development of clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver patients and healthcare providers.

Approach and Results

This article discusses what is known about COVID-19 with a focus on its impact on hepatologists, liver transplant providers, patients with liver disease, and liver transplant recipients. We provide clinicians with guidance for how to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their patients' care.

Conclusions

The situation is evolving rapidly, and these recommendations will need to evolve as well. As we learn more about how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the care of patients with liver disease, we will update the online document available at https://www.aasld.org/about-aasld/covid-19-and-liver.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^c088b524]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Rationale — kidney transplantation candidacy in chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes that kidney transplantation improves survival and quality of life and is less costly compared to dialysis. Patients with advanced CKD who are expected to reach end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have the right to be informed of all available treatment options, including transplantation, and demand for transplantable kidneys exceeds supply such that candidacy for deceased donor transplantation needs careful evaluation. Initiation of the transplant evaluation process depends on the patient's subjective well-being, underlying kidney disease and rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss; number and severity of comorbid conditions; and the anticipated need for specialized testing, and depending on the patient and region, evaluation may take weeks to several months to complete. Pre-emptive transplantation is the preferred treatment option but requires sufficient time to ensure a complete evaluation and in many regions is restricted to those with a suitable living donor; the timing of pre-emptive living donor transplantation needs individual decision making depending on patient's symptoms and estimated GFR (eGFR). Candidacy assessment is to some extent subjective and those declined should have the right to seek a second opinion.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^0945ed23]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Hepatocellular carcinoma — liver transplantation eligibility and bridging: Transplantation should be considered for patients who meet the UNOS criteria (AFP level ≤ 1000 ng/mL and radiologic evidence of either a single lesion ≥ 2 cm and ≤ 5 cm in diameter, or 2–3 lesions ≥ 1 cm and ≤ 3 cm in diameter and no evidence of macrovascular involvement or extrahepatic disease) or can be downstaged to within Milan Criteria. Transplant also provides a curative intent option for patients with C-P class B and C cirrhosis who would not otherwise be surgical candidates. The guidelines recommend bridge therapy for patients eligible for liver transplant. Patients with tumor characteristics that are marginally outside of the UNOS guidelines should be considered for transplantation. Additionally, transplantation can be considered for patients who have undergone successful downstaging therapy (ie, tumor currently meeting Milan criteria). If transplant is not feasible, the panel recommends hepatic resection for this group of patients.

### Report of the ISHLT working group on primary lung graft dysfunction part II: definition. A consensus statement of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^3a23da21]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Medium credibility.

Definition needs across study designs — Different defining criteria may be needed for different study designs; small amounts of outcome misclassification can dramatically increase required sample size for associations, making accurate definitions necessary for mechanistic studies, whereas randomized trials may prefer earlier or broader lung injury definitions to enroll subjects at higher risk who could benefit from therapy; working group views varied on excluding "secondary" causes, and some favored broader inclusive criteria because so little is known about the timing and natural history of PGD at this stage.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^a61a3fd0]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Indications for liver transplant — "LT is indicated for severe acute or advanced chronic liver disease when the limits of medical therapy have been reached (see Table 2)." However, "Recognition of cirrhosis per se does not imply a need for LT," and "Many patients with cirrhosis in the absence of an index complication such as ascites or variceal hemorrhage will not develop hepatic decompensation, although patients with cirrhosis have diminished survival compared to the population as a whole."

### Management of patients with liver diseases on the waiting list for transplantation: a major impact to the success of liver transplantation [^7160bac7]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Considering the dramatic improvement of the results of liver transplantation over the past years, we need to be more reactive regarding the indication of liver transplantation in the most severe patients, i.e. those in the ICU. When a patient is referred in a critical condition, the very first question to address is: is this patient a potential candidate for liver transplantation? For alcoholic cirrhotic patients, or for patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis refractory to medical treatment, this will require an urgent workup, advice from a specialist in alcohol addiction, and a consensus decision from the team. When the decision for liver transplantation is taken, patient prognosis should be assessed using ICU scores rather than the MELD score. An urgent workup to assess comorbidities is also required. The difficult issue is the definition of the optimal window for transplantation in such severe cases. The risk is to perform transplantation in patients without an adequate workup at the worse moment. Therefore, coordination with the ICU specialists in order to determine the appropriate timing for liver transplantation is essential. The optimal transplantation window between several complications is difficult to determine, but essential for its success. This transplantation window may be open during the ICU stay or soon after recovery prior to the advent of the next deteriorating event.

### Time to discard the term "discard" [^9f5e0f57]. American Journal of Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2022 Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients Consensus Conference "People Driven Transplant Metrics" offered an opportunity for a diverse group of stakeholders in the solid organ transplant community to exchange ideas about what information and metrics are important to different stakeholders. Participating patients and family members called on the transplant community to cease using the term "discards" to refer to donated organs that are not transplanted.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^0adbbb42]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

AASLD/AST long-term management of adult liver transplant — recommendation grading and evidence quality are defined using the GRADE framework with minor modifications: the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidelines Committee "has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup with minor modifications," and "the strength of a recommendation is classified as (1) strong or (2) weak," while "the quality of evidence supporting a strong or weak recommendation is designated by 1 of 3 levels: (A) high, (B) moderate, or (C) low)." For Strong, "Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, presumed patient-important outcomes, and the cost." For Weak, "There is variability in the preferences and values or more uncertainty. The recommendation is made with less certainty, or the cost or resource consumption is higher." Evidence levels are defined as A High — "Further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect," B Moderate — "Further research may change confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect," and C Low — "Further research is very likely to affect confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect."

### Prioritization for liver transplantation [^44cecfac]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

There are three possible policies for prioritization for liver transplantation: medical urgency, utility and transplant benefit. The first is based on the severity of cirrhosis, using Child-Turcotte-Pugh score and, more recently, the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, or variants of MELD, for allocation. Although prospectively developed and validated, the MELD score has several limitations, including interlaboratory variations for measurement of serum creatinine and international normalized ratio of prothrombin time, and a systematic adverse female gender bias. Adjustments to the original MELD equation and new scoring systems have been proposed to overcome these limitations; incorporation of serum sodium improves its predictive accuracy. The MELD score poorly predicts outcomes after liver transplantation due to the absence of donor factors incorporated into the scoring system. Several utility models are based on donor and recipient characteristics. Combined poor recipient and donor characteristics lead to very poor outcomes, which in a utility system would be considered unacceptable. Finally, transplant benefit models rank patients according to the net survival benefit that they would derive from transplantation. However, complex statistical models are required, and unmeasured characteristics may unduly affect the models. Well-designed prospective studies and simulation models are necessary to establish the optimal allocation system in liver transplantation.

### Novel benchmark values for redo liver transplantation: does the outcome justify the effort? [^d2d6df77]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The availability of liver transplantation (LT) has revolutionized the treatment of many patients with advanced liver diseases and liver cancer.–This success has generated a dramatic shortage of available organs with the consequence to consider marginal (also called extended criteria) grafts. The use of these livers, however, carries an increased risk for graft failure, with the potential need also for secondary transplants. Such redo liver transplants (redo-LT) after initial failure are generally perceived to be associated with outrageous cost, and several transplant physicians may consider redo procedures as futile or unethical, in view of scarce resources. Importantly, however, redo-LT may vary highly in terms of indications, for example, for recurrence of the underlying disease versus acute graft failure.

It therefore seems crucial to have objective benchmark values for these challenging procedures, serving as references to compare with primary LT, or higher-risk population requiring a redo-LT.

Accordingly, in this study, we aim to establish clinically relevant thresholds gathered in high-volume centers on 3 continents. For this purpose, an ideal cohort serving as benchmark redo-LT cohort was defined using a well-established methodology previously used to assess primary LT, and other major procedures.–The benchmark values were subsequently used to assess outcome of redo-LT in recipients with severe liver disease stages, and in patients requiring an emergency high-risk redo-LT, such as those with primary nonfunction (PNF).

Make a decision for transplantation if the risk of death on the waiting list outweighs the risk of cancer transmission and the recipient provides informed consent.

### Liver transplantation for acute-on-chronic liver failure: science or fiction? [^a04e8b7e]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute clinical deterioration of a patient with chronic liver disease remains a decisive time point both in terms of medical management and prognosis. This condition, also known as acute decompensation (AD), is an important event determining a crossroad in the trajectory of patients. A significant number of patients with AD may develop hepatic or extrahepatic organ failure, or both, which defines the syndrome acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), and ACLF is associated with a high morbidity and short-term mortality. ACLF may occur at any phase during chronic liver disease and is pathogenetically defined by systemic inflammation and immune metabolic dysfunction. When organ failures develop in the presence of cirrhosis, especially extrahepatic organ failures, liver transplantation (LT) may be the only curative treatment. This review outlines the evidence supporting LT in ACLF patients, highlighting the role of timing, bridging to LT, and possible indicators of futility. Importantly, prospective studies on ACLF and transplantation are urgently needed.

### Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: a survey of practices [^37d9b558]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goal

To survey physician practices regarding liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Background

Many issues surrounding liver transplantation for HCC are controversial and physician practices have not been well characterized.

Methods

Transplant physicians and surgeons were electronically surveyed regarding surveillance, diagnosis, selection criteria for deceased and living donor transplantation, and use of adjunctive therapy for HCC.

Results

Eighty-nine of 174 (51%) physicians completed the survey (39 hepatologists, 41 transplant surgeons, and 9 others). Most respondents were from large US transplant centers. All reported screening for HCC during transplant evaluation, and 98% surveyed patients awaiting transplant. Sixty percent of respondents would biopsy lesions under selective conditions, whereas 32% never biopsy lesions, and 8% biopsy all lesions. Eighty two percent of respondents claimed to adhere to the Milan criteria (single lesion ≤ 5 cm or no more than 3 lesions each ≤ 3 cm without vascular invasion) for patient selection, however, 36% would transplant patients with tumors that invade a small portal branch. Forty one percent of respondents would consider living donor transplantation for patients with tumors exceeding the Milan criteria. Ninety-six percent of respondents treat HCC before transplantation, and 87% would transplant patients down-staged to meet the Milan criteria.

Conclusions

There is consistency related to HCC surveillance and treatment in liver transplant candidates. Variations of responses regarding biopsy of lesions, patient selection for deceased donor and living donor transplantation highlight a need for evidence-based guidelines.

### Potentially inappropriate liver transplantation in the era of the "sickest first" policy – A search for the upper limits [^25b90fd1]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Liver transplantation has emerged as a highly efficient treatment for a variety of acute and chronic liver diseases. However, organ shortage is becoming an increasing problem globally, limiting the applicability of liver transplantation. In addition, potential recipients are becoming sicker, thereby increasing the risk of losing the graft during transplantation or in the initial postoperative period after liver transplantation (three months). This trend is challenging the model for end-stage liver disease allocation system, where the sickest candidates are prioritised and no delisting criteria are given. The weighting of the deontological demand for "equity", trying to save every patient, regardless of the overall utility; and "efficiency", rooted in utilitarianism, trying to save as many patients as possible and increase the overall quality of life of patients facing the same problem, has to be reconsidered. In this article we are aiming to overcome the widespread concept of futility in liver transplantation, providing a definition of potentially inappropriate liver transplantation and giving guidance on situations where it is best not to proceed with liver transplantation, to decrease the mortality rate in the first three months after transplantation. We propose "absolute" and "relative" conditions, where early post-transplant mortality is highly probable, which are not usually captured in risk scores predicting post-transplant survival. Withholding liver transplantation for listed patients in cases where liver transplant is not deemed clearly futile, but is potentially inappropriate, is a far-reaching decision. Until now, this decision had to be discussed extensively on an individual basis, applying explicit communication and conflict resolution processes, since the model for end-stage liver disease score and most international allocation systems do not include explicit delisting criteria to support a fair delisting process. More work is needed to better identify cases where transplantation is potentially inappropriate and to integrate and discuss these delisting criteria in allocation systems, following a societal debate on what we owe to all liver transplant candidates.

### Does COVID-19 infection significantly affect liver transplantation? Results of liver transplantation in the COVID-19 era at a single, high-volume centre [^346d808a]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus first emerged in Wuhan, China, and ever since the disease became a pandemic, many individuals have been affected by the disease. The highly virulent and contagious disease has affected all age groups and cases with different risk factors. It has been stated that a concurrent underlying disease such as hypertension, diabetes and age could significantly increase mortality and morbidity rates.one of the most prominent risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection is immunosuppression. Regardless of the aetiology for which cases are immune-compromised, the outcomes of infections can worsen. Liver transplantation is particularly affected by the infection as not only does immunosuppression predisposes cases to more severe consequences, but also the infection itself might worsen liver failure status.

Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is one of the major complications after liver transplantation, significantly increasing post-transplantation mortality rates.ever since the first studies of COVID-19 were carried out, it was realised that the infection increases coagulopathic incidences such as stroke. Even though several cases of post-transplantation HAT have been reported, the correlation between the two incidences have not been studied.

During the COVID-19 era, many elective surgeries were postponed as hospital beds were needed for severely affected cases. Meanwhile, emergent surgery was still required to treat cases in an emergent state properly. Given that the current literature has not assessed and evaluated the outcomes of liver transplantation, this study was designed to assess the early postoperative mortality rate and HAT incidence rates before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in both elective and emergent settings.

### Patient reflections, challenges, and supports related to early liver transplant for severe alcohol-associated liver disease [^bd670190]. Liver Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) accounts for nearly half of liver-related deaths in the US. Severe ALD may manifest as acute hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis, or both. Liver transplant surgery is a rescue treatment in these high-acuity clinical scenarios. However, the conventional requirement of a 6-month pretransplant alcohol abstinence period limits some patients' timely access to the treatment. Early/expedited liver transplant (ELT) is the practice of proceeding with a transplant — after a meticulous evaluation process — without first meeting the conventional requirement. If necessary, ELT recipients can undergo a majority (or even the entirety) of the alcohol use treatment after their transplants.

Since its introduction a decade ago, ELT for severe ALD has garnered growing interest from liver transplant communities. Concurrently, the practice has also stimulated ethics debates on issues of justice and utility involving organ allocation for ALD. Much of the existing ELT literature has centered around posttransplant outcomes, candidate selection, and policy-centric discussions. But attention has been minimal toward the ELT recipient experience: the recognition of the liver disease, transplant process, and posttransplant survivorship. Recent publications have highlighted the importance of appreciating patients' nuanced experiences living with decompensated liver disease and after a liver transplant. – However, patients who received ELT for severe ALD are unique among liver transplant recipients in their juxtaposition of acute disease manifestation, long-standing and stigmatizing root cause, and patient-reported low readiness to change harmful behaviors at transplant. Studies purposefully assessing ELT recipients' viewpoints are therefore crucial.

Our qualitative study aimed to characterize patient reflections and perceived challenges and supports related to ALD, organ transplant, and posttransplant life among ELT recipients. Where a gap exists in the literature, qualitative research can help identify potential issues or explore emerging ideas through in-depth inquiry. In addition, findings from qualitative studies can generate hypotheses for eventual testing or describe themes to create or reinforce a conceptual framework. Ultimately, assessing ELT recipient perspectives can help illuminate features of ELT experiences relevant to future research on support interventions or ethical decision-making related to the conventional 6-month abstinence requirement.

Combined liver–kidney transplantation — Selection and allocation considerations include that candidates may have a "need for sustained dialysis) for 6 consecutive weeks, or in rare cases when a candidate has rare metabolic disease such as primary hyperoxaluria," yet "meeting the GFR criteria alone should not automatically lead to a decision to perform combined liver and kidney transplantation without evaluating the potential for reversibility among patients with a high likelihood of having hepatorenal syndrome." Although "native kidney biopsy has been investigated… data on this are limited," it "should be considered in select patients at low risk of kidney biopsy–related complications" to decide between combined versus liver-alone transplant. For implementation, OPTN/UNOS "implemented a new 'safety net' kidney allocation policy," under which "Patients who are listed for kidney transplant within 60–365 days of a liver transplant are given additional priority for local kidney allocation if they meet specific medical requirements," and "There is some evidence that survival with kidney-after-liver transplantation is similar to combined liver and kidney transplant and that kidney outcomes are better for the former."

Liver transplantation is an efficient procedure as performed in Italy, yet major differences are present in terms of practice. In an effort to facilitate an homogeneous practice of liver transplantation in Italy, the Italian Association for the Study of Liver Disease has instituted a Commission aimed at providing recommendations on non-urgent liver transplantation in adults, based on current evidence. This nation-wide commission which included experienced hepatologists, surgeons and pathologists with major interest in liver transplantation has drafted a final document in October 2004, approved by the Italian Association for the Study of Liver Governing Board, whose key arguments and main conclusions are summarised in the present paper. The Commission has made specific recommendations on the following topics: the current needs of liver transplantation in Italy; the indications to liver transplantation and re-liver transplantation, with special reference to controversial issues and the minimal listing criteria; the use of marginal donors and the need to optimise donor/recipient matching; the use of living donor liver transplantation; the management of the waiting list and the introduction of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease to define priorities; the clinical management of liver transplantation recipients and disease recurrence; the implementation of audits and outcome monitoring; the training of transplant surgeons and hepatologists and the requirements for Centre accreditation; the pathology of liver transplantation.

### Indications for liver transplantation [^8e4546d8]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients should be considered for liver transplantation if they have evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, a life-threatening systemic complication of liver disease, or a liver-based metabolic defect or, more commonly, cirrhosis with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatorenal syndrome, or bleeding caused by portal hypertension. While the complications of cirrhosis can often be managed relatively effectively, they indicate a change in the natural history of the disease that should lead to consideration of liver transplantation. Referral to a liver transplant center is followed by a detailed medical evaluation to ensure that transplantation is technically feasible, medically appropriate, and in the best interest of both the patient and society. Patients approved for transplantation are placed on a national transplant list, although donor organs are allocated locally and regionally. Since 2002, priority for transplantation has been determined by the Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which provides donor organs to listed patients with the highest estimated short-term mortality.

### Liver transplantation in patients with alcohol-related liver disease: current status and future directions [^cf22d1fd]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

The survival of patients with alcohol-related liver disease who receive a liver transplant has steadily improved to reach 80–85% at 1 year post-transplantation. The standard requirement for liver transplant-abstinence from alcohol for 6 months before transplantation-has been applied widely, but few data support the use of this rule as the sole criterion for selecting candidates for liver transplantation. When determining the suitability of a patient for transplantation, many liver transplant programmes now try to balance the period of abstinence against the risk of death associated with the severity of liver damage. Data accumulated since 2011 suggest that early liver transplantation (ie, transplantation without a specific period of abstinence) in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who do not respond to medical therapy is an effective therapeutic strategy. Further studies are needed to help refine the selection of patients with alcohol-related liver disease who have been abstinent for less than 6 months as suitable liver transplant candidates, and to improve the treatment of alcohol use disorder in those patients who have received a liver transplant.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^c58c96db]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction: malignancy risks after kidney transplantation — kidney transplant recipients are at greater risk of developing cancer compared to the general population; cohort studies show variability of risk with both age and sex, with young kidney transplant recipients having a risk 15–30 times greater than the general population of the same age, while the risk is only two times greater for 65-year-old kidney transplant recipients; after the development of cancer, the survival of transplant recipients is poor and treatment options are limited, and it is thus important to consider options for preventative measures and screening kidney transplant recipients.

### Impact of pretransplant renal failure: when is listing for kidney-liver indicated? [^c300c6c7]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Renal and hepatic function are often intertwined both through the existence of associated primary organ diseases and hemodynamic interrelationships. This connection occasionally results in the chronic failure of both organs, necessitating the need for combined kidney-liver transplantation. Since 1990, over 1,790 patients in the United States have received such transplants with a patient survival somewhat less than that for patients receiving either organ alone. Patients with renal failure due to acute injury or to the hepatorenal syndrome have classically not been included as candidates for combined transplantation due to the reversibility of the renal dysfunction following liver transplantation. However, the rate and duration of renal failure prior to liver transplantation continues to be prolonged even with the new allocation scheme prioritizing liver transplants to those with renal failure. Thus the issue of when kidney transplantation should be offered and what evaluation is necessary prior to the decision continues to confront the transplant community.

Liver transplantation evaluation — multidisciplinary pretransplant assessment (Table 3) spans disease, surgical, laboratory, cardiac, imaging, and general health domains alongside psychosocial and financial reviews. Hepatology evaluation should "assess disease severity and prognosis, confirm diagnosis and optimize management," while surgical evaluation should "confirm need for transplant; identify technical challenges…; discuss donor options (deceased, living, extended)." Laboratory testing should "assess hepatic synthetic function, serum electrolytes, renal function, viral serologies… ABO-Rh blood typing, creatinine clearance, urinalysis and urine drug screen."

### CAQ corner: surgical evaluation for liver transplantation [^7956f8c9]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Liver transplantation is a complex multidisciplinary field requiring the collaboration of many different health care providers. The decision to list and transplant patients with end‐stage liver disease is done with the consensus of the entire transplant team, including the patient, hepatologists, transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, social workers, psychologists, and transplant coordinators. From a surgical perspective, one must determine whether a patient with end‐stage liver disease will tolerate a liver transplant and if it is technically feasible, prior to proceeding to the operating room (OR). When determining transplant candidacy in patients with high Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease scores who are critically ill, there is a delicate balance between optimizing a patient for liver transplantation and proceeding to the OR if an appropriate organ offer is available. Here we review some of the salient aspects of the surgical evaluation for liver transplantation, specifically perioperative and technical considerations.

AASLD AST Practice Guideline — evidence review and guideline development methods state that databases searched included Ovid MEDLINE and Embase.com, with gray literature searched in the Cochrane Library and relevant association websites, and the initial search was completed on May 15, 2023 with limits to English, humans, and from January 1, 2016, to May 15, 2023; MEDLINE and conference abstract records were excluded in the Embase search. Studies were selected if they were peer reviewed full‑text articles involving populations with consideration for liver transplantation (LT) or who have received a LT and included one of the outcomes of interest; exclusions encompassed conference abstracts not published in peer‑reviewed journals, editorials, commentaries, case reports, narrative reviews, consensus documents, letters, full‑text articles not available in English, and studies without outcomes of interest. Study flow reported that a total of 1913 unique studies met search terms, 415 continued to full‑text review, and 144 to data extraction; a refresher literature search was conducted on September 12, 2024 and additional key articles were also included, resulting in a total of 175 studies providing data that informed the recommendations. Guideline statements were developed and graded by the writing group and level of evidence was assessed using the Oxford Grading system.

When to refer for transplant

LT is the definitive treatment for selected patients with DC and should be considered when the severity of liver disease incurs a likelihood of poor survival or impaired quality of life. A UK clinical guideline outlining the process of LT assessment, including who and how to refer, has recently been published. To summarise, the over-riding principles of LT in the UK are that anticipated life expectancy after LT must exceed that without. A UK Model for End-stage liver disease (UKELD) score of 49 is the equipoise at which the predicted 1 year mortality without LT matches that after LT and is therefore the current minimum listing threshold for elective LT in those with irreversible decompensation.

In the absence of variant conditions, we recommend that referral for LT is considered when a patient with chronic liver disease develops the typical features of DC (ie, jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding or HE) and UKELD ≥ 49. Early referral is preferable because a patient can become too unwell for LT, if the referral is made too late. The referring clinician should consider first whether the decompensation is potentially reversible (for example with abstinence, in the case of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), or with antivirals in untreated chronic viral hepatitis). If not, is the patient suitable for LT? Contraindications to LT include coexisting significant extrahepatic comorbidity (with predicted mortality of > 50% at 5 years), presence of extrahepatic sepsis, active malignancy and some previous extrahepatic malignancies. Some contra-indications can be temporary or relative, so if a patient is not currently suitable for LT, consider whether they may be suitable following treatment or an intervention (eg, nasogastric feeding in a patient with severe sarcopenia). If there is any doubt, advice should be sought from the LT unit.

ARLD is the leading indication for LT in the UK. Detailed recommendations for LT referral in ARLD in the UK are beyond the scope of this practice guidance. These have recently been revised. To summarise, it is recommended that patients with decompensated ARLD should be referred to consider their suitability for LT if they still have evidence of decompensation after optimal management and 3 months validated abstinence from alcohol and are otherwise suitable candidates for LT, in line with The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. Contraindications to LT in ARLD include active ongoing alcohol use, drinking alcohol while on the waitlist and during the period of transplant evaluation, and a history of repeated non-adherence to advice to abstain from alcohol.

### Decompensated cirrhosis but low MELD-should we wait or refer for liver transplantation? [^4b68c264]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis constitutes a significant global health burden with decompensation characterized by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, as well as variceal hemorrhage. These decompensation features are independent predictors of mortality. Liver transplantation remains the definitive treatment for patients with cirrhosis. However, given that this is a limited resource, thus its allocation, using the MELD score, has to be judicious despite decompensation features affecting the patient's quality of life. Patients with grade 3 ascites or overt hepatic encephalopathy have significant mortality; therefore, in some instances, these decompensation features should be considered indications for liver transplantation despite low MELD. The majority of patients listed for liver transplantation have low MELD scores (≤ 15 points); and approximately half will die due to liver-related complications. Current evidence demonstrates a mortality reduction of ~40% with LT in those patients with a low MELD. Furthermore, new scores have been developed, such as the MELD 3.0, which incorporates female sex, albumin, and all the MELD-Na components (bilirubin, creatinine, international normalized ratio, and sodium), and the Gender-Equity Model for Liver Allocation, that includes bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and the Royal Free Hospital glomerular filtration rate, which have demonstrated improved discrimination. Lastly, to address the limited resource, living donor liver transplant has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients even at MELD-Na scores as low as 11, suggesting that life-years gained are similar to deceased-donor transplant. In this review, our goal is to present the frequency of patients listed for transplant with low MELD, and the limitation of using MELD in patients for liver transplantation. We will provide practical guidance on the management of common complications of cirrhosis and early consideration for liver transplant referral in patients with clinical decompensation and low MELD.

Adult liver transplant (LT) recipients — liver test monitoring: The frequency of monitoring with liver tests should be individualized by the transplant center according to the time from LT, the complications from LT, the stability of serial test results, and the underlying cause (grade 1, level A). Liver tests are routinely monitored after LT, and when abnormal liver tests are recognized in a healthy, asymptomatic LT recipient, it is reasonable to repeat the tests in 1 to 2 weeks; a decision to investigate further should be based on the persistence and severity of the liver test abnormalities.

Acute on chronic liver failure

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF) is a syndrome characterised by acute decompensation of CLD associated with organ failures and high short-term mortality. Sepsis, active alcoholism and relapse of chronic viral hepatitis are the most common reported precipitating factors, but still only account for perhaps half the cases, the remainder have no identifiable trigger. The poor prognosis mimics that seen in ALF and mandates an expedited triage and consideration for LT. However, while LT remains the definitive treatment, sadly very few prove suitable.

When to consider referral/discussion with the LTU in CLF or AoCLF

Liver transplantation should be considered, when a patient with established liver disease develops any of the typical features of decompensation (figure 1). As decompensation correlates with rising morbidity and mortality, the supervising clinician should reflect on the key considerations outlined below.

Figure 1
Clinical features of hepatic decompensation.

Key considerations in patients with hepatic decompensation

Is the decompensation potentially reversible (for example with abstinence in the case of ALD or with anti-virals in untreated chronic viral hepatitis)* or
If not reversible, is the patient suitable for LT*? or
Are there any contraindications to LT such as comorbidity which preclude transplant* (see table 5) or
If not currently suitable for transplant, could a patient become suitable with treatment or an intervention*?

* If in any doubt, seek advice from local LTU

Bear in mind that it is possible for a patient to be too unwell for LT if the referral is made too late.

To aid with the assessment of suitability for referral, the UK Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (UKELD) score can be calculated. The UKELD score is devised from patient's INR, serum sodium, creatinine and bilirubin/).UKELD scores ≥ 49 indicate survival advantage for LT over conservative management in patients with irreversible decompensation.

Patients with decompensated CLD, unsuitable for LT, should have this conclusion documented and receive symptom-directed care.

Non-liver failure indications for liver transplantation

Some patients will still benefit from LT, even though their liver is not failing (i.e., likely to cause death within 12 months). This would include patients with cirrhosis and a UKELD score under 49, such as PBC patients with intractable pruritus (see table 2).

### Explore transplant at home: a randomized control trial of an educational intervention to increase transplant knowledge for black and white socioeconomically disadvantaged dialysis patients [^af186b26]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Kidney transplantation has clear survival and quality-of-life benefits for patients; however, patients within low-income and minority populations continue to have limited access to the information they need to make an informed decision about their CKD treatment options. With the majority of dialysis patients dying within 5 years of starting dialysis, the importance of these patients receiving comprehensive education prior to their presentation at a transplant center about their other treatment options–DDKT and LDKT–cannot be understated. Since these patients are often less knowledgeable or ready to pursue transplant, transplant educational content must be simplified and made more culturally sensitive to honor patients where they are in their decision-making process about transplant.

Two recent transplant education interventions using print education, videos, and educators have been implemented with kidney patients prior to presenting to a transplant center in an effort to reduce disparities in pursuit or receipt of transplant. Compared to patients receiving usual transplant education in dialysis centers, a patient navigator intervention where previous kidney transplant recipients led dialysis patients through taking different transplant steps during a 2 year period (e.g. increasing interest in transplant, getting on the transplant wait-list, receiving a transplant) significantly increased the number of steps patients actually took, and was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of wait-listing. A second trial examined the impact of an educational intervention on transplant pursuit for CKD 3–5 patients recruited from community nephrology practices. Compared to standard-of-care education, patients who received additional print and video education with support from a social worker were more likely to have discussions about transplant and take other LDKT steps (e.g. identify potential living donors). Also, the patients who only received educational materials were more likely to begin and complete transplant evaluation than the other two groups.

There is no consensus on the best model of care for individuals with CF to manage the non-pulmonary complications that persist after lung transplant. The CF Foundation virtually convened a group of international experts in CF and lung-transplant care. The committee reviewed literature and shared the post-lung transplant model of care practiced by their programs. The committee then developed a survey that was distributed internationally to both the clinical and individual with CF/family audiences to determine the strengths, weaknesses, and preferences for various models of transplant care. Discussion generated two models to accomplish optimal CF care after transplant. The first model incorporates the CF team into care and proposes delineation of responsibilities for the CF and transplant teams. This model is reliant on outstanding communication between the teams, while leveraging the expertise of the CF team for management of the non-pulmonary manifestations of CF. The transplant team manages all aspects of the transplant, including pulmonary concerns and management of immunosuppression. The second model consolidates care in one center and may be more practical for transplant programs that have expertise managing CF and have access to CF multidisciplinary care team members (e.g., located in the same institution). The best model for each program is influenced by several factors and model selection needs to be decided between the transplant and the CF center and may vary from center to center. In either model, CF lung transplant recipients require a clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities of their providers and mechanisms for effective communication.

### The place of liver transplantation in the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis [^30023ad6]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Although most patients with alcoholic liver disease experience positive outcomes following liver transplantation, data on the outcome after liver transplantation in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis are limited. Furthermore, predicting which patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis will maintain sobriety after transplantation is especially difficult. We review the arguments in favour and against extending liver transplantation to selected patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. In conclusion, we propose that liver transplantation should be a rescue option for occasional patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who meet the following criteria: those with severe alcoholic hepatitis that has failed medical management, who fulfil all other standard criteria for transplantation, including a thorough psychosocial assessment, yet who are unlikely to survive a mandatory 6-month abstinence period.

### Refitting the model for end-stage liver disease for the eurotransplant region [^5abf1eef]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The number of patients in need of a liver transplantation (LT) in the Eurotransplant region exceeds the available donor grafts. Therefore, patients with end‐stage liver disease are placed on a waiting list (WL), which prioritizes the patients with the most severe liver disease, i.e. most in need of transplantation. The Model for End‐stage Liver Disease (MELD) estimates disease severity in LT candidates based on three parameters: serum creatinine, bilirubin, and the international normalized ratio (INR) for prothrombin time. Since 2016, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) regions also added serum sodium through the MELD‐Na score, but the Eurotransplant region remains MELD‐based. The MELD was weighed, i.e. the relative importance of each parameter, based on a cohort from 1991 to 1995. For clinical use, the lower boundaries for the parameters were set to 1, to prevent negative MELD scores after natural logarithm transformation. Creatinine levels were capped at 4 mg/dL for patients not receiving dialysis. According to some of the proposers of MELD, these boundaries were "based entirely on the clinical intuition of the policymaking body when the MELD score was implemented." Others also noted that "﻿arbitrary changes not based on mortality risk evidence were incorporated into the form of MELD" and that these lower and upper limits were "﻿set without any particular objective rationale."

On another continent and almost 20 years later, the original UNOS‐MELD equation is still being used for the allocation of liver grafts in the Eurotransplant region and elsewhere. Due to changing population characteristics, the predictive power of the UNOS‐MELD has declined significantly in recent years. However, an update of the MELD coefficients in UNOS data showed that performance could still be further improved. As the Eurotransplant population differs from the original MELD cohort, improvement of the Eurotransplant liver allocation is very possible by refitting MELD to the Eurotransplant population. Refitting is the reweighing of predictors and establishment of lower and upper bounds of each parameter, based on the best fit to the current data. It was hypothesized that the UNOS‐MELD is not optimally fit for Eurotransplant patients as it was fit on the UNOS population. This could diminish MELD's predictive power and discrimination ability between survival and death. It is the optimization of this discrimination that gives the most effective sickest‐first allocation.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^aca11e6b]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — principles of resection and transplant state that all patients should be evaluated for possible transplant candidacy with multidisciplinary review. Hepatic resection is indicated as a potentially curative option in the following circumstances: adequate liver function (generally CTP Class A without portal hypertension), solitary mass without major vascular invasion, and adequate future liver remnant (at least 20% without cirrhosis and at least 30%–40% with CTP Class A cirrhosis, adequate vascular and biliary inflow/outflow). Hepatic resection is controversial in the following circumstances, but can be considered: limited and resectable multifocal disease and major vascular invasion. For patients with chronic liver disease being considered for major resection, preoperative portal vein embolization should be considered. Select patients with initially unresectable disease that responds to therapy can be considered for surgery, and consultation with a medical oncologist, interventional radiologist, and a multidisciplinary team is recommended to determine the timing of surgery after systemic therapy. Patients meeting the UNOS criteria (AFP level ≤ 1000 ng/mL and single lesion ≥ 2 cm and ≤ 5 cm, or 2 or 3 lesions ≥ 1 cm and ≤ 3 cm) should be considered for transplantation (cadaveric or living donation). The MELD score is used by UNOS to assess the severity of liver disease and prioritize the allocation of the liver transplants. There are patients whose tumor characteristics are marginally outside of the UNOS guidelines who should be considered for transplant. Furthermore, there are patients who can be downstaged to within criteria that can also be considered for transplantation. Patients with CTP Class A liver function, who fit UNOS criteria and are resectable, could be considered for resection or transplant, and these patients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team. Based on retrospective analyses, patients who are older may benefit from liver resection or transplantation for HCC, but they need to be carefully selected, as overall survival is lower than for patients who are younger. Minimally invasive approaches by experienced surgeons have been proven to be safe and effective. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Post-transplantation diabetes-state of the art [^a374ab58]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

With increasing success in overcoming the immunological and infectious challenges accompanying solid organ transplantation, susceptibility to post-transplant diabetes and cardiovascular disease has assumed increasing importance. Although some guidance is available from diabetes-related literature pertaining to the general population, some aspects are unique to solid organ allograft recipients. Both insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction are generally agreed to contribute to development and manifestation of post-transplant diabetes, but controversy continues about which is most important and to what extent post-transplant diabetes is a distinct entity or simply a variant of type 2 diabetes with transplant-specific components. The optimum method and timing for detection and diagnosis of post-transplant diabetes remains an area of uncertainty. However, the greatest needs are to: address the absence of contemporary data for incidence and clinical outcomes associated with post-transplant diabetes; establish the role of glycaemic control; and assess the role of new diabetic therapies in prevention and management of post-transplant diabetes. We place the present knowledge base in the context of other advances in transplantation, challenge some existing ideas, and examine the potential role of emerging diabetes therapies. In highlighting existing deficiencies, we hope to provide direction for future research that will ultimately reduce incidence and improve management of post-transplant diabetes.

### Stem cell transplantation for patients with hematologic malignancies… [^bc370dc0]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Stem Cell Transplantation for Patients With Hematologic MalignanciesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. Childhood leukemias which cannot be cured by chemotherapy alone may be effectively treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Moreover, for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only proven curative modality of treatment. Patients who have received hematopoietic stem cells from an HLA matched sibling donor have proven to be less at risk for disease relapse and regimen related toxicity. The nature of the hematopoietic stem cell graft has been implicated as a primary factor determining these outcomes. The standard stem cell graft has been unmanipulated bone marrow, but recently several advantages of T-lymphocyte depleted bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells have been demonstrated.

However, T-cell depletion may increase the risk of infectious complications and leukemic recurrence while an unmanipulated stem cell graft may increase the risk of graft vs. host disease. A key element in long range strategies in improving outcomes for patients undergoing matched unrelated donor HSCT is to provide the optimal graft.
- To estimate the overall survival in patients with high risk hematological malignancies who receive a HSCT with an unmanipulated marrow graft or a peripheral blood stem cell graft
- To estimate disease-free survival and relapse rates
- To estimate the rates of chronic GvHD and graft failure
- To estimate the incidence of non-hematologic peri-transplant regimen-related toxicity and regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days after transplantation.
- All patients lacking an HLA identical sibling for whom an unrelated donor matched at 6/6 HLA loci is formally requested within about 3 months of search initiation
- Age greater than or equal to 24 months, but less than 21 years for new patients.

### Xenotransplantation… [^309e1bea]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Xenotransplantation is any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation or infusion into a human recipient of either live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source, or human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues or organs. The development of xenotransplantation is, in part, driven by the fact that the demand for human organs for clinical transplantation far exceeds the supply. Currently ten patients die each day in the United States while on the waiting list to receive lifesaving vital organ transplants. Moreover, recent evidence has suggested that transplantation of cells and tissues may be therapeutic for certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and diabetes, where, again human materials are not usually available.

Although the potential benefits are considerable, the use of xenotransplantation raises concerns regarding the potential infection of recipients with both recognized and unrecognized infectious agents and the possible subsequent transmission to their close contacts and into the general human population. Of public health concern is the potential for cross-species infection by retroviruses, which may be latent and lead to disease years after infection. Moreover, new infectious agents may not be readily identifiable with current techniques. Related Information

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^2dc49683]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Resection or transplantation candidacy — Child-Pugh classes and evaluation approach: Resection or liver transplantation can be considered for patients with C-P Class A liver function or for highly selected patients with C-P Class B liver function who meet UNOS criteria/extended criteria and are resectable. Controversy exists over which initial strategy is preferable to treat such patients, and the guidelines recommend that these patients be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team when deciding an optimal treatment.
