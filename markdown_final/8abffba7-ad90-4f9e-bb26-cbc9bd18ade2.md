## Question

what's the first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation and how to frame it across different clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about universal foundational therapy that applies to essentially all patients with AF. Then, I should distinguish rate control versus rhythm control strategies and when each is preferred. Next, I will examine who qualifies for catheter ablation as a first-line rhythm-control option. After that, I need to review the evidence base supporting ablation-first strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered algorithm and ensure I address anticoagulation, shared decision-making, and special populations like heart failure and athletes.

> Let me first confirm the universal foundation: stroke prevention and risk factor modification are mandatory for essentially all patients with AF, regardless of symptoms or rhythm strategy, so I need to ensure anticoagulation decisions are addressed up front using CHA2DS2-VASc and periodic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risk, with DOACs preferred over warfarin when not contraindicated and warfarin reserved for mechanical valves or mitral stenosis, plus aggressive management of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea, and alcohol use [^113zvGVi] [^1126frCA] [^111dwEui].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rhythm therapy before establishing the initial strategy fork: for most hemodynamically stable patients, rate control with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is the appropriate first-line approach, with digoxin reserved for heart failure or when first-line agents are ineffective or contraindicated, and I should double-check that this aligns with contemporary guidelines emphasizing rate control as initial therapy for many patients, especially older or minimally symptomatic individuals [^113VKrgp] [^113zhaW4] [^116cQg1a].

> Wait, let me verify the rhythm-control branch: rhythm control is indicated when symptoms persist despite adequate rate control, when AF is driving hemodynamic compromise or heart failure exacerbation, in younger patients desiring definitive rhythm therapy, or when patient preference favors early restoration of sinus rhythm. Importantly, recent randomized data support early rhythm control to improve outcomes in selected patients, so I should incorporate that into shared decision-making rather than reflexively deferring rhythm restoration [^115mjskJ] [^114yg1fo] [^114EKNsz].

> I will now examine first-line rhythm-control options, and I need to ensure I separate the old paradigm from the new: traditionally, antiarrhythmic drugs were first-line for rhythm maintenance, with flecainide or propafenone for structurally normal hearts, sotalol or dofetilide in coronary disease, and amiodarone in heart failure or left ventricular hypertrophy, but wait, I should verify whether ablation has moved earlier in the sequence for selected patients [^113VFvP4] [^114rAuLL].

> Let me consider the modern shift: catheter ablation is now a Class I first-line therapy for selected patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, typically younger with few comorbidities, and a Class 2a first-line option for other symptomatic patients pursuing rhythm control. I should confirm that both ACC/AHA and ESC endorse this evolution and that shared decision-making is emphasized given procedural risks and patient preferences [^115Qfavv] [^112gUYx7] [^114u3ypp].

> Next, I should review the evidence base supporting ablation-first, and I need to check consistency across trials: randomized studies and meta-analyses show that first-line ablation reduces recurrence, symptomatic burden, and hospitalizations compared with antiarrhythmic drugs, with comparable or lower serious adverse events in many analyses. EARLY-AF and STOP AF First demonstrated markedly lower recurrence and AF burden with cryoballoon ablation versus drugs, and CABANA showed fewer recurrences and improved quality of life, reinforcing ablation as a reasonable early strategy in appropriately selected patients [^111LGbhU] [^112rBZUa] [^111XDqCy].

> But wait, what if the patient is older, has significant structural heart disease, or prefers to avoid procedures? I should confirm that antiarrhythmic drugs remain appropriate first-line in those contexts: flecainide or propafenone for structurally normal hearts, sotalol or dofetilide in coronary disease without heart failure, and amiodarone in heart failure or LVH are still guideline-concordant choices, and I need to ensure careful selection based on comorbidities, QT risk, and renal function [^113VFvP4] [^114rAuLL].

> I should double-check special populations where ablation-first is particularly compelling: tachy-brady syndrome with symptomatic pauses, high-level athletes prioritizing performance, and patients with recent-onset persistent AF of less than one year may benefit from early ablation to restore rhythm and potentially halt progression. These scenarios often tilt the balance toward a procedural-first approach after discussing risks, benefits, and expectations [^1176mHPt] [^111XDqCy].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying: for all patients, start with stroke risk assessment and anticoagulation as indicated, plus risk factor modification. For stable patients, initiate rate control and reassess symptoms and quality of life. If symptoms persist or patient preference favors rhythm restoration, offer rhythm control with either AADs or catheter ablation, recognizing that ablation is a Class I first-line option in selected symptomatic paroxysmal AF and a Class 2a first-line option in broader symptomatic cohorts. Throughout, use shared decision-making to align therapy with goals, comorbidities, and values [^113EdKv5] [^115Qfavv] [^112gUYx7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that ablation is broadly first-line for everyone, but I should correct that to be precise: ablation is not universally first-line. It is first-line for selected patients within a rhythm-control strategy, whereas rate control remains the appropriate initial approach for many, particularly older or minimally symptomatic patients, so the answer is strategy-dependent and must be individualized [^113VKrgp] [^113zhaW4] [^113EdKv5].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing care elements are explicit: reassess stroke and bleeding risk periodically, monitor for drug interactions and adverse effects if using AADs, and track symptoms and quality of life to guide escalation. Real-world data suggest that when ablation is chosen first-line, hospitalizations and arrhythmia-related events are lower, supporting the clinical value of an early ablation strategy in the right patients [^1112Nufz] [^113Ttw9y].

First-line treatment for atrial fibrillation is **rate control with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** (diltiazem, verapamil) for stable patients without significant LV dysfunction, and **catheter ablation as first-line rhythm control** for selected symptomatic patients, particularly younger patients with minimal structural heart disease [^113VKrgp] [^114u3ypp]. Anticoagulation is indicated based on **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** to prevent stroke, with DOACs preferred over warfarin when not contraindicated [^113zvGVi] [^1126frCA]. Rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs or cardioversion is reserved for persistent symptoms despite rate control or when rhythm control is preferred [^114EKNsz].

---

## Rate control as first-line therapy

Rate control is the **preferred initial strategy** for most patients with AF, particularly older adults or those with minimal symptoms, because it effectively reduces symptoms and improves quality of life without the risks associated with rhythm-control drugs [^116XDtfT].

---

### Pharmacological agents for rate control

- **Beta-blockers**: First-line agents for rate control in patients with AF without significant LV dysfunction (LVEF > 40%) [^116gaw1M].
- **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**: Diltiazem or verapamil are first-line alternatives, particularly in patients with contraindications to beta-blockers [^113zhaW4].
- **Digoxin**: Considered second-line or adjunctive therapy, particularly in patients with heart failure or those who are sedentary [^112ekckL].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting rate control

AFFIRM and RACE trials showed that rate control is **non-inferior to rhythm control** in terms of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes, with fewer hospitalizations and adverse events [^1113qUcj]. Rate control is especially beneficial in older adults and those with minimal symptoms or significant comorbidities [^1113qUcj].

---

## Rhythm control as first-line therapy

Rhythm control is **appropriate for selected patients**, particularly younger individuals with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, minimal structural heart disease, or those who prefer rhythm restoration [^115Qfavv].

---

### Pharmacological agents for rhythm control

- **Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs)**: Flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, dofetilide, and amiodarone are commonly used agents for rhythm control, selected based on patient-specific factors such as structural heart disease, coronary artery disease, and renal function [^114EKNsz].
- **Catheter ablation**: Emerging as a first-line rhythm control strategy, particularly in younger patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF and minimal structural heart disease [^115Qfavv].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting rhythm control

Recent trials (e.g. EARLY-AF, STOP AF First) demonstrate that **catheter ablation as first-line therapy** significantly reduces AF recurrence and burden compared to antiarrhythmic drugs, with comparable safety profiles [^112rBZUa] [^111LGbhU]. Rhythm control is particularly beneficial in symptomatic patients, younger individuals, and those with recent-onset AF [^111XDqCy].

---

## Anticoagulation therapy

Regardless of rate or rhythm strategy, **anticoagulation is essential** to prevent stroke and systemic thromboembolism. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin for most patients, except those with mechanical heart valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^1126frCA].

---

## Individualized treatment approach

Treatment selection should be **individualized**, considering age, symptom severity, comorbidities, structural heart disease, and patient preferences. Shared decision-making is crucial to align treatment with patient goals and improve adherence [^113EbK7M].

---

## Summary of first-line treatment recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **First-line treatment** |
|-|-|
| Stable, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AF | Rate control (beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers) |
| Symptomatic paroxysmal AF, younger patients, minimal structural heart disease | Rhythm control (catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs) |
| All patients with elevated stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men, ≥ 3 in women) | Anticoagulation (DOACs preferred) |

---

First-line treatment for atrial fibrillation is **rate control with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers** for stable patients, while rhythm control with catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs is appropriate for selected symptomatic patients. Anticoagulation is essential for stroke prevention, and treatment should be individualized based on patient-specific factors.

Background

Guidelines recommend a trial of one or more antiarrhythmic drugs before catheter ablation is considered in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, first-line ablation may be more effective in maintaining sinus rhythm.

Methods

We randomly assigned 303 patients with symptomatic, paroxysmal, untreated atrial fibrillation to undergo catheter ablation with a cryothermy balloon or to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy for initial rhythm control. All the patients received an implantable cardiac monitoring device to detect atrial tachyarrhythmia. The follow-up period was 12 months. The primary end point was the first documented recurrence of any atrial tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia) between 91 and 365 days after catheter ablation or the initiation of an antiarrhythmic drug. The secondary end points included freedom from symptomatic arrhythmia, the atrial fibrillation burden, and quality of life.

Results

At 1 year, a recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia had occurred in 66 of 154 patients (42.9%) assigned to undergo ablation and in 101 of 149 patients (67.8%) assigned to receive antiarrhythmic drugs (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35 to 0.66; P < 0.001). Symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia had recurred in 11.0% of the patients who underwent ablation and in 26.2% of those who received antiarrhythmic drugs (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.68). The median percentage of time in atrial fibrillation was 0% (interquartile range, 0 to 0.08) with ablation and 0.13% (interquartile range, 0 to 1.60) with antiarrhythmic drugs. Serious adverse events occurred in 5 patients (3.2%) who underwent ablation and in 6 patients (4.0%) who received antiarrhythmic drugs.

Conclusions

Among patients receiving initial treatment for symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, there was a significantly lower rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence with catheter cryoballoon ablation than with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, as assessed by continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring.

### Ablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs as first-line therapy for treatment-naive atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tvCtq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence on the relative safety and efficacy of atrial fibrillation catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as the first-line therapy for patients with treatment-naive atrial fibrillation (AF) remains disputed. Digital databases were queried to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. The incidence of recurrent AF, major adverse cardiovascular events, and its components (all-cause death, nonfatal stroke, and bleeding) were compared using the DerSimonian and Laird method under the random-effects model to calculate pooled unadjusted risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 6 randomized controlled trials consisting of 1,120 patients (574 ablation and 549 AADs) were included in the final analysis. Over a median follow-up of 1 year, the risk of any AF recurrence (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.75) was significantly lower in patients receiving ablation than in patients receiving AADs. However, there was similar risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.61 to 11.46), trial-defined composite end point of adverse events (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.80), stroke (RR 2.42, 95% CI 0.22 to 26.51), all-cause mortality (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.28 to 13.90), and procedure/medication failure (RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.61 to 11.46) with both therapies. In conclusion, in patients presenting with treatment-naive AF, ablation as a first-line therapy lowers the risk of AF recurrence with no associated increase in major adverse events, stroke, and mortality compared with AADs.

Coronary artery disease with atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic selection emphasizes beta blockers first, sotalol preference, and cautious use of other agents. In stable coronary artery disease (CAD), beta blockers may be considered first but supporting evidence is limited to 2 studies, and efficacy for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of persistent AF is not convincing. When additional therapy is needed, sotalol has substantial beta-blocking activity and may be the preferred initial antiarrhythmic agent in ischemic heart disease due to less long-term toxicity than amiodarone. Amiodarone increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker implantation in elderly AF patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) but may be preferred over sotalol in patients with heart failure (HF). Neither flecainide nor propafenone is recommended; quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide may be considered as third-line choices. Regarding dofetilide, post-MI data from DIAMOND-MI support a second-line role, whereas in CAD without MI or HF it remains uncertain whether benefits outweigh risk and more experience is needed before it can be recommended even as second line.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — epidemiology and scope of guideline: AF is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance, increasing in prevalence with age, and it is often associated with structural heart disease, although a substantial proportion of patients with AF have no detectable heart disease; hemodynamic impairment and thromboembolic events related to AF result in significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. These guidelines present a comprehensive review of AF definition, classification, epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical characteristics; review management including prevention of AF, control of heart rate, prevention of thromboembolism, and conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm; describe treatment algorithms including pharmacological and nonpharmacological antiarrhythmic approaches and antithrombotic strategies; and are a consensus document that attempts to reconcile evidence and opinion from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

AF catheter ablation — indications and first-line use in atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL): In patients with symptomatic AF in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred, and continued rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful to improve symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF in whom rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF (Class 1, Level A). In patients with symptomatic or clinically significant AFL, catheter ablation is useful for improving symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In patients who are undergoing ablation for AF, ablation of additional clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias can be useful to reduce the likelihood of future atrial arrhythmias (Class 2a, Level B-NR). In patients (other than younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF who are being managed with a rhythm-control strategy, catheter ablation as first-line therapy can be useful to improve symptoms (Class 2a, Level B-R).

Catheter ablation of AF as first-line rhythm control therapy — There have been several studies evaluating first-line ablation before antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy in symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). In MANTRA-PAF, ablation versus AAD did not reduce cumulative AF burden over 2 years, but ablation was associated with a lower rate of AF recurrence and a similar rate of complications. In RAAFT-2, AF or atrial tachycardia recurred in 55% of the ablation group compared with 72% with AAD after a 2-year follow-up (P = 0.016). A meta-analysis found first-line ablation more effective than AAD for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm with comparable adverse event rates in relatively young patients with PAF and minimal structural heart disease, and an additional analysis suggested a better cost-effectiveness profile. These results provide some support for first-line ablation for PAF, although whether such benefits extend to elderly patients, those with associated structural heart disease, or non-PAF remains controversial.

Concomitant arrhythmia ablation during AF procedures — utility and limits: During ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), ablation of previously documented or inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial flutter (AFL) is described as useful to reduce recurrent arrhythmias, but when AF alone or inducible SVT is targeted in patients with both AF and AFL the likelihood of recurrent arrhythmias is high. Prophylactic cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation without documented or inducible AFL likely has minimal benefit. A comparative study reported cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as first-line treatment for AFL is equally effective as standard CTI ablation for preventing recurrent atrial arrhythmia and better at preventing new-onset AF.

### Evolving antithrombotic treatment patterns for patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation [^112jjpHy]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Since the introduction of NOACs, newly diagnosed at-risk patients with AF are more often receiving guideline-recommended therapy, driven by increased use of NOACs and less treatment with AP and VKA therapies.

Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation — comparisons with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as first-line or early therapy: In selected patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), ablation is described as a suitable first-line option, and longer-term follow-up showed reduced recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias versus drugs (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38–0.67]) with fewer persistent AF episodes (1.9% vs 7.4%; HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.13–0.70]). In CABANA, ablation was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in recurrent AF (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45–0.60]; P < 0.001). Randomized trials comparing ablation to AADs as first-line therapy found at 24 months a lower AF burden with ablation (ablation, 9% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 18%; P = 0.004), and at 1 year fewer recurrent atrial arrhythmias in EARLY-AF (43% vs 68%; P < 0.001) and STOP AF First (25% vs 55%; P < 0.001). Across these trials, procedural complications were observed in 2% to 5% of patients, AF burden remained low in EARLY-AF (percentage of time in AF: ablation, 0.6% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 3.9%), and the average age was ≤ 60 years; ablation is also noted as effective in persistent AF, particularly if of relatively recent onset (< 1 year).

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^116rYHaf]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation centers of excellence — rhythm control and catheter ablation selection — The major indication for rhythm control is to improve QoL in patients who are symptomatic with AF, and the most important criterion for patient selection is the presence of symptoms or cardiovascular dysfunction related to AF. Systematic and serial assessment of QoL and symptoms is important when assessing responses and when to consider switching to a new rhythm control intervention, and systematic collection of patient reported outcomes (PRO) data can facilitate management. Most guidelines suggest that ablation should be second line to antiarrhythmic treatment (class I or III drugs), though ablation also should be considered in patients with cardiomyopathy, tachy-brady syndrome, patients < 60 years old, or those with professions that require no AF; first-line therapy might also be considered for patients who prefer to avoid medical therapy. The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial recently reported a reduction in hospitalization and improved QoL for patients randomized to ablation in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Future directions in catheter-based ablation for atrial fibrillation — catheter-directed ablation represents a substantial achievement promising better therapy for patients resistant to pharmacological or electrical conversion, yet limited studies do not provide convincing evidence of optimum catheter positioning or absolute treatment success; double-blind studies are almost impossible to perform, and there is a need for randomized trials with outcomes evaluation blinded to treatment modality, including comprehensive assessments of quality of life and recurrence rates versus pharmacological strategies.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, general indications, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating long-term oral anticoagulation in suitable patients with trigger-induced AF at elevated thromboembolic risk to prevent ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism.

Knowledge gaps and clinical bias among providers, particularly for other (noncardiology specialty) HCPs, might also account for some of the discordance between actual practice and AAD guidelines; these may be driven by the overall paradigm of rhythm management, which has largely shifted in the past 10 years. For example, there is currently increased emphasis being placed on anticoagulation, 23 particularly direct oral anticoagulants. 8 In addition, the relative incidence of complications related to real‐world AAD prescribing, versus other components of management of AF such as anticoagulation, make it difficult to power a difference in outcomes in the observational research to instill recommended use. 8, 24

Finally, although it is a class IIa recommendation as a first‐line choice (and class I after > 1 AAD in select patients), there is also growing interest around catheter ablation as a first‐line approach. 25 In patients following an "ablation first" treatment paradigm, post–ablation first AAD selection may favor better efficacy in maintaining sinus rhythm over a long‐term safety profile if only short‐term dosing is expected.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb low-risk and treatment intensification: In patients with AF younger than 60 y without heart disease or risk factors for thromboembolism (lone AF), the risk of thromboembolism is low without treatment and the effectiveness of aspirin for primary prevention of stroke relative to the risk of bleeding has not been established (Level of Evidence: C). In patients with AF who sustain ischemic stroke or systemic embolism during treatment with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0), rather than add an antiplatelet agent, it may be reasonable to raise the intensity of anticoagulation to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 (Level of Evidence: C).

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with ACS, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and oral anticoagulation for > 1 week after an ACS in patients with AF when ischemic risk outweighs the bleeding risk. Decide the total duration (≤ 1 month) according to assessment of these risks and ensure clear documentation of the discharge treatment plan.

### Antiarrhythmic drug therapy for atrial fibrillation: are the guidelines guiding clinical practice? [^113PL2Wa]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The AFFIRM study showed no clear survival advantage for a rhythm versus rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is appropriate in a large number of patients with AF. The American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology AF management guidelines include a safety-based algorithm for selection of AAD therapy. Class 1C agents are recommended as first-line therapy in patients without or with minimal structural heart disease. However, market research and clinical study data indicate a growing use of class III agents (mainly amiodarone) despite long-term safety and tolerability concerns, suggesting that clinical practice does not adhere to current guidelines.

### Rhythm control in atrial fibrillation [^114EKNsz]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Many patients with atrial fibrillation have substantial symptoms despite ventricular rate control and require restoration of sinus rhythm to improve their quality of life. Acute restoration (ie, cardioversion) and maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation are referred to as rhythm control. The decision to pursue rhythm control is based on symptoms, the type of atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent), patient comorbidities, general health status, and anticoagulation status. Many patients have recurrent atrial fibrillation and require further intervention to maintain long term sinus rhythm. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is generally recommended as a first-line therapy and drug selection is on the basis of the presence or absence of structural heart disease or heart failure, electrocardiographical variables, renal function, and other comorbidities. In patients who continue to have recurrent atrial fibrillation despite medical therapy, catheter ablation has been shown to substantially reduce recurrent atrial fibrillation, decrease symptoms, and improve quality of life, although recurrence is common despite continued advancement in ablation techniques.

### Anesthesiologists guide to the 2019 AHA / ACC / HRS focused update for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^113WGsCK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative physicians should be well versed in atrial fibrillation (AF) management because it is the most common sustained arrythmia in the United States. In this narrative review of the 2019 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologists/Heart Rhythm Society Focused Update on Atrial Fibrillation, the authors detail the emergence of new evidence from completed studies that may affect the management of patients with AF presenting for surgery. Updates regarding non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) comprise the bulk of the update with newer evidence emerging regarding their equivalence and/or superiority compared to Coumadin. Apixaban is now the preferred drug of choice for first line stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF over Coumadin. Renal dysfunction and the management of patients with AF on hemodialysis is examined; in patients on hemodialysis with AF, the focused update recommends administration of either warfarin or dose-reduced apixaban. Evidence from new trials addressing the appropriate bridging of NOACs before surgery is discussed. Patients with nonvalvular AF may not exhibit an added benefit from bridging of anticoagulation, and perioperative physicians should balance the risks of stroke and major bleeding before surgery. Advances in nonpharmacologic treatment and management of AF are outlined, including left atrial appendage occlusion devices, catheter ablations, and electrical cardioversion. Anesthesiologists' understanding of these 2019 updated guidelines will allow for more adept optimization of patients with AF presenting for surgery.

### Catheter ablation as first-line treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111owXyi]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation (CA) compared with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as first-line treatment for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials identified using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Embase published between 01/01/2000 and 19/03/2021. The primary efficacy endpoint was the first documented recurrence of atrial arrhythmias following the blanking period. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of all serious adverse events (SAEs).

Results

From 441 records, 6 studies met the inclusion criteria. 609 patients received CA, while 603 received AAD therapy. 212/609 patients in the CA group had a recurrence of atrial arrhythmias as compared with 318/603 in the AADs group resulting in a 36% relative risk reduction (risk ratio: 0.64, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.80, p < 0.01). The risk of all SAEs was not statistically different between CA and AAD (0.87, 0.58 to 1.30, p = 0.49); 107/609 SAE in the CA group vs 126/603 in the AAD group. Both recurrence of symptomatic atrial arrhythmias (109/505 vs 186/504) and healthcare utilisation (126/397 vs 185/394) were significantly lower in the CA group (0.53, 0.35 to 0.79 and 0.65, 0.48 to 0.89, respectively). There was a 79% reduction in the crossover rate during follow-up among patients randomised to CA compared with AAD (0.21, 0.13 to 0.32, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

First-line treatment with CA is superior to AAD therapy in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, as it significantly reduces the recurrence of any atrial arrhythmias and symptomatic atrial arrhythmias, and healthcare resource utilisation with comparable safety profile.

### Assessment of catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs for first-line therapy of atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111LGbhU]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Early rhythm control of atrial fibrillation (AF) with either antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) or catheter ablation has been reported to improve cardiovascular outcomes compared with usual care; however, the optimal therapeutic modality to achieve early rhythm control is unclear.

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of AF ablation as first-line therapy when compared with AADs in patients with paroxysmal AF.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and various major scientific conference sessions from January 1, 2000, through November 23, 2020.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published in English that had at least 12 months of follow-up and compared clinical outcomes of ablation vs AADs as first-line therapy in adults with AF. The quality of individual studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Six RCTs met inclusion criteria, including 1212 patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently extracted data. Reporting was performed in compliance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) guidelines. Analysis was performed using a random-effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel method, and results are presented as 95% CIs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were safety and efficacy of AF ablation as first-line therapy when compared with AADs. Trials were evaluated as having low risk of selection and attrition biases, high risk of performance bias, and with unclear risk for detection biases due to unblinding and open-label designs.

Results

A total of 6 RCTs involving 1212 patients with AF were included (609 were randomized to AF ablation and 603 to drug therapy; mean [SD] age, 56 [11] years). Compared with AADs, catheter ablation use was associated with reductions in recurrent atrial arrhythmia (32.3% vs 53%; risk ratio [RR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51–0.74; P < .001; I² = 40%), with a number needed to treat with ablation to prevent 1 arrhythmia of 5. Use of ablation was also associated with reduced symptomatic atrial arrhythmia (11.8% vs 26.4%; RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27–0.72; p = 0.001; I² = 54%) and hospitalization (5.6% vs 18.7%; RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.19–0.53; P < .001) with no significant difference in serious adverse events between the groups (4.2% vs 2.8%; RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.81–2.85; p = 0.19).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials including first-line therapy of patients with paroxysmal AF, catheter ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs was associated with reductions in recurrence of atrial arrhythmias and hospitalizations, with no difference in major adverse events.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an extremely common rapid atrial arrhythmia that affects approximately 60 million people worldwide. In most instances, AF starts as a paroxysmal self‐terminating arrhythmia. However, electrical and structural remodeling due to atrial fibrosis can lead to the progression of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) to persistent AF in approximately 10% of patients over a 1‐year follow‐up. Persistent AF is not only strongly associated with higher risks of heart failure, cerebral ischemic stroke, and thrombotic events, but it also significantly reduces the quality of life (QoL) of affected patients. Therefore, the management and treatment of PAF have gained increasing attention in clinical practice.

Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and catheter ablation (CA) are common treatments for AF. Recent guidelines recommend that AADs should be the preferred medications for PAF patients and CA should be considered for patients with drug refractory. However, AAD therapy is unable to control the rhythm of AF in nearly 70% of patientsand this consequently prolongs the treatment cycle. Previous studies have revealed the importance of the time between the first diagnosis of AF and ablation, also known as the diagnosis‐to‐ablation time (DAT). It was found that a shorter DAT (less than 1 year) could lead to a lower recurrence rate and fewer hospitalizations, which suggested the potential clinical implication of first‐line CA strategy.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoballoon ablation (CBA) are currently the two major CA techniques for PAF treatment and they differ in the energy source. The famous "FIRE AND ICE" trial showed that CBA was noninferior to pulmonary vein isolation by RFA in efficacy and safety. In addition, CBA was superior to RFA in direct‐current cardioversions, repeat ablations, all‐cause rehospitalizations, and cardiovascular rehospitalizations in drug‐refractory symptomatic PAF patients. To date, only a few studies have investigated the role of CBA as an initial treatment for PAF. Several randomized‐controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated the relationship between early CBA and AF rhythm control. Additionally, CBA as a first‐line strategy has been shown to be associated with improved QoL. However, these studies reported different outcomes when comparing CBA and AAD. Therefore, whether CBA as first‐line treatment has better effects than AAD on AF rhythm control, safety, hospitalization, and QoL of PAF patients remains unclear.

### The impact of new and emerging clinical data on treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation [^116oTzWj]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Exchange Group, an international multidisciplinary group concerned with the management of AF, was convened to review recent advances in the field and the potential impact on treatment strategies.

Methods

Issues discussed included epidemiology and the impact of the rising incidence of AF on health care systems, developments in pharmacological and surgical interventions in the management of arrhythmias and thromboprophylaxis, the potential to affect treatment strategies, and barriers to implementing them.

Results

The incidence of AF and the associated burden on health care systems are increasing with aging populations, prevalence of comorbidities and more effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Advances in available medical treatments, in particular dronedarone and dabigatran, with other products in development, offer the possibility of changes in treatment paradigms and a greater emphasis on reducing hospitalizations and improvement in long-term outcomes instead of a symptom/safety-driven approach in which the priority is symptom suppression without provoking drug toxicity. Developments in catheter ablation techniques may mean that, in experienced centers, ablation may be offered as first-line treatment in selected patient populations. Barriers to optimal treatment include underdiagnosis, lack of recognition as a serious condition and as a risk factor for stroke, limited access to care, inadequate implementation of guidelines, and poor adherence to treatment.

Conclusions

The focus of the management of AF may be changing as a consequence of new treatments based on the outcome improvements they offer. However, the benefits will not be fully realized if guidelines and guidance are not observed in routine clinical practice.

### Catheter ablation vs antiarrhythmic drug therapy for first-line treatment of atrial fibrillation in United States clinical practice [^113Ttw9y]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Catheter ablation (CA) has a Class I indication for first-line rhythm control for atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

To compare the safety and effectiveness of CA versus antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) for first-line rhythm control therapy in clinical practice.

Methods

Persons with incident AF (2015–2022) in the Optum Clinformatics cohort were categorized by the first-line treatment they received (CA or AAD). The incidence of hospitalization for atrial arrhythmia (AF, atrial flutter or tachycardia) at 1-year (3-month blanking period) was compared between CA and AAD. Cox regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to compare outcomes between treatment groups.

Results

A total of 2,711 CA-treated (mean age 66.4 ± 10.7 years, 39.8% female) and 22,726 AAD-treated (mean age 70.3 ± 11.4 years, 52.2% female) persons with a new diagnosis of AF were included. Patients undergoing CA as the first-line therapy had a 48% lower risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.68) of hospitalization for atrial arrhythmia, a 52% lower risk of AF-related electrical cardioversion (HR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.34–0.68), and a 74% lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.13–0.54) compared with those receiving first-line AAD therapy. Lower risks of atrial arrhythmia hospitalization were also found with first-line CA receipt versus AAD in paroxysmal (HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.37–0.73) and persistent AF (HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.81).

Conclusions

First-line cablation for both paroxysmal and persistent AF is associated with significantly lower risk of hospitalization for atrial arrhythmia consistent with results from randomized clinical trials and current Class I guideline recommendations.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1126frCA]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Antithrombotic options in atrial fibrillation — treatment thresholds and choices: Anticoagulation is recommended if ≥ 2%/y (1) and reasonable if 1%- < 2%/y (2a). For agent selection, DOACs are preferred over warfarin (except for mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve) (1). Aspirin either alone or with clopidogrel is not recommended to reduce stroke risk (3: Harm), and if no risk factors for stroke, aspirin to prevent thromboembolic events is not recommended (3: No benefit).

### Anticoagulation: updated guidelines for outpatient management [^112aLoNe]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation therapy is recommended for preventing, treating, and reducing the recurrence of venous thromboembolism, and preventing stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation. Direct oral anticoagulants are first-line agents for eligible patients for treating venous thromboembolism and preventing stroke in those with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K antagonists are recommended for patients with mechanical valves and valvular atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K antagonists inhibit the production of vitamin K-related factors and require a minimum of five days overlap with parenteral anticoagulants, whereas direct oral anticoagulants directly inhibit factor II or factor Xa, providing more immediate anticoagulation. The immediate effect of direct oral anticoagulants permits select patients at low risk to initiate treatment in the outpatient setting for venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin continues to be recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with venous thromboembolism and active cancer, although there is growing evidence of effectiveness for the use of direct oral anticoagulants in this patient population. Validated bleeding risk assessments such as HAS-BLED should be performed at each visit and modifiable factors should be addressed. Major bleeding should be treated with vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for patients already being treated with a vitamin K antagonist. Idarucizumab has been effective for reversing the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, and andexanet alfa has been effective for reversing the effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban.

### Catheter ablation as first line therapy for atrial fibrillation [^115HWx2x]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment for atrial fibrillation has evolved significantly over time. Previously, medication management was the mainstay of treatment. As we have developed more robust technologies and modalities for catheter ablation, these treatment recommendations have changed. Catheter ablation is a safe and effective strategy for treating atrial fibrillation that is now considered first-line therapy in some patient populations. In this review, we discuss historical perspectives regarding the treatment and management of atrial fibrillation. We review the literature on studies investigating catheter ablation as first-line therapy, including the impact of catheter ablation on arrhythmia recurrence, cardiovascular outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Finally, we discuss future directions for the management of atrial fibrillation as the technology for catheter ablation continues to grow and progress.

Risk-based selection of oral anticoagulation — In patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have an estimated annual risk of stroke or thromboembolic events ≥ 2%, selection of therapy to reduce the risk of stroke should be based on the risk of thromboembolism, regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent (COR 1, LOE B-R). In patients with AF at risk for stroke, reevaluation of the need for and choice of stroke risk reduction therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risk, net clinical benefit, and proper dosing (COR 1, LOE B-NR).

Background Current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. We assessed the concordance between healthcare provider real-world practice and current guidelines with respect to first-line AAD rhythm management. Methods and Results Administrative claims data from the deidentified Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database were used. Patients were included if they were initiated on an AAD in 2015 to 2016, had 1 year of continuous data availability before their first AAD pharmacy claim, and had a diagnosis for atrial fibrillation within that period. Concordance was assessed by comparing the AAD initiated by the healthcare provider against guideline recommendations for first-line treatment, given the presence of heart failure, coronary artery disease, both, or neither (as determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision [ICD-9 and ICD-10] codes). Concordance was also assessed by provider type using Medicare taxonomy codes. For the 15 445 patients included, 51% of healthcare providers initiated AAD treatments with amiodarone, 18% flecainide, 15% sotalol, 8% dronedarone, 5% propafenone, and 2% dofetilide. The overall rate of guideline concordance was 61%, with differences by provider type: 67% for electrophysiologists, 61% for cardiologists, and 60% for others (internal medicine, etc). Conclusions There continues to be a sizable gap in concordance between practice and guidelines in first-line rhythm management of patients with atrial fibrillation. Further research is needed to identify possible explanations for non-guideline-recommended use of AADs, in addition to enhanced AAD educational strategies for practitioners.

### Rate versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation [^1113qUcj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether rate control is a viable initial treatment approach in persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) through the evaluation of recently completed trials comparing rate and rhythm control.

Data Sources

Biomedical literature was obtained through MEDLINE (1966-December 2003) and the Iowa database.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles identified from the biomedical literature search were reviewed and included if deemed relevant.

Data Synthesis

Currently available data suggest that rate control is not inferior to rhythm control in patients with persistent AF with respect to mortality. Rate control also reduces hospitalizations and the occurrence of proarrhythmias. No significant difference was observed between treatments with respect to thromboembolism and strokes.

Conclusions

Due to the increased incidence of hospitalizations and antiarrhythmic adverse effects associated with rhythm control, rate control is a reasonable first-line strategy in the treatment of recurrent AF, especially in elderly patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Further studies are needed to clearly define the role of rate control in younger patients.

### A randomized clinical trial of early invasive intervention for atrial fibrillation (EARLY-AF)-methods and rationale [^115omCVK]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The ideal management of patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unknown. Current practice guidelines recommend a trial of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) prior to considering an invasive ablation procedure. However, earlier ablation offers an opportunity to halt the progressive patho-anatomical changes associated with AF, as well as impart other important clinical benefits.

Objective

The aim of this study is to determine the optimal initial management strategy for patients with newly diagnosed, symptomatic atrial fibrillation.

Methods/Design

The EARLY-AF study (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02825979) is a prospective, open label, multicenter, randomized trial with a blinded assessment of outcomes. A total of 298 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to first-line AAD therapy, or first-line cryoballoon-based pulmonary vein isolation. Patients with symptomatic treatment naïve AF will be included. Arrhythmia outcomes will be assessed by implantable cardiac monitor (ICM). The primary outcome is time to first recurrence of AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia (AF/AFL/AT) between days 91 and 365 following AAD initiation or AF ablation. Secondary outcomes include arrhythmia burden, quality of life, and healthcare utilization.

Discussion

The EARLY-AF study is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the optimal first management approach for patients with AF. We hypothesize that catheter ablation will be superior to drug therapy in prevention of AF recurrence.

### Real-world health care resource utilization and costs associated with first-line dronedarone versus first-line ablation in adults with atrial fibrillation [^116Axtoo]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the United States and worldwide. The prevalence of AF in the United States is predicted to increase from approximately 5.2 million individuals in 2010 to ≥ 12.1 million in 2030. Alongside this rising prevalence, AF is associated with substantial health care resource utilization (HCRU) and has a significant associated cost burden owing largely to its chronic nature. Based on US public and private health insurer records (1996–2016), HCRU costs associated with AF were estimated at $28 billion.

Rhythm control therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) or catheter ablation is recommended in the United States and European guidelines for patients with AF to improve symptoms and this may reduce hospitalizations, stroke, and mortality in patients with recently diagnosed AF (< 1 year). In patients with AF and heart failure, rhythm control may also be useful in reducing mortality and heart failure–related hospitalizations. Catheter ablation is supported as a first‐line approach in selected patients, based on evidence from studies such as the Catheter Ablation versus AAD Therapy for AF (CABANA) trial, to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF. However, the health economic impact of an AAD or ablation approach is unclear.

With shared decision‐making, many patients may select AAD therapy over the more invasive approach of ablation. Consequently, a better understanding is needed of the real‐world HCRU and cost implications of adopting first‐line AAD therapy versus catheter ablation in patients recently diagnosed with AF. The appropriate AAD selection is based on the safety of the AAD for a particular patient and depends on comorbidities, presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease, coronary heart disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, or presence of recent heart failure decompensation. Studies of individual AADs are particularly relevant because amiodarone (the most frequently used AAD in the comparator group of CABANA) has been associated with long‐term toxicity and higher cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations or death compared with rate control therapy alone. In this context, the current study sought to assess all‐cause HCRU and associated payer costs in patients with recently diagnosed AF (within 1 year) receiving a rhythm control strategy of first‐line dronedarone therapy or first‐line ablation in the real‐world setting.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Agents with proven efficacy to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) — evidence summary and amiodarone: Thirty-six controlled trials evaluating 7 antiarrhythmic drugs for maintenance were identified, including 14 trials in paroxysmal AF and 22 trials in persistent AF. Available evidence suggests that amiodarone is more effective than either class I drugs, sotalol, or placebo for long-term maintenance in patients refractory to other drugs, but it is associated with a relatively high incidence of potentially severe extracardiac toxic effects, making it a second-line or last-resort agent in many cases. The use of low-dose amiodarone (200 mg daily or less) may be effective and associated with fewer side effects. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and/or previous myocardial infarction (MI), amiodarone is associated with a low risk of proarrhythmia, making it an appropriate initial choice to prevent recurrent AF in these situations, and it provides the added benefit of effective rate control, frequently eliminating the need for other drugs to control the ventricular rate. In the CTAF trial context, a majority of the 403 patients had first-time paroxysmal (46%) or persistent (54%) AF of less than 6-month duration.

Oral anticoagulants — vitamin K antagonists — note that "Since the 1950s, warfarin was used as a first-line therapy until DOACs came into practice", but its "narrow therapeutic window" with INRs, monitoring, drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and "low clinical safety profile affected the routine use of warfarin in practice". Due to affordability barriers to DOACs, "warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs", and utilization data show "About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quarter of 2017".

### Introduction: early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of atrial fibrillation [^115mjskJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia, represents a significant burden to patients and healthcare systems. Many patients with AF are asymptomatic and often undiagnosed. Improved detection methods and surveillance have resulted in recognition of asymptomatic and subclinical AF, providing earlier diagnosis. The recent EAST-AFNET 4 and Korean studies have demonstrated early rhythm control (ERC) with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) or ablation in patients with AF improves outcomes. The EARLY AF and STOP AF First studies have shown that ERC using ablation can slow AF progression. In the following videos, the authors discuss the evolving AF landscape, with an emphasis on the benefits of early diagnosis and treatment. Historic rate versus rhythm control studies and their limitations are reviewed, followed by recent studies that support the use of ERC alongside usual care including rate control. Discussion of ERC treatment includes the selection of appropriate AADs based on safety, when to choose ablation as first-line therapy, and the complementary use of ablation and AADs. The authors summarize the current guidelines for the use of AADs to treat AF, highlighting the importance of concordance with those guidelines. Patient cases are used to relate the contents of the videos to clinical practice and are supplemented with discussion of the importance of shared decision-making involving the patient in treatment decisions. It is anticipated that this digital publication will enable cardiologists and primary care providers to recognize when early treatment of AF will improve patient outcomes, and to empower them to initiate that treatment accordingly.

### US antiarrhythmic drug treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation: an insurance claims-based report [^113puqMk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. We assessed the concordance between healthcare provider real‐world practice and current guidelines with respect to first‐line AAD rhythm management.

Methods and Results

Administrative claims data from the deidentified Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database were used. Patients were included if they were initiated on an AAD in 2015 to 2016, had 1 year of continuous data availability before their first AAD pharmacy claim, and had a diagnosis for atrial fibrillation within that period. Concordance was assessed by comparing the AAD initiated by the healthcare provider against guideline recommendations for first‐line treatment, given the presence of heart failure, coronary artery disease, both, or neither (as determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision [ICD‐9 and ICD‐10] codes). Concordance was also assessed by provider type using Medicare taxonomy codes. For the 15 445 patients included, 51% of healthcare providers initiated AAD treatments with amiodarone, 18% flecainide, 15% sotalol, 8% dronedarone, 5% propafenone, and 2% dofetilide. The overall rate of guideline concordance was 61%, with differences by provider type: 67% for electrophysiologists, 61% for cardiologists, and 60% for others (internal medicine, etc).

Conclusions

There continues to be a sizable gap in concordance between practice and guidelines in first‐line rhythm management of patients with atrial fibrillation. Further research is needed to identify possible explanations for non–guideline‐recommended use of AADs, in addition to enhanced AAD educational strategies for practitioners.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — agent selection by AF subtype: In patients with lone AF, a beta blocker may be tried first, but flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol are particularly effective, and amiodarone and dofetilide are recommended as alternative therapies; quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide are not favored unless amiodarone fails or is contraindicated. For patients with vagally induced AF, the anticholinergic activity of long-acting disopyramide makes it a relatively attractive theoretical choice; in that situation, flecainide and amiodarone represent secondary and tertiary treatment options, respectively, whereas propafenone is not recommended because its (weak) intrinsic beta-blocking activity may aggravate vagally mediated paroxysmal AF. In patients with adrenergically mediated AF, beta blockers represent first-line treatment, followed by sotalol and amiodarone, and in patients with adrenergically mediated lone AF, amiodarone represents a less appealing selection; in patients with nocturnal AF, the possibility of sleep apnea should be considered.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1176mHPt]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to recognize that there are certain situations in which first-line AF ablation is a preferred treatment option. For example, first-line AF ablation is often recommended in patients with PAF who have symptomatic pauses (tachybrady syndrome). For these patients, initiation of pharmacological therapy would be inappropriate in the absence of a permanent pacemaker. Over the past 15 years, a body of literature has been published demonstrating that catheter ablation is effective, without concomitant need of a permanent pacemaker in the great majority of patients with tachy-brady syndrome. Based on this body of literature and the cumulative experience of the writing group, we believe that it is appropriate to consider AF ablation as first-line therapy in this clinical situation. Another specific population of patients in whom first-line AF ablation is often recommended as an initial approach are high-level competitive athletes with paroxysmal or persistent AF. These individuals often are strongly against taking a medication, which could potentially reduce their peak heart rate and/or impair cardiac function; they often have a marked resting bradycardia. Several studies have reported favorable outcomes of AF ablation in this subgroup of patients.

Catheter Ablation of AF in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Cardiac Function

AF and HF are closely related conditions. HF can predispose an individual to the occurrence of AF through various mechanisms, such as the increase of the left ventricular filling pressure or LA dilatation and fibrosis, each of which can lead to atrial structural and electrical remodeling. Conversely, AF with the loss of atrial contraction and potential uncontrolled heart rate secondary to arrhythmia can predispose an individual to the development of HF, thus leading to impaired contractility and reduced cardiac output. AF can increase mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; therefore, the treatment of AF in this subset of patients is of pivotal importance.

Much controversy still exists regarding how to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with HF; undoubtedly, however, maintenance of sinus rhythm is beneficial in restoring atrial-ventricular coordination, thus favoring an improved left ventricular performance and a better QOL.

### Physician stated atrial fibrillation management in light of treatment guidelines: data from an international, observational prospective survey [^1165M99b]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The Registry on Cardiac Rhythm Disorders Assessing the Control of Atrial Fibrillation (RecordAF) study is the first worldwide, prospective, survey of real-life management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in recently diagnosed patients (n = 5604) with a 1-year follow-up.

Hypothesis

Surveys of AF management have identified a divergence between guidelines and clinical practice, and an overinterpretation of guidelines in low-risk patients.

Methods

Physicians' theoretical approaches to rhythm and rate control were investigated using a pre-study questionnaire.

Results

One cardiologist, from each of the 583 sites in 6 regions, completed a questionnaire on their practice and management of AF patients. In AF patients with structural heart disease (SHD), amiodarone was the most frequent choice of first-line rhythm control agents in all regions. Amiodarone or sotalol tended to be the preferred second-line rhythm control agents, 1 exception being Central/South America. beta-Blockers were the first-line rate control agents for patients with AF and SHD in all regions, and calcium channel blockers and cardiac glycosides were the most common second-line rate control treatments in all regions, except Asia. In lone AF patients, propafenone (30.6%), flecainide (24.1%), and amiodarone (21.7%) were the most common global choices of first-line rhythm control, and amiodarone or sotalol were the preferred second-line rhythm control agents, 1 exception being Central/South America.

Conclusions

These results highlight points of divergence from the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of AF in terms of first-line drug selection in patients with associated SHD or coronary artery disease.

### Treatment of atrial fibrillation [^114rAuLL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that affects more than 2.5 million people in the United States and causes substantial morbidity and mortality, especially regarding the increased risk of stroke.

Objective

To summarize atrial fibrillation treatment exclusive of stroke prevention.

Evidence Review

An Ovid MEDLINE comprehensive literature search was performed on atrial fibrillation therapy excluding anticoagulation and emphasizing studies published within the last 5 years through April 2015 (N = 5044 references). The 2014 atrial fibrillation guideline from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society also was reviewed.

Findings

Reversible causes of atrial fibrillation should be identified. Risk factor modification, including weight loss and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea can reduce atrial fibrillation episodes. Appropriate anticoagulation is necessary for patients at substantial stroke risk regardless of rate or rhythm treatment strategy. Sinus rhythm is often needed to control symptoms; however, an alternative strategy for atrial fibrillation is appropriate rate control. Rate control is safe in older patients (those who are about age ≥ 65 years) followed up for a few years, but no such safety data exist for patients younger than 60 years or for those followed up for longer periods. Thus, selection of therapy is individualized, taking into account present and future medical problems for the patient. Choice of an antiarrhythmic drug is based on safety first vs efficacy. Catheter ablation is an effective nonpharmacological alternative that is often, but not always, the second-line treatment. Reduction of the frequency and duration of atrial fibrillation episodes that result in a significant improvement in quality of life is a good marker of drug treatment success and complete elimination of atrial fibrillation is not required in many patients. Rate control is usually achieved with a β-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It is important to assess adequate rate control during both rest and activity. If the ventricular rate goes uncontrolled for a prolonged period, tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy can occur.

Conclusions and Relevance

Therapy for atrial fibrillation includes prevention and modification of inciting causes and appropriate anticoagulation. Rate control is necessary for all patients. Maintenance of sinus rhythm with drugs or catheter ablation should be considered based on the individual needs of each patient.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: guidelines from the American… [^112Phi9t]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- Percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage reduces stroke risk and mortality with similar effectiveness as warfarin.
- Surgical exclusion of the left atrial appendage during cardiac surgery reduces stroke risk with continued anticoagulation.
- Electrical cardioversion is more effective for acute rhythm control than medications.
- Catheter ablation reduces symptoms of AF, but it recurs in up to 40% of patients. From the AFP Editors Atrial fibrillation is expected to impact 12 million people by 2030 and increase mortality risk by at least 1. 5 times. It is a chaotic, irregular atrial rhythm caused by ectopic sources in the pulmonary veins of the left atrium or in response to reentrant cardiac conduction activity from interstitial fibrosis. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association released guidelines for managing patients with AF.

EVALUATION Clinical evaluation of newly diagnosed AF should include transthoracic echocardiography. Testing for cardiac ischemia and pulmonary embolism is recommended only if suggested by clinical presentation. SubscribeFrom $180

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to catheter ablation, indications, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to perform catheter ablation as a first-line option within a shared decision-making rhythm control strategy in patients with paroxysmal AF, to reduce symptoms, recurrence, and progression of AF.

### First-line catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation-lower than recommended doses of antiarrhythmic drugs may have contributed to their inferiority: analysis of randomized controlled studies comparing ablation with antiarrhythmic drugs [^115MKCpD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation plays a pivotal role in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). Recent randomized controlled studies have shown that catheter ablation is superior to conventional antiarrhythmic medical treatment as first-line therapy in reducing symptoms, AF recurrences, and preventing progression of AF. If the examined antiarrhythmic medical regimens were given in therapeutic and adequate doses remains an open question. We performed a PubMed and Medline search for randomized trials comparing first-line antiarrhythmic drug therapy with catheter ablation of AF. Among the 442 patients randomized to the drug arm, 15% to 43% received flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol at lower than recommended doses. Additionally, between 2.5% and 10.4% of these patients either have not received or discontinued the designated therapy with Class I/III drugs early. Notably, up to 10% of the patients in the ablation arm were adjunctively treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. This may have contributed to the reported superiority of catheter ablation compared to antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^117JsQSK]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) antithrombotic therapy — stroke prevention conclusions state that stroke is a serious complication of AF with risk varying across patient groups and that antithrombotic prophylaxis is associated with increased bleeding risk; recommendations are based on net clinical benefit across varying stroke-risk levels. Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS₂ score ≥ 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, decisions require an individualized approach considering patient values and preferences, bleeding risk, and non-CHADS2 stroke risk factors. The role of oral anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in AF will evolve with results of large, ongoing, phase 3 RCTs of new oral anticoagulants and as experience with these new agents in clinical practice continues to grow.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — recommendations emphasize first-line agents and safety limits. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for long-term rate control, and for patients in whom measuring serum digoxin levels is indicated, it is reasonable to target levels < 1.2 ng/mL. In AF with heart failure (HF) symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. In AF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF, and in patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^113hdVtZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC atrial fibrillation — recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: In patients who experience brief or minimally symptomatic recurrences, it is reasonable to avoid antiarrhythmic drugs, but troublesome symptoms generally call for suppressive antiarrhythmic therapy, and rate control and prevention of thromboembolism are appropriate in both situations. For individuals with no or minimal heart disease, flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol is recommended as initial antiarrhythmic therapy, and for patients who tolerate these agents an as-needed, pill-in-the-pocket approach may reduce toxicity. If these drugs prove ineffective or cause side effects, second- or third-line choices include amiodarone, dofetilide, disopyramide, procainamide, or quinidine, and as an alternative when first-line drugs fail or are not tolerated, PV isolation or LA substrate modification may be considered. When a consistent initiating scenario suggests vagally mediated AF, disopyramide or flecainide are appropriate initial agents, and a beta blocker or sotalol is suggested for adrenergically induced AF; in particularly symptomatic patients, LA ablation may be considered when antiarrhythmic drug treatment alone fails. For patients with heart failure, safety data support selecting amiodarone or dofetilide to maintain sinus rhythm. In coronary artery disease, sotalol is considered first unless heart failure is present, with amiodarone and dofetilide considered secondary and disopyramide, procainamide, or quinidine on an individual basis. In hypertension without left ventricular hypertrophy, flecainide and propafenone are recommended first, with amiodarone, dofetilide, or sotalol as secondary choices and disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine considered third-line; in left ventricular hypertrophy, amiodarone is suggested as first-line therapy.

Atrial fibrillation — digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

### Stroke prevention strategies in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation [^111kyM7E]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Effective stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the cornerstone of the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. The use of OAC reduces the risk of stroke and death. For most patients with atrial fibrillation without moderate or severe mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic mechanical heart valves, treatment options include vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Although most guidelines generally recommend NOACs as the first-line OAC, caution is required in some groups of patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke and bleeding who have been under-represented or not studied in the randomized clinical trials on NOACs for stroke prevention. In addition to OAC, non-pharmacological, percutaneous therapies, including left atrial appendage occlusion, for stroke prevention have emerged, sometimes used in combination with catheter ablation for the treatment of the atrial fibrillation. High-risk groups of patients with atrial fibrillation include patients with end-stage renal failure (including those receiving dialysis), extremely old patients (such as those aged > 80 years with multiple risk factors for bleeding), patients with dementia or those living in a long-term care home, patients with previous intracranial bleeding or recent acute bleeding (such as gastrointestinal bleeding), patients with acute ischaemic stroke and patients with an intracardiac thrombus. This Review provides an overview of stroke prevention strategies, including left atrial appendage occlusion, in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke and bleeding.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

### Catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drug therapy as first-or second-line therapy in the management of atrial fibrillation: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151NbgZ]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal management of atrial fibrillation remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to examine the safety and the efficacy of catheter ablation (CA) when compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy both as first- and second-line therapy for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation.

Methods and Results

Several databases were searched from inception to March 2014, which yielded 11 studies with 1481 patients with atrial fibrillation. The outcomes measured were recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia and the incidence of adverse events. A subgroup analysis was done to evaluate the efficacy of CA as first- or second-line therapy. There was recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia in 222 of 785 (28%) patients who underwent CA and in 451 of 696 (65%) patients who were on antiarrhythmic drug therapy (relative risk, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.31–0.52; P = 0.00001). Subgroup analysis revealed a beneficial effect of CA both as a first-line (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.91; P = 0.02) and as a second-line (relative risk, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.29–0.48; P < 0.00001) therapeutic modality. There was a significantly higher incidence of major adverse events in the CA group when compared with those in the antiarrhythmic drug therapy group (relative risk, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–3.77; P = 0.02, I(2) = 0%).

Conclusions

CA seems to be superior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in drug naïve, resistant, and intolerant patients with atrial fibrillation. However, it should be performed in carefully selected patients after weighing the risks and benefits of the procedure.

### The young patient with asymptomatic atrial fibrillation: what is the evidence to leave the arrhythmia untreated? [^117CY1ix]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and has gained increasingly more attention due to new treatment options, particularly catheter ablation. Growing experience with this technique and better AF suppression compared with antiarrhythmic medication have paved the way for its extended use and indication. At this point, it is recommended for symptomatic patients if antiarrhythmic drugs failed and in selected young symptomatic patients as first line therapy. It is a tempting concept to improve prognosis in young AF patients by rhythm control irrespective of symptoms. In this review, we summarize epidemiological data on young AF, efficacy, and limitations of rate and rhythm control by means of medication and catheter ablation in young patients, information on arrhythmia progression and outcome, and the consequences of these data for AF treatment in young, asymptomatic patients.
