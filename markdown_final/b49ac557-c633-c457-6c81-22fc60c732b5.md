## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for hyperesthesia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 code for hyperesthesia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a specific ICD-10-CM code for hyperesthesia. Then, I should verify the exact code and its placement in the classification. Next, I will check for any laterality or encounter-type requirements that might modify the code. Finally, I will consider alternatives if the term is not found and confirm the code's clinical context and usage examples.

> Let me first confirm whether a dedicated ICD-10-CM code exists for hyperesthesia. Wait, let me verify in a reliable coding source; Find-A-Code lists R20.3 for hyperesthesia under disturbances of skin sensation, which supports that a specific code is available rather than requiring an unspecified alternative [^111hNnAz].

> I should confirm the exact code and its hierarchical placement. The code is R20.3, located in Chapter 18 (Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified), within the R20–R23 block for symptoms and signs involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue, specifically under R20 Disturbances of skin sensation, which aligns with the concept of hyperesthesia as an abnormal sensory symptom [^111hNnAz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about laterality or encounter-type modifiers. I need to check whether R20.3 requires a 7th character for laterality or encounter type. The R20.3 entry does not specify laterality or encounter-type extensions, and unlike some ophthalmic or musculoskeletal categories, this code does not carry the 7th-character structure or placeholder X requirement, so R20.3 stands as is without additional digits in standard ICD-10-CM usage [^111hNnAz].

> Let me consider clinical context and synonyms to ensure I'm not missing a more specific etiologic code. Hyperesthesia denotes increased sensitivity of the skin, often co-occurring with dysesthesia, allodynia, or paresthesia; in the absence of a more specific underlying diagnosis, R20.3 is appropriate, whereas if hyperesthesia is due to a known condition, coding should prioritize the underlying cause first and use R20.3 as an additional symptom code when clinically relevant [^111UjedQ].

> I should double-check that no competing codes are commonly used for the same concept. R20.8 covers other disturbances of skin sensation, and R20.9 is unspecified; these are broader and less specific than R20.3, so if the clinician documents hyperesthesia, R20.3 is the preferred, most specific choice unless the documentation is insufficient to support it [^111hNnAz].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for hyperesthesia is R20.3 [^111hNnAz].

---

The ICD-10 code for hyperesthesia is **R20.3** [^111hNnAz]. This code is used for documented increased sensitivity of the skin and should be applied when hyperesthesia is the most specific diagnosis available. If the hyperesthesia is secondary to another condition, code the underlying cause first and use R20.3 as an additional code when clinically relevant [^111UjedQ].

---

## ICD-10 code for hyperesthesia

The ICD-10 code for hyperesthesia is **R20.3**, defined as "hyperesthesia" within the broader category of disturbances of skin sensation (R20) [^111hNnAz].

---

## Clinical definition and significance

Hyperesthesia is characterized by **increased sensitivity of the skin**, often manifesting as heightened responsiveness to touch, temperature, or other sensory stimuli. It can be associated with various neurological, psychiatric, or systemic conditions, including anxiety disorders, neuropathies, and medication-induced sensory changes [^116nirZH] [^1129qfUY].

---

## ICD-10 code structure and classification

The ICD-10 code R20.3 is part of **Chapter XVIII** (Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified), specifically under the subcategory R20 (Disturbances of skin sensation). This classification emphasizes that hyperesthesia is a symptom rather than a standalone disease entity, often indicating an underlying neurological or psychiatric condition [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding of hyperesthesia requires thorough clinical documentation. Clinicians should specify:

- **Anatomical location**: Identify the specific area of the body affected by hyperesthesia (e.g. upper limb, lower limb, face, trunk).

- **Severity and characteristics**: Describe the intensity, frequency, and triggers of the hyperesthesia episodes.

- **Underlying conditions**: Document any associated neurological, psychiatric, or systemic conditions that may contribute to hyperesthesia (e.g. anxiety disorders, neuropathies, medication side effects) [^116nirZH] [^1129qfUY].

- **Functional impact**: Assess and document the impact of hyperesthesia on daily activities, sleep, and quality of life.

---

## Related ICD-10 codes and differential diagnosis

Several related ICD-10 codes may be used in conjunction with or as alternatives to R20.3, depending on the clinical context:

| **ICD-10 code** | **Description** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| R20.0 | Anesthesia of skin | Loss of sensation |
| R20.1 | Hypoesthesia of skin | Decreased sensitivity |
| R20.2 | Paresthesia of skin | Tingling or pins-and-needles sensation |
| R20.8 | Other disturbances of skin sensation | Other specified sensory disturbances |
| R20.9 | Unspecified disturbance of skin sensation | Unspecified sensory disturbance |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Hyperesthesia can significantly impact patient quality of life, causing discomfort, anxiety, and functional impairment. Management typically involves:

- **Identifying and treating underlying conditions**: Addressing neurological, psychiatric, or systemic causes is essential for effective management [^115u8o9q].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Medications such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or topical agents may be used to manage sensory symptoms [^notfound].

- **Non-pharmacological therapies**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and physical therapy may help patients cope with sensory disturbances.

- **Patient education**: Educating patients about their condition, triggers, and coping strategies is crucial for improving adherence and outcomes.

---

## Limitations and challenges in coding hyperesthesia

Despite the availability of a specific ICD-10 code, several challenges exist in coding hyperesthesia:

- **Subjectivity of symptoms**: Hyperesthesia is inherently subjective, relying on patient reports, which can lead to variability in documentation and coding accuracy.

- **Lack of standardized diagnostic criteria**: There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria for hyperesthesia, complicating consistent coding across clinicians and healthcare settings.

- **Underreporting**: Hyperesthesia may be underreported or overlooked, particularly when patients present with multiple comorbidities or when sensory symptoms are not the primary concern.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for hyperesthesia is **R20.3**, representing increased sensitivity of the skin. Accurate coding requires thorough clinical documentation of the anatomical location, severity, underlying conditions, and functional impact. Effective management involves addressing underlying causes, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, and patient education. Despite challenges, precise coding and documentation are essential for appropriate clinical care, research, and healthcare reimbursement.

Key Points

Question

How did cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) present and change in US emergency departments (EDs) from 2016 to 2022?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, with more than 188 million ED visits, CHS visits clustered among adults aged 18 to 35 years, rose during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2021, then plateaued. Among ED visits with primary cyclic vomiting syndrome, the conditional probability of CHS remained elevated in 2022.

Meaning

These findings suggest that CHS represents a growing share of emesis-related ED visits, especially among younger adults; greater awareness, standardized diagnostic practices, and use of the recently added International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes (F12.188) may improve recognition and management as cannabis use expands postlegalization.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, 2016 to 2022 [^117SeKf9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome

Because no specific ICD-10 code for CHS existed during the study period, we applied diagnostic criteria to estimate the presence of cannabis use disorder (CUD), cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), and CHS for each ED visit. As used here, CUD refers to cannabis-related diagnoses — including use, abuse, dependence, and poisoning — and does not align precisely with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition)–defined CUD.

CUD was identified using the Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR), which aggregates over 70 000 ICD-10 codes into 530 clinically meaningful categories. We classified CUD as present if any diagnosis in the record fell under CCSR category MBD019 (cannabis-related disorders) or MBD30 (subsequent encounters for cannabis-related disorders). Because cannabis use is often underreported in clinical settings, this broader definition was used to optimize detection.

CVS was classified as present when the primary diagnosis (ie, the main reason for the ED visit) was either ICD-10 code R11.15 (cyclical vomiting, not associated with migraine) or R11.10 (vomiting, unspecified). On the basis of these criteria, visits were assigned to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive groups: (1) no CVS, CUD, or CHS; (2) CUD only; (3) CVS only; and (4) CHS, defined as a primary CVS diagnosis with a cannabis-specific secondary diagnosis (F12x or T40.7Xx).

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^1131gom4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^115BJ9c8]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Coding of post-surgical pain in ICD-11: between conceptual richness and practical constraints [^116nneh6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) marks a decisive step forward in recognising chronic postsurgical pain as a distinct clinical entity. Yet, significant gaps remain between its conceptual framework, coding tools, and real-world clinical practice. Here we highlight these inconsistencies and call for stronger integration of the diagnostic criteria, along with improved visibility of neuropathic pain mechanisms as well as the psychosocial dimensions of pain.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^114Brojh]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^112re7WE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Updating allergy and / or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures in the WHO ICD-11 revision [^117XzUrX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

The classification of allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions for the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 provides the appropriate corresponding codes for allergic diseases, assuming that the final diagnosis is correct. This classification should be linked to in vitro and in vivo diagnostic procedures. Considering the impact for our specialty, we decided to review the codification of these procedures into the ICD aiming to have a baseline and to suggest changes and/or submit new proposals. For that, we prepared a list of the relevant allergy and/or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures that health care professionals are dealing with on a daily basis. This was based on the main current guidelines and selected all possible and relevant corresponding terms from the ICD-10 (2015 version) and the ICD-11 β phase foundation (June 2015 version). More than 90% of very specific and important diagnostic procedures currently used by the allergists' community on a daily basis are missing. We observed that some concepts usually used by the allergist community on a daily basis are not fully recognized by other specialties. The whole scheme and the correspondence in the ICD-10 (2015 version) and ICD-11 foundation (June 2015 version) provided us a big picture of the missing or imprecise terms and how they are scattered in the current ICD-11 framework, allowing us to submit new proposals to increase the visibility of the allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions and diagnostic procedures.

### Changes in emergency department visits for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome following recreational cannabis legalization and subsequent commercialization in Ontario, Canada [^111MRx1x]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of ED visits owing to CHS per 100 000 individuals. Because there is no diagnostic code for CHS, we followed the previous literature identifying CHS ED visits as those in which vomiting (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Canada [ICD-10-CA] code R11) was the primary diagnosis and a cannabis harm (ICD-10-CA code F12 or T40.7) was an additional diagnosis. Since CHS is not widely recognized, we developed a secondary outcome measure termed sensitive CHS ED visits, which includes the primary outcome definition and an ED visit with a primary diagnosis of vomiting (ICD-10-CA code R11) plus an ED visit owing to a cannabis harm in the 6 months preceding or following the incident vomiting visit. We constructed 4 additional outcome measures to better isolate the association with commercialization vs with the COVID-19 pandemic. These outcomes normalized our CHS ED visits by total ED visits for any cause and for vomiting, mental health, or substance use.

We characterized the clinical course of CHS ED visits through 3 measures. We examined the triage acuity of visits using the Canadian Trauma and Acuity Scale, which is a validated ordinal score used to classify the acuity of ED presentations ranging from 1 (resuscitation) to 5 (nonurgent). We examined the proportion of CHS ED visits resulting in hospitalization and the proportion of CHS ED visits with a repeat CHS ED visit within 6 months.

Additional Covariates

We identified prior mental health service use over the past 2 years of individuals with CHS ED visits, including outpatient visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations. We classified individuals as living in urban or rural regions and neighborhood income groups (categorized into quintiles) using Statistics Canada census data.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^115ybKo2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) classification — International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes that "could be used when managing individuals with CTS" include G56.00, G56.01, G56.02, M79.641, M79.642, M79.643, M79.644, M79.645, M79.646, R20.1, R20.2, and R20.9, as listed under "ICD-10-CM".

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^11523574]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Accuracy of malignant hyperthermia diagnoses in hospital discharge records [^11235Umz]. Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In 1997, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9) coding system introduced the code for malignant hyperthermia (MH) (995.86). The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of coding for MH in hospital discharge records.

Methods

An expert panel of anesthesiologists reviewed medical records for patients with a discharge diagnosis of MH based on ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008 at six tertiary care medical centers in North America. All cases were categorized as possible, probable, or fulminant MH, history of MH (family or personal) or other.

Results

A total of 47 medical records with MH diagnoses were reviewed; 68.1% had a documented surgical procedure and general anesthesia, and 23.4% (95% CI, 12.3–38.0%) had a possible, probable, or fulminant MH event. Dantrolene was given in 81% of the MH events. All patients judged to have an incident MH event survived to discharge. Family and personal history of MH accounted for 46.8% of cases. High fever without evidence of MH during admission accounted for 23.4%, and the reason for MH coding was unclear in 6.4% of cases.

Conclusions

Approximately one quarter of ICD-9 or ICD-10 coded MH diagnoses in hospital discharge records refer to incident MH episodes and an additional 47% to MH susceptibility (including personal history or family history). Information such as surgical procedure, anesthesia billing data, and dantrolene administration may aid in identifying incident MH cases among those with an ICD-9 or ICD-10 coded MH diagnosis in their hospital discharge records.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^117JU1Un]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^116EtPoF]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^112joPc3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — classification codes include the primary International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes "M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabuli, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament". The corresponding ICD-9-CM codes and conditions are "719.45 Joint pain, 718.65 Unspecified intrapelvic protrusion of acetabulum, 718.15 Loose body in joint, and 718.5 Other derangement of joint pelvic region and thigh". Other ICD-10 codes that may be associated are "M21.0 Valgus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.1 Varus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.2 Flexion deformity", "M24.3 Pathological dislocation and subluxation of joint, not elsewhere classified", and "M24.4 Recurrent dislocation and subluxation of joint".

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^113zaDgk]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, the ICD-11 is superior to the ICD-10 and equally suitable for coding chronic primary and chronic secondary pain. According to results of this field test, the ICD-11 will be more precise and less ambiguous in representing chronic pain conditions in healthcare statistics in the future.

### Pathway to acquire new ICD-10 codes pertinent to new wound care technology [^114SpFAv]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

New technologies are continually developed for the wound care market. This article provides an overview of the process for obtaining a new or revised ICD-10-Clinical Modification and/or ICD-10-Procedure Coding System code. Manufacturers, providers and researchers often forget that this process can be lengthy and must be included in product development timelines. An example of timelines required for implementation of new 2020 ICD-10 codes is provided in the article. In addition, the article provides insight into the appropriate individuals, within a manufacturing organization or consulting firm, who may be able to assist with evaluating whether pertinent ICD-10 diagnosis or procedure codes exist within the ICD-10 coding system or whether an application must be submitted for one or more new/revised ICD-10 codes.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^111V3LKf]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

4. Discussion

With this study, we supply comprehensive data of an evaluative field test demonstrating that the new chronic pain diagnoses conform to the WHO requirements for ICD-11 coding.

In the line coding, the new ICD-11 classification was tested against the established system of the ICD-10 and outperformed it in almost every way: With the ICD-11, coding was more accurate, easier, and less ambiguous to use than the ICD-10. In particular, chronic secondary pain was difficult to code in the ICD-10 (72.8% false). The lack of unique codes for these conditions in the ICD-10 required the co-selection of unspecific codes (R52) to indicate the presence of chronic pain. Most participants failed to use this code combination and offered a broad variety of codes and combinations instead, demonstrating that reliable coding of chronic pain conditions with the ICD-10 is difficult. This difficulty is reflected by the fact that these codes are rarely used in healthcare statistics. Here, the ICD-11 fared significantly better.

3. Results

3.1. Line coding

In total, the participants rated 2576 lines. They assigned more codes correctly using the ICD-11 (63.3%) than the ICD-10 (42.1%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 229.23, P < 0.001), encountered fewer difficulties assigning ICD-11 diagnoses (no difficulty 86.6%) than ICD-10 diagnoses (47.2%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 863.81, P < 0.001), and perceived fewer cases of ambiguity for the ICD-11 (no ambiguity: 75.5%) than for the ICD-10 (29.1%) (χ² [1, N = 2512] = 1003.84, P < 0.001).

Six of the lines referred to what is called "chronic primary pain" in the ICD-11 and 12 referred to chronic secondary pain. The diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly in the ICD-11 between chronic primary (62.2%) and secondary pain syndromes (63,8%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 0.64, P > 0.4) (Fig. 1). In the ICD-10, however, coding of chronic secondary pain was poor (27.2%) while existing chronic primary pain conditions were recognized correctly (70.8%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 722.51, P < 0.001). Regarding the perceived difficulty of the code assignment, primary and secondary pain did not differ in the ICD-11 (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 0.004, P > 0.9), but did so in ICD-10 (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 58.87, P < 0.001), with secondary pain being more difficult (refer to Fig. 1 for percentages). A parallel picture is revealed for ambiguity of code assignment. In the ICD-11, no difference between primary and secondary pain was observed (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 0.09, P > 0.7), but in the ICD-10, more ambiguity was reported for code assignments for secondary pain (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 49.14, P < 0.001).

Results

In total, 5 152 250 patients (3 817 817 female [74.1%]; mean [SD] age, 58.2 [16.4] years) with inflammatory arthritides were identified; 2 626 584 (51.0%) were coded in ICD-9 and 2 525 666 (49.0%) in ICD-10. For ICD-9, 4 of 14 inflammatory arthritides codes (28.6% of available codes) were higher-usage codes (used > 1% of the time). For ICD-10, 9 of 438 codes (2.1%) were higher-usage (Table). Of the top 20 codes, 65% contained unspecified or other specified in the verbiage.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^1156v3af]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Accuracy of diagnostic codes for identifying brief resolved unexplained events [^114roCKy]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding strategies for the identification of patients with a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE).

Methods

Multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged < 1 year with an emergency department (ED) visit between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2018, and an ICD-10 code for the following: (1) BRUE; (2) characteristics of BRUE; (3) serious underlying diagnoses presenting as a BRUE; and (4) nonserious diagnoses presenting as a BRUE. Sixteen algorithms were developed by using various combinations of these 4 groups of ICD-10 codes. Manual chart review was used to assess the performance of these ICD-10 algorithms for the identification of (1) patients presenting to an ED who met the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical definition for a BRUE and (2) the subset of these patients discharged from the ED or hospital without an explanation for the BRUE.

Results

Of 4512 records reviewed, 1646 (36.5%) of these patients met the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for BRUE on ED presentation, 1016 (61.7%) were hospitalized, and 959 (58.3%) had no explanation on discharge. Among ED discharges, the BRUE ICD-10 code alone was optimal for case ascertainment (sensitivity: 89.8% to 92.8%; positive predictive value: 51.7% to 72.0%). For hospitalized patients, ICD-10 codes related to the clinical characteristics of BRUE are preferred (specificity 93.2%, positive predictive value 32.7% to 46.3%).

Conclusions

The BRUE ICD-10 code and/or the diagnostic codes for the characteristics of BRUE are recommended, but the choice between approaches depends on the investigative purpose and the specific BRUE population and setting of interest.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^115xmrav]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Naming a newly discovered disease is a difficult process; in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), which includes long COVID, it has proven especially challenging. Disease definitions and assignment of a diagnosis code are often asynchronous and iterative. The clinical definition and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID are still in flux, and the deployment of an ICD-10-CM code for long COVID in the USA took nearly 2 years after patients had begun to describe their condition. Here, we leverage the largest publicly available HIPAA-limited dataset about patients with COVID-19 in the US to examine the heterogeneity of adoption and use of U09.9, the ICD-10-CM code for "Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified".

Methods

We undertook a number of analyses to characterize the N3C population with a U09.9 diagnosis code (n = 33,782), including assessing person-level demographics and a number of area-level social determinants of health; diagnoses commonly co-occurring with U09.9, clustered using the Louvain algorithm; and quantifying medications and procedures recorded within 60 days of U09.9 diagnosis. We stratified all analyses by age group in order to discern differing patterns of care across the lifespan.

Results

We established the diagnoses most commonly co-occurring with U09.9 and algorithmically clustered them into four major categories: cardiopulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, and comorbid conditions. Importantly, we discovered that the population of patients diagnosed with U09.9 is demographically skewed toward female, White, non-Hispanic individuals, as well as individuals living in areas with low poverty and low unemployment. Our results also include a characterization of common procedures and medications associated with U09.9-coded patients.

Conclusions

This work offers insight into potential subtypes and current practice patterns around long COVID and speaks to the existence of disparities in the diagnosis of patients with long COVID. This latter finding in particular requires further research and urgent remediation.

For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica between 2005 and 2018: a national cohort study [^114dperV]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of meralgia paresthetica (MP), which is caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), has been increasing over recent decades. Since guidelines and large-scale studies are lacking, there are substantial regional differences in diagnostics and management in MP care. Our study aims to report on current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies as well as time trends in clinical MP management in Germany. Patients hospitalized in Germany between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2018, with MP as their primary diagnosis were identified using the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) code G57.1 and standardized operations and procedures codes (OPS). A total of 5828 patients with MP were included. The rate of imaging studies increased from 44% in 2005 to 79% in 2018 (p < 0.001) and that of non-imaging diagnostic studies from 70 to 93% (p < 0.001). Among non-imaging diagnostics, the rates of evoked potentials and neurography increased from 20%/16% in 2005 to 36%/23% in 2018 (p < 0.001, respectively). Rates of surgical procedures for MP decreased from 53 to 37% (p < 0.001), while rates of non-surgical procedures increased from 23 to 30% (p < 0.001). The most frequent surgical interventions were decompressive procedures at a mean annual rate of 29% (± 5) throughout the study period, compared to a mean annual rate of 5% (± 2) for nerve transection procedures. Between 2005 and 2018, in-hospital MP care in Germany underwent significant changes. The rates of imaging, evoked potentials, neurography, and non-surgical management increased. The decompression of the LFCN was substantially more frequent than that of the LFCN transection, yet both types of intervention showed a substantial decrease in in-hospital prevalence over time.

Materials and methods

Study setting and data acquisition

In 2005, Germany had 82,437,995 inhabitants, compared to 83,019,213 in 2018. The German health system is mainly funded by the government. About one-third of all hospitals are run by private companies. Data on all patients hospitalized in Germany between 2005 and 2018 with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code G57.1, which represents the diagnosis of MP, were provided by the German Federal Statistical Office (GFSO) for every 2nd year as well as 2018 and were included in the analysis. Ethical approval for this study was granted by local authorities (EA 1/275/20). Inclusion criteria were the main diagnosis of MP represented by the ICD code G57.1. Patients hospitalized with MP as their main diagnosis in years 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2018 entered the final analysis. The ICD10 main diagnosis refers to the diagnosis that is the cause for hospitalization. Procedures are coded according to the German operations and procedures codes (OPS). An unlimited number of procedures can be assigned to a single patient. Different chapters describe the procedure type, such as chapter 1 — diagnostic procedures, chapter 3 — imaging methods, chapter 5 — surgical procedures, chapter 6 — specific drug applications, chapter 8 — nonsurgical therapeutic procedures, and chapter 9 — additional procedures. Outpatient data on MP were not included in the analysis as they are not available through the GFSO.

Statistical analysis

Rates for diagnostics and procedures were calculated relative to patients hospitalized for MP. The presence of systematic time trends was investigated with the prop.trend.test-function. No adjustment for multiple testing was done. Rates of events in patients with MP are expressed as annual averages in % of patients hospitalized for the main diagnosis of MP. All analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism Version 8, IBM SPSS Statistics version 27, and R Version 4.0.0.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^112b5oGv]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

1. Background

Chronic pain is very frequent, and one of the most common reasons to seek medical attention. It is a major contributor to the global burden of disease, leading to individual suffering and substantial direct and indirect societal costs. Yet, up to now, in the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), chronic pain diagnoses were not represented systematically. Reporting of mortality and morbidity, visibility in health statistics, consideration in public health policies, and research agendas depend on ICD diagnoses. In addition, many healthcare systems make the referral for multidisciplinary pain treatment conditional on suitable ICD codes as indicators of such health needs. The lack of appropriate codes contributes to the paucity of clearly defined treatment pathways for patients with chronic pain.

An international and multidisciplinary task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) developed a systematic classification of chronic pain. Chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts or recurs for longer than 3 months. The classification contains 7 main diagnostic categories, distinguishing chronic primary painand chronic secondary pain syndromes, and integrates existing pain diagnoses including headaches. The 7 main categories contain subdiagnoses to achieve a detailed classification. For every diagnosis, precise descriptions, operationalized criteria, and characteristic features are provided according to the World Health Organization (WHO) content models for the ICD-11. These pain diagnoses have been implemented in the 11 th version of the ICD that was released by the WHO in June 2018and approved by the World Health Assembly in May 2019. The ICD-11 will come into effect on January 1, 2022, for international health reporting.

### Comparing the ICD-11 chronic pain classification with ICD-10: how can the new coding system make chronic pain visible? A study in a tertiary care pain clinic setting [^114PGvAC]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain is a frequent reason for patients to ask for medical services. However, systematic information about the extent and impact of pain, especially in developing countries, has not been available up to now. We evaluated whether the 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) can fill this gap by coding all electronic out-patient medical records of the pain clinic at Siriraj Hospital in Thailand in 2019 (8714 visits), using the ICD-10 and ICD-11 browsers referenced on the WHO websites. The 3 most frequent pain-related codes in ICD-10 were R52.2 "other chronic pain" (29%), M54.5 "low back pain" (18%), and M79.6 "pain in limb" (13%). In ICD-11, the 3 most frequent codes were MG30.31 "chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain associated with structural changes" (28%), MG30.51 "chronic peripheral neuropathic pain" (26%), and MG30.10 "chronic cancer pain" (23%). Thus, using the currently valid ICD-10 system, roughly one-third of patient encounters were coded as "other chronic pain", and the next 2 were specifying the pain region rather than any underlying cause. By contrast, ICD-11 coding of the same patients identified underlying causes (bones and joints, somatosensory nervous system, cancer, or surgery), which provide guidance towards differential patient management. In our pain clinic, most patients suffered from chronic cancer pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain, which were poorly defined or nonexistent in the current ICD-10 coding system. Compared with the ICD-10, the ICD-11 provides more detailed diagnostic categories and is more informative for clinical use, research, and resource allocation for pain-related conditions.

### Consensus agreement to rename burning mouth syndrome and improve international classification of diseases-11 disease criteria: an international Delphi study [^114HNCE1]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) proposes revisions in the nomenclature, disease definition, and diagnostic criteria for "burning mouth syndrome" (BMS). This process could benefit from additional systematically collected expert input. Thus, the purpose of this study was to use the Delphi method to (1) determine whether revision in nomenclature and alternative names for "BMS" are warranted and (2) identify areas of consensus among experts for changes to the disease description and proposed diagnostic criteria of "BMS", as described in the ICD-11 (World Health Organization). From 31 international invited experts, 23 who expressed interest were sent the survey. The study used 4 iterative surveys, each with a response rate of ≥ 82%. Consensus was predefined as 70% of participants in agreement. Data were summarized using both descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis. Consensus indicated that BMS should not be classified as a syndrome and recommended instead renaming to "burning mouth disorder". Consensus included deletion of 2 diagnostic criteria: (1) emotional distress or functional disability and (2) the number of hours symptoms occur per day. Additional items that reached consensus clarified the disease definition and proposed more separate diagnostic criteria, including a list of local and systemic factors to evaluate as potential secondary causes of oral burning. Experts in this study recommended and came to consensus on select revisions to the proposed ICD-11 BMS nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, and disease definition. The revisions recommended have the potential to improve clarity, consistency, and accuracy of diagnosis for this disorder.

### Diagnostic criteria and the use of ICD-10 codes to define and classify minor head injury [^115zBi8L]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological research on the incidence of traumatic head injuries relies on the correct definition and classification of the injury.

Objective

To address the use of diagnostic criteria and ICD-10 codes to define minor head injury in Swedish hospitals managing patients with head injury.

Methods

A questionnaire was mailed to all 76 Swedish hospitals managing head injuries. The hospitals were asked what diagnostic criteria they use to define minor head injury, and which ICD-10 codes they use to classify such injuries.

Results

72 hospitals (95%) responded to the survey. The most common criterion was loss of consciousness (76%), followed by post-traumatic amnesia (38%). Almost half the hospitals used other signs and symptoms to define minor head injury. The ICD-10 code S.06 (intracranial injury) was used by 51 of the hospitals (91%).

Conclusions

It is essential that there should be common definitions, classifications, and registration of minor head injuries. The wide variation in definition and classification found in this study emphasises the importance of improved implementation of the present guidelines.

### Purpura and erythema associated with cutaneous numbness and hyperesthesia [^115hFgdp]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What other sport is likely to result in a similar appearance?
A. Running
B. Scuba diving
C. Ping-pong
D. Water polo
E. Wrestling

Answers:
A. Running – Incorrect. Running lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin diseases associated with running include jogger's nipples, jogger's toe, traction alopecia, runner's rump, piezogenic pedal papules, blisters, and tinea pedis.
B. Scuba diving – Incorrect. Scuba diving lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin disease associated with scuba diving includes scuba diver facial dermatitis from masks, diving suit dermatitis from the rubber suit, and purpura goggelorum from goggles.
C. Ping-pong - Correct. A similar phenomenon is seen in high-velocity ball sports such as ping-pong, squash, floorball, racquetball, and paintball. In these activities, a high-velocity ball strikes the skin, resulting in an erythematous ring surrounding central blanching with or without accompanying or the subsequent development of purpura, described by Cohen as the ball SITE (sports-induced targetoid erythema) sign. In diving, the high-velocity impact produces similar lesions briefly mentioned in rare articles as platform purpura.
D. Water polo – Incorrect. Although water poloists also spend time in the pool as our patient did, they do not hit the water with velocities comparable to competitive divers, making it unlikely for this sport to result in a rash like the one in our patient. Skin disease associated with water polo includes swimmer's shoulder caused by repeated rubbing of an unshaven beard against the shoulder, and bikini bottom, which is a deep bacterial folliculitis associated with damp and tight-fitting swimwear.
E. Wrestling – Incorrect. Wrestling lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin disease associated with wrestling includes mat burn as well as herpes gladiatorum, scabies, pediculosis, and impetigo from close skin-to-skin contact between athletes.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^112oV5xU]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord".

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

### The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: chronic neuropathic pain [^113eRBio]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

The upcoming 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) of the World Health Organization (WHO) offers a unique opportunity to improve the representation of painful disorders. For this purpose, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has convened an interdisciplinary task force of pain specialists. Here, we present the case for a reclassification of nervous system lesions or diseases associated with persistent or recurrent pain for ≥ 3 months. The new classification lists the most common conditions of peripheral neuropathic pain: trigeminal neuralgia, peripheral nerve injury, painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and painful radiculopathy. Conditions of central neuropathic pain include pain caused by spinal cord or brain injury, poststroke pain, and pain associated with multiple sclerosis. Diseases not explicitly mentioned in the classification are captured in residual categories of ICD-11. Conditions of chronic neuropathic pain are either insufficiently defined or missing in the current version of the ICD, despite their prevalence and clinical importance. We provide the short definitions of diagnostic entities for which we submitted more detailed content models to the WHO. Definitions and content models were established in collaboration with the Classification Committee of the IASP's Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG). Up to 10% of the general population experience neuropathic pain. The majority of these patients do not receive satisfactory relief with existing treatments. A precise classification of chronic neuropathic pain in ICD-11 is necessary to document this public health need and the therapeutic challenges related to chronic neuropathic pain.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^112hJ6Sx]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — ICD-10 CM classifications and coding rules include the following: open-angle glaucoma is coded as H40.10X-; primary open-angle glaucoma uses H40.111-, H40.112-, or H40.113-; low-tension glaucoma uses H40.121-, H40.122-, or H40.123-; residual stage of open-angle glaucoma uses H40.151, H40.152, or H40.153; and glaucomatous atrophy of the optic disc uses H47.231, H47.232, or H47.233. The footnote defines " = 0, stage unspecified; 1, mild stage; 2, moderate stage; 3, severe stage; 4, indeterminate stage". Additional ICD-10 CM instructions state that certain categories require a "7th character" and, if needed, "a placeholder X must be used" to ensure it is in the seventh position, that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality" and if no bilateral code exists "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and that laterality mapping is standardized as "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Epicrania fugax with a novel sign: pain paroxysms with parallel forward or backward trajectories [^116EuJty]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Epicrania fugax (EF) manifests as ultrabrief electric or stabbing pain paroxysms on the cranium surface of moderate or severe intensity. Sometimes, patients with EF also experience ocular or nasal autonomic accompaniments and interictal mild pain or hyperesthesia. The frequency of these paroxysms varies greatly, from a few attacks per year to numerous attacks per day. Mostly, the paroxysms occur spontaneously, but they can also be triggered by touch or palpation. First reported by Pareja et al. in 2008, EF has since been listed in the Appendix of the 3rd edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) (Table 1).

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for epicrania fugax (ICHD-3)

EF patients display various pain features that stem from posterior cranial areas moving to the ipsilateral anterior scalp, or from the frontal areas, eye, or nose toward the parietal or occipital region along lineal or zigzag trajectories. We performed a retrospective study on the clinical course of 960 patients attending a headache specialist clinic from January 2016 to December 2017 in our hospital. Among these patients, the three cases meeting diagnostic criteria for EF with a specific pain radiating pattern were reviewed.

The first patient was a 62-year-old woman who complained of headache paroxysms for three months. The pain was described as electric, with an intensity of 5 out of 10 on a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 = no pain, 10 = the worst imaginable pain). The paroxysms began in the right eye and spread posteriorly and caudally along two parallel backward zigzag trajectories to reach the ipsilateral suboccipital region and lasted for three seconds every time (Figure 1A). These attacks happened around twice per month and showed no apparent triggers. Physical or neurological examinations, routine blood tests, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain detected no abnormalities, but paresthesia along the spreading route of the pain was obvious. The patient rejected any preventive therapy and maintained similar pain quality, intensity, and frequency during the one-year follow-up.

### Purpura and erythema associated with cutaneous numbness and hyperesthesia [^113G4xcQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the treatment for this condition?
A. Topical corticosteroids
B. Aloe vera
C. Antibiotics
D. Self-resolution
E. Intralesional kenalog

Answers:
A. Topical corticosteroids – Incorrect. Topical corticosteroids are useful for dermatologic conditions whose etiology involves inflammation or hyperproliferation, neither of which are the etiology of our patient's condition.
B. Aloe vera – Incorrect. Aloe vera is occasionally used on sunburned skin; however, no clear evidence showing improved outcomes in superficial burns has been shown.
C. Antibiotics – Incorrect. Antibiotics can be used for an infectious process, but the etiology of our patient's condition is not infectious.
D. Self-resolution – Correct. The blanching resolved within hours, but the extensive erythema of her bilateral legs developed into ecchymoses within 24 hours. This interesting phenomenon of diving-related blanching with purpura is not previously described in the medical literature to our knowledge. The diver's ecchymoses resolved within 10 days without treatment.
E. Intralesional kenalog – Incorrect. Intralesional kenalog is used for various inflammatory conditions. The etiology of our patient's condition is not inflammatory.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^116koc7s]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

3.2. Case coding

One of the prepared cases referred to a diagnosis (Chronic peripheral neuropathic pain) that had not yet been implemented in the ICD-11 at the time of the field trial, and therefore was excluded from evaluation, leaving 13 pain diagnoses for 11 cases to be rated per participant. Taken together, the participants rated 1342 cases, each case was rated by between 67% (119/177) and 75% (132/177) of participants. Participants assigned the correct code for the pain diagnosis in 83.9% of cases, and in 98.4% of cases, participants reported having no difficulty in assigning the diagnosis (Table 2). The aggregated clinical utility (the mean for the individual facets) was high across all cases (4.3 ± 0.90) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful) and all single cases (Table 2).

Table 2
Case coding.

Text box 1.
Morbidity coding rules

Morbidity rule 1 (MB1): Several conditions recorded as the "main condition". Select the "main condition" for which the patient received care. Extension codes may be used to indicate different types of main condition (eg, reason for admission or main resource condition). In cases where the main condition cannot be determined based on documentation, select the condition that is mentioned first.
Morbidity rule 2 (MB2): Condition recorded as "main condition" is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition. If a symptom or sign (ICD-11 chapter 21) or a problem (ICD-11 chapter 24) is recorded as the "main condition", and this is obviously a sign, symptom, or problem of a diagnosed condition coded elsewhere, and care was given to the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the "main condition".
Morbidity rule 3 (MB3): Signs and symptoms. When a symptom or sign is documented as the "main condition", and it is documented that it could be caused by either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as "main condition".

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^112PzvHP]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

The participating pain specialists perceived the clinical utility of the new classification as high and agreed with the utility judgements obtained in the formative field testing.

The participants also indicated that the ICD-11 classification of chronic pain offers a good coverage of chronic pain syndromes, again corroborating the results from the informal field testing. The majority believed the level of detail to be appropriate and reported few gaps and very few redundancies. The main areas in which a need for more detailed diagnoses was perceived were chronic neuropathic pain and chronic postsurgical or posttraumatic pain. Here, the frozen version meant that the coding reached only down to the levels of chronic postsurgical or posttraumatic pain, or chronic central or chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. This does not reflect the classification, but the granularity of the frozen version. At present, this is still the level to which the codes of the classification are visible in the ICD-11, although the level below, allowing for the relevant detail, has been included as index terms ("inclusion terms") and has been assigned uniform resource identifiers.

To sum up, the field test demonstrated that the classification of chronic pain in the ICD-11 improves clinical utility and thus fulfills a central aim of the ICD revision process,: The ICD-11 was easier to use and less ambiguous than the ICD-10 and reflected all relevant categories of chronic pain without redundancy. The descriptions in the foundation were published in a series of articles (for review see) meeting the WHO's aim of scientific evidence for the diagnoses entered. This predicts that not only in the field of pain medicine but also for chronic pain cases in primary care the ICD-11 will be easy to implement in clinical practice. Codes were easier to find in the ICD-11 browser than the ICD-10 browser. The excellent mapping of chronic pain syndromes onto clinically meaningful codes will improve the healthcare statistics and epidemiological studies and contribute to an improved visibility of chronic pain. This, in turn is expected to lead to research programs and advances in access to treatment benefitting millions of patients with chronic pain.

### Assessing the uniformity of uveitis clinical concepts and associated ICD-10 codes across health care systems sharing the same electronic health records system [^1157Fecg]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Big data studies may allow for the aggregation of patients with rare diseases such as uveitis to answer important clinical questions. Standardization of uveitis-related variables will be necessary, including the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes used to identify patients of interest. There are currently limited data on the uniformity of diagnosis mapping to ICD-10 codes for uveitis diagnoses among different health systems.

Objective

To assess the degree of uniformity in mapping of uveitis clinical concepts to ICD-10 codes across health care systems using the same electronic health record (EHR) system.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter survey study was conducted between September 14 and October 9, 2020, at 5 academic health care systems that use the Epic EHR. Researchers from the University of Washington, Harvard University, Stanford University, Yale University, and the University of California, San Francisco queried 54 uveitis-related diagnostic terms and recorded the associated ICD-10 codes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The degree of uniformity for uveitis clinical concepts and associated ICD-10 codes.

Results

Fifty-four uveitis-related diagnostic terms were queried within the Epic EHR at 5 different health care systems. There was perfect agreement among all 5 centers for 52 of the 54 diagnostic terms. Two diagnostic terms had differences in ICD-10 coding: juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated chronic uveitis and intermediate uveitis. Intermediate uveitis was associated with codes H20.1x (ICD-10 description: chronic iridocyclitis) or H20.9 (ICD-10 description: unspecified iridocyclitis) in 3 centers while being associated with code H30.2x (ICD-10 description: posterior cyclitis) at the 2 remaining centers. The discrepancies appear to be related to a recent update in diagnostic mapping in the Epic EHR.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that ICD-10 code mapping to uveitis diagnostic terminology appears to be highly uniform at different centers with the Epic EHR. However, temporal changes in diagnosis mapping to ICD-10 codes and a lack of 1-to-1 mapping of diagnosis to ICD-10 code add additional sources of complexity to the interpretation of big data studies in uveitis.

### Approach to diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of generalized and nonlocal dysesthesia: a review [^115u8o9q]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dysesthesia is an abnormal sensation in the skin that occurs in the absence of any extraordinary stimulus or other primary cutaneous disorders, excluding any delusions or tactile hallucinations. Clinicians have characterized dysesthesias to include sensations such as burning, tingling, pruritus, allodynia, hyperesthesia, or anesthesia. The etiology and pathogenesis of various generalized dysesthesias is largely unknown, though many dysesthesias have been associated with systemic pathologies including malignancy, infection, autoimmune disorders, and neuropathies. Dermatologists are often the first-line clinicians for patients presenting with such cutaneous findings, thus it is crucial for these physicians to be able to methodically work-up generalized dysesthesias to build a working differential diagnosis, follow up with key labs and/or imaging, and offer patients evidence-based treatment to relieve their symptoms. This broad literature review is an attempt to centralize key studies, cases, and series to help guide dermatologists in their assessment and evaluation of complaints of abnormal cutaneous sensations.

Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

Diagnoses

Between the baseline and post-acute phases, the frequency of individual ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes increased within several chapters (Fig. 2). The greatest percentage increase was observed in the ICD-10 chapter of "diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism" (+ 16.3%), followed by "diseases of the nervous system" (+ 11.1%), "external causes of morbidity and mortality" (+ 7.9%), and "mental and behavioral disorders" (+ 7.7%).

Fig. 2
Percentage change from baseline to post-acute phase in ICD-10 diagnoses in the overall population (N = 19,558). Diagnosis codes (shown in parentheses) include those with a prevalence of ≥ 2% in the baseline population and with an increase from baseline to post-acute phases. Code ranges, raw values at baseline and post-acute phases, and diagnoses decreasing from baseline to post-acute phases are shown in Table 3. ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision

Frequencies of other disorders increased more modestly or decreased (Table 3); the greatest percentage decrease was observed in the chapter of "diseases of the respiratory system" (–18.3%). Within this chapter, the decrease was driven specifically by a drop in frequency of the subchapters acute upper and lower respiratory infections (–56.6% and –69.3%, respectively), which outweighed increases in frequency of other respiratory conditions, such as "other respiratory diseases principally affecting the interstitium" (+ 59.8%; Table S 2 and Fig. S 1).

Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Level of injury (1)

Similarly, inference about level of injury can be extrapolated from the ICD-10 descriptor "tetraplegia or paraplegia unspecified" but this controlled vocabulary cannot distinguish aetiology (e.g. SCI from SCD). Thus, we report that it is not reasonable to derive a definitive SCI/D aetiology or assign an injury level from this single ICD-10-AM 7th EDN code. For reasons involving false positives or false negatives, this filter was rejected and is omitted from Fig. 1.

Systematic search strategy

To reduce the assumptions introduced by single filters or NLM search terms, we next referenced aggregated ICD-10 codes to the consensus taxonomies of SCD and the ISNCSCI standard.

Level of injury (2)

A Windows Excel find function search for all descriptors containing the NLM terms "paraplegia" or "tetraplegia" or " cauda equina syndrome" yielded a definitive cohort of 140 (28%) cases (Fig. 3). In rank order, a principal diagnosis of "Other paralytic syndromes: Cauda equina syndrome" (50 cases; 9.9%) was the most common followed by "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Tetraplegia, unspecified" (36 cases; 7.1%) and "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Paraplegia, unspecified" (34 cases; 6.7%). From this we surmise that when referenced to ICD-10 standards and the controlled NLM vocabulary, an agnostic systematic search strategy can provide some information of relevance to health service planning about level of injury (constrained to 3 categories); with the caveat that it is not possible to rule out false positives/ negatives or achieve a precise SCI/D taxonomic classification.

### Chronic pain as a symptom or a disease: the IASP classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^11689P8b]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is a major source of suffering. It interferes with daily functioning and often is accompanied by distress. Yet, in the International Classification of Diseases, chronic pain diagnoses are not represented systematically. The lack of appropriate codes renders accurate epidemiological investigations difficult and impedes health policy decisions regarding chronic pain such as adequate financing of access to multimodal pain management. In cooperation with the WHO, an IASP Working Group has developed a classification system that is applicable in a wide range of contexts, including pain medicine, primary care, and low-resource environments. Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months. In chronic pain syndromes, pain can be the sole or a leading complaint and requires special treatment and care. In conditions such as fibromyalgia or nonspecific low-back pain, chronic pain may be conceived as a disease in its own right; in our proposal, we call this subgroup "chronic primary pain". In 6 other subgroups, pain is secondary to an underlying disease: chronic cancer-related pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic secondary visceral pain, chronic posttraumatic and postsurgical pain, chronic secondary headache and orofacial pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain. These conditions are summarized as "chronic secondary pain" where pain may at least initially be conceived as a symptom. Implementation of these codes in the upcoming 11th edition of International Classification of Diseases will lead to improved classification and diagnostic coding, thereby advancing the recognition of chronic pain as a health condition in its own right.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112VmNkr]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^111RjxMu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Medication-overuse headache — description, diagnostic criteria, and coding guidance are as follows: Headache occurring on 15 or more days/month in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache and developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more or 15 or more days/month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months, and it usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped. Diagnostic criteria specify A. Headache occurring on ≥ 15-days/month in a patient with a pre-existing headache disorder; B. Regular overuse for > 3-months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or symptomatic treatment of headache; and C. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Patients who meet criteria for both 1.3 Chronic migraine and 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be given both diagnoses. Previously used terms include: Rebound headache, medication-misuse headache, drug-induced headache. Coding notes state patients should be coded for one or more subtypes of 8.2 Medication-overuse headache according to the specific medication(s) overused, with examples including receiving both 8.2.2 Triptan-overuse headache and a subform of 8.2.3 Non-opioid analgesic-overuse headache, except when combination-analgesic medications are overused, who are coded 8.2.5 Combination-analgesic-overuse headache and not according to each constituent; patients using multiple drugs without any single drug overused should be coded 8.2.6 Medication-overuse headache attributed to multiple drug classes not individually overused; and those clearly overusing multiple drugs but unable to specify names/quantities are coded 8.2.7 Medication-overuse headache attributed to unspecified or unverified overuse of multiple drug classes, and in almost all cases, this necessitates diary follow-up.

### How accurate is ICD-10 coding for revision total knee arthroplasty? [^1163Q6HY]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) came into effect in October 2015. The new procedural codes (ICD-10-PCS) were designed to specify granular aspects of the procedure, including laterality and revised components. This specificity could improve data collection in institutional databases, large registries, and administrative claims data. Given these possible applications, this study's purpose was to assess the accuracy of ICD-10-PCS coding for revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA).

Methods

This multicenter retrospective analysis utilized the rTKA databases at four academic medical centers for all aseptic rTKAs between October 1, 2015 and July 3, 2019. Operative reports were reviewed to determine laterality and revised components (tibial, femoral, liner, and patellar component), which were then compared with the ICD-10-PCS codes associated with the billing records. Proper coding required both component removal and replacement codes. The correct series of removal and replacement codes was determined using the American Joint Replacement Registry's guidelines.

Results

In total, 1906 rTKAs were examined, and 98.0% had at least one proper ICD-10-PCS code, indicating an rTKA had occurred. Coding for components replaced was correct in 76.3% of cases. When examining both removal and replacement codes, accuracy dropped to 57.0%.

Conclusion

Nearly 25% of rTKA procedures were incorrectly coded for replaced components, and over 40% were incorrectly coded for removed and replaced components. ICD-10-PCS codes can accurately identify that an rTKA has occurred; however, the inaccuracy in identifying which specific components were revised should prompt further evaluation of the coding process before utilizing ICD-10-PCS codes to report granular rTKA data.

Emerging technology, evidence gaps, and future directions — definition, classification, and epidemiology: The writing committee created a list of key areas in which knowledge gaps are present in the evaluation and management of patients presenting with syncope. Reported incidence and prevalence of syncope vary significantly because of several confounders, including variable definitions for syncope versus transient loss of consciousness, different populations, different clinical settings, and different study methodologies. The definition and classification of syncope provided in this document will set the standard for future research, and standardized national registries and large sample databases are needed to gather data on a continuous basis to understand the true incidence and prevalence of syncope, understand patient risk, inform driving policies, improve patient outcomes, and improve and streamline health service delivery.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^112dTi7a]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^116vS4H9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Chronic migraine — diagnostic notes state that characterization of frequently recurring headache generally requires a headache diary to record information on pain and associated symptoms day-by-day for at least one month; when criteria A-C are fulfilled by headache that is daily and unremitting from < 24 hours after its first onset, code as 4.10 New daily persistent headache, and when the manner of onset is not remembered or is otherwise uncertain, code as 1.3 Chronic migraine; the most common cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse, and patients meeting criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine and for 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be coded for both, with around 50% of patients apparently with 1.3 Chronic migraine reverting to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; because tension-type-like headache is within the diagnostic criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine, the diagnosis excludes the diagnosis of 2. Tension-type headache or its types.

### The valencia consensus-based adaptation of the IASP complex regional pain syndrome diagnostic criteria [^112nUyZy]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Changes concern 3 areas: (a) diagnostic parenting under ICD-11, (b) CRPS subtypes, and (c) the diagnostic procedure.
(a) Diagnostic parenting under ICD-11: The current first parent classification of CRPS in the ICD-11 is "focal or segmental autonomic disorder" (ICD-11 BD8A). We consider this classification to be a mistake based on the historic misunderstanding of CRPS as primarily an autonomic disorder. The past 3 decades of CRPS experimental and clinical research clearly demonstrate that this is not the case. We therefore have proposed that the correct parent is "chronic primary pain". This proposal is also supported by the American Autonomic Society.
(b) CRPS subtypes: (i) CRPS II as defined in the IASP criteria is associated with discrete peripheral nerve damage as indicated by neurological examination, electrodiagnostic testing, or other quasi-objective testing. We now clarify that the diagnostic signs of CRPS II must extend beyond any identified injured nerve territory. Nerve lesion itself may cause separate CRPS-concomitant symptoms and signs, including neuropathic pain, paraesthesias, numbness, and autonomic dysfunction restricted to the injured nerve territory. CRPS II should therefore not be classed as a neuropathic pain condition in accordance with current criteria #. Diagnostic signs of CRPS I (without discrete nerve damage) and II are identical. The clinical relevance and implications of subgrouping CRPS into these 2 subtypes remain unclear at present.# (ii) We have introduced a third CRPS subtype and have also modified the description of the current diagnostic label CRPS Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) to minimise any confusion with using this latter term. Patients previously documented as having fully met CRPS criteria (either CRPS I or CRPS II, Table 1) but who currently display CRPS features insufficient to fully meet the diagnostic criteria should be classified into the new CRPS subtype, " CRPS with Remission of Some Features". These patients should not be classified as having CRPS NOS. Notably, a reduction in the number of CRPS diagnostic signs and symptoms does not necessarily constitute an improvement in the lived experience of CRPS; these patients may not have improved pain nor are they usually free of all CRPS-related signs and symptoms. CRPS with Remission of Some Features is a third formal subtype of CRPS, which by necessity overlaps with either CRPS I or II. At what point CRPS changes from being an ongoing condition potentially requiring continued clinical management (ie, CRPS with Remission of Some Features) to being considered resolved is a topic that will need to be addressed in future research. (iii) The term "CRPS-NOS" in the current IASP criteria has been retained exclusively for application to patients who have never been documented to fulfil the new IASP CRPS criteria (Table 1). That is, they now display some but not all features of CRPS required for formal diagnosis, and no other diagnosis better explains the clinical features. (iv) Warm/cold CRPS and early/persistent CRPS are overlapping presentations that are clinically observed. The group did not consider there to be sufficient evidence yet to create formal CRPS subgroups according to these features. However, there was consensus that research and clinical reports should include this information when describing individual patients, study inclusion criteria, or research participants (clinical experience and research suggest that a substantial proportion of individuals who develop acute CRPS improve or resolve, with a smaller subgroup that fails to substantially improve even with standard care. This transition of CRPS to a more prolonged and difficult to manage condition seems to occur during the first 12–18 months after onset, although there is no widely accepted demarcation point for this distinction. The word "persistent" is used here as a descriptive term for this subgroup of prolonged and intractable CRPS. Use of the alternative term "chronic" is preferred by some CRPS experts. However, we note that the term "chronic" is also broadly used across all pain conditions to refer to pain lasting more than 3 months after tissue injury to distinguish it from "acute" pain. To avoid incorrect implications of the word 'chronic' to be understood as a > 3 months' pain duration in patients with CRPS, the word "persistent" is used to refer to such prolonged CRPS. For clarity, 'persistent' does not necessarily indicate the condition will persist indefinitely — a minority of patients with persistent CRPS will naturally improve).#
(c) The diagnostic procedure ICD-11 includes additional text to clarify diagnostic terms and procedures. The purpose of that text, pragmatic clarification of the diagnostic process, bears resemblance to that of the IASP taxonomy and associated text, which is not currently being updated. This ICD-11 supplemental text has now been updated for CRPS. The following key points are now all implemented (except viii): (i) All patients should be asked systematically about all symptoms listed in the criteria at each formal diagnostic evaluation, even if they have not previously reported certain symptoms. This is recommended because CRPS signs and symptoms are clinically observed to fluctuate over time.# (ii) Clarification of the terms "asymmetry" and "changes" as used in the current IASP CRPS criteria (Table 1): For unilateral CRPS, assess asymmetry by comparing the affected side to the unaffected side. For (much rarer) bilateral and symmetrical CRPS, assess changes in the affected limbs relative to an unaffected limb in the patient or to the limbs of a typical healthy individual. Asymmetry is based on clinical judgment only, rather than any prespecified criteria.# (iii) For evaluating possible spreading of CRPS beyond a single limb, the full diagnostic criteria must be applied to each limb individually. True spreading of CRPS is defined as CRPS that meets full new IASP/ICD-11 diagnostic criteria (Table 1) for multiple limbs — extension of pain alone to other limbs, which is not unusual, in the absence of other CRPS features is not formally considered to be spreading CRPS.# (iv) Hyperalgesia (note that other definitions of hyperalgesia and allodynia exist for use in other chronic pain conditions)is a clinical observation in which a painful stimulus evokes more pain than it normally would. The group recommended standard testing for hyperalgesia by comparing the response to a single pinprick applied in the center of the most affected region to the response to an identical pinprick at the corresponding location on the unaffected limb, or an equivalent control site in the case of bilateral CRPS. The test is positive if reported pain is more intense or lasts longer on the affected limb.# (v) Allodynia is a clinical observation in which pain is evoked by a stimulus that is not normally painful. Stimuli used in clinical allodynia assessment can include light touch, vibration, cool or warm temperature, deep tissue or joint pressure in the affected area, or joint movement. Only one of these is required to confirm whether allodynia is present or absent. Suggested clinical assessment procedures are now outlined as below in the revised text: " allodynia to light touch as tested by light manual touch (or brush); allodynia to tissue pressure as assessed by pressure applied to a joint or other tissue using the evaluator's finger with just enough pressure to make the fingernail bed of the evaluator blanch (turn white) (equating to a pressure of below 100g/cm², and a load of no more than 500 g; this is substantially less than the pressure recommended for the examination of tender points [4 kg/cm²]), allodynia to vibration as assessed using a graded tuning fork over bony prominence on the affected limb; allodynia to cool or warm temperature".# (vi) Temperature asymmetry is assessed in the affected area and compared with the corresponding area on the contralateral extremity, or a suitable control site in the case of bilateral CRPS. Such asymmetry should be obvious to the touch of the dorsum of the hand of the examiner.# (vii) Obvious color asymmetry of a regional nature (ie, hand, foot, knee, or larger region). Please specify the nature of the color changes, eg, red, blue, pale, or mottled.# (viii) A rare limitation of the CRPS diagnostic criteria is noted: In some cases, an objective CRPS diagnostic sign such as color or temperature asymmetry may be observed by the examiner without the patient reporting the corresponding subjective symptom. This may occur, for example, because the patient cannot feel a temperature change, or a color change is difficult to see (this similarly applies to swelling). This situation may result in a patient's diagnostic symptom-category count dropping below the threshold of 3 required for formal diagnosis, despite the patient objectively displaying sufficient clinical features for diagnosis. In these instances, because of the statistical methods on which the IASP criteria were developed and validated, the obvious common-sense approach that 'signs override symptoms' (ie, a sign automatically generates a tick also as a symptom) cannot automatically apply. A related challenge arises also where a patient has impaired vision and is therefore unable to ascertain objective color changes; in these rare cases, a pragmatic solution must be found in which common sense prevails.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^112P9eXD]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

3.2.1.2. Radicular pain without radiculopathy

Radicular pain is likely associated with hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges of dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. The hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges may be due to inflammatory irritation, ischaemia, or mechanical deformation of neural structures or a combination of these and their downstream mechanisms (eg, inflammation).

The pain may be described as shocking, lancinating, electric, stabbing, or shooting and is often accompanied by a dull background ache. We have further added sharp and burning as potential pain descriptors as these are frequently reported by patients with lumbar radicular pain. With radicular pain, the pain may be spontaneous or evoked, for instance, by certain movements of the spine or leg. In addition to pain, patients may experience paraesthesia and dysaesthesia such as tingling, a "woolen feeling", or "a block of ice".

The pain can be felt deep or cutaneous and may radiate into the leg in areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes. The working group further agreed to remove the original description of "band-like" location of the pain, which seemed sufficiently covered by "areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes".

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^113FDxNv]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Citalopram hydrobromide (citalopram) [^1129qfUY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Citalopram Hydrobromide

Following is a list of WHO terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by patients treated with citalopram at multiple doses in a range of 10 to 80 mg/day during any phase of a trial within the premarketing database of 4422 patients. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and those occurring in only one patient. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with citalopram, they were not necessarily caused by it.

Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^116ZACgr]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Others have similarly developed ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices developed during the ICD-9-CM era. Quan et al. constructed ICD-10-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities using Canadian administrative data. They found the frequency of most comorbidities to be similar between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding algorithms and the ICD-10-CM code set to either match or outperform the ICD-9-CM versions in predicting in-hospital mortality. As in our study, peptic ulcer disease was a condition that differed in frequency between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. Glasheen et al. have since updated the ICD-10-CM coding for the Charlson Comorbidity Index, validating the predictive performance of ICD-10-CM codes for hospital admission and mortality. Sears and Rundell developed updated ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM code lists for the Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI), assessing concordance before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM. The frequency of individual comorbidities was consistent between coding algorithms for thirteen of eighteen comorbidities. While the Functional Comorbidity Index retained predictive value for hospital length of stay with ICD-10-CM codes, there was an interaction between the index and coding algorithm suggesting modest reduced performance with ICD-10-CM codes. Our findings are in agreement with these studies; appropriate ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices can have concordance with ICD-9-CM versions and retain predictive value for health outcomes.

Comorbidity burden is a crucial determinant of long-term outcomes that include mortality and functional status among people with rheumatic diseases (,–). Thus, we tested the validity of the ICD-10-CM codes by assessing the predictive ability of the RDCI score for mortality and functional status. As expected, higher RDCI scores, indicating a greater comorbidity burden, were associated with higher mortality risk and poorer functional status during follow-up in both the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts. Moreover, metrics of overall model performance (AIC, QICu) for predicting these same outcomes in each cohort also showed substantial improvement when the RDCI was included. Together, these findings demonstrate that the RDCI calculated with the proposed ICD-10-CM codes maintains expected predictive value for key long-term outcomes.

### Survival strategies for tsunami of ICD-10-CM for interventionalists: pursue or perish! [^117Bg7Cb]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The unfunded mandate for the implementation of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is scheduled October 1, 2015. The development of ICD-10-CM has been a complicated process. We have endeavored to keep Interventional Pain Management doctors apprised via a variety of related topical manuscripts. The major issues relate to the lack of formal physician participation in its preparation. While the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) as active partners in its preparation. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are major players; 3M and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are also involved. The cost of ICD-10-CM implementation is high, similar to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), likely consuming substantial resources. While ICD-10, utilized worldwide, includes 14,400 different codes, ICD-10-CM, specific for the United States, has expanded to 144,000 codes, which also includes procedural coding system. It is imperative for physicians to prepare for the mandatory implementation. Conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding in interventional pain management is not a conversion of one to one that can be easily obtained from software packages. It is a both a difficult and time-consuming task with each physician, early on, expected to spend on estimation at least 10 minutes per visit on extra coding for established and new patients. For interventional pain physicians, there have been a multitude of changes, including creation of new codes and confusing conversion of existing codes. This manuscript describes a variety of codes that are relevant to interventional pain physicians and often utilized in daily practices. It is our objective that this manuscript will provide coding assistance to interventional pain physicians.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^112kisfo]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^115iziUA]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.2. Case coding

The case coding examined the ICD-11 alone. The main objective was testing the morbidity rule application concerning the chronic pain diagnoses. For this purpose, 12 short case vignettes (mean length = 78 words, range: 50–113 words) were prepared. Each vignette featured 2 or more health conditions, at least one of which was a chronic pain condition. The vignette stated a main condition and an "other condition", without listing the ICD-11 codes. (Table 1, vignette texts, cf supplementary information S2, available at).

Table 1
Chronic pain and other conditions featured in the vignettes in the case coding.

In 10 of the vignettes, the main condition was specified correctly according to the morbidity rules; in 2 of the vignettes, the rules had been misapplied intentionally to test the participants' application of the rules in connection with chronic pain. In a first step, the participants had to provide the appropriate ICD-11 codes for each condition. In a second step, they had to judge whether the main condition was identified correctly (yes or no). For each diagnosis, we recorded whether they met with any difficulty in finding the code. At the end of each vignette, the participants rated the clinical utility of the new chronic pain code (0 = not at all to 5 = very useful) according to 3 questions: How useful is this classification (1) to describe this case in communications to colleagues (communication), (2) in facilitating the management of patients (management), and (3) for the collection of data, eg, for clinical or population databases (documentation)?

2.2.3. General evaluation

After the participant had completed rating the lines or cases, an additional questionnaire became available in which the participant rated the overall coverage of the conditions in the ICD-11 (5 = very good or 1 = very poor), the level of detail (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed), and the ease of use (5 = very easy or 1 = very difficult). In addition, textboxes were provided for the participants to mention whether they perceived gaps and redundancies.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^115Tdgti]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervicogenic headache in chronic cervical zygapophyseal joint pain — sensory processing differences — are characterized by lateralized pressure hyperalgesia and thermal hyperesthesia on the painful side. There were differences in sensory processing between chronic cervical zygapophyseal joint pain patients with and without cervicogenic headache; the main difference was lateralization of pressure hyperalgesia to the painful side of the head of the headache patients, accompanied by cold as well as warm relative hyperesthesia on the painful side of the head and neck; these results suggested that neuraxial spread of central sensitization was probably linked to the trigeminal spinal nucleus.

### The inaccuracy of ICD-10 coding in revision total hip arthroplasty and its implication on revision data [^111k6DjF]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), was adopted by the United States on October 1, 2015 and expanded coding from 3800 codes with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, procedure code system (ICD-9-PCS) to 73,000. The increase in number of codes was designed to create more accurate representations of procedures like revision total hip arthroplasties (rTHAs). However, many worry that the increased complexity leads to more inaccurate coding. The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of ICD-10-PCS coding for rTHA and discuss the implications on registry data.

Methods

The rTHA databases at 2 large, academic medical centers were retrospectively reviewed for all rTHAs between October 1, 2015 and July 3, 2019. The laterality and specific revised components were recorded and compared with the ICD-10-PCS codes used for each procedure. The accuracy of ICD-10-PCS codes relative to the surgical record was determined using coding guidelines published by the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR).

Results

Overall, 895 cases were reviewed. Replacement coding was 22% accurate (195 of 895). For removal and replacement coding, accuracy dropped to 17% (152 of 895). All procedures had at least 1 rTHA trigger code that would signify correctly to AJRR that an rTHA occurred.

Conclusion

In this study, the percent of correctly coded rTHA was low. All rTHA procedures had at least 1 AJRR trigger code; therefore, an rTHA would have been appropriately captured by AJRR. But these inaccuracies should make one pause when using ICD-10-PCS procedural data to try to evaluate specific rTHA details from administrative claims databases and ward against expanding ICD-10-PCS as a means to collect implant survival and registry data.

### Symptoms prior to diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in individuals younger than 18 years [^113sirEh]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

ICD-10-GM Codes Before a First MS Diagnosis or Demyelinating Event

Of the 163 ICD-10-GM codes assessed, 96 (58.9%) were present more frequently among children and adolescents with MS in the 5 years before the MS diagnosis than among controls at the significance level of 5%. After adjustment for multiple testing, the difference in frequency of 35 of those codes (36.4%) remained statistically significant (Figure 2 and eTable 3 in Supplement 1). The codes comprised various diseases, including infectious diseases and diseases of the eye, respiratory system, digestive system, and musculoskeletal system as well as various other symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings. The prevalence of these diagnoses in the control group ranged from 0.5% (disturbances of skin sensation [ICD-10-GM code R20]) to 53.7% (acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and unspecified sites [code J06]). In a multivariable model including all 35 codes plus sex and age, 9 of the disease codes (25.7%) remained associated with a later MS diagnosis (Figure 3 and eTable 3 in Supplement 1). These codes were for obesity (E66) (adjusted OR [AOR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.42–2.02); 2 eye disorders, including disorders of refraction and accommodation (H52) (AOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09–1.47) and visual disturbances (H53) (AOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10–1.55); 1 gastrointestinal disorder (gastritis and duodenitis [K29]) (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.08–1.70); 1 musculoskeletal disorder (disorders of patella [M22]) (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13–1.90); and 4 codes from the ICD-10-GM classification "symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified", including abnormalities of heartbeat (R00) (AOR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.27–2.96), flatulence and related conditions (R14) (AOR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01–2.01), disturbances of skin sensation (R20) (AOR, 12.93; 95% CI, 8.98–18.62), and dizziness and giddiness (R42) (AOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.22–1.89) (Figure 3 and eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Of these, 4 disorders (44.4%) were still significantly associated with a later MS diagnosis when comparing children and adolescents with MS with those with JIA: obesity (AOR, 3.19; 95% CI, 2.03–5.02), disorders of refraction and accommodation (AOR, 3.08; 95% CI, 2.33–4.08), visual disturbances (AOR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.13–2.33), and disturbances of skin sensation (AOR, 27.70; 95% CI, 6.52–117.64) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Children and adolescents with 1 of 3 musculoskeletal diagnoses — other joint disorders (M25), other soft-tissue disorders (M79), and biomechanical lesions (M99) — were less likely to be diagnosed with MS compared with children and adolescents with JIA.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^115F1FbU]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

ICD-10 Classification Process

We extracted all ICD-10 codes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 testing visit for each patient by matching visit numbers. Codes specific for the outcomes (R50* for fever, R05* for cough, and R06.0* for dyspnea) were selected on the basis of the specifications suggested by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. The asterisk (*) denotes that any code starting with the specified alphanumeric sequence would be included (ie, R06.03 is included for cough). Using this approach, the following codes were present in our data: R50.9, R50.81, R05, R06.02, R06.00, R06.03, and R06.09. Patients with at least 1 code in a given category were classified as having the symptom according to ICD-10 code.

### The invisible cost of pain management by the current international classification of diseases coding system: a study in a tertiary care inpatient setting [^1145e6mj]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is applied worldwide for public health data collection among other use cases. However, the current version of the ICD (ICD-10), to which the reimbursement system is linked in many countries, does not represent chronic pain properly. This study aims to compare the ICD-10 with the ICD-11 in hospitalized patients in terms of specificity, clinical utility, and reimbursement for pain management. The medical records of hospitalized patients consulted for pain management at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand, were reviewed, and all pain-related diagnoses were coded into ICD-10 and ICD-11. The data of 397 patients showed unspecified pain was coded 78% in the ICD-10 and only 0.5% in the ICD-11 version. The difference gap in the proportion of unspecified pain between the 2 versions is wider than in the outpatient setting. The 3 most common codes for ICD-10 were other chronic pain, low back pain, and pain in limb. The 3 most common codes for ICD-11 were chronic cancer pain, chronic peripheral neuropathic pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain. As in many other countries, no pain-related ICD-10 codes were coded for routine reimbursement. The simulated reimbursement fee remained the same when adding 397 pain-related codings, even if the cost of pain management, such as cost of labor, existed. Compared with the ICD-10 version, the ICD-11 is more specific and makes pain diagnoses more visible. Thus, shifting from ICD-10 to ICD-11 has the potential to improve both the quality of care and the reimbursement for pain management.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^113coEMA]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Because chronic pain has been poorly represented in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) despite its significant contribution to the burden of disease worldwide, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) developed a classification of chronic pain that was included in the ICD-11 version as "MG30" and approved by the World Health Assembly in 2019. The objective of this field test was to determine how well the classification of chronic pain works in the context of the ICD-11. A web-based survey using the WHO-FiT platform recruited 177 healthcare professionals from all WHO regions. After a training on coding chronic pain hosted by the IASP Web site, participants evaluated 18 diagnostic codes (lines) of the 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 and 12 vignettes (cases) describing chronic pain conditions. Correctness, ambiguity, and perceived difficulty of the coding were compared between the ICD-11 and the ICD-10 and the applicability of the morbidity rules for the ICD-11 verified. In the line coding, 43.0% of correct chronic pain diagnoses assigned with the ICD-10 contrasted with 63.2% with the ICD-11. Especially in cases in which the chronic pain is regarded as the symptom of an underlying disease, the ICD-11 (63.5%) commanded more correct diagnoses than the ICD-10 (26.8%). The case coding was on average 83.9% accurate, only in 1.6% of cases any difficulty was perceived. The morbidity rules were applied correctly in 74.1% of cases. From a coding perspective, the ICD-11 is superior to the ICD-10 in every respect, offering better accuracy, difficulty, and ambiguity in coding chronic pain conditions.

### Hospital costs in relation to body-mass index in 1. 1 million women in england: a prospective cohort study [^113jLcnZ]. The Lancet: Public Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Costs of hospital inpatient and day-case care

Each HES episode (defined as care under a particular consultant) was allocated to a health-care resource group, the classification system used to describe hospital activity in the UK. The associated costs depend primarily on any procedures done, diagnoses, hospital admission type (day-case, elective, or non-elective inpatient care), length of stay (when it exceeds a threshold specific to the health-care resource group and admission type), and patient characteristics such as age, and were calculated with 2011–12 NHS reference costs. We calculated the cost of each hospital admission (in UK 2012 prices) as the sum of the costs of all episodes within the admission. Episodes were regarded as part of the same admission if they had the same admission date, had overlapping durations, or if the admission date for one episode was the same as the discharge date for another. The costs do not include outpatient attendances or costs for prescription drugs individuals were taking outside of their hospital stay.

Categories of health conditions

Each hospital admission was allocated to an ICD-10 chapter on the basis of the recorded primary diagnosis of the admission episode. ICD-10 chapters with less than 10 000 hospital admissions during the follow-up period were combined into a category called other. ICD-10 chapter XIX (injury, poisoning, and some other consequences of external causes) was subdivided into fractures (ICD-10: S02, S12, S22, S32, S42, S52, S62, S72, S82, S92, T02), medical and surgical complications (ICD-10: T80–T88), and the remainder, which was incorporated into the existing other category. ICD-10 chapter XIII (musculoskeletal conditions) was subdivided for some analyses into arthropathies (ICD-10: M00–M25), dorsopathies (ICD-10: M40–M54), soft tissue disorders (ICD-10: M60–M79), and the remainder. Arthropathies were further subdivided into knee replacements (ICD-10: M17) and hip replacements (ICD-10: M16), identified using ICD-10 and OPCS code combinations specified by the National Joint Registry; other arthrosis (ICD-10: M15–M19 excluding knee and hip replacements with arthrosis); rheumatoid arthritis (ICD-10: M05–M06); and other arthropathies.

### Evaluation of the ICD-10 system in coding revascularisation procedures in patients with peripheral arterial disease in england: a retrospective cohort study using national administrative and clinical databases [^116qHVHz]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common progressive condition characterised by reduced blood flow to the lower limbs. Patients may present with varying degrees of severity, from pain during walking (intermittent claudication), to pain at rest. The most severe form of the disease is called chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) and is characterised by pain at rest and/or tissue loss on the leg and foot, in the form of ulcers or gangrene. Treatment options for PAD depend upon the stage of the disease, with early forms often responding to medical management. More severe disease typically requires revascularisation, performed with endovascular procedures (angioplasty and stent), open surgical operations (endarterectomy and bypass) or a combination of the two modalities.

Data about the care received by patients with PAD are available within the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care (APC) database, an administrative database that contains information about all admissions to National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England.HES has been used by various studies to evaluate patterns of care for patients with PAD who undergo revascularisation, such as time to surgeryand postoperative outcomes. A benefit of HES is its comprehensive coverage and its linkage with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) death registry. However, the standard version of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10)used by HES does not currently have specific diagnostic codes for the various stages of PAD. This raises the possibility of misclassification bias affecting studies that only use HES data, particularly when they focus on particular subgroups like patients with CLTI, because there is a risk that diagnostic codes are being used inconsistently by different hospitals for the same stage of disease.

Information about revascularisation procedures performed in NHS hospitals in England is also collected in the National Vascular Registry (NVR), a national clinical audit commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) on behalf of NHS England. Data include patient demographics, comorbidities, indication for intervention, procedural details and selected postoperative outcomes. Its bespoke dataset includes the Fontaine stage, which is used to distinguish between stages of PAD, with stage III defined as nocturnal/rest pain and IV (necrosis/gangrene) indicating tissue loss.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement of diagnostic details between the National Vascular Registry and Hospital Episode Statistics in records of patients with PAD having revascularisation, and explore which ICD-10 codes are used for the different types of PAD.

### Persistent postsurgical pain in a general population: prevalence and predictors in the troms ø study [^116nnrF8]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

Population-based data on the prevalence of persistent postsurgical pain are scarce. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of persistent postsurgical pain in a general population and to describe associated physical, social, and psychological factors, including symptoms of nerve injury and sensitization. A cross-sectional survey was performed in northern Norway with questionnaire items covering surgery, pain, and sensory abnormalities in the area of surgery. Of the 12,982 participants, 24.0% (3111) had undergone one or more surgical procedures during the 3 years preceding the survey. Of these, 2043 had the surgery performed more than 3 months before the investigation. Persistent pain in the area of surgery was reported by 40.4% of the patients (826 of 2043), moderate or severe pain by 18.3% (373 of 2043). Hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, or both was reported by 24.5% (501 of 2043). There were strong associations between sensory abnormalities and persistent pain, increasingly with higher pain intensities; odds ratios were 2.68 for hypoesthesia and 6.27 for hyperesthesia. Of the 826 individuals reporting persistent pain in the anatomical area of surgery, 51.0% reported chronic pain when questioned without specific reference to the surgery. The present study supports evidence from clinical studies of persistent postsurgical pain, indicating a high prevalence, but reveals large discrepancies in report of pain, depending on the questions asked and the context in which the questions are presented. Strong associations between sensory abnormalities and pain indicate neuropathic mechanisms in a major proportion of cases.
