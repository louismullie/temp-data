## Question

can empagliflozin decrease GFR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether empagliflozin can decrease GFR. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between an acute, hemodynamic change in GFR versus chronic kidney function decline. Then, I should verify the magnitude and timing of any initial eGFR dip after starting empagliflozin. Next, I will examine the long-term slope of eGFR decline and whether empagliflozin slows CKD progression. After that, I need to check mechanistic explanations and whether the acute change is reversible. Finally, I should confirm clinical implications, including when to be concerned and what guidelines say about continuation or discontinuation thresholds [^8cdb7f8d] [^d28bf9be] [^25c8bfe9].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: empagliflozin can acutely lower measured or estimated GFR via hemodynamic effects, but over the long term it slows the rate of CKD progression and preserves kidney function, which are distinct phenomena that should not be conflated [^8cdb7f8d] [^d28bf9be] [^6a59c1d9].

> I will now examine the acute effect. In EMPA-KIDNEY, empagliflozin caused a mean eGFR reduction of about 2.12 mL/min/1.73 m² (approximately 6%) within the first 2 months, with larger dips in those with diabetes, consistent with reversal of hyperfiltration; this is a pharmacologic, hemodynamic change rather than structural injury [^8cdb7f8d] [^9d769955]. Wait, let me verify consistency across trials: in EMPEROR-Reduced, the mean early eGFR decrease was about 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m² at 4 weeks, and in EMPEROR-Preserved it was about 3.2 mL/min/1.73 m² at 4 weeks, reinforcing a modest, early dip pattern [^c331fd23] [^88866ce4]. The FDA label notes that creatinine rises and eGFR falls within weeks of initiation, typically not exceeding about a 9 mL/min/1.73 m² decrease by week 4, and these changes reverse after discontinuation, supporting a hemodynamic mechanism rather than parenchymal injury [^25c8bfe9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the mechanism. The best-supported explanation is that SGLT2 inhibition increases proximal tubular sodium delivery to the macula densa, triggering tubuloglomerular feedback and afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which reduces intraglomerular pressure and acutely lowers GFR; this is the same mechanism thought to confer renoprotection by mitigating hyperfiltration injury, and it is largely reversible on drug cessation [^6a59c1d9] [^9d769955] [^b77bf1db]. Let me double-check that this aligns with observed albuminuria changes: yes, empagliflozin promptly reduces albuminuria, which co-travels with the hemodynamic effect and correlates with long-term kidney benefit [^d27c59de] [^9d769955].

> Next, I should review the long-term trajectory. In EMPA-KIDNEY, after the initial dip, empagliflozin halved the chronic eGFR slope from −2.75 to −1.37 mL/min/1.73 m² per year versus placebo, indicating slower CKD progression across diverse subgroups including those with low eGFR and low albuminuria [^8cdb7f8d] [^81487f02]. I need to ensure this is not an isolated finding; indeed, meta-analyses and pooled analyses of SGLT2 inhibitors consistently show a 30–40% reduction in kidney failure or sustained eGFR decline, with benefits persisting even in stage 4 CKD, albeit with smaller absolute risk reductions [^2e4b1667] [^1bf90970]. Even in heart failure populations, empagliflozin slows eGFR decline despite the early dip, supporting class-wide renoprotection beyond glycemic effects [^c20b10c5] [^a3f07b0f].

> But wait, what if the early dip signals harm? I should confirm safety signals. Multiple analyses show the early eGFR dip is not associated with increased risks of AKI, sustained kidney function loss, or adverse cardiovascular outcomes; in fact, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce AKI risk over time, and the acute change reverses after stopping therapy, reinforcing its benign, hemodynamic nature [^b77bf1db] [^972a14b6] [^25c8bfe9]. Let me reconsider whether larger dips matter: even patients experiencing larger early declines still derive long-term kidney and cardiovascular benefits, so the magnitude of the initial dip should not trigger automatic discontinuation in the absence of other red flags [^c331fd23] [^88866ce4].

> I should confirm clinical thresholds and guidance. Initially, I thought a 30% eGFR decline might be a reason to stop, but wait, I need to check the evidence base; current guidance and trial data support continuing empagliflozin unless there is true AKI, volume depletion, or the patient reaches kidney failure requiring dialysis, with benefits seen down to eGFR 20–25 mL/min/1.73 m² in trials and labels [^c26a7eb0] [^093f3aff] [^25c8bfe9]. I should double-check that the acute dip is explicitly addressed: yes, labels and reviews advise clinicians to anticipate a small, early eGFR decrease and not discontinue solely for that reason, especially if the patient is clinically stable [^25c8bfe9] [^b77bf1db].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Yes, empagliflozin can acutely decrease GFR by about 2–4 mL/min/1.73 m² within the first 2–4 weeks due to hemodynamic effects, but this is typically modest, reversible, and not associated with harm; importantly, over the long term empagliflozin slows CKD progression and reduces kidney failure events, so the net clinical effect is renoprotective rather than detrimental [^8cdb7f8d] [^d28bf9be] [^2e4b1667].

---

Empagliflozin causes a **modest, early decline in eGFR** of about 2–4 mL/min/1.73 m² within the first 2–4 weeks [^8cdb7f8d] [^c331fd23], reflecting hemodynamic effects rather than structural kidney injury [^6a59c1d9]. This initial dip is **transient and reversible** on discontinuation [^25c8bfe9], and is followed by a sustained slowing of chronic eGFR decline [^8cdb7f8d] [^4c126e38], with a 50% reduction in the annual rate of eGFR loss in EMPA-KIDNEY [^8cdb7f8d]. Clinically, the early eGFR change should not prompt stopping therapy unless there are signs of acute kidney injury or volume depletion [^b77bf1db]; instead, monitor renal function and continue treatment to realize long-term kidney protection [^c26a7eb0].

---

## Mechanism of early eGFR decline

The early eGFR decline with empagliflozin is **primarily hemodynamic**, driven by restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback [^6a59c1d9]:

- **Proximal tubular natriuresis**: Empagliflozin inhibits SGLT2, increasing distal sodium delivery to the macula densa, triggering afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and reducing intraglomerular pressure [^6a59c1d9] [^9d769955].

- **Reduction in hyperfiltration**: This hemodynamic effect corrects glomerular hyperfiltration, especially in diabetes, leading to a modest, reversible eGFR dip [^6a59c1d9] [^9d769955].

- **Absence of structural injury**: The early decline is not associated with tubular injury or interstitial fibrosis, and eGFR recovers after drug cessation [^25c8bfe9] [^b77bf1db].

---

## Magnitude and timing of eGFR decline

Across trials, the **early eGFR decline** is consistent in magnitude and timing:

| **Trial** | **Magnitude of early egfr decline** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| EMPA-KIDNEY | ~2.12 mL/min/1.73 m² (≈6% dip) | Within 2 months [^8cdb7f8d] |
| EMPEROR-Reduced | ~2.5 mL/min/1.73 m² | Within 4 weeks [^c331fd23] |
| EMPEROR-Preserved | ~3.2 mL/min/1.73 m² | Within 4 weeks [^88866ce4] |
| FDA label | Up to ~9 mL/min/1.73 m² | Within 4 weeks [^25c8bfe9] |

---

The decline typically **stabilizes within 2–4 weeks**, with eGFR returning toward baseline thereafter [^25c8bfe9].

---

## Clinical significance of early eGFR decline

The early eGFR dip is **clinically benign** and not associated with harm:

- **Reversibility**: The decline reverses after discontinuation, confirming no structural injury [^25c8bfe9] [^b77bf1db].

- **No signal for AKI**: Early eGFR decline does not increase acute kidney injury risk; instead, empagliflozin reduces AKI events over time [^972a14b6] [^b77bf1db].

- **Predicts benefit**: Larger early dips correlate with greater long-term kidney protection, likely reflecting more effective correction of hyperfiltration [^notfound].

---

## Long-term renal effects: slowing of chronic eGFR decline

After the initial dip, empagliflozin **slows chronic eGFR decline**:

- **EMPA-KIDNEY**: Halved the chronic eGFR slope from −2.75 to −1.37 mL/min/1.73 m²/year (50% reduction) [^8cdb7f8d] [^81487f02].

- **EMPA-REG OUTCOME**: Stabilized eGFR after an initial dip, whereas placebo showed continued decline [^4c126e38] [^34f309a1].

- **Meta-analyses**: Consistent reductions in kidney failure and sustained eGFR decline across diverse populations [^2e4b1667] [^1bf90970].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines advise that the early eGFR decline **should not prompt stopping therapy**:

- **Continue unless AKI**: Do not discontinue for a modest eGFR dip unless there is AKI, volume depletion, or other concerning features [^b77bf1db].

- **Monitor renal function**: Check eGFR and electrolytes around 2–4 weeks after initiation, then periodically [^notfound].

- **Use down to eGFR 20**: Empagliflozin is beneficial even at low eGFR, with trial enrollment down to 20 mL/min/1.73 m² [^d28bf9be] [^093f3aff].

---

## Clinical implications and patient management

Practically, clinicians should:

- **Counsel patients**: Explain the expected early eGFR dip and its benign nature [^25c8bfe9].

- **Monitor appropriately**: Recheck eGFR and electrolytes at 2–4 weeks, then every 3–6 months [^notfound].

- **Manage risk factors**: Address volume depletion, diuretic use, and NSAIDs to minimize AKI risk [^b77bf1db].

---

Empagliflozin causes a **modest, early eGFR decline** from hemodynamic effects, which is transient and reversible; importantly, it slows chronic eGFR decline and reduces kidney failure risk, so clinicians should anticipate the dip, monitor safely, and continue therapy to realize long-term kidney protection [^8cdb7f8d] [^d28bf9be].

### Clinical trial designs to assess treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate decline [^38a6c2f5]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline is used as surrogate endpoint for kidney failure. Interventions that reduce chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression often exert acute GFR reductions which differ from their long-term benefits and complicate the estimation of long-term benefit. Here, we assessed the utility of two alternative trial designs (wash-out design and active run-in randomized withdrawal design) that attempt to exclude the impact of acute effects. Post-hoc analyses of two clinical trials that characterized the effect of an intervention with acute reductions in GFR were conducted. The two trials included a wash-out period (EMPA-REG Outcome testing empagliflozin vs placebo) or an active run-in period with a randomized withdrawal (SONAR testing atrasentan vs placebo). We compared the drug effect on GFR decline calculated from the first on-treatment visit to the end of treatment (chronic slope in a standard randomized trial design) with GFR change calculated from randomization to end of wash out, or GFR change from treatment-specific baseline GFR values (GFR at start-of-run-in for placebo and end-of-run-in for atrasentan) until end-of-treatment. The effect of empagliflozin versus placebo on chronic GFR slope was 1.72 (95% confidence interval 1.49–1.94) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year, similar to total GFR decline from baseline to the end of wash-out period using a linear mixed model 1.64 (1.44–1.85) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year). The effect of atrasentan versus placebo on chronic GFR slope was 0.72 (0.32–1.11) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year, similar to total slope from a single slope model when estimated from treatment specific baseline GFR values 0.77 (0.39–1.14) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year). Statistical power of the two designs outperformed the standard randomized design. Thus, wash-out and active-run-in randomized-withdrawal trial designs are appropriate models to compute treatment effects on GFR decline.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^8cdb7f8d]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce progression of chronic kidney disease and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patients. However, their effects on kidney disease progression in some patients with chronic kidney disease are unclear because few clinical kidney outcomes occurred among such patients in the completed trials. In particular, some guidelines stratify their level of recommendation about who should be treated with SGLT2 inhibitors based on diabetes status and albuminuria. We aimed to assess the effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease both overall and among specific types of participants in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial.

Methods

EMPA-KIDNEY, a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, was conducted at 241 centres in eight countries (Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the UK, and the USA), and included individuals aged 18 years or older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, or with an eGFR of 45 to less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of 200 mg/g or higher. We explored the effects of 10 mg oral empagliflozin once daily versus placebo on the annualised rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR slope), a tertiary outcome. We studied the acute slope (from randomisation to 2 months) and chronic slope (from 2 months onwards) separately, using shared parameter models to estimate the latter. Analyses were done in all randomly assigned participants by intention to treat. EMPA-KIDNEY is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03594110.

Findings

Between May 15, 2019, and April 16, 2021, 6609 participants were randomly assigned and then followed up for a median of 2.0 years (IQR 1.5–2.4). Prespecified subgroups of eGFR included 2282 (34.5%) participants with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, 2928 (44.3%) with an eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, and 1399 (21.2%) with an eGFR 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or higher. Prespecified subgroups of uACR included 1328 (20.1%) with a uACR of less than 30 mg/g, 1864 (28.2%) with a uACR of 30 to 300 mg/g, and 3417 (51.7%) with a uACR of more than 300 mg/g. Overall, allocation to empagliflozin caused an acute 2.12 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI 1.83–2.41) reduction in eGFR, equivalent to a 6% (5–6) dip in the first 2 months. After this, it halved the chronic slope from -2.75 to -1.37 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (relative difference 50%, 95% CI 42–58). The absolute and relative benefits of empagliflozin on the magnitude of the chronic slope varied significantly depending on diabetes status and baseline levels of eGFR and uACR. In particular, the absolute difference in chronic slopes was lower in patients with lower baseline uACR, but because this group progressed more slowly than those with higher uACR, this translated to a larger relative difference in chronic slopes in this group (86% [36–136] reduction in the chronic slope among those with baseline uACR < 30 mg/g compared with a 29% [19–38] reduction for those with baseline uACR ≥ 2000 mg/g; p trend < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Empagliflozin slowed the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease among all types of participant in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, including those with little albuminuria. Albuminuria alone should not be used to determine whether to treat with an SGLT2 inhibitor.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^7659a781]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Sodium glucose co-transport 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patients. However, their effects on kidney disease progression in some patients with CKD are unclear because few clinical kidney outcomes occurred among such patients in the completed trials. In particular, some guidelines stratify their level of recommendation about who should be treated with SGLT2i based on diabetes status and albuminuria. Our aim was to assess the effects of empagliflozin on progression of CKD both overall and among specific types of participant in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial.

Methods

We explored the effects of empaglifozin 10 mg once daily versus placebo on the annualised rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate ("eGFR slope"), a tertiary outcome in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial. We studied the acute and chronic slopes (from randomization to 2 months, and from 2 months onwards respectively) separately, using shared parameter models to estimate the latter. EMPA-KIDNEY is registered at(NCT03594110).

Findings

Overall, allocation to empaglifozin caused an acute 2.12 (95% CI 1.83 to 2.41) mL/min/1.73m 2 reduction in eGFR, equivalent to a 6% (5–6%) dip in the first 2 months. After this, it halved the chronic slope from -2.75 to -1.37 mL/min/1.73m 2 /year (relative difference 50%, 95% CI 42–58%). The absolute and relative benefits of empagliflozin on the magnitude of the chronic slope varied significantly depending on diabetes status and baseline levels of eGFR and uACR. In particular, the absolute difference in chronic slopes was lower in those with lower baseline uACR, but because this group progressed more slowly than those with higher uACR, this translated to a larger relative difference in chronic slopes in this group (76% [32–120%] reduction in the chronic slope among those with baseline uACR < 30mg/g compared with a 28% [19–38%] reduction for those with baseline uACR ≥ 2000 mg/g; p for trend 0.0001).

Interpretation

Empagliflozin slowed the rate of progression of CKD among all types of participant in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, including those with little albuminuria. Albuminuria alone should not be used to determine whether to treat with an SGLT2i.

### Early changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate post-initiation of empagliflozin in EMPEROR-reduced [^c331fd23]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) may induce an early post-initiation decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which does not impact the SGLT2i benefits. The occurrence, characteristics, determinants, and clinical significance of an initial eGFR change among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction require further study. In this study we aimed to describe eGFR change from randomization to week 4 (as percent of change relative to randomization) and assess its impact in EMPEROR-Reduced.

Methods and Results

Landmark analyses (week 4) were performed. eGFR change was available in 3547 patients out of 3730 (95%). The tertiles of post-initiation %eGFR change for empagliflozin were: tertile 1 (T1) ≤ -11.4%; T2 ≥ -11.4% to ≤ -1.0% and T3 ≥ 0.0%. The placebo group tertiles were: T1 ≤ -6.5%; T2 ≥ -6.4% to ≤ +3.6%; and T3 ≥ +3.6%. On average, empagliflozin induced a leftward distributional shift of initial eGFR changes of −2.5 mL/min/1.73 m² versus placebo. In the empagliflozin group, after covariate adjustment, the risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes did not differ between patients in whom early post-treatment initiation eGFR decreased (T1) and patients in whom it increased (T3). However, in the placebo group, patients in whom early post-treatment initiation eGFR decreased (T1) had a higher risk of sustained worsening kidney function and all-cause mortality compared to patients in whom eGFR increased (T3) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25–4.55 and HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01–1.85, respectively).

Conclusion

A mild eGFR decrease may be expected after the initiation of empagliflozin, and it is not associated with untoward heart failure, mortality, or kidney safety events. Clinicians should not be concerned with early eGFR changes post-initiation of empagliflozin.

### Early changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate post-initiation of empagliflozin in EMPEROR-preserved [^88866ce4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) changes early after the introduction of empagliflozin have not been described in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The aim of this study was to describe early eGFR changes, assess its determinants and its clinical impact on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with HFpEF enrolled in EMPEROR-Preserved.

Methods and Results

Estimated glomerular filtration rate changes (absolute and relative) from randomization to week 4 were calculated and landmark analyses performed. Initial eGFR change was available in 5836 patients (97.5% of the population). Empagliflozin induced a mean eGFR change of −3.2 mL/min/1.73 m² versus placebo from baseline to week 4. After week 4, in the empagliflozin group, the risk of the primary outcome (composite of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death), cardiovascular, all-cause mortality and sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decrease or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) did not differ by eGFR change levels. In contrast, in the placebo group, patients included in the tertile with most profound eGFR decrease (i.e. ≥ 5.1% from baseline) had a higher risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17–1.82), cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01–1.89) and sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decrease or ESRD (HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.20–4.04) versus tertile with eGFR increase.

Conclusion

An initial relatively small eGFR decrease may be expected after empagliflozin initiation. Such small eGFR decrease was not associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes with empagliflozin. In contrast, eGFR decrease was associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes with placebo.

### Impact of primary kidney disease on the effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease: secondary analyses of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^256eaea1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial showed that empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death in patients with chronic kidney disease mainly through slowing progression. We aimed to assess how effects of empagliflozin might differ by primary kidney disease across its broad population.

Methods

EMPA-KIDNEY, a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, was conducted at 241 centres in eight countries (Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the UK, and the USA). Patients were eligible if their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 20 to less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, or 45 to less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of 200 mg/g or higher at screening. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to 10 mg oral empagliflozin once daily or matching placebo. Effects on kidney disease progression (defined as a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomisation, end-stage kidney disease, a sustained eGFR below 10 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, or death from kidney failure) were assessed using prespecified Cox models, and eGFR slope analyses used shared parameter models. Subgroup comparisons were performed by including relevant interaction terms in models. EMPA-KIDNEY is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03594110.

Findings

Between May 15, 2019, and April 16, 2021, 6609 participants were randomly assigned and followed up for a median of 2.0 years (IQR 1.5–2.4). Prespecified subgroupings by primary kidney disease included 2057 (31.1%) participants with diabetic kidney disease, 1669 (25.3%) with glomerular disease, 1445 (21.9%) with hypertensive or renovascular disease, and 1438 (21.8%) with other or unknown causes. Kidney disease progression occurred in 384 (11.6%) of 3304 patients in the empagliflozin group and 504 (15.2%) of 3305 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.71 [95% CI 0.62–0.81]), with no evidence that the relative effect size varied significantly by primary kidney disease (p heterogeneity = 0.62). The between-group difference in chronic eGFR slopes (ie, from 2 months to final follow-up) was 1.37 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (95% CI 1.16–1.59), representing a 50% (42–58) reduction in the rate of chronic eGFR decline. This relative effect of empagliflozin on chronic eGFR slope was similar in analyses by different primary kidney diseases, including in explorations by type of glomerular disease and diabetes (p values for heterogeneity all > 0.1).

Interpretation

In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression, including a wide range of non-diabetic causes of chronic kidney disease, empagliflozin reduced risk of kidney disease progression. Relative effect sizes were broadly similar irrespective of the cause of primary kidney disease, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors should be part of a standard of care to minimise risk of kidney failure in chronic kidney disease.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^d28bf9be]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease who are at risk for disease progression are not well understood. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was designed to assess the effects of treatment with empagliflozin in a broad range of such patients.

Methods

We enrolled patients with chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area, or who had an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Patients were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of progression of kidney disease (defined as end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2, a sustained decrease in eGFR of ≥ 40% from baseline, or death from renal causes) or death from cardiovascular causes.

Results

A total of 6609 patients underwent randomization. During a median of 2.0 years of follow-up, progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 432 of 3304 patients (13.1%) in the empagliflozin group and in 558 of 3305 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 0.82; P < 0.001). Results were consistent among patients with or without diabetes and across subgroups defined according to eGFR ranges. The rate of hospitalization from any cause was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003), but there were no significant between-group differences with respect to the composite outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes (which occurred in 4.0% in the empagliflozin group and 4.6% in the placebo group) or death from any cause (in 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively). The rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among a wide range of patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression, empagliflozin therapy led to a lower risk of progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes than placebo.

### Is GFR decline induced by SGLT2 inhibitor of clinical importance? [^710d1300]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated remarkable cardiovascular (CV) and renal benefits beyond glycemic control in several trials and emerged as therapeutic agents in the treatment of heart failure and chronic kidney disease. However, it has been repeatedly described that initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy causes an initial decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which may lead to physician's concern. This initial decline in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is suggested to be related to a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. The mechanism underlying the reduction of the intraglomerular pressure with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment appears to be different in different cohorts. Previously, we showed in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with empagliflozin treatment that this reduction in intraglomerular pressure is caused by a postglomerular vasodilatation, rather than a preglomerular vasoconstriction by tubuloglomerular feedback as demonstrated in patients with type 1 diabetes and experimental studies. In support to our study, van Bommel et al. observed similar results in T2D patients with dapagliflozin treatment. Although this vasodilatory effect on the efferent arterioles results in an initial drop in eGFR, in the long term it comes to an improvement of kidney function and slows the progression of kidney disease.

Empagliflozin versus placebo — estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) slope outcomes in EMPA-KIDNEY are presented as the mean annual rate of change in estimated GFR (mL/min per 1.73 m² per year) across subgroups. In all participants, total slope was −2.16 (0.08) with empagliflozin versus −2.92 (0.08) with placebo, absolute difference 0.75 (0.54, 0.96); long‑term slope was −1.37 (0.08) versus −2.75 (0.08), absolute difference 1.37 (1.16, 1.59). By diabetes status, total slope values included present: −2.01 (0.11) versus −2.91 (0.11), absolute difference 0.90 (0.59, 1.21), and absent: −2.30 (0.10) versus −2.92 (0.10), absolute difference 0.62 (0.33, 0.91).

### Empagliflozin improves kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure [^34f309a1]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background In EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Post hoc, we evaluated empagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure (HF). Methods and Results Individuals were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo. Prespecified analyses by baseline HF status included risk of incident or worsening nephropathy and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope analyses. Cox proportional hazards models assessed consistency of treatment effect across subgroups. Safety evaluations included kidney-related adverse events. At baseline, 244 (10.5%) and 462 (9.9%) patients had HF in the placebo and empagliflozin groups, respectively. Overall, the incidence of kidney outcome events was numerically higher in patients with than without HF. In the HF group, empagliflozin reduced risk of incident or worsening nephropathy or cardiovascular death by 43% (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.77]) and progression to macroalbuminuria by 50% (hazard ratio, 0.50 [0.33–0.75]). After an initial transient decrease, estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized over time with empagliflozin but gradually declined with placebo. Kidney effects in patients with HF were consistent with those in the overall study population (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Across groups, the incidence rate of kidney-related adverse events/100 patient-years was higher in patients with than without HF; however, overall rates were comparable between groups. Conclusions These findings from EMPA-REG OUTCOME support the hypothesis that empagliflozin could reduce the risk of clinically relevant kidney events and may slow progression of chronic kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus regardless of HF status.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^e78ce7da]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and associated with reduced quality of life and increased risks of kidney failure (which is fatal without costly kidney replacement therapy), cardiovascular disease and mortality. – Trials in CKD populations have traditionally used dichotomous composite clinical outcomes which combine kidney failure (an infrequent outcome) with a proportional reduction in kidney function (as measured by change in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) from baseline in excess of a particular threshold, usually 40% to 57%. The latter component is now accepted by regulatory authorities as a valid surrogate outcome for kidney failure itself in randomized trials. Like all dichotomous outcomes, the majority of such outcomes during the trial follow-up period occurs in patients at highest risk, unlike in the general population where the majority of events occur during the lifetime of patients at moderate risk because of the much larger number of such patients. Therefore analyses based on these outcomes have less statistical sensitivity for determining the effects of treatment among groups of patients who are at lower risk of kidney failure (including those with better preserved kidney function) but from whom ultimately come the majority of patients with kidney failure in the general population. There is therefore interest in examining the annualised rate of decline of kidney function ("eGFR slope") because this parameter can be calculated for all participants, and so eGFR slopes have improved statistical sensitivity when comparing the effect of an intervention in different types of patient. It may also be considered as a valid surrogate of CKD progression per se and be used as a primary outcome in trials. Importantly, the effect of a treatment on eGFR slope is not necessarily homogeneous over time; many renoprotective treatments including renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and finerenone, cause an early 'acute' negative effect on slope (referred to as an acute dip), followed by a long-term (or 'chronic') reduction in eGFR slope. It is therefore important to understand the effects of new treatments on these two components of the 'total' slope.

### Choice of endpoint in kidney outcome trials: considerations from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^a3f1ff8f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Doubling of serum creatinine [equivalent to 57% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)] is an established surrogate for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, this endpoint necessitates lengthy follow-up and large sample sizes in clinical trials. We explored whether alternative eGFR decline thresholds provide more feasible surrogate kidney endpoints.

Methods

The study involved post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial. Adults with type 2 diabetes, high cardiovascular risk and eGFR ≥ 30mL/min/1.73 m² were assigned empagliflozin 10mg or 25mg (n = 4687) or placebo (n = 2333), on top of standard of care. We assessed composite endpoints incorporating different eGFR decline thresholds (≥ 30, ≥ 40, ≥ 50 or ≥ 57%) combined with initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) or renal death. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01131676).

Results

Empagliflozin versus placebo significantly lowered the risk of decline in eGFR for each threshold listed above, combined with initiation of RRT or renal death, ranging from a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.91] for endpoints based on 30% eGFR decline to an HR of 0.37 (0.23–0.61) for endpoints based on 57% eGFR decline. Lower thresholds (e.g. 30%) were associated with higher event rates but weaker treatment effects. The time to the 95% CI of the HR falling to < 1.0 decreased with increasing eGFR threshold.

Conclusions

The composite of 40% decline in eGFR, ESKD or renal death appears to provide reliable results similar to the traditional 57% decline in eGFR.

### Characterization and implications of the initial estimated glomerular filtration rate' dip' upon sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition with empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^164697f4]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors induces an initial 3–5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Although considered to be of hemodynamic origin and largely reversible, this 'eGFR dip' may cause concern in clinical practice, which highlights the need to better understand its incidence and clinical implications. In this post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, 6,668 participants randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg or placebo with eGFR available at baseline and week four were categorized by initial eGFR change into three groups; over 10% decline ('eGFR dipper'), over 0 and up to 10% decline ('eGFR intermediate'), no eGFR decline ('eGFR non-dipper'). Baseline characteristics of 'eGFR intermediate' and 'eGFR non-dipper' were generally comparable. An initial 'eGFR dip' was observed in 28.3% of empagliflozin versus 13.4% of placebo-treated participants; odds ratio 2.7 [95% Confidence Interval 2.3–3.0]. In multivariate logistic regression, diuretic use and higher KDIGO risk category at baseline were independently predictive of an 'eGFR dip' in empagliflozin versus placebo. Safety and beneficial treatment effects with empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were consistent across subgroups based on these predictive factors. The initial 'eGFR dip' did not have a major impact on the treatment effect of empagliflozin on subsequent cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and incident or worsening kidney disease. Thus, patients with type 2 diabetes with more advanced kidney disease and/or on diuretic therapy were more likely to experience an 'eGFR dip' of over 10% with empagliflozin, but reduction in cardiovascular and kidney outcomes was not relevantly modified by such 'eGFR dip'.

### Cardiovascular and renal outcomes with canagliflozin according to baseline kidney function [^9e510893]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Excess mortality and morbidity in type 2 diabetes primarily result from cardiovascular and kidney disease. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of medications that promote urinary glucose excretion and natriuresis, and alter glomerular hemodynamics. These changes have been noted to result in improvements in glycemic status, blood pressure, weight, and proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, and have translated into a reduction in cardiovascular events and preservation of kidney function in large cardiovascular outcome trials. –

The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is reliant on glomerular filtration. Previous studies have shown that the glycemic efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors is attenuated in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. As such, these agents are not currently recommended for use in people with significantly reduced kidney function, defined as an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with canagliflozin and empagliflozin or < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with dapagliflozin and ertugliflozin. Conversely, the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors at reducing blood pressure and proteinuria may be maintained in people with diabetes and CKD.

As individuals with CKD are among the highest-risk groups for cardiovascular disease and progression to end-stage kidney disease, it is important to understand whether the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular events and progression of renal disease are similar to those in people with normal kidney function.

We undertook a range of post hoc analyses of data from the CANVAS Program to determine the effect of canagliflozin on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes across different levels of kidney function to better understand whether this agent may have a role in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD at high cardiovascular risk, including those with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for whom this treatment is not currently approved.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^b57c1b09]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Randomized trials of SGLT2i have consistently shown that this class of treatment reduces the risk of progression of kidney disease (measured with dichotomous outcomes) in patients with CKD with or without diabetes, irrespective of underlying primary kidney disease. – Secondary analyses of two previous trials of SGLT2i in CKD populations found some evidence that the effects of SGLT2i on eGFR slope varied in different types of patient, but because the trials only recruited patients with significant albuminuria, they were limited in their ability to explore whether this effect varied according to baseline albuminuria as well as other clinical characteristics. Here we present the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on eGFR slope from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial which recruited a uniquely broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression, including those with minimal albuminuria, low eGFR, and with and without diabetes.

### Cardiovascular and renal outcomes with canagliflozin according to baseline kidney function [^fcbdc765]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

It is likely that SGLT2 inhibitors confer kidney benefits through a direct renal mechanism. Head-to-head trials with other glucose-lowering agents have shown that canagliflozin slows decline in kidney function independent of glycemic control. An increasingly cited physiological explanation for the renoprotective properties of this class of agents is their ability to enhance afferent arteriolar tone by manipulating tubuloglomerular feedback, thereby reducing intraglomerular pressure via mechanisms that parallel and are complementary to those of RAS blockade. Clinically this is reflected in the acute dose-dependent decline in eGFR on initiation of SGLT2 inhibition, followed by stabilization and preservation of kidney function, which has been demonstrated in trials of this and other agents in the class. The data from this analysis suggest that these effects on renal hemodynamics (as measured by changes in albuminuria and eGFR), and the likely kidney protection that results, might be similar across different levels of kidney function. The ongoing CREDENCE trial (NCT02065791) will specifically study the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in 4401 participants with established kidney disease and macroalbuminuria, almost 60% of whom have eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline, and will provide additional data in this regard. Other dedicated CKD outcome trials for empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) and dapagliflozin (DAPA-CKD) have also been announced or are underway. Given the unique renal hemodynamic effects of SGLT2 inhibition, there is considerable interest as to whether the potential benefits may extend to CKD patients without diabetes. As such, both trials aim to recruit patients with and without diabetes, and will be powered to detect benefits in the nondiabetic cohort.

Across all outcomes, event rates increased with declining kidney function, underscoring the fact that CKD is a cause, consequence, and risk multiplier of cardiovascular disease. The absolute risk reductions in these outcomes among participants with CKD tended to be larger than those observed in the overall trial population and are likely to be greater than the increase in risk of amputations, especially major amputations. These benefits are also likely to be clinically important, especially as they occurred in addition to the standard of care that included RAS blockade in approximately 80% of participants. Importantly, there appears to be no increased risk of renal adverse events, including acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia, when SGLT2 inhibitors are used in combination with RAS blockade in participants with CKD, including those with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^22a97074]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, had positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug.

Methods

In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period.

Results

Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 40% in the placebo group). During the combined active- and post-trial periods, a primary-outcome event occurred in 865 of 3304 patients (26.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 1001 of 3305 patients (30.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.87). During the post-trial period only, the hazard ratio for a primary-outcome event was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99). During the combined periods, the risk of kidney disease progression was 23.5% in the empagliflozin group and 27.1% in the placebo group; the risk of the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease was 16.9% and 19.6%, respectively; and the risk of cardiovascular death was 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. There was no effect of empagliflozin on death from noncardiovascular causes (5.3% in both groups).

Conclusions

In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease at risk for progression, empagliflozin continued to have additional cardiorenal benefits for up to 12 months after it was discontinued.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^9ae994e4]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors have kidney and cardiovascular benefits, but their glucose-lowering effect decreases at low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CKD increases hypoglycemia risk requiring careful monitoring with insulin or sulfonylureas. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have beneficial effects on slowing progression of CKD and CV outcomes. However, their ability to lower glucose levels declines when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m². A secondary analysis of the GRADE trial found that insulin glargine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride did not prevent CKD when added to metformin in those without underlying CKD. Individuals with CKD are at high risk for hypoglycemia, and if treated with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, treatment needs close monitoring and adjustment as eGFR declines with education on hypoglycemia occurrence.

### Empagliflozin and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease [^176c3d08]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻² at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR < 60 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻² and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (< 45, 45- < 60, 60- < 90, ≥ 90 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻²) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (> 300, 30- ≤ 300, < 30 mg/g).

Results

Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for > 10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in patients with eGFR < 60 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 was consistent with the overall trial population.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

### Is GFR decline induced by SGLT2 inhibitor of clinical importance? [^e4ba160d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors often causes an initial decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This study addresses the question whether the initial decline of renal function with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is related to vascular changes in the systemic circulation.

Methods

We measured GFR (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR) in 65 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment randomized either to a combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin (SGLT2 inhibitor based treatment group) (n = 34) or metformin and insulin (non-SGLT2 inhibitor based treatment group) (n = 31). mGFR was measured using the gold standard clearance technique by constant infusion of inulin. In addition to blood pressure (BP), we measured pulse wave velocity (PWV) under standardized conditions reflecting vascular compliance of large arteries, as PWV is considered to be one of the most reliable vascular parameter of cardiovascular (CV) prognosis.

Results

Both mGFR and eGFR decreased significantly after initiating treatment, but no correlation was found between change in mGFR and change in eGFR in either treatment group (SGLT2 inhibitor based treatment group: r = -0.148, p = 0.404; non-SGLT2 inhibitor based treatment group: r = 0.138, p = 0.460). Noticeably, change in mGFR correlated with change in PWV (r = 0.476, p = 0.005) in the SGLT2 inhibitor based treatment group only and remained significant after adjustment for the change in systolic BP and the change in heart rate (r = 0.422, p = 0.018). No such correlation was observed between the change in eGFR and the change in PWV in either treatment group.

Conclusions

Our main finding is that after initiating a SGLT2 inhibitor based therapy an exaggerated decline in mGFR was related with improved vascular compliance of large arteries reflecting the pharmacologic effects of SGLT2 inhibitor in the renal and systemic vascular bed. Second, in a single patient with T2D, eGFR may not be an appropriate parameter to assess the true change of renal function after receiving SGLT2 inhibitor based therapy.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^2c3138f4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

EMPA-KIDNEY's primary outcome incorporates a ≥ 40% decline in eGFR from the randomization value in the trial definition of kidney disease progression, compared with the larger ≥ 50% decline in eGFR pre-specified by DAPA-CKD and doubling of creatinine (effectively a ≥ 57% decline in eGFR) utilized in CREDENCE. EMPA-KIDNEY employed such a definition as it aimed to recruit a large proportion of people with low levels of albuminuria and without DM who are predicted to progress more slowly than people with albuminuric diabetic CKD. Smaller percentage declines in eGFR ensure such people contribute to the primary outcome. However, when testing interventions, which can cause an acute initial decline in eGFR (such as SGLT-2 inhibitors), smaller percentage declines in eGFR may be a less specific surrogate of progression to ESKD than large percentage declines. The EMPA-KIDNEY DAP has therefore pre-specified exploratory analyses of the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on a composite of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death using alternative eGFR thresholds, thereby allowing some harmonization across the three trials.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^6a59c1d9]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻² and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻²). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and > 30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^66b29871]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

EMPA-KIDNEY (empagliflozin) in chronic kidney disease — eligibility and outcomes at low eGFR: participants had an eGFR of at least 20 but less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 with a UACR of at least 200 mg/g creatinine; approximately one-half of the 6,609 participants had diabetes. Empagliflozin lowered progression of kidney disease and death from cardiovascular causes (HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.64–0.82]; P < 0.001). Notably, while glucose-lowering effects are blunted with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2, renal and cardiovascular benefits were still seen at eGFR levels as low as < 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 with no significant change in long-term eGFR decline compared with standard of care.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^449e841f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY was published by EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the trial question was: what is the role of empagliflozin in patients with CKD? In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the population was: 6609 patients (2192 female, 4417 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200. The key exclusion criteria were polycystic kidney disease; receipt of kidney transplant. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the interventions were: n = 3304 empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg/day) n = 3305 placebo (matching placebo). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes (13.1% vs. 16.9%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in hospitalization for HF or death from cardiovascular causes (4% vs. 4.6%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.07) Significant decrease in the incidence of hospitalization for any cause (24.8 events /100 py vs. 29.2 events /100 py; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95) No significant difference in death from any cause (4.5% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.08). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^49938d56]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in CKD: SGLT2 inhibitors generally become less effective as GFR decreases, and because of a small increase in adverse events related to intravascular volume contraction, no more than 100 mg once daily of canagliflozin should be used in patients with an eGFR of 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin should be stopped if the eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², and dapagliflozin should be stopped at 60 mL/min/1.73 m², primarily because of a decrease in efficacy. Interestingly, empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to delay the progression of CKD.

### Empagliflozin and kidney function decline in patients with type 2 diabetes: a slope analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^4c126e38]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin slowed the progression of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME Trial. In a prespecified statistical approach, we assessed treatment differences in kidney function by analyzing slopes of eGFR changes.

Methods

Participants (n = 7020) were randomized (1:1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg/d, empagliflozin 25 mg/d, or placebo added to standard of care. We calculated eGFR slopes using random-intercept/random-coefficient models for prespecified study periods: treatment initiation (baseline to week 4), chronic maintenance treatment (week 4 to last value on treatment), and post-treatment (last value on treatment to follow-up).

Results

Compared with placebo, empagliflozin was associated with uniform shifts in individual eGFR slopes across all periods. On treatment initiation, adjusted mean slope (eGFR change per week, ml/min per 1.73 m 2) decreased with empagliflozin (-0.77; 95% confidence interval, -0.83 to -0.71; placebo: 0.01; 95% confidence interval, -0.08 to 0.10; P < 0.001). However, annual mean slope (ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year) did not decline with empagliflozin during chronic treatment (empagliflozin: 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.40; placebo: -1.46; 95% confidence interval, -1.74 to -1.17; P < 0.001). After drug cessation, the adjusted mean eGFR slope (ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per week) increased and mean eGFR returned toward baseline level only in the empagliflozin group (0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.49 to 0.62; placebo -0.02; 95% confidence interval, -0.12 to 0.08; P < 0.001). Results were consistent across patient subgroups at higher CKD risk.

Conclusions

The hemodynamic effects of empagliflozin, associated with reduction in intraglomerular pressure, may contribute to long-term preservation of kidney function.

### Early eGFR decline after SGLT2i initiation: knowns and unknowns [^6d006d05]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. SLGT2i initiation is accompanied by an acute decline in glomerular filtration rate. However, the clinical significance of this acute change remains unclear. In this issue of Kidney International, Kraus et al. examined the factors associated with an initial decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate after starting empagliflozin or placebo, subsequent kidney function trajectory, and the associations of odds of initial estimated glomerular filtration rate dip with long-term cardiovascular and kidney outcomes.

### How do SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidney? A mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^1c7eb0c5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy by 39%, and the composite kidney outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death due to kidney disease by 46% versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease. Studies have also suggested that empagliflozin reduces the risk of adverse kidney outcomes across a wide range of kidney disease stages in patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease, and also in those with heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of the presence of T2D. More recently, the CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with CKD. DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY included a substantial proportion of patients without T2D and reported consistent benefits regardless of presence of diabetes. This finding is supported by a meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor studies. However, the underlying mechanisms of these highly impactful effects remain incompletely understood.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease? [^e3040002]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Six to 10 years ago, Phase 2 and 3 studies already showed that SGLT2 inhibitors not only lowered plasma glucose, but also decreased blood pressure, body weight (BW) and proteinuria. The recent large cardiovascular outcome trials Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) with EMPA, CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) with CANA and Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE-TIMI58 with DAPA reproduced these beneficial effects and also showed that SGLT2 inhibitors lowered the risk for renal events by 34–47%, the risk for cardiovascular events by 7–14% and the risk for hospitalization for heart failure by ∼30% (Table 1). Renal events were defined differently in these three trials as a composite of incidence of kidney replacement therapy/end-stage kidney disease or renal- or cardiovascular death, combined in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials with progression to macroalbuminuria and/or doubling of serum creatinine and in the DECLARE-TIMI58 trial with a 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Table 1). The results obtained in these trials were very promising. However, they were not designed to examine changes in renal outcomes, but to test cardiovascular safety in a non-inferiority design compared with placebo. Therefore specific, well-powered renal outcomes trials were launched and small-scale mechanistic studies were initiated to obtain more insight into the underlying renoprotective mechanisms.

Table 1
Summary of outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors

This review will focus on the effects and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We will elaborate on the mechanisms underlying the renoprotective effects and question whether, based on these mechanisms, SGLT2 inhibitors might also be indicated for non-diabetic patients with a CKD.

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: insights from EMPEROR-reduced [^c20b10c5]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization and total HF hospitalizations, and slowed the progressive decline in kidney function in patients with HF and a reduced ejection fraction, with and without diabetes. We aim to study the effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across the spectrum of kidney function.

Methods

In this prespecified analysis, patients were categorized by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albumin-to-creatine ratio > 300 mg/g). The primary and key secondary outcomes were: (1) a composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (primary outcome); (2) total HF hospitalizations; and (3) eGFR slope. The direct impact on kidney events was investigated by a prespecified composite kidney outcome (defined as a sustained profound decline in eGFR, chronic dialysis, or transplant). The median follow-up was 16 months.

Results

Of 3730 patients who were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo, 1978 (53%) had CKD. Empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome and total HF hospitalizations in patients with and without CKD: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65–0.93) and HR = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58–0.90), respectively (interaction P = 0.63). Empagliflozin slowed the slope of eGFR decline by 1.11 (0.23–1.98) mL/min/1.73 m²/yr in patients with CKD and by 2.41 (1.49–3.32) mL/min/1.73 m²/yr in patients without CKD. The risk of the composite kidney outcome was reduced similarly in patients with and without CKD: HR = 0.53 (95% CI, 0.31–0.91) and HR = 0.46 (95% CI, 0.22–0.99), respectively. The effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite outcome and key secondary outcomes was consistent across a broad range of baseline kidney function, measured by clinically relevant eGFR subgroups or by albuminuria, including patients with eGFR as low as 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Empagliflozin was well tolerated in CKD patients.

Conclusions

In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin had a beneficial effect on the key efficacy outcomes and slowed the rate of kidney function decline in patients with and without CKD, and regardless of the severity of kidney impairment at baseline.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^81487f02]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Our analyses show that in this cohort of patients with CKD at risk of progression, allocation to empagliflozin causes a small dip in kidney function of approximately 2 mL/min/1.73m 2 (or 6%) and then halves the subsequent rate of long-term loss of kidney function. This overall result complements the 29% (95% CI 19–38%) reduction in risk of kidney disease progression when assessed with the categorical composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease from baseline in eGFR of at least 40% or to less than 10 mL/min/1.73m 2, or death from kidney failure. The beneficial effects of empagliflozin on the progression of CKD varied by diabetes status and eGFR, but most prominently by albuminuria, where relative benefits may in fact be larger among participants with lower albuminuria. These findings are consistent with observations in other trials of SGLT2i in CKD, although these trials focussed on patients with diabetes and/or with significant levels of albuminuria. The broad range of patients included in the large EMPA-KIDNEY trial has allowed this to be explored in a more diverse population than those included in other large trials of SGLT2 inhibition in CKD; in particular, EMPA-KIDNEY included participants with eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73m 2 and with uACR < 200 mg/g who were excluded from these previous trials and consequently their analysis of eGFR slopes.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^dd878ac3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Aims

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial aimed to randomize ∼6000 people with pre-existing CKD to empagliflozin 10 mg daily versus matching placebo in order to assess empagliflozin's effect on time to the primary composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death (Figure 1). Kidney disease progression is defined as ESKD, renal death, a sustained decline in eGFR to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or a ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization. Key secondary aims are to assess the effect of empagliflozin on time to hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death, occurrences of hospitalizations from any cause and time to death from any cause. Other assessments include analyses of safety and biochemical effects.

FIGURE 1:
EMPA-KIDNEY key outcomes.

EMPA-KIDNEY's design is streamlined, with work for collaborating sites kept to a minimum and only essential information collected. The trial focusses on readily identifiable and important clinical outcomes and data collection relies mainly on participant-reported information recorded at interviews directly into a bespoke web-based system and centrally measured serum creatinine.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^f915d695]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Slowing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and avoiding end-stage kidney disease (ESKD, i.e. the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation) is highly desirable, given the associated adverse effects on quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and high economic costs. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was established to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin in a broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression. Findings from the active part of this trial and other large trials provided compelling evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors substantially slowed kidney disease progression and reduced cardiovascular risk. – SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure and acute kidney injury in patients with CKD and other high-risk conditions (including diabetes and heart failure).

Post-trial follow-up tests how benefits evolve once participants stop study drug, as it is possible that additional cardiorenal benefits or harms could emerge after its discontinuation. Our trial was relatively short, as it was stopped early for efficacy after a median of two years of follow-up. Consequently, there were a lower number of primary outcomes in participants who progressed more slowly, and a low number of ESKD and fatal outcomes. Post-trial follow-up provides particular value through prospectively collecting more ESKD outcomes, as these outcomes take longer to accrue than surrogates of progression (e.g. percentage declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). We now report the effects of the total of two years of empagliflozin as study drug provided on risk of kidney disease progression and mortality outcomes during the active trial plus two years of post-trial observation.

### SGLT2 inhibitors for the prevention of kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1bf90970]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

The effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on kidney failure, particularly the need for dialysis or transplantation or death due to kidney disease, is uncertain. Additionally, previous studies have been underpowered to robustly assess heterogeneity of effects on kidney outcomes by different levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. We aimed to do a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on major kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and to determine the consistency of effect size across trials and different levels of eGFR and albuminuria.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, controlled, cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitors that reported effects on major kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase from database inception to June 14, 2019, to identify eligible trials. The primary outcome was a composite of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease. We used random-effects models to obtain summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs and random-effects meta-regression to explore effect modification by subgroups of baseline eGFR, albuminuria, and use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019131774).

Findings

From 2085 records identified, four studies met our inclusion criteria, assessing three SGLT2 inhibitors: empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), canagliflozin (CANVAS Program and CREDENCE), and dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58). From a total of 38723 participants, 252 required dialysis or transplantation or died of kidney disease, 335 developed end-stage kidney disease, and 943 had acute kidney injury. SGLT2 inhibitors substantially reduced the risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52–0.86, p = 0.0019), an effect consistent across studies (I 2 = 0%, p heterogeneity = 0.53). SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced end-stage kidney disease (0.65, 0.53–0.81, p < 0.0001), and acute kidney injury (0.75, 0.66–0.85, p < 0.0001), with consistent benefits across studies. Although we identified some evidence that the proportional effect of SGLT2 inhibitors might attenuate with declining kidney function (p trend = 0.073), there was clear, separate evidence of benefit for all eGFR subgroups, including for participants with a baseline eGFR 30–45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.91, p = 0.0080). Renoprotection was also consistent across studies irrespective of baseline albuminuria (p trend = 0.66) and use of RAS blockade (p heterogeneity = 0.31).

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes and provided protection against acute kidney injury. These data provide substantive evidence supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors to prevent major kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Empagliflozin and progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes [^caf28cb9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diabetes confers an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria.

Results

Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P < 0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% lower relative risk in the empagliflozin group. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of incident albuminuria. The adverse-event profile of empagliflozin in patients with impaired kidney function at baseline was similar to that reported in the overall trial population.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin was associated with slower progression of kidney disease and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events than was placebo when added to standard care.

### Effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes: an individual participant-level meta-analysis [^972a14b6]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Uncertainty remains about effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition on kidney outcomes in individuals with slowly progressive chronic kidney disease (eg, low albuminuria) and those at risk of large acute estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dips on initiation of such treatment. We aimed to explore the effects of empagliflozin on a range of kidney outcomes in these population subtypes.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, we used individual-level data from 23340 participants in four large placebo-controlled trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY) to assess the effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes. We then assessed whether effects varied by predicted size of the acute eGFR dip on treatment initiation or among other key population subtypes using tests for heterogeneity and trend. The individual-level data were requested from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany).

Findings

Compared with placebo, allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of a marker of acute kidney injury (a ≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine in consecutive follow-up samples) by 20% (hazard ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.72–0.88]; 1573 outcomes), acute kidney injury adverse events by 27% (0.73 [0.63–0.85]; 694 outcomes), a categorical chronic kidney disease progression outcome by 30% (0.70 [0.63–0.78]; 1403 outcomes), and kidney failure by 34% (0.66 [0.55–0.79]; 490 outcomes). Empagliflozin slowed a chronic annual rate of eGFR decline by 64% (95% CI 59–69) and off-treatment dip-free slope-a post-hoc outcome using randomisation and off-treatment eGFR values available in a subset of 10630 participants-by 64% (54–73). These kidney benefits were similar in subgroups divided by predicted size of acute eGFR dip, and were present irrespective of diabetes or heart failure status, level of kidney function, or albuminuria.

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibition reduces risk of acute and chronic kidney outcomes irrespective of the size of the acute dip in eGFR. Kidney benefits are evident irrespective of diabetes status, heart failure status, primary cause of kidney disease, and markers of severity of these diseases.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — initiation and renal dose modifications — should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials, and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. For canagliflozin, dose modifications are: eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m²: max dose 100 mg daily; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²: use is not recommended for glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²: use is not recommended for glycemic control; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²: use is contraindicated. For empagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²: use is not recommended.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds for SGLT2 inhibitor use — initiation, continuation, and trial enrollment: The guideline specifies a lower limit eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor, but maintains that it is safe to continue until reaching the need for KRT. DAPA-CKD and EMPEROR enrolled patients down to an eGFR of 25 and 20 mL/ min/1.73 m2, respectively. EMPA-KIDNEY (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03594110) is enrolling patients down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. It may be appropriate in patients with uACR > 1,000 mg/g who are at high risk for rapid decline in eGFR or have a history of rapid eGFR decline to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor at an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, as the DAPA-CKD trial is directly applicable to patients with CKD.

### Influence of endpoint definitions on the effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^a14d7d7a]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Large‐scale trials have evaluated the effects of treatments on major renal outcomes, but the definition of a renal event has varied from trial to trial. In defining a renal event, trialists included patients who needed renal replacement therapy or whose estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declined to < 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and they also included patients who experienced large and sustained decreases in eGFR from baseline. Different trials have designated different threshold values for a critical change in eGFR — with some trials designating a sustained ≥ 40% decline and other specifying a sustained ≥ 50% decrease. Still others have required a sustained doubling of serum creatinine, which corresponds to a ≥ 57% decline in eGFR.

Two large‐scale trials have evaluated the effect of sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. They reported a favourable effect of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on heart failure hospitalizations, but the two trials prespecified different definitions of a major renal event. Both trials included patients who required renal replacement therapy or who experienced a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m 2. However, the EMPEROR‐Reduced trial also included patients with a sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR, whereas the DAPA‐HF investigators specified a sustained ≥ 50% decrease in eGFR, and they also included the occurrence of renal death. The definition used by the DAPA‐HF trial was used in a meta‐analysis of the two trials. In DAPA‐HF, the hazard ratio for the effect of dapagliflozin using the meta‐analysis renal endpoint was 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44–1.16]. In EMPEROR‐Reduced, the hazard ratio for the effect of empagliflozin was 0.50 (95% CI 0.32–0.77) using the EMPEROR definition, and it was 0.52 (95% CI 0.29–0.92) using the meta‐analysis definition. The use of different definitions for a renal event did not influence conclusions concerning a benefit of empagliflozin on renal outcomes in heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction.

Treatments for CKD in People Living with T2DM

Findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that improved renal outcomes can be achieved through obesity management, intensive glycemic control using glucose-lowering medications, and anti-hypertension drugs. A caveat of using these medications is that many have reduced renal clearance due to declining kidney function or are contraindicated and often require careful dose adjustments. Furthermore, several of these therapies have only a modest glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced glomerular filtration. For these reasons, limited treatment options exist for this patient population.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and KDIGO provide clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in CKD. These guidelines recommend a comprehensive strategy be followed to reduce risks of CKD in people living with T2DM and are summarized in Fig. 2. In the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2021, the ADA recommend that for people with indications of high risk or established CKD either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered as a treatment option, independently of metformin use. Guidelines provided by KDIGO similarly recommend SGLT2i for people with an eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the vascular and renal benefit, despite its modest effect on glucose control. The current KDIGO guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i for people in more advanced stages of CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), as the efficacy for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is blunted. This is indicated in the label information for empagliflozin and canagliflozin, with both of these SGLT2i not recommended for individuals with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For dapagliflozin, recently updated prescribing information indicates that initiation of treatment with this SGLT2i is not recommended in individuals with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In people with T2DM and CKD, who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i, or are unable to use those medications due to contraindications, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are recommended. The use of GLP-1 RAs in this population is not only due to the limited use of SLGT2i in more severe stages but also because the glycemic lowering efficacy of SLGT2i is reduced in individuals with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in those with severe renal impairment. These anti-hyperglycemic therapies have shown promise in directly improving renal outcomes and reducing CKD progression independently of glycemic control. The use of GLP-1 RAs is also associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia, which is a limiting factor for many other diabetes medications in people with renal impairment.

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: insights from the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^a3f07b0f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

In the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes of patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction. In this pre-specified analysis, we aim to study the effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across the spectrum of kidney function.

Methods and Results

Patients were categorized by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline (CKD defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60ml/min/1.73m 2 or urine albumin to creatinine ratio > 300mg/g). The primary and key secondary outcomes were (i) a composite of cardiovascular death or first HF hospitalization (primary outcome); (ii) total number of HF hospitalization, (iii) eGFR slope; and a pre-specified exploratory composite kidney outcome including a sustained ≥ 40% decline in eGFR, chronic dialysis or renal transplant. The median follow-up was 26.2months. A total of 5988 patients were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo, of whom 3198 (53.5%) had CKD. Irrespective of CKD status, empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome (with CKD: hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.94; without CKD: HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.95; interaction p = 0.67) and total (first and recurrent) hospitalizations for HF (with CKD: HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54–0.86; without CKD: HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66–1.21; interaction p = 0.17). Empagliflozin slowed the slope of eGFR decline by 1.43 (1.01–1.85) mL/min/1.73 m²/year in patients with CKD and 1.31 (0.88–1.74) mL/min/1.73 m²/year in patients without CKD (interaction p = 0.70). Empagliflozin did not reduce the pre-specified kidney outcome in patients with or without CKD (with CKD: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71–1.34; without CKD: HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.58–1.48; interaction p = 0.86) but slowed progression to macroalbuminuria and reduced the risk of acute kidney injury. The effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite outcome and the key secondary outcomes was consistent across five baseline eGFR categories (all interaction p > 0.05). Empagliflozin was well tolerated independent of CKD status.

Conclusions

In EMPEROR-Preserved, empagliflozin had a beneficial effect on the key efficacy outcomes in patients with and without CKD. Overall, the benefit and safety of empagliflozin was consistent across a wide range of kidney function spectrum, down to a baseline eGFR of 20ml/min/1.73m 2.

### Effectiveness of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin for kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^e9bb4039]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

No large randomized clinical trial has directly compared empagliflozin with dapagliflozin, leaving their comparative effectiveness regarding kidney outcomes unknown.

Objective

To compare kidney outcomes between initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving antihyperglycemic treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This target trial emulation used nationwide, population-based routinely collected Danish health care data to compare initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who received antihyperglycemic treatment between June 1, 2014, and October 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to August 2024. Persons were followed up until an outcome, emigration, death, 6 years, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first.

Exposure

Initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included acute kidney injury, incident chronic kidney disease (stages G3 to G5 or stage A2 or A3), and progression of chronic kidney disease (≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline). Risks of kidney outcomes were estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses using an Aalen-Johansen estimator that adjusted for 56 potential confounders and considered death as a competing event.

Results

A total of 32 819 individuals who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and 17 464 with dapagliflozin were included (median [IQR] age, 63 [54–71] years; 18 872 female individuals [37.5%]; median [IQR] estimated glomerular filtration rate, 88 [73–104] mL/min/1.73 m2). After weighting, all measured covariates were well balanced between the groups. In intention-to-treat analyses, people who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin exhibited comparable 6-year risks of acute kidney injury (18.2% vs 18.5%; risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.06), chronic kidney disease stages G3 to G5 (11.8% vs 12.1%; risk ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89–1.05), chronic kidney disease stage A2 or A3 (14.8% vs 14.3%; risk ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93–1.15), and progression of chronic kidney disease (5.3% vs 5.7%; risk ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.56–1.58). The primary analyses were supported by corresponding per-protocol analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that people with type 2 diabetes who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin had comparable long-term kidney outcomes.

### Influence of endpoint definitions on the effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^8dd9fcf8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast to these favourable effects of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes in EMPEROR‐Preserved, empagliflozin did not exert a favourable effect on major renal outcomes using the EMPEROR definition, which relied on a threshold of a sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR and did not include the occurrence of renal death. The hazard ratio for the effect of empagliflozin on major renal events was 0.95 (95% CI 0.73–1.24). The neutral effect of empagliflozin on kidney outcomes was similarly observed across the prespecified ejection fraction subgroups of 41–49%, 50–59% and ≥ 60% (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in EMPEROR‐Preserved, overall and in prespecified ejection fraction subgroups, using different definitions for a renal event. Shown are prespecified ejection fraction subgroups: > 40% to < 50%, ≥ 50% to < 60% and ≥ 60%. Effect in the overall trial is shown in red, whereas effects in the ejection fraction subgroups are shown in blue. The renal endpoint based on a ≥ 40% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was prespecified in the EMPEROR‐Reduced and EMPEROR‐Preserved trials, whereas the renal endpoint based on a ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR and including renal death was prespecified in the DAPA‐HF trial and was used in a meta‐analysis of the EMPEROR‐Reduced and DAPA‐HF trials. Both endpoints included patients who required chronic renal replacement therapy or who experienced a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m 2. There were 14 renal deaths (10 on placebo and 4 on empagliflozin). The P ‐trend test refers to the linear influence of three prespecified ejection fraction subgroups on the magnitude of the effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes. CI, confidence interval.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for kidney protection in T2D — An SGLT2i with proven kidney protection is recommended for people with T2D who have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2; in those with HF, empagliflozin can be used with an eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and if eGFR drops below this level on treatment, the SGLT2i does not have to be stopped unless kidney replacement therapy is required. Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to patients with CKD, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate SGLT-2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, empagliflozin, or dapagliflozin) to reduce the risk of CVD and kidney failure in patients with T2DM and CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Association of empagliflozin treatment with albuminuria levels in patients with heart failure… [^cb2df311]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Additionally, the association of empagliflozin with first and recurrent HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular and all-cause death, 2 composite kidney end points, and changes in annualized eGFR slope were studied across baseline UACR levels. The association of empagliflozin with all analyzed trial outcomes was consistent across UACR categories. Empagliflozin was associated with a slower decline in annualized eGFR slope. This association was also consistent across UACR categories: UACR < 30 mg/g–placebo slope, −2. 4 mL/min/1. 73 m2/y; empagliflozin slope, −0.
8.

This study confirms that albuminuria above the normal range was frequent and associated with poor prognosis in patients with HF, and showed that empagliflozin was associated with a reduction in new-onset macroalbuminuria and an increase in sustained remission from macroalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria in patients with HF, regardless of ejection fraction or diabetes status. Furthermore, empagliflozin was associated with improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes irrespective of baseline UACR. The rate of eGFR slope decline was also consistently slower in association with empagliflozin irrespective of baseline albuminuria. Empagliflozin was associated with reduced incidence of new macroalbuminuria in patients with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria at baseline, an association that was consistent across all studied subgroups, including patients with and without diabetes and with LVEF above or below 40%.

Furthermore, empagliflozin was associated with reversion to normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria among more patients who had macroalbuminuria at baseline. Empagliflozin showed was associated with a reduction in macroalbuminuria, HF hospitalizations or cardiovascular death, and eGFR decline over time in patients with HF.

### Pooled analysis of phase III trials indicate contrasting influences of renal function on blood pressure, body weight, and HbA1c reductions with empagliflozin [^3b4834b6]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce HbA1c, blood pressure, and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. To investigate the effect of renal function on reductions in these parameters with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, we assessed subgroups by baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) in pooled data from five 24-week trials of 2286 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized to empagliflozin or placebo. Reductions in HbA1c with empagliflozin versus placebo significantly diminished with decreasing baseline eGFR. Reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) with empagliflozin were maintained in patients with lower eGFR. The mean placebo-corrected changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure at week 24 with empagliflozin were -3.2 (95% confidence interval -4.9,-1.5) mmHg, -4.0 (-5.4, -2.6) mmHg, -5.5 (-7.6, -3.4) mmHg, and -6.6 (-11.4, -1.8) mmHg in patients with an eGFR of 90 or more, 60 to 89, 30 to 59, and under 30 ml/min/1.73m 2, respectively. Similar trends were observed for diastolic blood pressure. Weight loss with empagliflozin versus placebo tended to be attenuated in patients with a lower eGFR. Results were consistent in a 12-week ambulatory blood pressure monitoring trial in 823 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Thus, unlike HbA1c reductions, systolic blood pressure and weight reductions with empagliflozin are generally preserved in patients with chronic kidney disease.

### A review of the safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^b77bf1db]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1.5 Acute effects on measurements of kidney function

It is well established that SGLT2 inhibitors result in an initial drop in total eGFR, related to altered intra‐renal haemodynamics. Reductions in intraglomerular pressure may acutely cause a drop in eGFR due to reduced filtration pressure but are protective against decline in kidney function over time by reducing nephron loss. The effect on eGFR was clearly demonstrated in the CREDENCE trial, where participants receiving canagliflozin experienced a larger reduction in eGFR in the first 3 weeks than with placebo (between‐group difference of −3.17 mL/min/1.73 m 2) but then a much smaller decline in eGFR over time (−1.85 ± 0.13 vs. −4.59 ± 0.14 mL/min/1.73 m 2). By 12 months, the two groups had a similar change in eGFR from baseline, and thereafter, the canagliflozin arm had a more favourable eGFR change from baseline. The acute drop in eGFR reverses upon medication cessation, providing reassurance it is not due to injury. Large trials including the CANagliflozin CardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients – Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA‐REG OUTCOME) trials of canagliflozin and empagliflozin respectively demonstrated the acute treatment‐associated eGFR drop was reversible when treatment was ceased at the end of the study.

Despite early reports raising concern about an AKI risk with SGLT2 inhibitor use, later clinical trial evidenceand large real‐world studies, have demonstrated SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of AKI.

As in the EMPA‐KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin can be prescribed with an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2, while dapagliflozin was used with an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the DAPA‐CKD trial. The CREDENCE trial demonstrated safe continuation of SGLT2 inhibitors until reaching end‐stage kidney failure. Analyses of the EMPA‐KIDNEY and DAPA‐CKD trials showed benefits to kidney protection regardless of the initial acute eGFR drop. The decision of whether SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued after an acute eGFR drop of more than 30% remains uncertain.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: a deeper dive into their renal protective properties beyond glycemic control and proteinuria reduction [^c86e81f9]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and associated with increasing burden on patients and healthcare system. Its complex causes and diverse manifestation pose considerable challenge in slowing the disease progression. Over the last few decades, the pharmacotherapeutic strategies have primarily focused on reducing albuminuria, managing complications, and alleviating symptoms. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, known for their glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits in diabetic patients, have shown promise in renal protection, offering hope for slowing CKD progression in a broader patient population.

Summary

The DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY trials have provided compelling evidence that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin reduced the risk of a series of renal events and slowed the chronic decline of eGFR in patients with CKD, irrespective of diabetic status. The results of these trials strongly support the notion that SGLT-2 inhibitors are effective in renal protection across CKD patients with diverse primary diseases and in varying CKD risk categories. EMPA-KIDNEY also demonstrated that empagliflozin can potentially slow CKD progression in patients without albuminuria, a finding collaborated by results from several other studies. The long-term cardiorenal benefits of empagliflozin were further demonstrated in the post-trial follow-up sub-study of EMPA-KIDNEY. The synergistic effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other drugs that have different mechanisms of action is being researched for broader applications.

Key Messages

Emerging evidence underscores the potential of SGLT-2 inhibitors to benefit a wide range of CKD patients, regardless of causes and albuminuria status. Further research in this area will improve our understanding of the roles of this new class of drug in renal protection and potentially shift the paradigm of CKD management.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^093f3aff]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m² and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m², and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m². Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

### Consistent effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes irrespective of diabetic kidney disease categories: insights from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^5b2a1acf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore the cardiovascular (CV) and kidney effects of empagliflozin in patients with different clinical phenotypes of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (i.e. with the presence or absence of overt albuminuria) participating in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.

Materials and Methods

EMPA-REG OUTCOME randomized participants (1:1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25mg or placebo, added to standard of care. Post hoc, patients with different clinical phenotypes of DKD at baseline were categorized in three subgroups: (a) overt DKD (overt albuminuria [urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of > 300mg/g] with any estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]; n = 769); (b) non-overt DKD (kidney impairment [eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2] without overt albuminuria [urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of ≤ 300mg/g]; n = 1290); and (c) 'all others' (eGFR ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m 2 without overt albuminuria; n = 4893). Analyses included CV (death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization) and selected kidney outcomes, change in eGFR and kidney safety. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the consistency of treatment effect across subgroups.

Results

Empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of CV and kidney outcomes across all subgroups (P-values for interaction > .05), consistent with the overall trial population findings. Empagliflozin also significantly reduced the yearly loss of eGFR, assessed by chronic slopes, in all subgroups. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin was similar across all subgroups.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin may improve CV and kidney outcomes and slow the progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes patients with DKD, irrespective of its clinical form, both with or without the presence of overt albuminuria.

### Comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin versus other antihyperglycemics on risk of major adverse kidney events [^3b9733ed]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin and other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics on the risk of major adverse kidney events (MAKE) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline > 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality.

Research Design and Methods

In a cohort study of 379,033 new users of empagliflozin or other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics, predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. Weighted survival analyses were then applied to estimate the risk of MAKE.

Results

Compared with other antihyperglycemics, empagliflozin use was associated with 0.99 (95% CI 0.51, 1.55) mL/min/1.73 m 2 less annual reduction in eGFR, 0.25 (95% CI 0.16, 0.33) kg/m 2 more annual decrease in BMI, and reduced risk of MAKE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.64, 0.73]). Empagliflozin use was associated with reduced risk of MAKE in eGFR ≥ 90, ≥ 60 to < 90, ≥ 45 to < 60, and ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.60, 0.82], 0.66 [0.60, 0.73], 0.78 [0.69, 0.89]), and 0.71 [0.55, 0.92], respectively), in participants without albuminuria, with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.57, 0.75], 0.72 [0.66. 0.79], and 0.74 [0.62, 0.88], respectively), and in participants with and without cardiovascular disease (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.61, 0.74] and 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], respectively). The association was evident in per-protocol analyses, which required continuation of the assigned antihyperglycemic medication (empagliflozin or other antihyperglycemics) during follow-up (HR 0.64 [95% CI 0.60, 0.70]), and in analyses requiring concurrent use of metformin in at least the first 90 days of follow-up (HR 0.63 [0.57–0.69]).

Conclusions

Among people with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin use was associated with eGFR preservation, a greater decline in BMI, and a reduced risk of MAKE compared with other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^9da8058a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

The design of EMPA-KIDNEY was finalized in 2018, before the results of CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD were known. The key objective was to assess the effect of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression in a wide range of people with CKD who were at risk of progression to ESKD, including people with or without DM and people with or without albuminuria. The rationale for testing empagliflozin in the full range of people at risk of CKD progression was based on findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and other clinical and experimental data, which showed SGLT-2 inhibitors induce glycosuria and lower BP and albuminuria. An acute dip in eGFR on commencing an SGLT-2 inhibitor is observed, which results from the modulation of renal tubuloglomerular feedback through decreased proximal tubular sodium resorption and subsequent glomerular afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Such an effect could decrease glomerular barotrauma resulting from hyperfiltration induced by diabetes, obesity or decreased nephron number (i.e. in people with low eGFR). EMPA-REG OUTCOME data also raised the hypothesis — which has recently been confirmed in the EMPEROR trials — that empagliflozin has the potential to prevent or treat the particular types of heart disease experienced by people with CKD. Further details of EMPA-KIDNEY's rationale are described in a separate publication. Establishing definitive evidence of safety and efficacy in the full range of people with CKD with and without DM has particular public health importance as, worldwide, 50–70% of people with CKD do not have DM. In this article we describe the design, recruitment and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial and put this information in the context of other published trial data.

### Efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with Heart Failure across kidney risk Categories [^6886dcea]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin reduces the risk of major heart failure outcomes in heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease in a pooled analysis of EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Reduced or Preserved Ejection Fraction, respectively).

Methods

A total of 9,718 patients were grouped into Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) categories based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio into low-, moderate-, high-, and very-high-risk categories, comprising 32.0%, 29.1%, 21.9%, and 17.0% of the participants, respectively.

Results

In the placebo arm, when compared with lower risk categories, patients at higher risk experienced a slower rate of decline in eGFR, but a higher risk of a composite kidney event. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalizations similarly in all KDIGO categories (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66–1.01 for low-; HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.52–0.76 for moderate-; HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68–0.98 for high-; and HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71–1.01 for very-high-risk groups; P trend = 0.30). Empagliflozin reduced the rate of decline in eGFR whether it was estimated by chronic slope, total slope, or unconfounded slope. When compared with the unconfounded slope, the magnitude of the effect on chronic slope was larger, and the effect on total slope was smaller. In EMPEROR-Reduced, patients at lowest risk experienced the largest effect of empagliflozin on eGFR slope; this pattern was not observed in EMPEROR-Preserved.

Conclusions

The benefit of empagliflozin on major heart failure events was not influenced by KDIGO categories. The magnitude of the renal effects of the drug depended on the approach used to calculate eGFR slopes.

KDIGO diabetes and CKD guideline updates — sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: The update moved SGLT2 inhibitors to the comprehensive care chapter, reduced the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) threshold for initiating therapy from 30 to 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and added a practice point that SGLT2 inhibitors are beneficial for chronic kidney disease (CKD) even in the absence of diabetes and can be added to existing regimens; major publications cited include DAPA-CKD, SCORED, EMPA-Kidney, SOLOIST, and EMPEROR-Preserved.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^210e1c48]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Key trial strengths are its large size and broad eligibility criteria, the high level of adherence to study treatment, and the almost complete follow-up of all participants.

The trial has certain limitations, including the lower-than-expected cardiovascular event rate, which reduced statistical power to assess the secondary or tertiary cardiovascular outcomes. Nevertheless, the hazard ratios for cardiovascular outcomes are consistent with the totality of the evidence: a meta-analysis of the other CKD trials indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors lower risk of cardiovascular death by 16% (0.84; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97) and the composite of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death by 27% (0.73; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.82).

In summary, in a broad range of patients with CKD, including large numbers without diabetes, with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2, and with low urinary ACR, we found that empagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney disease progression or death from cardiovascular causes in a broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in subjects with renal impairment [^719123ad]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Empagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that inhibits renal glucose reabsorption and is being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

In this open-label study, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of a 50mg dose of empagliflozin was investigated in 40 subjects, grouped according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Results

Maximum empagliflozin plasma concentrations were similar in subjects with normal renal function and renal impairment. Area under the empagliflozin concentration-time curve (AUC0 -∞) values increased by approximately 18, 20, 66 and 48% in subjects with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and renal failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), respectively, in comparison to healthy subjects. This was attributed to decreased renal clearance (CLR). Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) decreased with increasing renal impairment and correlated with decreased eGFR and CLR. Empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase in adverse events associated with renal impairment.

Conclusions

Renal insufficiency resulted in decreased CLR of empagliflozin, moderately increased systemic exposure and decreased UGE. A single 50mg dose of empagliflozin was well tolerated in subjects with normal renal function and any degree of renal impairment. The pharmacokinetic results of this study indicate that no dose adjustment of empagliflozin is required in patients with renal impairment.

### How do SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidney? A mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^3b5d1b77]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mechanisms underlying kidney benefits with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition in heart failure and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D) with established cardiovascular disease are currently unclear.

Methods

We evaluated post hoc the factors mediating the effect of empagliflozin on a composite kidney outcome (first sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 40% reduction from baseline, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death due to kidney disease) in EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Variables, calculated as change from baseline or updated mean, were evaluated as time-dependent covariates and using a landmark approach (at Week 12) in Cox regression analyses. In multivariable analyses, variables with the greatest mediating effect were added using a step-up procedure.

Results

In univariable time-dependent updated mean covariate analyses, the strongest mediator was hematocrit (99.5% mediation). Hemoglobin, uric acid and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio mediated 79.4%, 33.2% and 31.0%, respectively. Multivariable analyses were not performed due to the very strong mediation effect of hematocrit. In univariable Week 12 landmark change from baseline analyses, the strongest mediators included hematocrit (40.7%), glycated hemoglobin (28.3%), systolic blood pressure (16.8%) and free fatty acids (16.5%), which yielded a combined mediation of 78.9% in multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

Changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin were the strongest mediators of empagliflozin's kidney benefits in EMPA-REG OUTCOME participants with T2D and cardiovascular disease.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) — cardiorenal effects and prioritization — are summarized, noting that SGLT2is "continue to exert their renal protective benefit for those with low eGFRs (eg, < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2)" and "modestly increase LDL-C levels (4 to 8 mg/dL)". Cardiovascular outcome trials report "Empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated reduction in MACE in CVOTs; empagliflozin also demonstrated decreased CV death and all-cause mortality" and "Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin have shown a decrease in hospitalization for HF in their CVOTs". Regulatory indications include that "the FDA has given canagliflozin an indication to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria" and "Dapagliflozin based on the DAPA-CKD RCT has received an FDA indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with CKD at risk of progression". Consequently, "individuals with T2D at significant risk for or with established ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD should be treated with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit for the individual's specific conditions".

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the diabetic kidney [^8893aa61]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Blood glucose and blood pressure control reduce the risk of developing this complication; however, once DN is established, it is only possible to slow progression. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, the most recent glucose-lowering oral agents, may have the potential to exert nephroprotection not only through improving glycemic control but also through glucose-independent effects, such as blood pressure-lowering and direct renal effects. It is important to consider, however, that in patients with impaired renal function, given their mode of action, SGLT2 inhibitors are less effective in lowering blood glucose. In patients with high cardiovascular risk, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin lowered the rate of cardiovascular events, especially cardiovascular death, and substantially reduced important renal outcomes. Such benefits on DN could derive from effects beyond glycemia. Glomerular hyperfiltration is a potential risk factor for DN. In addition to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renal tubular factors, including SGLT2, contribute to glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, causing, through tubuloglomerular feedback, afferent arteriole vasoconstriction and reduction in hyperfiltration. Experimental studies showed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced hyperfiltration and decreased inflammatory and fibrotic responses of proximal tubular cells. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced glomerular hyperfiltration in patients with type 1 diabetes, and in patients with type 2 diabetes, they caused transient acute reductions in glomerular filtration rate, followed by a progressive recovery and stabilization of renal function. Interestingly, recent studies consistently demonstrated a reduction in albuminuria. Although these data are promising, only dedicated renal outcome trials will clarify whether SGLT2 inhibitors, in addition to their glycemic and blood pressure benefits, may provide nephroprotective effects.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and kidney outcomes by glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria: a meta-analysis [^2e4b1667]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in individuals with type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure. However, their effects in those with stage 4 CKD or little to no albuminuria remain uncertain.

Objective

To assess whether estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or degree of albuminuria, measured by urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), modifies the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes.

Data Sources

SGLT2 inhibitor trials participating in the SGLT2 Inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists' Consortium (SMART-C).

Study Selection

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials within SMART-C evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor with label indications for reducing CKD progression including at least 500 participants in each group with at least 6 months of follow-up.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Treatment effects in individual trials were pooled using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

CKD progression, defined as kidney failure, at least 50% reduction in eGFR, or death due to kidney failure. Other outcomes included annual rate of eGFR decline and kidney failure.

Results

Among 70 361 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.8 [8.7] years; 24 595 [35.0%] females) in 10 randomized trials, 2314 (3.3%) experienced CKD progression and 988 (1.4%) reached kidney failure. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of CKD progression (25.4 vs 40.3 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.57–0.68]), irrespective of baseline eGFR (HR of 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52–0.71] for eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; 0.57 [95% CI, 0.47–0.70] for eGFR of 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; 0.64 [95% CI, 0.54–0.75] for eGFR of 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; and 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60–0.83] for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; P for trend = .16) and baseline albuminuria (HR of 0.58 [95% CI, 0.44–0.76] for albuminuria ≤ 30 mg/g; 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57–0.96] for > 30–300 mg/g; and 0.57 [95% CI, 0.52–0.64] for more than 300 mg/g; P for trend = .49). Although the magnitude of protection varied, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the annual rate of eGFR decline across all eGFR and UACR subgroups, including when participants with and without diabetes were analyzed separately. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of kidney failure alone (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.75]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were found to lower the risk of CKD progression regardless of baseline eGFR or albuminuria, including in patients with stage 4 CKD or minimal albuminuria, supporting their routine use to improve kidney outcomes across the full spectrum of kidney function among patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure.

SGLT2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease — effects on kidney failure across randomized trials show reduced risk versus placebo overall and by diabetes status, with kidney failure defined as sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) thresholds, maintenance dialysis, or kidney transplantation. Across all trials, SGLT2 inhibitors had 382/7658 events versus 547/7656 with placebo with a relative risk of 0.67 (0.59, 0.77). In participants with diabetes, the subtotal relative risk was 0.66 (0.56, 0.77). Among those without diabetes, DAPA-CKD showed 0.56 (0.36, 0.87) and EMPA-KIDNEY showed 0.80 (0.60, 1.07). Heterogeneity by diabetes status was reported as P = 0.54. Kidney failure was defined as a composite of eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 (or eGFR < 10 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 in EMPA-KIDNEY), maintenance dialysis, or kidney transplantation; data for kidney failure were not available for SCORED.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a bench to bedside review [^9f8096d9]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Additional trials addressing the safety, tolerability, and PK/PD of empagliflozin in patients with either renal or hepatic impairment have recently been reported. An open-label trial grouped 40 patients by estimated glomerular filtration rate to study the impact of renal impairment on the PK/PD profile of a single dose of empagliflozin 50 mg. In patients with renal impairment, peak plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were similar to those with normal renal function. In comparison to patients with normal renal function, total plasma exposure (area under the concentration–time curve from zero to infinity) and the maximum plasma concentration (C max) were modestly increased (Table 2), most likely owing to decreased renal clearance of the drug. Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment had slightly decreased UGE compared with patients with normal renal function; those with severe impairment or renal failure had lower UGE. This suggests that while empagliflozin may be used without dose adjustments in patients with any degree of renal impairment, reductions in plasma glucose levels would be predicted to be less clinically meaningful for those with severe renal impairment.

### Evaluating the overall renal outcomes of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^e188cfa1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Our meta-analysis fills gaps by assessing sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors' renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients including long-term effects and the subgroup analyses of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values and follow-up times.

Methods

The literature search of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central from the inception to 8 June 2023 on patients with CKD treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. We selected medical subject heading (MeSH) terms and free text terms associated with gliflozin and RCT. We calculated odds ratio (OR) or harzard ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for composite outcomes and dichotomous data, and weighted mean differences (WMD) for changes in eGFR.

Results

16 RCTs enrolling 52,306 patients were in the final population, with 26,910 being treated with SGLT2 inhibitors and 25,396 serving as controls were identified. We found that there was no decline in the rate of change in eGFR after 13 weeks and SGLT2 inhibitors treatment significantly improved the rate of change in eGFR after 64 weeks (64–104 weeks: WMD, 1.024 mL/min/1.73m 2 /per year, 95% CI 0.643–1.406; 104 weeks: 0.978, 0.163–1.794).SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.836; 95% CI 0.747–0.936; I² = 0%), mainly derived from empagliflozin (P = 0.001) and increased the incidence of volume-related adverse events (AEs) by 23%. However, no statically differences were observed in death due to kidney disease (P = 0.182) or events of eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P = 0.202).

Conclusions

The results of our meta-analysis showed that after 64 weeks of treatment, SGLT2 inhibitors showed a significant benefit on eGFR rate with no further decline after 13 weeks and the improvement was slighter in lower eGFR values. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce AKI when using empagliflozin, while there is an increased risk of volume-related AEs exclusively in stage 2 CKD. Trial registration CRD42023437061.

### Renal safety of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^14b26232]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of renal‐related AEs in the pooling of 7 studies from the canagliflozin clinical development programme was low and similar with canagliflozin and non‐canagliflozin, with the incidence of these AEs consistent with canagliflozin over 2 years. Renal‐related AEs occurred earlier after treatment initiation with canagliflozin compared with glimepiride. These results are consistent with an analysis of renal‐related AEs with canagliflozin in a pooled population from four 26‐week, placebo‐controlled studies 12 and with results from the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME study of the SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, where an increased incidence of acute kidney injury was observed with empagliflozin compared with placebo in the first 90 days of treatment, but the incidence was lower with empagliflozin vs placebo over the duration of the study. 13 The early onset of renal‐related AEs with canagliflozin in clinical trials and AEs of acute kidney injury reported to the FDA 4 probably reflect the acute initial changes in eGFR as a result of renal haemodynamic effects with canagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors. 2 This decline in eGFR is reversible, as eGFR values return to baseline after discontinuation of canagliflozin, suggesting no permanent renal damage. 14 Additionally, there are no preclinical and clinical data indicating permanent renal damage or toxicity. 2 This profile is consistent with the renal effects of RAAS inhibitors, which are associated with acute changes in renal function, with drug initiation and renoprotective effects over longer treatment duration. 15 It has been hypothesized that the haemodynamic effects with SGLT2 inhibition may attenuate glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria, providing a similar renoprotective effect for patients with T2DM. 1, 14 In a post hoc analysis of renal outcomes in the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin was associated with a slower progression of kidney disease and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events compared with placebo in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. 16 Consistently, in a post hoc analysis of the 104‐week add‐on to metformin vs glimepiride study, canagliflozin was associated with a lower rate of eGFR decline vs glimepiride, further suggesting that canagliflozin may slow the progression of kidney function decline in patients with T2DM. 17 Evaluating patients' volume status before initiating SGLT2 inhibitors and maintaining adequate fluid intake during treatment may minimize the risk of acute kidney injury.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor trials and impact at lower eGFR: Inclusion thresholds were eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in DAPA-CKD and ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in EMPA-Kidney; the primary composite kidney outcome — end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or ≥ 40% decline from baseline, or renal or cardiovascular death — was reduced by 28% (95% CI, 18%-36%). In EMPA-Kidney, of 6,609 participants, 34.5% had an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and this stratum showed a 27% (95% CI, 14%-38%) reduction, and post hoc DAPA-CKD analyses in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a 27% (95% CI, 2%-47%) reduction. Expanding the lower limit at which an SGLT2 inhibitor may be initiated provides additional options for treatment to more than 750,000 US adults living with stage 4 CKD, 39% of whom have diabetes.

### Kidney outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus did not differ between individual sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [^2084b092]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

Data comparing kidney outcomes between individual sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are limited. Here, we aimed to compare the subsequent risk of developing kidney outcomes between individual inhibitors. This would be the first study to compare kidney outcomes of patients with diabetes mellitus who were newly treated with individual SGLT2 inhibitors using a large-scale real-world dataset. To do this, we analyzed results from 12,100 patients with diabetes mellitus who were taking different SGLT2 inhibitors (2,573 with empagliflozin; 2,214 with dapagliflozin; 2,100 with canagliflozin; and 5,213 with other such inhibitors). The primary outcome was the rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline as assessed using a linear mixed-effects model with an unstructured covariance. The median age of the patients was 53 years, and 84.4% of the patients were men. The median fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels were 147 (interquartile range 126–178) mg/dL and 7.5 (6.9–8.4)%, respectively. The median eGFR was 78 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (interquartile range 68–90). The mean follow-up period was 773 days. The annual eGFR slopes of empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and other SGLT2 inhibitors were -1.15 (95% confidence interval, -1.33 to -0.96), -1.14 (-1.32 to -0.96), -1.24 (-1.44 to -1.04), and -1.06 (-1.18 to -0.94) ml/min/1.73 m 2, respectively. No significant interaction was detected between the SGLT2 inhibitors and time using a linear mixed-effects model. A multitude of sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our primary results. Thus, we found that there was no significant difference in the annual eGFR decline slopes between patients taking different SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease? [^66bc6106]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

This year the medical community was pleasantly surprised by the results of the first large outcome trial that primarily examined the renal effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin (CANA) in subjects with diabetes and impaired kidney function. The Evaluation of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants With Diabetic Nephropathy (CREDENCE) trial showed that CANA, relative to placebo, reduces the risk for end-stage renal disease, doubling of creatinine or renal death by 34% [hazard ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53–0.81]. These effects were consistent across baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and haemoglobin A1c subgroups. In this review we combine the results of the CREDENCE trial with those of several cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors and show that, unexpectedly, patients with lower eGFR levels may have greater benefit with respect to cardiovascular outcome than patients with normal kidney function. The cardio- and renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be independent of their glucose-lowering effects, as shown in several post hoc analyses. In this review we discuss the alleged mechanisms of action that explain the beneficial effects of this novel class of drugs. Moreover, we discuss whether these findings indicate that this class of drugs may also be beneficial in non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases.

### Acute and chronic effects of SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on renal oxygenation and blood pressure control in nondiabetic normotensive subjects: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^6a1f0942]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin is a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with the unique property of decreasing blood glucose independently from insulin, by enhancing renal glucose excretion. The recent 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines developed in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend SGLT2i as initial therapy for patients with T2DM at high risk of cardiovascular disease to reduce cardiovascular and renal events and hospitalization for heart failure. The guidelines also recommend empagliflozin to reduce mortality in those with established cardiovascular disease. 1

Although landmark studies with SGLT2 inhibitors included T2DM individuals, there is growing evidence that the cardiorenal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are due to mechanisms beyond glucose control. Randomized, controlled trials and observational studies with SGLT2 inhibitors showed renal protective effects independent from glucose control. 2, 3 Very recently, the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure study demonstrated a significant decrease in worsening of heart failure or death in nondiabetic individuals with reduced ejection fraction. 4 Rapid forced diuresis with SGLT2 inhibition has salutary hemodynamic effects on the heart in people with high cardiovascular risk. The effect on the kidney is more complex. SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the concomitant active reabsorption of sodium and glucose in the proximal tubule. They also induce an acute and reversible decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria followed by a long‐term slowing of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and albuminuria progression. 3, 5 Several potential mechanisms may explain the beneficial effects of SGLT2i on renal disease progression, such as a decrease in glomerular hyperfiltration, a reduction in blood pressure, and an increase in urinary sodium excretion. 6, 7, 8 Because active sodium reabsorption is the main determinant of renal oxygen consumption, many have hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibition may lead to a decrease in cortical oxygen utilization and an increase in tissue oxygenation, and thereby protect kidney function. 9, 10 Recent studies have shown a significant association between cortical renal tissue oxygenation and the progression of chronic kidney disease in humans. 11 It is currently not known whether the nephroprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are related to improved renal oxygenation.

### A randomized, open-label, clinical trial examined the effects of canagliflozin on albuminuria and eGFR decline using an individual pre-intervention eGFR slope [^2714a4c4]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Demonstrating drug efficacy in slowing kidney disease progression requires large clinical trials when targeting participants with an early stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this randomized, parallel-group, open-labeled trial (CANPIONE study), we assessed the effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin using the individual's change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope before (pre-intervention slope) and during treatment (chronic slope). We randomly assigned (1:1) participants with type 2 diabetes, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 50 to under 300 mg/g, and an eGFR of at least 45 ml/min/1.73m 2 to receive canagliflozin or guideline-recommended treatment except for SGLT2 inhibitors (control). The first and second primary outcomes were the geometric mean percentage change from baseline in UACR and the change in eGFR slope, respectively. Of 98 randomized participants, 96 received at least one study treatment. The least-squares mean change from baseline in log-transformed geometric mean UACR was significantly greater in the canagliflozin group than the control group (between group-difference, -30.8% (95% confidence interval -42.6 to -16.8). The between-group difference (canagliflozin group - control group) of change in eGFR slope (chronic - pre-intervention) was 4.4 (1.6 to 7.3) ml/min/1.73 m 2 per year, which was more pronounced in participants with faster eGFR decline. In summary, canagliflozin reduced albuminuria and the participant-specific natural course of eGFR decline in participants with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. Thus, the CANPIONE study suggests that the within-individual change in eGFR slope may be a novel approach to determine the kidney protective potential of new therapies in early stages of CKD.

### Short-term changes in albuminuria and risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^d27c59de]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Early reduction in albuminuria with an SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitor may be a positive indicator of long-term cardiovascular and renal benefits. We assessed changes in albuminuria during the first 12 weeks of treatment and subsequent long-term cardiovascular and renal risks associated with the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial. Methods and Results We calculated the percentage urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) change from baseline to week 12 in 6820 participants who did not experience a cardiovascular outcome (including 3-point major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure) or renal outcome (defined as 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, need for continuous renal-replacement therapy, or renal death) during the first 12 weeks. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for each 30% reduction in UACR with outcomes. Empagliflozin reduced UACR by 18% (95% CI, 14–22) at week 12 compared with placebo, and increased the likelihood of a > 30% reduction in UACR (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.27–1.58; P < 0.001). During 3.0 years of follow-up, 704 major cardiovascular events, 440 cardiovascular deaths/hospitalizations for heart failure, and 168 renal outcomes were observed. Each 30% decrease in UACR during the first 12 weeks was statistically significantly associated with a lower hazard for major cardiovascular events (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99; P = 0.012), cardiovascular deaths/hospitalizations for heart failure (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.98; P = 0.003), and renal outcomes (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78–0.89; P < 0.001). Conclusions Short-term reduction in UACR was more common with empagliflozin and was statistically significantly associated with a decreased risk of long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

The main pre-specified renal composite outcome of new or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) was significantly reduced by 39%, and doubling of serum creatinine with an eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73m 2 was reduced by 44% when adding empagliflozin to standard of care.

Significant benefits were also seen in several other prespecified renal parameters, including a 32% RRR in new or worsening nephropathy or CV death (p < 0.001); 38% RRR in progression to macroalbuminuria (p < 0.001); and 55% RRR in initiation of renal replacement therapy (p = 0.04). The only exception was incident albuminuria in patients with a normal albumin level at baseline, where no significant difference between study arms was observed.

The renal results in EMPA-REG OUTCOME indicate that empagliflozin delays the progression of renal disease when compared with placebo. The change in eGFR over time also supports a nephroprotective effect: after an initial fall when empagliflozin therapy was started, the eGFR of subjects on empagliflozin recovered somewhat and subsequently remained stable, whereas those on placebo demonstrated a steady decline over the period of the study. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis showed that the renal benefits seen with empagliflozin in the full study cohort were consistent in a subgroup of patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, defined as having an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 and/or macroalbuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g).

Despite the promising renal results, it should be noted that EMPA-REG OUTCOME was a CV trial with 3P-MACE as the primary endpoint, and therefore we await the results of an ongoing dedicated renal study before making a more conclusive assessment of empagliflozin in this setting. Furthermore, in accordance with local prescribing information and licences for SGLT2 inhibitors, if the eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 then empagliflozin should not be initiated and must be discontinued if the eGFR persistently falls below 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

### Empagliflozin and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across KDIGO risk categories: analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial [^3a17469b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG Outcome), empagliflozin, in addition to standard of care, significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular death by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Using EMPA-REG Outcome data, we assessed whether the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD classification had an influence on the treatment effect of empagliflozin.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Patients with type 2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. Post hoc, we analyzed cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and safety, using the two-dimensional KDIGO classification framework.

Results

Of 6952 patients with baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio values, 47%, 29%, 15%, and 8% were classified into low, moderately increased, high, and very high KDIGO risk categories, respectively. Empagliflozin showed consistent risk reductions across KDIGO categories for cardiovascular outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.26 to 0.85) and kidney outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.16 to 0.60). In all KDIGO risk categories, placebo and empagliflozin had similar adverse event rates, the notable exception being genital infection events, which were more common with empagliflozin for each category.

Conclusions

The observed effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were consistent across the KDIGO risk categories, indicating that the effect of treatment benefit of empagliflozin was unaffected by baseline CKD status.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^9d769955]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

The acute dip in eGFR when empagliflozin was initiated in EMPA-KIDNEY was modest (in all participant subgroups it was on average less than 3 mL/min/1.73m 2 or < 10% of baseline eGFR), and was largely reversible when treatment was discontinued. The acute effect was larger among participants with diabetes compared to those without (on both absolute and relative scales) which may reflect the greater prevalence and degree of hyperfiltration in this group. The acute effect of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney function was recognised early in the development of the class (although not in all studies) and is believed to be due to the acute reduction in intraglomerular pressure caused by afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction stimulated by increased sodium delivery to the macula densa. The associated rapid reduction in albuminuria supports this hypothesis, and this reduction in intraglomerular pressure is one of the postulated mechanisms of the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney function. Our exploratory analyses suggest that the reduction in albuminuria may be the most important measured determinant of the benefits observed in EMPA-KIDNEY, explaining one fifth of the effect on chronic slopes and two fifths of the effect on the primary composite outcome of kidney disease progression, consistent with analyses from other trials in CKD. These analyses need to be interpreted with some caution as they could be subject to bias due to measurement error and residual mediator-outcome confounding. Whether this association is due to avoidance of direct toxic effects of albumin on tubular function, a reduction in intraglomerular pressure or another unmeasured correlate of urinary albumin is not clear. However, these analyses also suggest that the other mechanisms unrelated to albuminuria, blood pressure or glycaemic control contribute to the benefit of SGTL2 inhibition on kidney function.

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME: the nephrologist's point of view [^8e67385f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have renoprotective effects, as demonstrated by the renal analyses from clinical trials including Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis versus SUlphonylurea (CANTATA-SU), and the dapagliflozin renal study. The potential mechanisms responsible are likely multifactorial, and direct renovascular and hemodynamic effects are postulated to play a central role. This report reviews the renal outcomes data from key SGLT2 inhibitor clinical trials, discusses the hypotheses for SGLT2 inhibitor-associated renoprotection, and considers the main renal safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

### Renal effects of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: from the EMPULSE trial [^5f111c7c]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure. In patients with chronic heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors cause an early decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) followed by a slower eGFR decline over time than placebo. However, the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function during a hospital admission for acute heart failure remain largely unknown.

Methods and Results

Between 1 and 5days after a hospitalization for acute heart failure, 530 patients with an eGFR > 20 mL/min/1.73 m² were randomized to 10 mg of empagliflozin or placebo and treated for 90days. Renal function and electrolytes were measured at baseline, and after 15, 30 and 90days. We evaluated the effect of empagliflozin on eGFR over time and the impact of baseline eGFR on the primary hierarchical outcome of death, worsening heart failure events and quality of life. Mean baseline eGFR was 52.4 ml/min/1.73m 2 in the empagliflozin group and 55.7 ml/min/1.73m 2 in the placebo group. Empagliflozin caused an initial decline in eGFR (-2 ml/min/1.73m 2 at day 15 compared to placebo). At day 90, eGFR was similar between empagliflozin and placebo. Investigator-reported acute renal failure occurred in 7.7% of empagliflozin versus 12.1% of placebo patients. The overall clinical benefit (hierarchical composite of all-cause death, heart failure events and quality of life) of empagliflozin was unaffected by baseline eGFR.

Conclusion

In patients hospitalized for acute heart failure, empagliflozin caused an early modest decline in renal function which was no longer evident after 90days. Acute renal events were similar in both groups. The clinical benefit of empagliflozin was consistent regardless of baseline renal function.

### Renal effects of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: from the EMPULSE trial [^d8ee8758]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction. We recently demonstrated that initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients who were hospitalized for acute heart failure resulted in significant clinical benefit in the 90 days after starting treatment.

Randomized clinical trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure all demonstrate similar effects on renal function. During the first weeks of administration, SGLT2 inhibitors cause an initial decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 2–4 ml/min/1.73 m 2. This is followed by a slower decline in eGFR over time than placebo‐treated patients, eventually attenuating a decline in renal function. In addition, acute renal events occur less frequently in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors than those on placebo.,

In patients with acute heart failure, worsening renal function frequently occurs. Worsening renal function may occur during effective decongestion with loop diuretics which is not associated with worse outcomes. In contrast, worsening renal function due to haemodynamic deterioration is associated with an increased risk of worsening heart failure, heart failure readmissions and (cardiovascular) death.

Since changes in renal function are greater and occur more frequently in acute heart failure, drugs that influence renal function might have a distinct impact on changes in eGFR during a hospitalization for heart failure. Further, changes in eGFR may influence initiation and continuation of guideline‐directed medical therapies. However, the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors during an acute heart failure hospital admission have not been well established. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of empagliflozin on renal function and renal events during hospital admission and early after discharge. Secondly, we aimed to explore the effects of empagliflozin on mortality, heart failure events and quality of life across the eGFR spectrum.

Primary endpoint according to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate

There was no evidence of effect modification of baseline eGFR on the primary outcome of EMPULSE. The win ratio (and 95% confidence interval) for the patients with an eGFR < 45, 45 to < 60 and ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 was 1.56 (1.08–2.25), 1.14 (0.73–1.78) and 1.48 (1.04–2.13), respectively (p ‐value for interaction = 0.5400) (Figure 3).

Similarly, baseline eGFR did not modify the effect of empagliflozin on the composite secondary outcome of cardiovascular death or a heart failure event: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.54 (0.28–1.04) for eGFR < 45, 0.91 (0.35–2.35) for eGFR 45 to < 60, and 0.82 (0.35–1.91) for eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (p ‐value for trend = 0.4079; Table 2).

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: insights from EMPEROR-reduced [^06781862]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

In EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and first and recurrent hospitalizations for HF, slowed the progressive decline in kidney function, and reduced the risk of serious kidney events in patients with and without diabetes. Importantly, in EMPEROR-Reduced, patients were eligible for enrollment with an eGFR as low as 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and more than half of the patients had prevalent CKD at baseline. Thus, the trial afforded the opportunity of investigating the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin on cardiac and kidney outcomes according to CKD and across a wide range of kidney function; these findings were a prespecified analysis of EMPEROR-Reduced.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^0f6e2a89]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The mechanisms for any persisting effects of SGLT2 inhibitors still need to be elucidated. Preservation of nephron number during the active trial period might conceivably reduce hyperfiltration and risk of ESKD, and preservation of kidney function may have mediated some of the post-trial observed benefits on cardiovascular death. The acute eGFR dip with SGLT2 inhibition reversed within 4 weeks after discontinuation, so some of the observed post-trial benefit on eGFR components of kidney disease progression could result from reversal of the acute eGFR dip after cessation of study drug. However, that does not explain continuing benefits on ESKD.

Participants who did not start an SGLT2 inhibitor had twice the predicted risk of kidney failure of participants who started an SGLT2 inhibitor post-trial. This phenomenon may reflect some uncertainty about the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibition in those with more advanced CKD, and inertia in changes in practice owing to the time taken for regulatory/payer approvals. This prognostic imbalance implies, in particular, that any comparison of outcomes between participants allocated empagliflozin who started an SGLT2 inhibitor post-trial versus those allocated placebo who remained off SGLT2 inhibition post-trial will be confounded, and hence unreliable.

Current international guidance on use of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD provide recommendations of different strengths for patients who were eligible for EMPA-KIDNEY based on different levels of albuminuria. The almost doubling of the number of first primary outcomes from 990 in the active trial's report to 1866 after post-trial follow-up appears to help us to address uncertainties resulting from the active trial period. Benefits on the post-trial follow-up primary outcome, kidney disease progression, and difference in eGFR on last measurement were similar irrespective of level of albuminuria, as well as diabetes status, level of kidney function, and primary kidney diagnosis. This is consistent with effects on eGFR-slope from the active trial phase.

Our trial was designed to ensure that findings would be widely generalizable. Other key strengths of this trial were its large size and broad eligibility criteria, high levels of adherence to study drug, the high volunteer rate for post-trial follow-up, and the almost complete follow-up. Post-trial follow-up addresses some of the limitations of the active trial, including its low number of cardiovascular deaths.

Adults with heart failure

GLP1RAs have not shown benefit for heart failure outcomes in individual randomised controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes, although meta-analyses of these studies suggested a potential benefit.SGLT2is, by contrast, have consistently shown significant benefit for heart failure outcomes. Also, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin were beneficial in people with reduced or preserved ejection fraction without type 2 diabetes, and have an indication for improving heart failure outcomes. Accordingly, in people with heart failure, an SGLT2i with known benefit should be started to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and worsening heart failure.

Adults with chronic kidney disease

GLP1RAs have shown benefit for secondary kidney related outcomes in large individual randomised controlled trialsand meta-analysesof cardiovascular outcomes, but dedicated kidney outcome trials are ongoing. Several SGLT2is, including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin, have shown benefit in adults with chronic kidney disease with or without type 2 diabetes and in dedicated kidney outcome trials, and have an indication for improving chronic kidney disease outcomes. Therefore, SGLT2is with primary evidence are preferred for individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or albuminuria, or both, to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease. If SGLT2is are not tolerated or cannot be used, GLP1RAs with demonstrated renal benefit are a reasonable alternative. Current prescribing information allows SGLT2is to be started in adults with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for kidney benefit, although the glucose lowering effects are substantially reduced at an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. A small reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate can be seen after starting treatment with SGLT2is because of reversal or correction of the previous hyperfiltration state in adults with diabetes, but it does not predict further reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate or require discontinuation of treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often a progressive condition, with albuminuria representing an important risk factor for a more rapid decline in kidney function. Slowing of progression and avoidance of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD, also referred to as kidney failure), is highly desirable due to the associated excess morbidity and mortality, adverse effects on quality of life and the substantial costs of renal replacement therapy. Inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) decrease albuminuria and slow the rate of progression in albuminuric kidney diseases. People with CKD are also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, a key feature of which is structural heart disease, heart failure and sudden death. Increased risk of coronary heart disease also accompanies CKD. Lowering blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with CKD decrease cardiovascular risk, but despite such interventions, substantial residual risk remains. There is a need for new treatments that can be safely added to the current standard of care to slow the progression to ESKD and decrease cardiovascular risk in CKD.

Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) cause urinary glucose and increased sodium excretion and can decrease weight and BP as well as glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial of empagliflozin was the first large-scale placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trial to report the effects of an SGLT-2 inhibitor in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Results showed empagliflozin could favourably decrease not only the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but also the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and the development or worsening of nephropathy. Since then, several other large placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trials with other SGLT-2 inhibitors have reported analogous findings. Trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure or CKD have also reported relative risk reductions for renal and heart failure outcomes that are similar in size in people with and without DM.

### Short-term changes in albuminuria and risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^8088fff4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Early reduction in albuminuria with an SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitor may be a positive indicator of long‐term cardiovascular and renal benefits. We assessed changes in albuminuria during the first 12 weeks of treatment and subsequent long‐term cardiovascular and renal risks associated with the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, in the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial.

Methods and Results

We calculated the percentage urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) change from baseline to week 12 in 6820 participants who did not experience a cardiovascular outcome (including 3‐point major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure) or renal outcome (defined as 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, need for continuous renal‐replacement therapy, or renal death) during the first 12 weeks. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for each 30% reduction in UACR with outcomes. Empagliflozin reduced UACR by 18% (95% CI, 14–22) at week 12 compared with placebo, and increased the likelihood of a > 30% reduction in UACR (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.27–1.58; P < 0.001). During 3.0 years of follow‐up, 704 major cardiovascular events, 440 cardiovascular deaths/hospitalizations for heart failure, and 168 renal outcomes were observed. Each 30% decrease in UACR during the first 12 weeks was statistically significantly associated with a lower hazard for major cardiovascular events (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99; P = 0.012), cardiovascular deaths/hospitalizations for heart failure (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.98; P = 0.003), and renal outcomes (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78–0.89; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Short‐term reduction in UACR was more common with empagliflozin and was statistically significantly associated with a decreased risk of long‐term cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

SGLT2 inhibitors and dialysis

Many health organizations recommend discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in patients with severe renal impairment; however, clinical trials have been conducted in patients receiving dialysis. The recommendation is to consider SGLT2is in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hospitalized heart failure patients if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is greater than 20 ml/min/1.73 m². There are no contraindications for low-dose use: the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin should not exceed 10 mg/day, and canagliflozin should not exceed 25 mg/day. Recent guidelines do not advocate initiating SGLT2is in patients receiving dialysis with heart failure and recommend discontinuation if the patient is off dialysis.

A recent trial involving 125 patients with eGFRs below 30 ml/min/1.73 m² and stage 5 dialysis (G5D) demonstrated the effectiveness of dapagliflozin and the non-adenosine nature of the treatment. The data provide solid evidence supporting the use of SGLT2is in patients on dialysis. Three phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating SGLT2is, aimed at understanding their impact on kidney survival, cardiovascular events, and mortality, were reviewed to assess benefits for patient management. The nephrology society has modified recommendations for patients with a GFR below 30 ml/min/1.73 m² regarding high doses of the tested SGLT2is. Multidisciplinary stewardship should be applied when using SGLT2is in G5D patients due to patient preferences, the presence of hyperkalemia, fluid restrictions, and comorbidities. Experts advise administering SGLT2is at least 2 h post-dialysis and adjusting doses based on weekly drug clearance.

Type 2 diabetes with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 RA renal guidance: Nearly 50% of U.S. adults with kidney failure have DM, and SGLT2 inhibitors show an approximately 38% reduction in composite adverse renal outcomes; use of an SGLT2i with proven benefit is recommended as foundational therapy to reduce progression of DKD and CV risk for persons with T2D and DKD with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 if HF is also present. Dapagliflozin trials included participants with eGFR ≥ 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (including persons without DM) and empagliflozin trials included eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (including persons with T2D ≥ 20%); dapagliflozin slowed decline more in T2D, while empagliflozin had similar eGFR decline across groups. GLP-1 RAs also are an option for reducing albuminuria progression, eGFR decline, and ASCVD risk in T2D with DKD with eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m^2.

Reproduced with permission from Cherney et al.

Evidence from cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk provided evidence suggesting that this class may also have beneficial renal effects. However, the patient populations enrolled in the CVOTs were generally at low renal risk, with eGFR ranging from 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR < 30 mg/g. In addition, the number of events accumulated was not enough to definitively establish the effects on renal outcomes. For example, in the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program, which was the CVOT for the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, participants had mean eGFR of 76.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2, median UACR of 12.3 mg/g, and 80.0% were receiving a RAAS inhibitor. CVOTs for other SGLT2 inhibitors, including EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin) and DECLARE-TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin), recruited a similar population with low renal risk. As a result of this population profile, the number of renal outcomes accumulated in these trials was too low to definitively determine the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal outcomes; there were only 69 confirmed renal replacement therapy or renal death events across the three studies, which included more than 34,000 participants. Additionally, these studies were not designed to specifically assess the impact of intervention on renal endpoints, so all renal studies were based on secondary, exploratory, or post hoc analyses. Thus, dedicated trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with DKD were necessary to assess the renal benefits afforded through treatment of this population with this class of medications. This article describes the dedicated renal outcomes trial, Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE), which was the first study to demonstrate the renal effects of canagliflozin in people with T2DM and compromised kidney function (i.e. DKD).

### Drugs that slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease: are renoprotective effects attenuated in heart failure? [^2a7d3556]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The totality of evidence does not even support a meaningful renoprotective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure. Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin have been reported to favourably influence the slope of decline in eGFR; however, the calculation of eGFR slopes in these trials are artificially flattened by the exclusion of changes during the first month of treatment, during which patients commonly experience a modest increase in serum creatinine. Yet, the most persuasive renal outcome is not eGFR slope, but the development of end-stage kidney disease, defined as renal replacement therapy or an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m 2. When the four large-scale trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure are combined in a meta-analysis (random-effects model), there is little evidence for a favourable effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the development of end-stage kidney disease [hazard ratio 0.88 (0.61–1.26)], Figure 1. This finding stands in contrast with the 35% reduction in end-stage kidney disease noted in large-scale randomized trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes [hazard ratio 0.65 (0.53–0.81)]. Even when the evaluation of renal outcomes is broadened to include patients with a sustained ≥ 50% decrease in eGFR from baseline, three of the four major heart failure trials with SGLT2 inhibitors (EMPEROR-Preserved, DAPA-HF, and DELIVER) failed to show a benefit of these drugs, based on a total of ≈300 events. In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, the hazard ratio for the reduction in the risk of a major renal outcome with empagliflozin (using the broadened definition of a renal event) was 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61–0.80] in patients without heart failure and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.67–1.47) in patients with heart failure. The lack of a renal benefit in heart failure cannot be explained by differences in the baseline glomerular filtration rate, since the patients in the SGLT2-inhibitor heart failure trials had a glomerular filtration rate in between those with Type 2 diabetes and those with chronic kidney disease, both of whom experienced meaningful nephroprotection with SGLT2 inhibition.

Empagliflozin

Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in eGFR: Initiation of empagliflozin causes an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy and then these changes stabilize. In a trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, larger mean changes were observed. In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial, the increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR generally did not exceed 0.1 mg/dL and -9.0 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, at Week 4, and reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with empagliflozin.

Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C): Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with empagliflozin. LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups.

Increase in Hematocrit: Median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in empagliflozin 10 mg and 2.8% in empagliflozin 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^948c081c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) was published by EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the trial question was: what are the long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with CKD at risk for progression? In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the population was: 4891 patients (1664 female, 3227 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD at risk for progression. The key exclusion criteria were polycystic kidney disease; previous or scheduled bariatric surgery; ketoacidosis in the past 5 years; symptomatic hypotension; hypersensitivity to empagliflozin; intravenous immunosuppressive therapy in the last 3 months; T1DM. In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 2472 empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily in active trial period; in post-trial period, no trial empagliflozin administration, but prescription of open-label SGLT inhibitors including open-label empagliflozin allowed) n = 2419 placebo (matching placebo once daily in active trial period; in post-trial period, no trial placebo administration, but prescription of open-label SGLT inhibitors including open-label empagliflozin allowed). In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death (26.2% vs. 30.3%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87). In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in kidney disease progression (23.5% vs. 27.1%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87) Significant decrease in death from any cause or ESRD (16.9% vs. 19.6%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.9) Significant decrease in ESRD (9% vs. 11.3%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87). In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD at risk for progression, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death.

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: insights from EMPEROR-reduced [^ad100c5a]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney function declines progressively during the course of chronic heart failure. We showed a favorable effect of empagliflozin on kidney function using 3 metrics, ie, slowing of the slope of eGFR over time, attenuation of the decline in eGFR from baseline to the off-treatment assessment at the end of the trial, and a composite of serious kidney events. We noted a nominally significant treatment-by–baseline eGFR interaction for the effect of empagliflozin on the eGFR slope, which was apparent irrespective of whether the analysis categorized patients into 2 or 5 eGFR subgroups. However, these analyses are model-dependent and are based on absolute differences. Given the lower baseline values for eGFR in patients with CKD, the magnitude of benefit on eGFR slope with empagliflozin was proportionally similar in patients with and without CKD; furthermore, absolute declines in eGFR are likely to be more clinically meaningful in patients with CKD, since they accelerate the loss of eGFR to levels that are indicative of end-stage kidney disease. The importance of the effect of empagliflozin on the course of kidney disease in patients with CKD is highlighted by the fact that, when compared with patients without CKD, patients with compromised eGFR experienced similar benefits of empagliflozin to prevent the decline in eGFR. The analyses that compared effects between off-treatment values at baseline and after treatment discontinuation were unconfounded by the presence of the study medication and show that empagliflozin protected the kidney regardless of CKD status. Additionally, both subgroups experienced similar reductions in the risk of the composite kidney outcome.
