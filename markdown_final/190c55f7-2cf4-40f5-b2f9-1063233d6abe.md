## Question

when to stop anticoagulant for dvt

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to stop anticoagulation after deep vein thrombosis, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that treatment has two phases and that 3 months is the minimum primary treatment. Then, I should classify the index event by provoking factors and thrombus location. Next, I will apply scenario-based duration rules, including special populations like cancer and distal DVT. After that, I need to integrate bleeding risk and patient-specific modifiers. Finally, I will outline the decision process at 3 months, monitoring, and a concise summary algorithm, making sure I verify each point against guidelines and key trials as I go [^114cu6jR] [^113Vmqon].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle so I don't jump to conclusions: VTE treatment has a primary phase of about 3 months and, if continued beyond that, an extended phase for secondary prevention, and the decision to stop or extend hinges on balancing recurrence risk against bleeding risk, with patient preference integrated via shared decision-making [^114cu6jR] [^113Vmqon] [^115zvGnP].

> I need to classify the index event carefully because this drives duration. Let me think about provoking factors: major transient (e.g., surgery, major trauma, pregnancy/postpartum), minor transient (e.g., estrogen therapy, prolonged travel, minor injury), persistent/chronic (e.g., active cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease), and truly unprovoked (idiopathic). I should also confirm location: proximal versus distal (calf) DVT, and whether it is a first or recurrent event, since recurrence substantially alters risk and recommendations [^114cu6jR] [^111f9f3G].

> Now, for provoked DVT with a major transient risk factor, I should confirm the default: stop at 3 months, as extended therapy does not meaningfully change long-term recurrence once stopped and simply defers risk, the so-called catch-up phenomenon. Wait, let me verify that both ACCP and ESVS align here; yes, both recommend 3 months rather than longer time-limited courses or indefinite therapy in this scenario [^112yDo3r] [^114hHYAp] [^115LkDuX].

> For unprovoked proximal DVT or PE, hold on, I should verify the nuanced guidance. CHEST suggests completing 3 months and then, if bleeding risk is low to moderate, considering indefinite anticoagulation; if bleeding risk is high, stopping at 3 months is preferred. ASH emphasizes completing a shorter primary course (3–6 months) and then individualizing extended therapy based on recurrence and bleeding risks. ESVS supports extended therapy beyond 3 months in low-to-moderate bleeding risk patients, with periodic reassessment. I should double-check that indefinite therapy reduces recurrence but increases bleeding; yes, meta-analyses and trials show substantial recurrence reduction with extended therapy at the cost of more bleeding, reinforcing the need to individualize [^111vmyRe] [^117GHxSS] [^1169MT4N] [^112ke753].

> Let me consider distal DVT carefully because management differs. Initially, I thought all distal DVT should be treated for 3 months; wait, that's too broad. CHEST 2021 allows serial imaging without anticoagulation for low-risk, asymptomatic isolated distal DVT, but recommends anticoagulation if symptoms are severe or risk factors for extension exist, and if the clot extends proximally, treat as proximal DVT. ESVS advises 3 months of anticoagulation for symptomatic calf DVT and supports serial imaging strategies in selected low-risk patients. I should confirm that randomized data show benefit of anticoagulation over no treatment for distal DVT; the Cochrane review indicates reduced recurrence with VKA but more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, supporting a tailored approach rather than a universal rule [^111HEo8y] [^111w3fPd] [^114E6zAS] [^1143bX3g].

> Cancer-associated thrombosis requires special handling. I should confirm that indefinite anticoagulation is generally recommended while cancer is active, with LMWH historically preferred; however, more recent guidance allows DOACs in many patients, avoiding DOACs in gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignancies with high bleeding risk. Let me verify that both ACCP and ESVS endorse extended therapy and allow DOACs in selected cancer patients; yes, both align with this approach, with periodic reassessment of bleeding and cancer status [^113tE5sk] [^111jy7E4] [^114bkLJS].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers that tilt the balance toward stopping or extending. Male sex, presentation as PE rather than isolated DVT, a positive D-dimer about 1 month after stopping anticoagulation, and residual vein thrombosis on ultrasound increase recurrence risk and favor extended therapy, whereas advanced age, prior bleeding, renal impairment, or high fall risk increase bleeding and favor stopping. I need to ensure I'm not over-weighting any single factor; CHEST notes sex and post-treatment D-dimer can inform decisions but are not definitive on their own, reinforcing shared decision-making [^113Y15wY] [^11582gJN] [^111f9f3G].

> At the 3-month mark, I should confirm the decision process. First, reassess that the acute episode has resolved clinically. Then, weigh recurrence risk against bleeding risk, incorporating provoking factors, thrombus location, sex, D-dimer if measured, and patient preferences. If continuing, I should choose a DOAC when feasible due to lower intracranial bleeding risk and greater convenience; if a VKA is used, target INR 2.0–3.0. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines prefer DOACs for extended therapy; ACCP and ESVS both favor DOACs over VKAs for long-term treatment in appropriate patients [^1127SsdP] [^116c7eSZ] [^116doaNf].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up so I don't miss safety checks. For patients on extended therapy, reassess annually for bleeding, falls, renal function, drug interactions, and cancer status. For those stopping, consider aspirin as a modest-risk-reduction alternative if anticoagulation is no longer acceptable, recognizing it is inferior to anticoagulation for recurrence prevention. I should double-check that CHEST suggests aspirin after stopping in unprovoked VTE; yes, it does, with the caveat that it is not a substitute for anticoagulation when extended therapy is indicated [^111vmyRe] [^113udtMh] [^112mrgRr].

> But wait, what if the initial course was already extended beyond 3 months without a clear indication? I need to ensure I'm not perpetuating unnecessary therapy. The evidence indicates that simply extending primary treatment to 6, 9, or 12 months without moving to indefinite secondary prevention does not confer durable benefit once therapy ends; the critical decision remains whether to stop at 3 months or continue indefinitely, not merely to prolong a finite course. This is precisely why guidelines frame the choice as 3 months versus indefinite, with periodic reassessment if indefinite therapy is chosen [^113Vmqon] [^114cu6jR].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios to avoid gaps. For upper extremity DVT, treat similarly to lower extremity DVT with 3 months for primary events, extending if unprovoked or persistent risk factors exist. For catheter-related thrombosis in cancer, short-course anticoagulation around catheter removal is reasonable in selected cases, though many require standard durations based on underlying risk. I should confirm these points against vascular and thrombosis society guidance; ESVS and ISTH statements support these approaches [^113WaGHJ] [^114ZbRHf] [^1173DASb].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the practical algorithm: treat everyone for at least 3 months; stop at 3 months if the event was provoked by a major transient factor; for unprovoked proximal DVT or PE, continue indefinitely if bleeding risk is low to moderate, otherwise stop at 3 months; for distal DVT, tailor to symptoms and extension risk, using serial imaging in low-risk cases; for cancer, continue anticoagulation as long as cancer is active, favoring LMWH historically and DOACs selectively now; throughout, use DOACs when appropriate, target INR 2.0–3.0 for VKAs, and reassess annually if on extended therapy. I should double-check that this aligns with ACCP, ASH, and ESVS; yes, this synthesis reflects their convergent recommendations [^114cu6jR] [^117GHxSS] [^1169MT4N].

Stop anticoagulation for DVT at **3 months** [^114cu6jR] if the event was provoked by a major transient risk factor (e.g. surgery, trauma, immobilization) [^112yDo3r] and there is no ongoing risk. For unprovoked proximal DVT or PE, **individualize the decision** [^111vmyRe] after 3 months [^117GHxSS] based on bleeding risk, patient preference, and risk factors such as male sex, elevated D-dimer [^113Y15wY], or residual thrombosis [^1151XQXk]. Continue anticoagulation indefinitely for active cancer, recurrent unprovoked VTE, or high-risk thrombophilia [^113tE5sk] [^116fSSds] [^114ATon3]. For distal DVT without high-risk features, **3 months is sufficient** [^114hWAYX]; with high-risk features or extension, treat as proximal DVT [^111HEo8y]. Reassess bleeding and recurrence risk at 3 months [^114cu6jR] and periodically thereafter [^111vmyRe].

## General principles guiding anticoagulation duration

- **Minimum duration**: All patients with acute DVT should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulation [^114cu6jR] to complete primary treatment and reduce recurrence risk [^113JJ3QZ].

- **Risk-benefit assessment**: After 3 months, decisions to continue or stop anticoagulation should balance recurrence risk against bleeding risk and patient preferences [^111vmyRe] [^115zvGnP].

- **Phases of treatment**: Anticoagulation occurs in three phases — initial (first 3 weeks), primary (3 months), and secondary prevention (extended, indefinite) [^113JJ3QZ].

---

## Indications for stopping anticoagulation at 3 months

Anticoagulation can be stopped at **3 months** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Provoked DVT by major transient risk factor (e.g. surgery, trauma, immobilization) | Low recurrence risk after 3 months; extended therapy does not significantly reduce recurrence [^112yDo3r] [^114hHYAp] |
| Isolated distal DVT without high-risk features (symptomatic or asymptomatic) | Low recurrence risk; 3 months sufficient [^114hWAYX] [^114E6zAS] |
| Patient preference for stopping after 3 months, with acceptable recurrence risk | Shared decision-making emphasizing patient autonomy and risk tolerance [^112drn3S] |

---

## Indications for continuing anticoagulation beyond 3 months

Anticoagulation should continue beyond **3 months** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Unprovoked proximal DVT or PE | Higher recurrence risk; extended therapy reduces recurrence [^111vmyRe] [^1157N3ai] |
| Active cancer or cancer-associated thrombosis | High recurrence risk; indefinite anticoagulation recommended [^113tE5sk] [^116ceJ2x] |
| Recurrent unprovoked VTE | High recurrence risk; indefinite anticoagulation recommended [^116fSSds] |
| High-risk thrombophilia (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome, severe protein C/S deficiency) | High recurrence risk; indefinite anticoagulation recommended [^114ATon3] |
| Persistent elevated D-dimer or residual thrombosis on ultrasound | Increased recurrence risk; extended therapy beneficial [^113Y15wY] [^1151XQXk] |

## Factors influencing the decision to stop or continue anticoagulation

Several factors influence whether to stop or continue anticoagulation beyond **3 months**:

- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk (e.g. recent major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, severe thrombocytopenia) favors stopping at 3 months [^111vmyRe] [^114TrNWt].

- **Patient preference**: Patient values, lifestyle, and risk tolerance significantly influence decisions [^114bkLJS] [^115zvGnP].

- **Clinical judgment**: Individualized assessment of recurrence risk, comorbidities, and ongoing risk factors guides decisions [^111vmyRe] [^115LkDuX].

---

## Risks and benefits of stopping anticoagulation

Stopping anticoagulation involves balancing the **risk of recurrent VTE** against the **risk of bleeding**:

- **Recurrence risk**: After stopping anticoagulation, recurrence risk varies by clinical scenario: provoked DVT (~3% per year), unprovoked DVT (~10% per year), cancer-associated VTE (~15% per year) [^115LkDuX] [^1157N3ai].

- **Bleeding risk**: Continuing anticoagulation increases major bleeding risk (~1–2% per year), particularly in elderly patients or those with renal impairment [^1177gLw3].

- **Individualized decision-making**: Decisions should consider patient-specific factors, including age, comorbidities, and lifestyle [^111vmyRe] [^115zvGnP].

---

## Current clinical guidelines summary

Current guidelines provide clear recommendations on **anticoagulation duration**:

- **ACCp 2021**: Complete 3 months of anticoagulation for all patients; assess need for extended therapy thereafter [^114cu6jR].

- **ASH 2020**: Prefer shorter primary treatment (3–6 months) over longer courses; individualize extended therapy based on risk factors [^117GHxSS].

- **ESVS 2021**: Recommend extended anticoagulation for unprovoked proximal DVT at low or moderate bleeding risk; reassess periodically [^1169MT4N].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up after stopping anticoagulation

After stopping anticoagulation, **regular follow-up is essential** to detect recurrence and manage ongoing risk:

- **Clinical surveillance**: Regular visits to assess symptoms, signs of recurrence, and bleeding complications [^111vmyRe].

- **Imaging**: Repeat ultrasound or CT angiography if recurrence is suspected [^11499QrM].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on symptoms of recurrence and when to seek medical attention [^notfound].

---

Stopping anticoagulation for DVT is guided by the **clinical scenario, recurrence risk, bleeding risk, and patient preference**. Most patients complete 3 months of therapy; extended therapy is reserved for unprovoked events, active cancer, recurrent VTE, or high-risk thrombophilia, with decisions reassessed periodically.

### How should we determine length of anticoagulation after proximal deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs? [^11582gJN]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The current approach for deciding the duration of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment after an episode of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is mainly based on the characteristic of the index event (3 months or longer in case of unknown/persistent risk factors, 3 months or less in case of removable causes). However, the length of anticoagulation should be tailored on the patient's risk for recurrent thrombosis as well as for bleeding, but such 'time for decision' is often unclear and the optimal duration of VKA remains debatable. The presence of persistent residual vein thrombosis and increased D-dimer levels after stopping therapy are predictors for recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Management strategies based on these parameters have been demonstrated to optimize the decision for VKA duration, as they establish the patient's intrinsic risk for recurrent events. This annotation discusses current practice and upcoming approaches regarding the length of VKA treatment after a first episode of DVT.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^115sm5Zz]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

It takes about 3 months to complete "active treatment" of venous thromboembolism (VTE), with further treatment serving to prevent new episodes of thrombosis ("pure secondary prevention"). Consequently, VTE should generally be treated for either 3 months or indefinitely (exceptions will be described in the text). The decision to stop anticoagulants at 3 months or to treat indefinitely is dominated by the long-term risk of recurrence, and secondarily influenced by the risk of bleeding and by patient preference. VTE provoked by a reversible risk factor, or a first unprovoked isolated distal (calf) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), has a low risk of recurrence and is usually treated for 3 months. VTE associated with active cancer, or a second unprovoked VTE, has a high risk of recurrence and is usually treated indefinitely. The decision to stop anticoagulants at 3 months or to treat indefinitely is more finely balanced after a first unprovoked proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Indefinite anticoagulation is often chosen if there is a low risk of bleeding, whereas anticoagulation is usually stopped at 3 months if there is a high risk of bleeding. The decision to continue anticoagulation indefinitely after a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE is strengthened if the patient is male, the index event was PE rather than DVT, and/or d-dimer testing is positive 1 month after stopping anticoagulant therapy.

### What is the optimal duration of treatment for DVT? An update on evidence-based medicine of treatment for DVT [^114QCH9i]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represent a major source of morbidity and mortality today. Incidence of DVT is estimated to be 56 to 160/100,000 population per year. Systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with initiation of oral vitamin K antagonist therapy has been shown to be beneficial in preventing pulmonary embolism and reducing extension and recurrence of DVT. The duration of anticoagulation following an episode of DVT is determined by the greatest predictors of recurrence. These include the presence of reversible risk factors, nonreversible risk factors, and no risk factors (idiopathic or unprovoked DVT). Short durations of anticoagulation are only appropriate for calf DVTs in patients with reversible risk factors. Patients with nonreversible risk factors, such as malignancy and certain inherited thrombophilias with a strong family history of venous thromboembolism will require lifelong anticoagulation. Those with proximal DVT due to reversible risk factors require 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic DVT require reassessment of risk-to-benefit ratio of hemorrhage from oral vitamin K antagonist therapy compared to reducing risk of recurrence and frequently require prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring with d-dimer and serial ultrasounds may offer an individualized approach to therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111SxyZo]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2.0 (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3.1 to 4.0) [Grade 1A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1.5 to 1.9) compared to INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Grade 1A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1A). For most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend clinicians not use systemic thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for PE, the recommendations are similar to those for DVT.

### Who should get long-term anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism and with what? [^111aDq42]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

After an initial 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians and patients face an important question: "Do we stop anticoagulants or continue them indefinitely?" The decision is easy in some scenarios (eg, stop in VTE provoked by major surgery). In most scenarios, which are faced on a day-to-day basis in routine practice, it is a challenging decision because of uncertainty in estimates in the long-term risks (principally major bleeding) and benefits (reducing recurrent VTE) and the tight trade-offs between them. Once the decision is made to continue, the next question to tackle is "Which anticoagulant?" Here again, it is a difficult decision because of the uncertainty with regard to estimates of efficacy and the safety of anticoagulant options and the tight trade-offs between choices. We conclude with the approach that we take in our clinical practice.

### Balancing risks and benefits of extended anticoagulant therapy for idiopathic venous thrombosis [^116d9u5t]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

About half of the patients with a first idiopathic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) are expected to have a recurrent episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE) within 10 years of stopping therapy, and randomized trials have shown that this group of patients benefit from long-term anticoagulant therapy. High risks for bleeding and patient preference are compelling reasons not to treat such patients long-term. Although a number of factors are associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, they require further validation before it is appropriate to routinely stop anticoagulants after 3 months in patients with idiopathic proximal DVT or PE.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^113PaYQ1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

### Individualized duration of oral anticoagulant therapy for deep vein thrombosis based on a decision model [^1135QQXc]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is still a matter of debate. However, according to the ACCP consensus strategy a limited stratification in treatment duration is advocated, i.e. 3 months for patients with a transient risk factor and 1 year or longer for patients with recurrent disease or a consistent risk factor such as thrombophilia or cancer. This consensus strategy is founded on the mean optimal duration of therapy obtained in large cohorts of patients and is mainly based on the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), with only minimal consideration for the patient's bleeding risk.

Objective

The aim of this study is to optimize the anticoagulant treatment strategy with vitamin K antagonists for the individual patient with DVT.

Methods

Based on an extensive literature study, a mathematical model was constructed to balance the risk of recurrent VTE against the risk of major hemorrhagic complications. The following parameters are incorporated in the model: baseline estimates and risk factors for recurrent VTE and bleeding, clinical course of DVT, and efficacy of treatment with vitamin K antagonists. With the use of these parameters, the risk for a recurrent VTE and a bleeding episode can be calculated for the individual patient. The optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy can be defined as the timepoint at which the benefit of treatment (prevention of VTE) is counterbalanced by its risk (bleeding).

Results/Conclusions

How long a patient should receive anticoagulant treatment is a matter of balancing the benefits and risks of treatment. The model shows that the optimal treatment duration varies greatly from patient to patient according to the patient's unique bleeding and recurrence risk.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112mrgRr]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Aspirin after stopping anticoagulation for unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) — we suggest aspirin over no aspirin to prevent recurrent VTE (Grade 2B) in patients who are stopping anticoagulant therapy and do not have a contraindication to aspirin; we do not consider aspirin a reasonable alternative to anticoagulant therapy in patients who want extended therapy, and use of aspirin should also be reevaluated when patients with VTE stop anticoagulant therapy because aspirin may have been stopped when anticoagulants were started.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to duration of anticoagulation, unprovoked thrombosis, ASH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider completing a shorter (3–6 months) over a longer (6–12 months) course of anticoagulation for primary treatment in patients with unprovoked DVT and/or PE.

### Should we diagnose and treat distal deep vein thrombosis? [^113FAX9K]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound series report that isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), also known as calf DVT, represents up to 50% of all lower-limb DVTs and, therefore, is a frequent medical condition. Unlike proximal DVT and pulmonary embolism, which have been studied extensively and for which management is well standardized, much less is known about the optimal management of isolated calf DVT. Recent data arising from registries and nonrandomized studies have suggested that most distal DVTs do not extend to the proximal veins and have an uneventful follow-up when left untreated. These data had some impact on the international recommendations that recently stated that ultrasound surveillance instead of systematic therapeutic anticoagulation might be an option for selected low-risk patients. However, robust data from randomized studies are scarce. Only 5 randomized trials assessing the need for anticoagulation for calf DVT have been published. Many of these trials had an open-label design and were affected by methodological limitations. The only randomized placebo-controlled trial included low-risk patients (outpatients without cancer or previous venous thromboembolism [VTE]) and was hampered by limited statistical power. Nevertheless, data from this trial confirmed that the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in low-risk patients with symptomatic calf DVT is not superior to placebo in reducing VTE but is associated with a significantly higher risk of bleeding. Further randomized studies are needed to define the best therapy for high-risk patients (inpatients, patients with active cancer, or patients with previous VTE) and the optimal dose and duration of treatment.

### Duration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism [^112na45n]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism-often denominated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE)- consists of parenteral administration of heparin (usually low-molecular-weight heparin or alternatively unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists that are administered for a certain period (usually 3 to 12 months). Recommended or suggested durations differ according to guidelines. Practically, the clinical decision in an individual patient depends upon the estimated risks of VTE recurrence and treatment-induced bleeding. The risk of VTE recurrence is higher in idiopathic events (about 10% per year during the first two years and 3% per year thereafter) (odds ratio of 2.4, compared to secondary events); in male subjects (at least before the age of 60, with an odds ratio of 2–4); in patients with persistently elevated D-dimer level (odds ratio of 2.3, compared with normal level); and during the first two years after discontinuation of treatment. The annual risk of major bleeding on anticoagulant treatment vary largely in observational studies with figures of 2% to 29%, depending on the patient characteristics. The case-fatality rate is 8% (DVT), 12% (PE) for recurrent VTE, and about 10% for major bleed. These figures do not support long-term anticoagulant therapy, except in those patients exhibiting a very high risk of recurrence and/or a very low risk of bleeding. New therapeutic aspects might impact on the duration of anticoagulant therapy after a venous thromboembolic event. They include the possibility of pursuing anticoagulant treatment at a reduced INR after an initial period with an INR 2–3, and the advent of new, more specific and orally active anticoagulants. These features might modify the risk-benefit balance of extending anticoagulant therapy beyond the usual, limited duration.

Introduction

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a pulmonary embolism (PE) are 2 manifestations of a venous thromboembolism (VTE), which may cause considerable morbidity and mortality. It occurs in 1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, which translates to 300 000 to 600 000 events in the United States annually. Following a primary VTE event, recurrent events may occur in patients with an unprovoked VTE, a VTE associated with transient risk factors, or a VTE associated with chronic risk factors.,

Anticoagulation remains the cornerstone of treatment for patients with a VTE based on proven efficacy in reducing the risk for recurrent events. However, it is also associated with an increased risk for bleeding. Therefore, when determining the duration of anticoagulation therapy, it is crucial to balance the benefits (namely, the prevention of recurrent VTE) against the harms, primarily major bleeding and all-cause mortality. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guidelines for the management of VTEdescribe the treatment decisions for VTE in the following 3 phases (Figure 1): (1) initial management, which occurs from the time of diagnosis through the first 3 weeks of therapy; (2) primary treatment, which is a time-limited phase that typically runs for a minimum of 3 months; and (3) secondary prevention, which begins after completion of the primary treatment phase and extends for a prolonged, usually indefinite, period of time.

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157N3ai]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

For patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, the optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment is uncertain. After three to six months of initial anticoagulation, extended treatment is highly effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE, but this clinical benefit is not maintained when anticoagulation is stopped. After discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment, patients with a first unprovoked VTE have a much higher risk of recurrence compared with patients with VTE provoked by a major transient risk factor. Consequently, anticoagulant treatment is discontinued after three to six months in patients with VTE due to a major transient provoking factor, whereas current guidelines suggest extended (ie, indefinite) anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who have a non-high bleeding risk. This is, however, a weak (grade 2B) recommendation, in large part as a result of uncertainty in estimates of the long term risk of major bleeding if treatment is continued, and, importantly, the long term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is discontinued. Thus deciding whether patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE should receive indefinite anticoagulation or can stop treatment after the initial three to six months, remains an important challenge.

A previous individual patient data meta-analysisof 1732 patients with unprovoked VTE from six randomised trials, reported an overall risk of recurrent VTE of about 10% per year in the first two years after discontinuation of anticoagulation. That analysis did not assess the risk of recurrent VTE in men and women separately or in patients with isolated pulmonary embolism, and it only followed patients for 24 months. Furthermore, trials in that analysis were published before 2004, whereas since then additional prospective studies have reported on the risk for recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment in patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE, with several of these studies having followed patients beyond 24 months and some up to 10 years. This offers an opportunity to obtain reliable estimates of the long term risk of recurrent VTE and to assess how the risk varies over time — knowledge that is crucial for deciding the need for indefinite anticoagulation, as well as defining the burden of illness in this common patient population.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116ceJ2x]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

### Treatment of distal deep vein thrombosis [^1143bX3g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The treatment of distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not clearly established. Distal DVT can either be treated with anticoagulation, or monitored with close follow-up to detect progression to the proximal veins (above the knee), which requires anticoagulation. Proponents of this monitoring strategy base their decision to withhold anticoagulation on the fact that progression is rare and most people can be spared from potential bleeding and other adverse effects of anticoagulation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatment interventions for people with distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 February 2019. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of distal DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Primary outcomes of interest were recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), DVT and major bleeding and follow up ranged from three months to two years. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with risk ratio (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs reporting on 1239 participants. Five trials randomised participants to anticoagulation for up to three months versus no anticoagulation. Three trials compared anticoagulation treatment for different time periods. Anticoagulant compared to no intervention or placebo for distal DVT treatment Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reduced the risk of recurrent VTE during follow-up compared with participants receiving no anticoagulation (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.77; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 3%; high-certainty evidence), and reduced the risk of recurrence of DVT (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.67; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect on risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.59; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in major bleeding with anticoagulation compared to placebo (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.62; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 26%; low-certainty evidence). There was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in the group treated with anticoagulants (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.07 to 10.46; 2 studies, 322 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was one death, not related to PE or major bleeding, in the anticoagulation group. Anticoagulation for three months or more compared to anticoagulation for six weeks for distal DVT treatment Three RCTs of 736 participants compared three or more months of anticoagulation with six weeks of anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with a VKA for three months or more reduced the incidence of recurrent VTE to 5.8% compared with 13.9% in participants treated for six weeks (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.68; 3 studies, 736 participants; I² = 50%; high-certainty evidence). The risk for recurrence of DVT was also reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.64; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 48%; high-certainty evidence), but there was probably little or no difference in PE (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.19 to 5.88; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in major bleeding events (RR 3.42, 95% CI 0.36 to 32.35; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.42; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 1%; low-certainty evidence) between three months or more of treatment and six weeks of treatment. There were no reports for overall mortality or PE and major bleeding-related deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found a benefit for people with distal DVT treated with anticoagulation therapy using VKA with little or no difference in major bleeding events although there was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding when compared to no intervention or placebo. The small number of participants in this meta-analysis and strength of evidence prompts a call for more research regarding the treatment of distal DVT. RCTs comparing different treatments and different treatment periods with placebo or compression therapy, are required.

1 INTRODUCTION

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), represents a common cardiovascular disease, affecting 1–2 per 1000 individuals per year worldwide. Timely diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulant treatment is critical as historical studies have reported mortality rates up to 30% when acute VTE is left untreated. To prevent thrombus progression and early recurrences once a diagnosis of VTE is established, anticoagulant treatment begins with an initiation phase that lasts for 5–21 days, depending on the anticoagulant regimen selected, and is continued for at least 3 months (i.e. the treatment phase). After completion of the treatment phase, the decision to continue anticoagulation is driven mainly by the estimated risk of recurrent VTE. Current guidelines advise to consider continuation of anticoagulant therapy among patients with major persistent risk factors (e.g. cancer or antiphospholipid syndrome) or when VTE occurs in the absence of transient risk factors (i.e. unprovoked VTE).

Although anticoagulant therapy is highly effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE, this comes at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding complications. The risk of major bleeding is greatest during the initial 3 months of treatment with an estimated incidence of 2%, and a case fatality rate of 11.3%, comparable to the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE. For patients who receive anticoagulant drugs for more than 3 months, the reported risk of major bleeding is 1.3–2.2 per 100 patient‐years (reaching a 5‐year cumulative risk of 6.3%) with a case fatality rate of 5.1%–12% in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). This risk is considerably lower when patients are treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) approximating 0.72–1.6 events/100 patient years, while evidence on cumulative risks beyond 24 months are still sparse. These numbers highlight the importance of harm‐to‐benefit assessment of long‐term anticoagulant treatment, for which the risk of VTE recurrence is weighed against the risk of bleeding. In addition, identification of potentially modifiable bleeding predictors may provide physicians tools to diminish an individual patient's bleeding risk during follow‐up.

Importance

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common, potentially lethal condition with acute morbidity.

Objective

To review the etiology of VTE and the 3 phases of VTE treatment: acute (first 5–10 days), long-term (from end of acute treatment to 3–6 months), and extended (beyond 3–6 months).

Evidence Review

Cochrane reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials, as well as other clinical trials for topics not covered by the former, were reviewed. Literature searches using broad terms were used to find meta-analyses published in the last 15 years. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Therapy Guidelines was used to supplement the literature search. Guidelines from specialty organizations were consulted when relevant. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health was searched for relevant cost-effectiveness studies. We also searched our own literature database of 8386 articles for relevant research.

Findings

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) along with with vitamin K antagonists and the benefits and proven safety of ambulation have allowed for outpatient management of most cases of DVT in the acute phase. Development of new oral anticoagulants further simplifies acute-phase treatment and 2 oral agents can be used as monotherapy, avoiding the need for LMWH. Patients with PE can also be treated in the acute phase as outpatients, a decision dependent on prognosis and severity of PE. Thrombolysis is best reserved for severe VTE; inferior vena cava filters, ideally the retrievable variety, should be used when anticoagulation is contraindicated. In general, DVT and PE patients require 3 months of treatment with anticoagulants, with options including LMWH, vitamin K antagonists, or direct factor Xa or direct factor IIa inhibitors. After this time, decisions for further treatment are based on balancing the risk of VTE recurrence, determined by etiology of the VTE (transient risk factors, unprovoked or malignancy associated), against the risk of major hemorrhage from treatment. Better prediction tools for major hemorrhage are needed. Experience with new oral anticoagulants as acute, long-term, and extended therapy options is limited as yet, but as a class they appear to be safe and effective for all phases of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

The mainstay of VTE treatment is anticoagulation, while interventions such as thrombolysis and inferior vena cava filters are reserved for limited circumstances. Multiple therapeutic modes and options exist for VTE treatment with small but nonetheless important differential effects to consider. Anticoagulants will probably always increase bleeding risk, necessitating tailored treatment strategies that must incorporate etiology, risk, benefit, cost, and patient preference. Although great progress has been made, further study to understand individual patient risks is needed to make ideal treatment decisions.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism [^114evLWq]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

In principle, the answer to this question is obvious: "as long as the risk of continued therapy is outweighed by the benefit". In practice, determining an individual patient's risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) without warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists is difficult. However, there are many factors (both intrinsic and environmental) that can alter the risk of VTE recurrence. This paper will discuss evidence and considerations (including the issue of bleeding risk) that may be relevant to decisions about duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with VTE.

Introduction

The main challenge for treating patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is deciding on the duration of anticoagulant therapy. The primary treatment for VTE consists of 3 months of anticoagulation in all patients. Primary treatment duration of > 3 months but with a limited duration (e.g. 9 or 12 months) is not recommended as this simply postpones recurrence until treatment is discontinued (the so-called 'catch-up phenomenon'). Therefore, the critical decision is choosing between a short treatment duration of 3 months and an extended treatment without an end-date. Guidelines recommend basing this decision on weighing the risks of recurrent VTE and bleeding. While anticoagulant treatment is effective in reducing recurrence risk, it is associated with a 1%–2% annual risk of major bleeding. Currently, the risk of recurrence is estimated by categorizing patients as having unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by minor or major transient risk factors, or persistent risk factors. The risk of recurrence is low (3% per year or less), if provoked by major transient risk factors (e.g. major surgery), and treatment discontinuation is recommended after 3 months. In the absence of major transient provoking factors, the risk of recurrence is considerably higher. For these patients, clinical equipoise exists regarding (dis)continuation of anticoagulant treatment if risk of bleeding is considered low (1.6% per year or less).

Deciding on the anticoagulant treatment duration for individual patients is challenging for multiple reasons. First, the risks of recurrence and bleeding differ between patients, even within the aforementioned groups. For example, there may be patients at high risk of bleeding for whom the benefit of extended treatment still outweighs the bleeding risks because VTE recurrence risk is very high. Second, guidelines do not provide recommendations as to how the risks of recurrent VTE and bleeding should be assessed and weighed. The risks of recurrent VTE and bleeding in the individual patient must be estimated from the results in groups of patients. Treatment decisions are currently based primarily on the presence of provoking factors as a way to categorize recurrence risk rather than on the absolute risk of bleeding. However, bleeding may have an important negative impact on quality of life and cause mortality as well.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^116fSSds]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs in ∼1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, corresponding to ∼300000 to 600000 events in the United States annually.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about treatment of VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 28 recommendations for the initial management of VTE, primary treatment, secondary prevention, and treatment of recurrent VTE events.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations include the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise, use of an international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0 to 3.0 over a lower INR range for patients with VTE who use a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for secondary prevention, and use of indefinite anticoagulation for patients with recurrent unprovoked VTE. Conditional recommendations include the preference for home treatment over hospital-based treatment for uncomplicated DVT and PE at low risk for complications and a preference for direct oral anticoagulants over VKA for primary treatment of VTE.

### Which patients are at high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)? [^111f9f3G]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE, or deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) is associated with mortality and long-term morbidity. The circumstances in which an index VTE event occurred are crucial when personalized VTE recurrence risk is assessed. Patients who experience a VTE event in the setting of a transient major risk factor (such as surgery associated with general anesthesia for > 30 minutes) are predicted to have a low VTE recurrence risk following discontinuation of anticoagulation, and limited-duration anticoagulation is generally recommended. In contrast, those patients whose VTE event occurred in the absence of risk factors or who have persistent risk factors have a higher VTE recurrence risk. Here, we review the literature surrounding VTE recurrence risk in a range of clinical conditions. We describe gender-specific risks, including VTE recurrence risk following hormone- and pregnancy-associated VTE events. Finally, we discuss how the competing impacts of VTE recurrence and bleeding have shaped international guideline recommendations.

### A conceptual framework for two phases of anticoagulant treatment of venous thromboembolism [^113Vmqon]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Four observations support that anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) has an 'active treatment' phase that is limited to about 3 months. First, < 3 months of treatment is associated with a higher risk of recurrent VTE than treatment for 3 months or longer, suggesting that < 3 months is inadequate therapy. Second, treatment for 3 months is associated with the same risk of recurrent VTE as treatment for 6 months or longer, suggesting that 3 months is adequate therapy. Third, the increase in recurrent VTE with too short a course of treatment is predominantly at the site of the initial thrombosis, suggesting reactivation of initial thrombosis. Fourth, the increase in recurrent VTE with too short a course of treatment occurs immediately after treatment is stopped and is short lived, again suggesting reactivation of initial thrombosis. Once the initial thrombosis has been adequately treated (i.e. the first phase of treatment), further anticoagulation serves as 'secondary prevention' of new, unrelated, episodes of thrombosis (i.e. the second phase of treatment). For most patients, therefore, anticoagulant therapy for VTE should be stopped at 3 months when the acute episode has completed treatment, or should be continued indefinitely as 'secondary prevention' if the risk of recurrence remains unacceptably high having completed 'active treatment'.

### Changing paradigms in the management of deep vein thrombosis [^1127hUDq]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

In adults diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), challenges remain in the management of the acute event whilst remaining alert to long-term morbidity. The addition of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the pharmacopoeia represents the first of a number of recent advancements in the management of DVT. Worldwide, uptake of these agents has been avid, although drug selection, reversal and chronic treatment effects continue to be controversial areas. Multi-centre studies to evaluate the impact of NOACs on long-term outcomes, including thrombosis recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), are ongoing. Validation of tools capable of predicting PTS would enable patient selection for early aggressive intervention, such as local thrombolysis. Such interventional strategies are gaining momentum as initial approaches and would benefit from large randomized controlled trials.

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ke753]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Antithrombotic therapy can prevent recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is, however, associated with an increased risk for major bleeding. This meta-analysis systematically reviewed the evidence regarding the duration of antithrombotic therapy to assess benefits and harms. We systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared shorter (3–6 months) with longer (> 6 months) courses of anticoagulation for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or that compared discontinued with indefinite antithrombotic therapy for the secondary prevention of VTE. Pairs of reviewers screened the eligible trials and collected data. This study included 22 RCTs (11 617 participants). Pooled estimates showed that, for the primary treatment of unprovoked VTE, VTE provoked by chronic risk factors or transient risk factors, treating patients with a longer course (> 6 months) of anticoagulation, as opposed to a shorter course (3–6 months), probably reduced recurrent PE (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–1.02) and DVT (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63–1.14), but it was associated with increased mortality (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.85–2.41) (moderate certainty) and a higher risk for major bleeding (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.02–3.98; high certainty). For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE and VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, when compared with discontinuing treatment, indefinite anticoagulation therapy was associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.81), a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.16–0.41) and DVT (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.10–0.21), and an increase in the risk for bleeding (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.18–3.30), all supported by high certainty. Indefinite antiplatelet therapy may be associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.53–1.68; low certainty), probably a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41–1.03) and DVT (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.17–1.13) (moderate certainty), and may increase the risk for bleeding (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.48–3.41; low certainty). In summary, for the primary treatment of all types of VTE, shorter (3–6 months) duration of anticoagulation is more beneficial. For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, indefinite antithrombotic treatment is more beneficial.

Better selection of patients for extended venous thromboembolism (VTE) therapy — first unprovoked events: In patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) without a high risk of bleeding, patient sex and a D-dimer measured about 1 month after stopping anticoagulant therapy can help stratify recurrence risk; men have about a 75% higher (1.75-fold) risk than women, a positive D-dimer has about double the risk vs a negative result, and the predictive value of the two factors appears additive. In women with a negative posttreatment D-dimer, risk appears similar to that for proximal DVT or PE provoked by a minor transient risk factor (approximately 15% recurrence at 5 years), whereas in men with a negative D-dimer the risk is not much less than that estimated for unprovoked proximal DVT or PE (approximately 25% compared with approximately 30% recurrence at 5 years); D-dimer testing will often influence a woman's decision but will often not influence a male's decision. Because there is still uncertainty about how to use D-dimer testing and a patient's sex to make decisions about extended therapy in patients with a first unprovoked VTE, we have not made recommendations based on these factors, though a qualifying remark notes that sex and D-dimer measured a month after stopping anticoagulant therapy may influence this treatment decision.

### Deep-vein thrombosis in malignancy: how long should patients be treated, and with what? [^116ACt3W]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Cancer patients are at high-risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the optimal VTE prophylaxis and treatment options for this population are currently unclear. Surgical cancer patients have been shown to benefit from pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, with a number of trials suggesting that prophylaxis duration should extend beyond the traditional 7 day period. Medical (nonsurgical) cancer patients are also at high-risk of VTE, and evidence-based guidelines recommend pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized cancer patients who are bedridden. In cancer patients with confirmed VTE, questions remain over the most effective long-term treatment regimen. Further trials are required to help physicians to make evidence-based choices for the management of VTE in these patients.

### Optimal treatment duration of venous thrombosis [^113Hb6RK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials have shown that patients with venous thromboembolism benefit from a minimum of three months of anticoagulant therapy. After this period, it was suggested that patients with an expected annual recurrence rate of < 5% could safely discontinue treatment. Using a population-based approach for stratification, these patients are those with major transient risk factors, and represent the minority. For all other patients, including those with previous episodes of venous thromboembolism, cancer, or unprovoked events, this treatment duration may not be sufficiently protective. Because extending anticoagulation for additional three to nine months does not result in further, long-term reduction of recurrences, indefinite treatment duration should be considered. However, case-fatality rate for major bleeding in patients taking warfarin for more than three months is higher than case-fatality rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism. Thus, an individual patient approach to improve and increase the identification of those who can safely discontinue treatment at three months becomes necessary. Clinical prediction rules or management strategies based on D-dimer levels or residual vein thrombosis have been proposed and need further refinement and validation. Specific bleeding scores are lacking. Meanwhile, the oral direct inhibitors have been proposed as potential alternatives to the vitamin K antagonists, and aspirin may provide some benefit in selected patients who discontinue anticoagulation. Deep vein thrombosis in unusual sites is associated with less, but potentially more severe recurrences, in particular in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis who also face an increased risk of bleeding complications while on treatment.

### Management of patients with venous thromboembolism after the initial treatment period [^112drn3S]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common medical problem seen in primary care settings. The most common long-term adverse sequelae are recurrent thromboembolism and incomplete resolution of the embolic material, which may result in pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic changes in the leg after deep vein thrombosis. Although there are detailed guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute VTE, there are few focused articles that provide recommendations for primary care physicians (PCPs) about how to manage VTE patients after completion of the initial period of anticoagulation treatment.

Observations

In this article, we highlight several important clinical decisions that must be addressed after the first 3 months of anticoagulation treatment is complete, with a focus on particular management issues for PCPs.

Conclusions

The 2 most important decisions the PCP must make are to determine, first, if symptoms of acute VTE have indeed resolved, and second, if they have resolved, to assess the long-term risk of recurrent VTE versus the risk of potential bleeding and decide if anticoagulation should be stopped, or if indefinite anticoagulation treatment is indicated. Among higher-risk patients who may benefit from indefinite anticoagulation, the PCP should discuss both the risks and benefits of anticoagulation treatment, empowering the patient to actively participate in this important shared decision-making process.

Once the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been established the focus shifts to management of the disease. The goals of acute treatment of DVT are several: arrest growth of the thrombus, dissolve or remove the thrombus, and prevent embolizations of the thrombus. Although these goals have remained constant, the initial management of DVT has undergone a series of evolutions during the past decade, affecting both acute treatment and disposition decisions. As this article discusses, emergency medicine is at the cutting edge of these changes.

### Six monthstwo years of oral anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis. the PADIS-DVT randomized clinical trial [^115pAJwP]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism have a high risk of recurrence after short-term oral anticoagulant therapy for 3 to 6 months. – Current guidelines suggest indefinite anticoagulation in these patients, although this is supported by only a moderate level of evidence.

Extending anticoagulation beyond 6 months of therapy is highly effective in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism as long as treatment is maintained, but exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding proportionate to treatment duration.

Only a few randomized trials have followed patients during a substantial period (up to 1 or 2 years) after stopping anticoagulation to determine whether or not the benefit of extended anticoagulant therapy is maintained. –, In a recent randomized trial comparing an additional 18 months of warfarin with placebo after a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism initially treated for 6 months, we confirmed that the benefit of extended therapy was not maintained during a 2-year follow-up period after discontinuing anticoagulation. However, although the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism after an unprovoked pulmonary embolism has been reported to be close to that observed after an unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis, there is evidence that the case-fatality rate of recurrence is about 4-fold higher after pulmonary embolism than after deep-vein thrombosis. Consequently, findings concerning unprovoked pulmonary embolism might not apply to patients with unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis.

We therefore conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in patients with a first episode of unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis given an initial 6-month course of oral anticoagulant therapy, to assess the benefits and risks of an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin versus placebo during the study treatment period and during the 24 months following treatment discontinuation. A further aim was to compare the therapeutic effect of an additional 18 months of treatment in patients presenting unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis with that observed in the PADIS-PE trial.

Current guidelines for anticoagulant therapy do not so far suggest any form of differentiated approach to cancer patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). This review article provides an overview of the published literature in cancer patients with VTE, mostly using data from the RIETE registry. Our findings provide some insights into what factors may be used to guide physicians in adapting recommended anticoagulant regimens to the individual patient, as oncologists are increasingly doing with cancer treatments. For instance, patients presenting with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) alone might benefit from curtailing treatment intensity as anticoagulant therapy progresses. The site of cancer also needs to be considered. In patients with incidental PE or splanchnic vein thrombosis, we should be more cautious before prescribing anticoagulant therapy. The optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy is unknown.

### Basics of diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism [^115iN6nq]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), is common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The symptoms and signs of VTE are nonspecific. Well-established integrated diagnostic strategies combining clinical probability scores and D-dimer are used to identify patients with a low probability of VTE, where the diagnosis can be safely excluded without imaging. In patients with confirmed VTE, anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment. However, patients with high-risk features at presentation may benefit from advanced reperfusion therapies such as thrombolysis and/or interventional approaches to reduce early mortality and/or long-term morbidity. The advent of direct oral anticoagulants has greatly simplified the treatment of VTE for most patients, with a persisting role for low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists in select patient groups. Following an initial 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation, those with major transient provoking factors can safely discontinue anticoagulation. Balancing the risk of recurrent VTE and bleeding risk is central to decisions regarding long-term anticoagulation, and patients should be included in shared decision-making. Assessment and recognition of common long-term complications such as postthrombotic syndrome and post-PE syndrome are also essential, given they are associated with significant adverse impact on long-term quality of life, with a significant risk of mortality associated with the less frequent complication of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. This review provides a basic overview and framework for the diagnostic approach to deep vein thrombosis and PE, risk stratification of confirmed diagnoses, and management.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Continued versus discontinued oral anticoagulant treatment for unprovoked venous thromboembolism: target trial emulation [^116DX4LY]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represents a major disease burden globally. In the US, about 1.2 million cases will have a diagnosis of VTE annually, with a one year mortality rate of about 20%. Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are effective in reducing VTE recurrence, but they also increase bleeding risk. Clinical guidelines recommend anticoagulation for at least 3–6 months for patients with deep vein thrombosis provoked by transient VTE risk factors such as major trauma, surgery, and pregnancy, and extended treatment beyond three months if the VTE is unprovoked or if the risk factors are not reversible (eg, metastatic cancer).

Several randomized controlled trials have compared the safety and efficacy of extended OAC treatment (ie, anticoagulation beyond 3–6 months) with discontinuation of OAC treatment and reported that extended anticoagulation substantially reduced the risk of recurrent VTE. However, these trials were underpowered to detect a difference in major bleeding and unable to provide full data for estimating the risk-to-benefit profile for extended OAC treatment in VTE. It is also unclear if the observed efficacy and safety patterns in the highly selected trial populations can be translated to routine care enriched with frail and complex patients at higher risk of bleeding. In addition, the limited follow-up of the published randomized controlled trials did not provide data to inform decisions beyond the first 1–2 years of extended anticoagulation.

Observational data to assess the effect of continuing OACs for unprovoked VTE are also limited. Two small studies without any adjustment for confounding did not find an association between discontinuation of OACs and reduction in major bleeding. Also, all the published studies were too small to assess effects by individual OAC or length of initial treatment. Therefore, while the clinical guidelines recommend extending anticoagulation for longer than 3–6 months for unprovoked deep vein thrombosis, no direct evidence informs optimal treatment duration of anticoagulation. In this study, we compared the outcomes of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality among adults with VTE without reversible provoking factors who continued versus discontinued OAC treatment, stratified by length of initial anticoagulation period from 90 days to almost three years.

### Risk prediction of recurrent venous thrombosis; where are we now and what can we add? [^115Mu7xk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with a first venous thrombosis (VT; the composite of deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism) have a high risk of a recurrent event. 1, 2 Anticoagulant therapy is effective for treating a first event as well as for preventing a recurrence. Trials have shown that 3 months of anticoagulant therapy is the minimum duration of initial treatment. 3 However, it is uncertain whether anticoagulant treatment should be continued beyond this period to prevent recurrences. This uncertainty arises from the associated risk of this treatment, that is severe bleeding. 4, 5 Both recurrent VT and major bleeding are serious events, with case‐fatality rates ranging between 4% and 10%. 6, 7

The decision on treatment duration has strong lifelong implications, as the cumulative thrombosis and bleeding risks will become high over a person's lifetime. Nevertheless, the propensity to develop recurrent VT or bleeding differs strongly between individuals, depending on their genetic makeup and environmental circumstances. 8 Attempts have been made to quantify these risks at an individual level as a basis for predicting the risk. The three best known prediction models for VT, that is, the Men continue and HERDOO2 rule, the Vienna prediction model, and the DASH score, are exclusively aimed at patients with an unprovoked first event (about 30%‐50% of the total VT population, depending on the definition of unprovoked). 9, 10, 11 External validation studies showed less discriminative ability than the original studies. 12, 13, 14 In the HERDOO2 study, authors confirmed that women with a first unprovoked VT and none or one of the HERDOO2 criteria could safely discontinue anticoagulants after completing short‐term treatment. 15 Nevertheless, the majority of their population could not be classified in this low‐risk group (n = 2125; 76%).

### Residual thrombosis on ultrasonography to guide the duration of anticoagulation in patients with deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^1151XQXk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities remains uncertain.

Objective

To assess whether tailoring the duration of anticoagulation on the basis of the persistence of residual thrombi on ultrasonography reduces the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with the administration of conventional fixed-duration treatment in adults with proximal DVT.

Design

Parallel, randomized trial from 1999 to 2006. Trained physicians who assessed outcomes were blinded to patient assignment status, but patients and providers were not.

Setting

9 university or hospital centers in Italy.

Patients

538 consecutive outpatients with a first episode of acute proximal DVT at completion of an uneventful 3-month period of anticoagulation.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned (stratified by center and secondary vs. unprovoked DVT by using a computer-generated list that was accessible only to a trial nurse) to fixed-duration anticoagulation (no further anticoagulation for secondary thrombosis and an extra 3 months for unprovoked thrombosis) or flexible-duration, ultrasonography-guided anticoagulation (no further anticoagulation in patients with recanalized veins and continued anticoagulation in all other patients for up to 9 months for secondary DVT and up to 21 months for unprovoked thrombosis). For the primary outcome assessment, 530 patients completed the trial.

Measurements

The rate of confirmed recurrent VTE during 33 months of follow-up.

Results

Overall, 46 (17.2%) of 268 patients allocated to fixed-duration anticoagulation and 32 (11.9%) of 270 patients allocated to flexible-duration anticoagulation developed recurrent VTE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.99]). For patients with unprovoked DVT, the adjusted HR was 0.61 (CI, 0.36 to 1.02) and 0.81 (CI, 0.32 to 2.06) for those with secondary DVT. Major bleeding occurred in 2 (0.7%) patients in the fixed-duration group and 4 (1.5%) patients in the flexible-duration group (P = 0.67).

Limitations

The trial lacked a double-blind design. The sample size was not powered to detect differences in bleeding between groups and to detect effectiveness of the intervention in the subgroups of patients with unprovoked and secondary DVT. Patients with previous thromboembolism, permanent risk factors for thrombosis, and thrombophilic abnormalities other than factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation were excluded.

Conclusion

Tailoring the duration of anticoagulation on the basis of ultrasonography findings reduces the rate of recurrent VTE in adults with proximal DVT.

Primary Funding Source

### DVT and pulmonary embolism: part II. treatment and prevention [^111mAF5b]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for deep venous thrombosis include stopping clot propagation and preventing the recurrence of thrombus, the occurrence of pulmonary embolism, and the development of pulmonary hypertension, which can be a complication of multiple recurrent pulmonary emboli. About 30 percent of patients with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism have a thrombophilia. An extensive evaluation is suggested in patients younger than 50 years with an idiopathic episode of deep venous thrombosis, patients with recurrent thrombosis, and patients with a family history of thromboembolism. Infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by oral administration of warfarin remains the mainstay of treatment for deep venous thrombosis. Subcutaneously administered low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin given in a continuous infusion. LMW heparin is the agent of choice for treating deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women and patients with cancer. Based on validated protocols, warfarin can be started at a dosage of 5 or 10 mg per day. The intensity and duration of warfarin therapy depends on the individual patient, but treatment of at least three months usually is required. Some patients with thrombophilias require lifetime anticoagulation. Treatment for pulmonary embolism is similar to that for deep venous thrombosis. Because of the risk of hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability, in-hospital management is advised. Unfractionated heparin commonly is used, although LMW heparin is safe and effective. Thrombolysis is used in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. Subcutaneous heparin, LMW heparin, and warfarin have been approved for use in surgical prophylaxis. Elastic compression stockings are useful in patients at lowest risk for thromboembolism. Intermittent pneumatic leg compression is a useful adjunct to anticoagulation and an alternative when anticoagulation is contraindicated.

### Long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism [^114bkLJS]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

The most important decision in the long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is how long to anticoagulate. VTE provoked by a reversible risk factor, or a first unprovoked isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), generally should be treated for 3 months. VTE provoked by a persistent or progressive risk factor (eg, cancer), or a second unprovoked proximal DVT or PE, is generally treated indefinitely. First unprovoked proximal DVT or PE may be treated for 3 to 6 months or indefinitely. Male sex, presentation as PE (particularly if concomitant proximal DVT), a positive d-dimer test after stopping anticoagulation, an antiphospholipid antibody, low risk of bleeding, and patient preference favor indefinite anticoagulation. The type of indefinite anticoagulation is of secondary importance. Low-dose oral Xa inhibitors are convenient and are thought to have a lower risk of bleeding; they are less suitable if there is a higher risk for recurrence. For cancer-associated VTE, we now prefer full-dose oral Xa inhibitors over low-molecular-weight heparin, with gastrointestinal lesions being a relative contraindication. Graduated compression stockings are not routinely indicated after DVT, but are encouraged if there is persistent leg swelling or if a trial of stockings improves symptoms. Medications have a limited role in the treatment of postthrombotic syndrome. After PE, patients should have clinical surveillance for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), with ventilation-perfusion scanning and echocardiography being the initial diagnostic tests if CTEPH is a concern. Patients with CTEPH and other symptomatic patients with extensive residual perfusion defects should be evaluated for endarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty, or vasodilator therapies.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^115V19Wo]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2004). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), manifested as either deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), is an extremely common medical problem, occurring either in isolation or as a complication of other diseases or procedures. Yet, despite its frequency, much remains to be learned regarding the pathogenic mechanisms that initiate VTE, about tailoring its treatment to the individual with her/his specific set of risk factors for recurrence, and about its medical management when associated with specific disease entities, such as cancer. These three topics are addressed in this chapter. In Section I, Drs. López and Conde discuss the mechanisms by which venous thrombi may be initiated on the vessel wall in the absence of anatomically overt vessel wall injury. The authors propose a model whereby tissue factor (TF)-bearing microvesicles that arise from cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage can fuse with activated endothelial cells in regions of vessel activation or inflammation and initiate blood coagulation. Key components of this model include docking of the microvesicles to the stimulated endothelium through P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 on their surfaces binding to either P-selectin or E-selectin on the endothelium, and the role of hypoxia during blood stasis in initiating local endothelial activation. Elevations in the levels of TF-bearing microvesicles associated with inflammatory conditions would help to explain the increased risk of thrombosis associated with infections and inflammatory states such as inflammatory bowel disease. In Section II, Dr. Clive Kearon discusses the risk factors for recurrent thrombosis and strategies for determining length of therapy and tailoring specific therapies through risk stratification. Those patients who experience VTE in association with a major reversible risk factor such as surgery are much less likely to experience a recurrence when anticoagulation is discontinued than are patients with a persistent risk factor, such as thrombophilia or cancer unresponsive to therapy. Those with a minor reversible risk factor, such as prolonged air travel, have an intermediate risk of recurrence after discontinuance of anticoagulant therapy. The author provides an algorithm for using risk assessment as a means of determining the length and type of therapy to be used to minimize the rate of recurrence while simultaneously diminishing the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulation. In Section III, Dr. Agnes Lee updates the topic of VTE associated with malignancy. Patients with cancer make up approximately 20% of those presenting with first time VTE, and the presence of VTE forebodes a much poorer prognosis for patients with cancer, likely because of the morbidity associated with VTE itself and because VTE may herald a more aggressive cancer. Recent evidence indicates that low-molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) improve survival in patients with advanced cancer through mechanisms beyond their effect as anticoagulants. Because of their improved efficacy and safety and potential anti-neoplastic effect, the LMWHs have become the anticoagulants of choice for treating VTE associated with cancer.

Because aspirin is expected to be much less effective at preventing recurrent VTE than anticoagulants, we do not consider aspirin a reasonable alternative to anticoagulant therapy in patients who want extended therapy, and use of aspirin should also be reevaluated when patients stop anticoagulant therapy because aspirin may have been stopped when anticoagulants were started.

1 Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a prevalent and severe disease, affecting approximately 1–2 per 1000 per year with a risk of death, recurrence, long term morbidity and impaired quality of life (QoL). Anticoagulation therapy (AT) is the mainstay of VTE treatment with a minimum of 3 months duration recommended. Beyond 3 months, a decision must be made to determine which patients warrant long term, indefinite duration anticoagulation for secondary prevention of VTE recurrence. This decision needs to balance the risk of recurrence if AT is stopped and the risk of bleeding if AT continues. The most important factor to consider when estimating the VTE recurrence risk is the clinical circumstance of the first event. The risk of recurrence after an unprovoked VTE (no obvious precipitant) is higher than following a provoked VTE with a transient risk factor (such as surgery). Clinical guidelines recommend consideration of long-term anticoagulation in patients with an unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) after weighing up individual additional risk factors for recurrence, bleeding risk and patient preference (NICE CG144 2015, ACCP 2016, BSH 2011). Other factors known to be associated with increased VTE recurrence risk include male sex, raised-dimer after cessation of anticoagulation for 1 month and post thrombotic syndrome.

### Predicting the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis: what the future might bring [^1177CaPz]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

An important clinical problem in the management of venous thrombosis is to determine whether a patient can safely cease anticoagulant therapy. In this Forum article, we summarize the predictive performance of several prediction models for recurrent thrombosis, as well as for bleeding while using anticoagulants. Patients with provoked first thrombosis (considered "low risk") are now denied long-term treatment, although a strong gradient in risk can be found in this group. We furthermore discuss the problem of an unclear definition of "(un)provoked" and show that this affects the yield of currently available prediction scores plus the limitations of a "one-size-fits-all" strategy. Better prediction tools are urgently needed. We propose a strategy for future studies for which the following should be considered: (a) reporting of absolute risks next to C-statistics, (b) model applicable to all patients, (c) no discontinuation of anticoagulation for measurement of predictors.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^115VfSbE]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) in pediatric patients — duration of therapy recommendation — states the panel "suggests using anticoagulation for 6 to 12 months rather than indefinite anticoagulation" with a "conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯". Remarks note unprovoked VTE is rare, recurrent VTE rates in those "aged > 1 year" are "21%-36% at age 3.5 years", and "there are no pediatric studies evaluating duration of therapy in this cohort". The evidence summary reports "There were no new studies since the 2018 guidelines" and cites adult data showing indefinite anticoagulation reduces PE (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15–0.56) and DVT (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.12–0.34) compared with discontinuation, with mortality (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.49–1.13) less certain; however, "the frequency of major outcomes in pediatric patients treated for 6 to 12 months compared with indefinite anticoagulation cannot be determined accurately", and patient values and preferences "should be considered".

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11179gVH]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We systematically reviewed 22 trials that included 11 617 patients to evaluate the effect of the duration of primary treatment and of secondary prevention of VTE. For primary treatment, moderate-certainty evidence indicates that, when compared with a shorter course duration (3–6 months), treating patients with a longer course (> 6 months) of VKA/LMWH probably reduces recurrent PE and DVT, but it is also associated with increased mortality, and high-certainty evidence indicates that a longer course (> 6 months) of VKA/LMWH increases major bleeding. Thus, using a shorter duration (3–6 months) of anticoagulation might bring more benefit than a longer duration (> 6 months) of anticoagulation for the primary treatment of all types of VTEs, that is, until the decision whether the patient should continue with secondary prevention or not, regardless of the type of VTE risk factors. When considering secondary prevention for VTE, high-certainty evidence indicates that indefinite anticoagulation therapy, when compared with discontinuing treatment, is associated with decreased mortality and a reduction in recurrent PE and DVT but with an increased risk for bleeding. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that indefinite antiplatelet therapy probably reduces the incidence of recurrent PE and DVT and may also be associated with decreased mortality, but it may increase the risk for major bleeding, as supported by low-certainty evidence. Thus, for secondary prevention of VTE, indefinite antithrombotic treatment might be more beneficial than discontinued treatment for patients with unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, but this does not apply to VTE provoked by transient risk factors because they do not require indefinite antithrombotic treatment. The evidence continues to support the current recommendations in the 2020 ASH guidelines.

### Six monthstwo years of oral anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis. the PADIS-DVT randomized clinical trial [^113ooscK]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

As previously reported, – the risk of recurrence in the placebo group was greatest during the first months after stopping anticoagulation (cumulative risk, 38.7%, 95% CI: 19.1–58.3 at 12 months) and then increased linearly by 2–3% per year. The risk of recurrence in the warfarin group was lower than in the placebo group during the first months after anticoagulation discontinuation (cumulative risk, 9.4; 95% CI: 2.87–15.9 at 12 months); however, if no rebound effect was observed as compared to the risk of recurrence in the placebo group in the first months following randomization, this risk increased linearly throughout the 24-month post-treatment period, resulting in an annual incidence of recurrence close to that observed in the placebo group during the entire study period. Finally, the loss of extended therapy benefit after cessation of anticoagulation corroborates that observed in other randomized trials evaluating extended therapy in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism. –

Finally, our results suggest that patients with a first episode of unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis should receive indefinite anticoagulation; however, such an assumption is tempered by the following observation. Consistent with the results of the PADIS-PE and other trials, –, venous thromboembolism predominantly recurred in the same form as the index episode: regardless of whether patients had been treated for 6 or 24 months, 90% of recurrences were symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, of which 3% (1 of 31 episodes) were fatal, and 97% of all recurrences were unprovoked. Thus, most recurrences were certainly unpreventable but they represented the less severe form of venous thromboembolism.

Our study had several strengths: (i) we used a double-blind, randomized design in a carefully predefined and characterized population; (ii) we achieved a very long and complete follow-up for all patients included; (iii) patients adhered closely to the study protocol during the treatment period and subsequent follow-up; and (iv) all outcomes were reviewed and validated blindly by an independent centralized adjudication committee.

### Pathophysiology… [^113RcXin]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Using blood thinners is the standard treatment. Typical medications include rivaroxaban, apixaban, and warfarin. Beginning warfarin treatment requires an additional non-oral anticoagulant, often injections of heparin. Prevention of VTE for the general population includes avoiding obesity and maintaining an active lifestyle. Preventive efforts following low-risk surgery include early and frequent walking. Riskier surgeries generally prevent VTE with a blood thinner or aspirin combined with intermittent pneumatic compression. D-dimers are a fibrin degradation product, a natural byproduct of fibrinolysis that is typically found in the blood. An elevated level can result from plasmin dissolving a clot — or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. Anticoagulation, the standard treatment for DVT, prevents further clot growth and PE, but does not act directly on existing clots.

Management Treatment for DVT is warranted when the clots are either proximal, distal, and symptomatic, or upper extremity and symptomatic. Providing anticoagulation, or blood-thinning medicine, is the typical treatment after patients are checked to make sure they are not subject to bleeding. However, treatment varies depending upon the location of DVT. For example, in cases of isolated distal DVT, ultrasound surveillance, might be used instead of anticoagulation. Although, those with isolated distal DVT at a high risk of VTE recurrence are typically anticoagulated as if they had proximal DVT. Those at a low risk for recurrence might receive a four- to six-week course of anticoagulation, lower doses, or no anticoagulation at all. In contrast, those with proximal DVT should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulation.

Some anticoagulants can be taken by mouth, and these oral medicines include warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban. Other anticoagulants cannot be taken by mouth. These parenteral medicines include low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, and unfractionated heparin. Some oral medicines are sufficient when taken alone, while others require the use of an additional parenteral blood thinner. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are the typical first-line medicines, and they are sufficient when taken orally. Rivaroxaban is taken once daily, and apixaban is taken twice daily. Warfarin, dabigatran, and edoxaban require the use of a parenteral anticoagulant to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy.

When warfarin is initiated for VTE treatment, a 5-day minimum of a parenteral anticoagulant together with warfarin is given, which is followed by warfarin-only therapy. Warfarin is taken to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2. 0–3. 0, with
2. 5 as the target. The benefit of taking warfarin declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age. Periodic INR monitoring is not necessary when first-line direct oral anticoagulants are used. Overall, anticoagulation therapy is complex, and many circumstances can affect how these therapies are managed. Structural representations of the backbone of heparins, which vary in the size of their chain, and the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux. The duration of anticoagulation therapy is a key factor in clinical decision making.

### Anticoagulation in patients with suspected DVT… [^11499QrM]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography frequently is performed to evaluate patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis of the leg. Simplified compression ultrasonography has high accuracy for symptomatic proximal venous thrombosis but can miss thrombosis of the distal calf veins. A repeat simplified compression ultrasonography is necessary within five to seven days to look for proximal thrombus propagation. Comprehensive duplex ultrasonography examines the deep veins within the entire leg down to the malleolus, thus potentially obviating routine repeat scanning. Stevens and associates performed a prospective cohort study of patients with a suspected first episode of DVT who had a negative comprehensive leg duplex ultrasonogram. The researchers examined the rate of venous thromboembolism in these patients after withholding anticoagulant therapy for three months. Exclusion criteria included previous DVT, pregnancy, and patients receiving long-term anticoagulation therapy for another reason.

Comprehensive ultrasonography was performed by registered vascular technologists and interpreted by a vascular surgeon. If a single, noncompressible segment was identified, the study was reported as positive, and the patient was diagnosed with DVT. If the results of all imaged venous segments were negative, anticoagulation was withheld without consideration of symptoms or clinical signs. Patients in the negative cohort were interviewed about multiple aspects of their health at least three months after enrollment in the study. The primary outcome measure was venous thromboembolism diagnosed by objective testing, including death caused by a venous thromboembolism. During the three-month period, symptoms of recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 22 of the 375 patients in the negative cohort, with three patients actually having objective evidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis.

Among the other 19 patients, four had suspected pulmonary embolism that was not confirmed by objective testing. Six patients in the negative cohort died in the three-month follow-up period; none of the deaths were caused by venous thromboembolism. The authors conclude that although comprehensive duplex ultrasonography takes more time to perform than simplified compression ultrasonogaphy, the advantage of requiring only a single examination is significant. They state that it is safe to withhold anticoagulation from patients with suspected symptomatic DVT who have a negative comprehensive duplex sonogram, repeatedly negative simplified compression ultrasonograms, or one negative simplified duplex ultrasonogram and normal results on a whole blood D-dimer test. When comprehensive ultrasonography reveals thrombosis isolated to the calf vein, anticoagulation can be withheld if ultrasonography is repeated to monitor extension of these thrombi into proximal deep veins.

The authors add that these results may not apply to patients who are pregnant or if factors prevent visualization of the deep venous system of the calf. In an accompanying editorial, El Kheir and Büller confirm the value of the single comprehensive ultrasonogram approach and recommend further testing of this procedure with good pretest clinical probability analysis or D-dimer testing to find the optimal algorithm to evaluate patients for symptomatic DVT.

### Management guidelines from the American Society of Hematology… [^114BZgG8]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In-hospital and home treatment of PE provide similar outcomes, although home treatment of DVT produces better outcomes.
- After primary DOAC treatment for three to six months, decisions for indefinite anticoagulation depend on risk factors associated with initial VTE.
- When VTE is unprovoked or associated with chronic factors, indefinite anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE with a slightly increased risk of major bleeding.
- Aspirin is less effective than anticoagulants at reducing VTE risk but has similar major bleeding risk. From the AFP Editors Every year, up to two in every 1, 000 people in the United States experience venous thromboembolism. The American Society of Hematology has updated recommendations for management of VTE, which includes deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Initial Management of VTE TREATMENT SETTING Treating VTE at home often produces better outcomes than treating in the hospital.

In patients with uncomplicated DVT, treating at home reduces the likelihood of PE development. The risk of a subsequent DVT is also less. Mortality and bleeding rates with DVT are similar between treatment settings. For patients with clinically stable PE, home treatment produces outcomes similar to those with hospital treatment. THROMBOLYSIS In the absence of threat to the limb or high risk of severe postthrombotic syndrome, thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for DVT. Up to one-half of patients with proximal DVT develop postthrombotic syndrome, although only 10% will experience severe symptoms. Thrombolysis reduces postthrombotic syndrome but increases major bleeding, with similar mortality and subsequent VTE risks.

MEDICATION Although direct oral anticoagulant treatment has similar effects on mortality and subsequent VTE risk as vitamin K antagonists, the risk of major bleeding is lower using DOACs. DOAC treatment appears to reduce cost by eliminating monitoring requirements. Patients who have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or morbid obesity, or who have had bariatric surgery, are poor candidates for DOAC treatment. No particular DOAC is recommended. Primary VTE Treatment Treatment of initial VTE is most effective for three to six months. Although longer treatment reduces the likelihood of recurrence, this benefit may be offset by increases in bleeding and mortality. After primary treatment, secondary VTE prevention is recommended for patients with a chronic persistent risk factor without a high risk of bleeding complications. There are separate recommendations for patients with cancer.

Patients with unprovoked VTE do not need follow-up studies such as d-dimer testing or ultrasonography to detect residual thrombosis to consider extending treatment. Limited study suggests that using these methods results in increased major bleeding with only slight reductions in future VTE. Secondary Prevention Secondary prevention is deciding whether to continue antithrombotic therapy indefinitely after VTE. In secondary prevention, the presence of provoking factors for the initial VTE is most important for this decision. Clinical prognostic scores have been proposed to determine the risk of recurrence, but patient-oriented evidence is lacking. After VTE that is unprovoked or provoked by a chronic factor, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered.
