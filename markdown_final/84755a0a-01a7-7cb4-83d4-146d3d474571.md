## Question

Name NSAID

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a list of NSAIDs with examples and a brief explanation of the class. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining NSAIDs and their mechanism. Then, I should categorize them by selectivity and provide representative examples. Next, I will verify which agents are available over-the-counter versus prescription-only. After that, I need to check for special cases like aspirin and topical formulations. Finally, I will confirm key safety caveats and ensure the list aligns with authoritative sources such as the FDA and major guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism so I don't gloss over fundamentals. NSAIDs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that reduce pain, fever, and inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby decreasing prostaglandin synthesis; this is the core pharmacology across the class, though selectivity for COX-1 versus COX-2 varies by agent and dose, which has clinical implications for gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal safety [^a6db1665] [^50f9d0d7].

> I will now examine the major subclasses, because grouping by COX selectivity helps frame both efficacy and risk. Nonselective NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, COX-2–selective agents (coxibs) preferentially inhibit COX-2, and some agents are described as relatively selective depending on dose and context; I should double-check that this framework matches contemporary summaries and FDA communications, which it does [^6a6c3ef3] [^50f9d0d7].

> Next, I should list representative nonselective NSAIDs and verify availability. Common nonselective NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid, piroxicam, meloxicam, and ketorolac; ibuprofen and naproxen are available over-the-counter at lower strengths, while many others are prescription-only, and I need to ensure I don't misclassify any of these, which aligns with FDA listings and clinical references [^fe49b88f] [^e0abcdc9].

> Hold on, I should verify the COX-2–selective agents and their status. Celecoxib is the prototypical coxib available in the U.S.; rofecoxib and valdecoxib were withdrawn due to cardiovascular safety concerns, so I should not list them as currently available even though they appear historically; etoricoxib is used in some regions but is not FDA-approved in the U.S., so I will note that explicitly to avoid confusion [^50f9d0d7] [^fe49b88f].

> Wait, let me verify the special case of aspirin. Aspirin is indeed an NSAID mechanistically, but it is unique because low-dose aspirin irreversibly acetylates platelet COX-1 and is used for cardioprotection; importantly, it carries gastrointestinal bleeding risk and is not interchangeable with other NSAIDs for analgesic dosing, so I should keep it distinct in the list and note its dual role and risks [^bfe0e2d5] [^fe49b88f].

> I need to check topical NSAIDs because they are clinically relevant for localized osteoarthritis pain with reduced systemic exposure. Topical diclofenac is the most studied and commonly used, with evidence of efficacy and favorable systemic safety in general populations; I should confirm that this is supported by comparative reviews, which it is, while acknowledging that cardiovascular safety data are less robust for topical agents and warrant cautious interpretation [^c262007f].

> Let me consider safety framing so I don't overgeneralize. All NSAIDs, including coxibs, carry class warnings for gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks; risk is dose- and duration-dependent and modified by patient factors, so the principle of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration applies across agents, and I should emphasize this consistently with FDA guidance and specialty guidelines [^b362ea10] [^5b8bf158] [^e44504b2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include acetaminophen in the NSAID list because it is often grouped with OTC analgesics; hold on, I should verify and correct that. Acetaminophen is not an NSAID because it lacks meaningful COX inhibition at therapeutic doses and therefore does not provide anti-inflammatory activity, so it should not be listed among NSAIDs despite frequent co-use for pain and fever [^a1387ced].

> Putting this together, here is a concise, reference-aligned summary: NSAIDs are defined by COX inhibition and include nonselective agents such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid, piroxicam, meloxicam, and ketorolac, with ibuprofen and naproxen available OTC; COX-2–selective agents include celecoxib in the U.S.; aspirin is an NSAID used primarily for antiplatelet effects at low dose; topical diclofenac is a localized NSAID option for osteoarthritis; and all NSAIDs require dose minimization and risk assessment due to GI, CV, and renal risks [^fe49b88f] [^50f9d0d7] [^c262007f] [^b362ea10].

NSAIDs are **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs** that reduce pain, inflammation, and fever by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) [^a6db1665], thereby decreasing prostaglandin synthesis [^a6db1665]. Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen, piroxicam, meloxicam, and celecoxib (a COX-2 selective agent) [^fe49b88f]. They are widely used for arthritis, musculoskeletal pain, dysmenorrhea, and acute pain, but carry risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events, and renal impairment, especially with prolonged use or high doses [^50f9d0d7] [^39e45bab]. Use the **lowest effective dose for the shortest duration** [^5b8bf158], and avoid in patients with peptic ulcer disease, significant cardiovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of action

NSAIDs exert their therapeutic effects by **inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes**, which are responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins [^a6db1665]. Prostaglandins are lipid compounds that mediate inflammation, pain, and fever. There are two main isoforms of COX: COX-1, which is constitutively expressed and involved in maintaining physiological functions such as gastrointestinal mucosal protection and platelet aggregation, and COX-2, which is inducible and primarily involved in inflammation and pain [^a6db1665]. Traditional NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, leading to reduced inflammation and pain but also causing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects [^50f9d0d7]. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, were developed to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity while maintaining anti-inflammatory efficacy [^ba075fda].

---

## Classification of NSAIDs

NSAIDs are broadly classified into **two main categories** based on their selectivity for COX enzymes:

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-selective NSAIDs | - Ibuprofen <br/> - Naproxen <br/> - Diclofenac <br/> - Indomethacin <br/> - Ketoprofen <br/> - Piroxicam <br/> - Meloxicam | Inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, providing analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects but increasing the risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects [^50f9d0d7] [^39e45bab]. |
| Selective COX-2 inhibitors | - Celecoxib <br/> - Etoricoxib <br/> - Rofecoxib (withdrawn) | Primarily inhibit COX-2 enzyme, reducing gastrointestinal toxicity but potentially increasing cardiovascular risk, particularly with prolonged use [^7affb3d2] [^50f9d0d7]. |

---

## Clinical indications

NSAIDs are indicated for a **variety of conditions**, including:

- **Inflammatory conditions**: Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory arthropathies [^e44504b2].
- **Acute pain**: Musculoskeletal injuries, dental pain, postoperative pain, and renal colic [^74c439da].
- **Dysmenorrhea**: Menstrual pain and discomfort.
- **Fever**: Antipyretic effects in acute febrile conditions.

---

## Common adverse effects

While NSAIDs are effective in managing pain and inflammation, they are associated with **significant adverse effects**, particularly with prolonged use or high doses:

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, and dyspepsia are common complications of NSAID use [^6ceb4793] [^b626fc03].
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and hypertension, particularly with selective COX-2 inhibitors and certain non-selective NSAIDs such as diclofenac [^7affb3d2] [^50f9d0d7].
- **Renal effects**: NSAIDs can cause renal impairment, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease, dehydration, or concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs [^5427ac3c].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Asthma exacerbations, urticaria, and anaphylaxis can occur, particularly in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [^9b4f858c].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

NSAIDs should be **used with caution or avoided** in the following situations:

- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Active or history of peptic ulcer disease due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Patients with established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk should avoid NSAIDs, particularly selective COX-2 inhibitors [^d6504a90].
- **Renal impairment**: Chronic kidney disease or renal impairment increases the risk of NSAID-induced nephrotoxicity [^5427ac3c].
- **Pregnancy**: NSAIDs are contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy due to risk of fetal ductus arteriosus closure and renal impairment [^fe49b88f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following principles for **NSAID use**:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible to minimize adverse effects [^5b8bf158].
- **Individualized risk assessment**: Assess patient-specific risk factors, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risk, before initiating NSAID therapy [^7d5a760e].
- **Gastroprotection**: Consider co-prescribing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or misoprostol in patients at high risk of gastrointestinal complications [^5ed81de7].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events, and renal impairment [^e44504b2].

---

## Conclusion

NSAIDs are a cornerstone of pain and inflammation management, but their use must be balanced against significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks. Clinicians should **individualize therapy**, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and monitor patients closely for adverse effects. Selective COX-2 inhibitors offer gastrointestinal advantages but may increase cardiovascular risk, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^50f9d0d7].

### An overview of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug reactions [^708abe64]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, are among the most commonly used drugs worldwide. They account for a large number of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The prevalence of NSAID-induced reactions is increasing. Distinguishing between a predicted side effect of a drug and a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction is essential to manage the affected patient. However, most clinicians find it difficult to diagnose these types of reactions despite published classification schemes. In this overview, we provide an in-depth review of NSAID classification, types of NSAID reactions, diagnostic tactics, and management strategies to provide the reader with a greater understanding of NSAID-induced reactions.

### Balancing risks and benefits of cyclooxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^92e43147]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Choosing NSAID therapy remains confusing and controversial-the challenge for the clinician is to sum all the risks as well as analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy. COX-2 inhibitors are an important scientific advance in pain therapy, and using them in a safe and cost-effective manner is possible when all the competing risks are carefully weighed.

### Gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^39e45bab]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed but can have serious gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular side effects, which have led to the withdrawal of some of these drugs and continuing uncertainty about the best approach to patients requiring NSAID therapy, particularly in those with GI or cardiovascular risk factors. To define the risks to the GI and cardiovascular systems associated with NSAID therapy, we have undertaken a series of systematic reviews of original articles published between January 1995 and December 2006. In this article we describe the mechanisms and patterns of GI and cardiovascular side effects in NSAID-taking patients and identify a range of drug and patient factors that contribute to an increased risk of adverse events. We conclude that NSAID therapy should not be started unless it is essential, and that Helicobacter pylori eradication should be considered in patients at increased GI risk. We discuss the use of gastroprotective agents and provide practical advice to help physicians assess and balance both cardiovascular and GI risks and benefits in their prescribing decisions.

### Recommendations for the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cardiovascular disease risk: decades later, any new lessons learned? [^33ebba36]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most prescribed pharmacologic therapies worldwide due to their therapeutic analgesic efficacy and relative tolerability. In the past several decades, various cardiovascular (CV) adverse events have emerged regarding both traditional NSAIDs (tNSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective (coxibs). This review will provide an updated report on the CV risk profile of NSAIDs, focusing on several of the larger clinical trials, meta-analyses, and registry studies. We aim to provide rheumatologists with a framework for NSAID use in the context of rheumatologic chronic pain management. Recent findings: In patients with and without CV diseases, the use of NSAIDs, both tNSAIDs and coxibs, is associated with an increased risk of adverse CV events, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cerebrovascular events. These CV risks have increased within weeks of coxib use and higher doses of tNSAIDs. The risk of adverse CV events is heterogenous across NSAIDs; naproxen and low-dose ibuprofen appear to have lower increased CV risk among NSAIDs. A variation in CV risk is associated with multiple factors, including NSAID class, COX-2 selectivity, treatment dose and duration, and baseline patient risk. Summary: Many important questions remain regarding the safety of NSAIDs and whether the culmination of research performed could inform us whether specific patient subtypes or NSAID class may have a more favorable profile. tNSAIDs such as naproxen and low-dose ibuprofen may have a lower CV risk profile, while coxibs have a more favorable GI risk profile. In general, any NSAID can be optimized if used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time, especially among individuals with increased CV risk.

### Pharmacogenetics of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^4b24998a]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2012). Low credibility.

With the beginning of the Human Genome Project, an emerging field of science was brought to the forefront of the pharmaceutical community. Pharmacogenetics facilitates optimization of the current patient-centered care model and pharmacotherapy as a whole. Utilizing these ever-expanding branches of science to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can provide novel opportunities to affect patient care. With a wide range of NSAID choices available as treatment options for relieving pain and/or reducing inflammation or fever, a more systematic way of selecting the ideal agent for the patients based upon their genetic information could spare them from a potentially permanent health-care condition. Furthermore, if a patient possesses or lacks certain alleles, serious adverse events can be anticipated and avoided. The tailoring of drug therapy can be achieved using the published data and cutting-edge genetic testing to attain a higher standard of care for patients.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the perioperative period: current controversies and concerns [^7eb48906]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors provide significant analgesic and opioid-sparing benefits. However, these analgesics are commonly avoided owing to concerns of potential adverse effects. The evidence for NSAID-related adverse effects is conflicting and of poor quality, and these analgesics are safer than what has been implied. Thus, it is imperative that NSAIDs or COX-2-specific inhibitors are administered routinely unless there are well-founded contraindications.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^a1387ced]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act via inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, were discovered more than 100 years ago. They remain a key component of the pharmacological management of acute and chronic pain. The COX-1 and COX-2 isozymes have different biological functions; analgesic activity is primarily (although not exclusively) associated with inhibition of COX-2, while different side effects result from the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2. All available NSAIDs, including acetaminophen and aspirin, are associated with potential side effects, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects, related to their relative selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2. Since all NSAIDs exert their therapeutic activity through inhibition of the COX isozymes, strategies are needed to reduce the risks associated with NSAIDs while achieving sufficient pain relief. A better understanding of the inhibitory activity and COX-1/COX-2 selectivity of an NSAID at therapeutic doses, based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties (eg, inhibitory dose, absorption, plasma versus tissue distribution, and elimination), and the impact on drug tolerability and safety can guide the selection of appropriate NSAIDs for pain management. For example, many NSAIDs with moderate to high selectivity for COX-2 versus COX-1 can be administered at doses that maximize efficacy (~80% inhibition of COX-2) while minimizing COX-1 inhibition and associated side effects, such as gastrointestinal toxicity. Acidic NSAIDs with favorable tissue distribution and short plasma half-lives can additionally be dosed to provide near-constant analgesia while minimizing plasma concentrations to permit recovery of COX-mediated prostaglandin production in the vascular wall and other organs. Each patient's clinical background, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be taken into account when selecting appropriate NSAIDs. New methods are emerging to assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate NSAIDs and their doses/schedules, such as biomarkers that may predict the response to NSAID treatment in individual patients.

### Need to develop new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations [^ac87b55c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the management of pain, primary care physicians are often the first to diagnose and treat acute or chronic painful conditions. This places them in an important intersection to manage pain, in which safe and effective therapeutic options are paramount for their patients. For decades, NSAIDs have been routinely prescribed for relief of mild to moderate acute and chronic pain. Yet, safety and tolerability concerns associated with the use of this class of drugs continue to be an issue for patients and clinicians.

Objective

The objective of this review was to discuss the unmet medical needs of patients in the management of pain and inflammation, review the dose-dependent safety data associated with use of NSAIDs, and discuss the need to develop new NSAID formulations to improve safety and tolerability while maintaining efficacy.

Methods

We performed literature searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases through December 2012 for articles in English that reported dose-dependent safety and tolerability data associated with use of NSAIDs.

Results

The risk of serious, dose-dependent adverse events involving the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and kidneys is associated with use of NSAIDs. On the basis of these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration has requested that the package insert for all NSAIDs be revised to include a boxed warning highlighting the potential increased risk of cardiovascular events and the risk of serious, and potentially life-threatening, gastrointestinal tract bleeding. While using lower dosages of a particular NSAID may be associated with lower rates of adverse events, maintaining the clinical efficacy of standard NSAID dosages remains a challenge.

Conclusions

There is a need to develop new and effective NSAID formulations to minimize the safety and tolerability concerns associated with currently available NSAIDs, yet maintain efficacy in management of inflammation and pain.

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for acute and chronic pain [^e0abcdc9]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use and impact on common rheumatic and arthritic conditions is critical to reconciling their appropriate use with their potentially serious adverse effects. NSAIDs have a profound impact on the treatment of connective tissue disorders because of their ability to address the underlying cause with specific benefits of decreasing stiffness and inflammation, and improving mobility. NSAID use is twice as common as opioid use, and inappropriate use of NSAIDs is widespread. NSAID use should be monitored and the impact understood to mitigate the risks. NSAID discontinuation should be evidence based and individualized to specific requirements.

### COX-2 inhibitors. are they nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with a better safety profile? [^ba075fda]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

In the treatment of arthritis, NSAIDs are some of the most commonly used drugs, although the prescription of such drugs has been questioned due to their inherent risks for gastrointestinal compromise, platelet effects, and the potential for renal toxicity with long-term use. With the availability of celecoxib and rofecoxib, 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors (or COX-1 sparing agents) as new forms of NSAIDs, these issues have become magnified not only in the context of risk-to-benefit ratios but also interms of pharmacoeconomics because they have been proven to be equally efficacious as the nonselective NSAIDs, with an improved safety profile particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, but at a significantly increased cost.

Medication Guide for Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

What is the most important information I should know about medicines called Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

 NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including:

Increased risk of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This risk may happen early in treatment and may increase:
with increasing doses of NSAIDs
with longer use of NSAIDs

Do not take NSAIDs right before or after a heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)".

 Avoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack.

Increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), stomach and intestines:

The risk of getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with:

NSAIDs should only be used:

exactly as prescribed
at the lowest dose possible for your treatment
for the shortest time needed

What are NSAIDs?

NSAIDs are used to treat pain and redness, swelling, and heat (inflammation) from medical conditions such as different types of arthritis, menstrual cramps, and other types of short-term pain.

### Progress in understanding hypersensitivity reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^0738506d]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the medications most commonly used for treating pain and inflammation, are the main triggers of drug hypersensitivity reactions. The latest classification of NSAIDs hypersensitivity by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) differentiates between cross-hypersensitivity reactions (CRs), associated with COX-1 inhibition, and selective reactions, associated with immunological mechanisms. Three phenotypes fill into the first group: NSAIDs-exacerbated respiratory disease, NSAIDs-exacerbated cutaneous disease and NSAIDs-induced urticaria/angioedema. Two phenotypes fill into the second one: single-NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis and single-NSAID-induced delayed reactions. Diagnosis of NSAIDs hypersensitivity is hampered by different factors, including the lack of validated in vitro biomarkers and the uselessness of skin tests. The advances achieved over recent years recommend a re-evaluation of the EAACI classification, as it does not consider other phenotypes such as blended reactions (coexistence of cutaneous and respiratory symptoms) or food-dependent NSAID-induced anaphylaxis. In addition, it does not regard the natural evolution of phenotypes and their potential interconversion, the development of tolerance over time or the role of atopy. Here, we address these topics. A state of the art on the underlying mechanisms and on the approaches for biomarkers discovery is also provided, including genetic studies and available information on transcriptomics and metabolomics.

### NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injury: a focused update for clinicians [^6ceb4793]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Gastroenterologists care for users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when the vast population exposed to the medication class experiences a relatively uncommon serious gastrointestinal (GI) side effect. As serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of these drugs have also been recognized, there remains continued confusion about the best treatment for patients who benefit from NSAID therapy and are at risk for GI and CV adverse events. Recognition of those patients at risk and strategies to reduce the adverse side effects of NSAIDs continues to provide an opportunity to improve patient outcomes. This review discusses the injury induced by these agents throughout the GI tract as well as strategies to prevent acute injury and reduce the development of serious adverse events. NSAID medication selection as well as GI cotherapy should balance individual patients' GI and CV risks.

### Cardiovascular effects and safety of (non-aspirin) NSAIDs [^50f9d0d7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective, widely used analgesics. For the past 2 decades, considerable attention has been focused on their cardiovascular safety. After early studies indicating an association between NSAID use and increased risks of heart failure and elevated blood pressure, subsequent studies found a link between NSAID use and an increased risk of thrombotic events. Selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors (also known as coxibs) have been associated with the greatest risk of adverse vascular effects but concern also relates to non-selective NSAIDs, especially those with strong COX2 inhibition such as diclofenac. Although NSAID use is discouraged in patients with cardiovascular disease, pain-relief medication is often required and, in the absence of analgesics that are at least as effective but safer, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed. Furthermore, non-prescription use of NSAIDs, even among people with underlying cardiovascular risks, is largely unsupervised and varies widely between countries. As concern mounts about the disadvantages of alternatives to NSAIDs (such as opioids) for pain management, the use of NSAIDs is likely to rise. Given that the pharmaceutical development pipeline lacks new analgesics, health-care professionals, patients and medicine regulatory authorities are focused on optimizing the safe use of NSAIDs. In this Review, we summarize the current evidence on the cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs and present an approach for their use in the context of holistic pain management.

### A community based study of adverse effects of NSAIDS… [^5427ac3c]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are widely available over the counter in pharmacies, wholesale stores, gas stations, and convenience stores for the treatment of fever and pain. In addition, more than 111 million people in the U. S., including many older Americans, take prescription NSAIDs each year. In certain high-risk patients, NSAIDs can significantly disrupt blood flow to the kidneys and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury. CA-AKI can lead to hospitalization, new-onset chronic kidney disease, and more rapid progression of existing chronic kidney disease. Many patients are unaware of NSAID-associated risks and the importance of appropriate use to prevent NSAID-induced CA-AKI. Current patient education materials, including the medication guide, may focus too narrowly on bleeding risks associated with NSAID use and thereby fail to describe the potential for CA-AKI.

Project Description Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences implemented a research project to assess NSAID use and the potential for reducing preventable harm from both prescription and over-the-counter use. The project evaluated adverse renal risks among a large population of patients in primary care settings. An informed community-based pilot program was developed to educate providers, patients, and pharmacists and determine if NSAID risk awareness could be improved. Project Goals
- Evaluate a nationwide cohort of patients in the DARTNet Practice Performance Quality Improvement Registry in collaboration with American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network to determine NSAID prescribing patterns and associated effects on kidney function.
- Develop and implement an innovative community-based NSAID education program to target providers, patients, and pharmacists.
- Evaluate effects of the education program on provider NSAID prescribing patterns and electronic medical record documentation, patient awareness, and pharmacist counseling efforts. Project Results The final report from the researchers to the FDA included the following results:

- Patients exposed to NSAIDS were older, having more co-morbidities and kidney impairment than the general population. Primary care providers commonly prescribed NSAIDS to patients at high risk for NSAID-related kidney injury.
- A majority of patients preferred educational materials in print form. Patients who viewed educational materials in print form achieved higher scores related to NSAID and kidney risk knowledge than those who viewed a video.
- More than half of patients exposed to education materials regarding NSAID-related kidney risks reported they would avoid future NSAID use.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^3deffc2f]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Thus, clinicians and their patients face some dilemmas about how to balance the GI and CV risks, especially in patients known to be at increased risk for both, as occurs in many elderly patients. Cryer, in a submission on behalf of consumers to a 2014 FDA hearing that was contemplating a labeling change based solely on CV risk, emphasized the need for a comprehensive risk assessment: ' In the process of addressing cardiovascular health in the setting of NSAID use, which we applaud, we would not want you to inadvertently increase the risk of other untoward outcomes associated with NSAIDs, such as GI and renal toxicities '.

It is timely to review the area; thus, in a recent article published in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato et al. report on a recent consensus meeting that has updated earlier guidelines using more recent information.

### Cyclooxygenase inhibition: pain, inflammation, and the cardiovascular system [^fa4d720e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Inhibitors of the cyclooxygenases (COXs), the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), relieve inflammatory pain, but are associated with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications. Given the widespread use of NSAIDs, there has been a longstanding interest in optimizing their risk-benefit ratio, for example by reducing their gastrointestinal risk. More recently, the focus has shifted toward the cardiovascular complications of NSAIDs and very large prospective studies have been performed to compare cardiovascular risk across distinct NSAIDs. Surprisingly, much less attention has been paid to the efficacy side of the risk-benefit ratio. There is marked variability in the degree of pain relief by NSAIDs due to the complex interplay of molecular mechanisms contributing to the pain sensation, variability in the disposition of NSAIDs, and imprecision in the quantification of human pain. Here we discuss how NSAIDs relieve pain, how molecular mechanisms relate to clinical efficacy, and how this may inform our interpretation of clinical trials.

### Classification of reactions to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [^e866dab6]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs may occur in susceptible individuals and vary in symptom (skin, respiratory tract, and solid organs), severity (from mild skin or respiratory reactions to severe generalized) and timing (from acute to delayed). The current classification of NSAID-induced reactions emerged with the understanding of the pathologic mechanism of reactions to NSAIDs which may be either non-allergic (related to cyclooxygenase inhibition) or immunologically mediated. In this chapter we discuss the implications of accurate NSAIDs hypersensitivity classification for proper diagnosis and patient management.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, are now among the most widely prescribed medications in the world. They have a long and fascinating history, with the use of aspirin derived from willow bark stretching back into the Assyrian culture. In the twenty-first century we are faced with both the challenge of balancing the benefits and side effects of these drugs and the exciting prospect of new, safer agents with comparable efficacy.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^d6504a90]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

As life expectancy in many countries increases into the 80s and beyond, degenerative joint disease is creating an increasing burden for patients and healthcare systems. For osteoarthritis especially, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) remain the most effective option for pain relief, short of surgical alternatives such as joint replacement. However, gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and their complications are well-known NSAID side effects that are more prevalent in the elderly and are, at times, life-threatening.

The recognition that NSAIDS damage the stomach and duodenum (at least partly) by blocking the mucosal production of protective prostaglandins catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 led to the development of COX-1-sparing NSAIDs. These selectively inhibit COX-2, which mediates synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. The strategy has been successful: highly selective COX-2 inhibitors do reduce (but do not eliminate) the risk of GI ulceration. However, an unanticipated risk that surfaced in several randomized studies was an increase in adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in patients taking COX-2 inhibitors for months or years. The European Medicines Agency responded promptly, stating, in 2005, that ' COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease… '. On the other hand, the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA), in the same year, declined to make such a limiting statement – noting that it was unclear whether COX-2 inhibitors carried a greater vascular risk than the older non-selective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs), that further research was required, and that in the meantime warnings about the possibility of increased CV risk with all NSAIDs should be included in drug labeling.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^288f20d8]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, anecdotal reports emerged suggesting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase susceptibility to infection and adversely impact clinical outcomes. This narrative literature review (March 2020-July 2021) attempted to clarify the relationship between NSAID use and COVID-19 outcomes related to disease susceptibility or severity. Twenty-four relevant publications (covering 25 studies) reporting original research data were identified; all were observational cohort studies, and eight were described as retrospective. Overall, these studies are consistent in showing that NSAIDs neither increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor worsen outcomes in patients with COVID-19. This is reflected in current recommendations from major public health authorities across the world, which support NSAID use for analgesic or antipyretic treatment during COVID-19. Thus, there is no basis on which to restrict or prohibit use of these drugs by consumers or patients to manage their health conditions and symptoms during the pandemic.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^488b565f]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In a recently published article in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato and colleagues present the results of a consensus conference that addressed several aspects of the management of pain in patients with osteoarthritis. The main areas covered include the relative safety in regard to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events of non-selective 'traditional' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) versus cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs. The role of co-therapy with proton pump inhibitors in enhancing gastrointestinal safety is also reviewed. This commentary focuses on two areas that the consensus conference addressed, i) the whole length of gastrointestinal tract risk profile of the various NSAIDs (not just the ulcer risks in stomach and duodenum); ii) more recent information, but still some uncertainties, about the cardiovascular risks associated with the two classes of NSAID in general, and naproxen in particular.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^73af7030]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

NSAIDs are a commonly used class of medication. They are affordable, widely available OTC, and have a well-established benefit-risk profile. NSAIDs provide benefits in managing COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, body aches, and headache. In addition, many patients with chronic or recurrent inflammatory conditions rely on NSAIDs to manage their everyday symptoms. Therefore, some of these drugs, including ibuprofen, are on the WHO's list of essential medicines to meet the most important needs in a health system.

Concerns about the potential of NSAID treatment to negatively impact COVID-19 outcomes were raised early in 2020. Since then, robust clinical data have been published, providing the opportunity to define the benefit/risk ratio of NSAID use with an evidence-based approach. The studies identified here represent the best available evidence to inform healthcare professionals and the scientific community. Of the 24 relevant publications identified, the overwhelming majority are consistent in showing that NSAIDs neither increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor worsen clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. In addition, a meta-analysis demonstrated no increase in risk of mortality among NSAID users vs. non-NSAID users. Another, very recent, systematic review and meta-analysis published after the cut-off of our search found no excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients exposed to NSAIDs. In addition, in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, exposure to NSAIDs was not associated with excess risk of hospital admission, death, or severe outcomes.

### Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in US adults: changes over time and by demographic [^c4edc338]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

For many years, aspirin and non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been used to address acute maladies (eg, pain, fever and inflammation). More recently, increasing knowledge of NSAIDs' preventive effects against development and progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)and cancerhas encouraged their use for prevention of chronic diseases, as well as for acute pain. However, the side effects and potential toxicities of long-term NSAID use, including increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, kidney toxicityand potential for haemorrhagic stroke, have raised concerns.

Recommendations for routine use of aspirin for prevention of CVD and other chronic diseases in healthy individuals are controversial. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) supports the regular use of aspirin in those with established heart disease, it recently denied requests for aspirin to be marketed as a therapeutic agent suitable for the primary prevention of CVD. This decision is contentious; agencies such as the American Heart Association, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) support aspirin's use in CVD prevention for those 'at high risk' of heart attack. Similarly, the recommendations on NSAID use for cancer prevention are still being debated. Recognising the potential for significant benefit and the need to manage possible harms, the USPSTF now recommends initiation of low-dose aspirin for CVD and colorectal cancer risk reduction in men and women 50–59 years old with at least 10% 10-year CVD risk, but does not include non-aspirin NSAIDs in the recommendation. The National Cancer Institute has less clear advice, awaiting the outcome of several long-term trials. Thus, with differing opinions and messages about regular aspirin/NSAID use from key health agencies, it is not clear what overall message the public has received.

### Prospects for changing the burden of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity [^5ed81de7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the risk of clinically important upper gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeds about fourfold. Other risk factors for these events include advanced age, higher NSAID dose, prior ulcer or bleed, use of anticoagulants, use of corticosteroids, and poor general health. Among NSAID users with more than one risk factor, the incidence of serious ulcer complications may be as high as 4% to 8% per year. NSAIDs may also increase blood pressure and have adverse effects on renal function. NSAID-associated toxicity may be decreased by (1) trying less toxic alternative drugs; (2) using NSAIDs less frequently or at a lower dose; (3) use of cotherapy, such as misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors, to prevent complications; (4) or use of the more selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. More research is needed to determine which of these strategies or combination of strategies is optimal in terms of patient safety and cost.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognised as causing peptic ulceration and ulcer complications. However, several critical issues, including the amount of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disease affected by NSAIDs, their interaction with ancillary risk factors, and how to optimise management in subgroups, remain poorly understood. In this article, strategies for subgroups that take account of non-specific gastrointestinal risks, minimisation of residual risk, and the importance of non-gastrointestinal toxicity are suggested, and areas for research identified.

### COX isoforms in the cardiovascular system: understanding the activities of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^a6db1665]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the formation of prostanoids by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Work in the past 15 years has shown that COX exists in two forms: COX1, which is largely associated with physiological functions, and COX2, which is largely associated with pathological functions. Heated debate followed the introduction of selective COX2 inhibitors around 5 years ago: do these drugs offer any advantages over the traditional NSAIDs theywere meant to replace, particularly in regard to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects? Here we discuss the evidence and the latest recommendations for the use of selective inhibitors of COX2 as well as the traditional NSAIDs.

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-related injury to the gastrointestinal tract: clinical picture, pathogenesis, and prevention [^e6b34561]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Increasing life expectancy in developed countries has led to a growing prevalence of arthritic disorders, which has been accompanied by increasing prescriptions for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These are the most widely used agents for musculoskeletal and arthritic conditions. Although NSAIDs are effective, their use is associated with a broad spectrum of adverse reactions in the liver, kidney, cardiovascular system, skin, and gut. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects are the most common. The dilemma for the physician prescribing NSAIDs is, therefore, to maintain the antiinflammatory and analgesic benefits, while reducing or preventing GI side effects. The challenge is to develop safer NSAIDs by shifting from a focus on GI toxicity to the increasingly more appreciated cardiovascular toxicity.

### Cataract surgery and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [^61cee49a]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have become an important adjunctive tool for surgeons performing routine and complicated cataract surgery. These medications have been found to reduce pain, prevent intraoperative miosis, modulate postoperative inflammation, and reduce the incidence of cystoid macular edema (CME). Whether used alone, synergistically with steroids, or for specific high-risk eyes prone to the development of CME, the effectiveness of these medications is compelling. This review describes the potential preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative uses of NSAIDs, including the potency, indications and treatment paradigms and adverse effects and contraindications. A thorough understanding of these issues will help surgeons maximize the therapeutic benefits of these agents and improve surgical outcomes.

Summary

Background

There are concerns that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of adverse outcomes among patients with coronavirus COVID-19. This study aimed to synthesize the evidence on associations between the use of NSAIDs and adverse outcomes.

Methods

A systematic search of WHO COVID-19 Database, Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Database for all articles published from January 1, 2020, to November 7, 2021, as well as a supplementary search of Google Scholar. We included all comparative studies that enrolled patients who took NSAIDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data extraction and quality assessment of methodology of included studies were completed by two reviewers independently. We conducted a meta-analysis on the main adverse outcomes, as well as selected subgroup analyses stratified by the type of NSAID and population (both positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or not).

Findings

Forty comparative studies evaluating 4,867,795 adult cases were identified. Twenty-eight (70%) of the included studies enrolled patients positive to SARS-CoV-2 tests. The use of NSAIDs did not reduce mortality outcomes among people with COVID-19 (number of studies [N] = 29, odds ratio [OR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 1.14, I² = 89%). Results suggested that the use of NSAIDs was not significantly associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with or without COVID-19 (N = 10, OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.07, I² = 78%; N = 8, aOR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.09, I² = 26%), or an increased probability of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (N = 12, OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.75, I² = 82%; N = 4, aOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.22, I² = 60%), requiring mechanical ventilation (N = 11, OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.54, I² = 63%; N = 5, aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.24, I² = 66%), or administration of supplemental oxygen (N = 5, OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.24, I² = 63%; N = 2, aOR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.12, I² = 0%). The subgroup analysis revealed that, compared with patients not using any NSAIDs, the use of ibuprofen (N = 5, OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.50 to 2.39; N = 4, aOR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.16) and COX-2 inhibitor (N = 4, OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.35 to 1.11; N = 2, aOR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.18) were not associated with an increased risk of death.

Interpretation

Data suggests that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, aspirin and COX-2 inhibitor, can be used safely among patients positive to SARS-CoV-2. However, for some of the analyses the number of studies were limited and the quality of evidence was overall low, therefore more research is needed to corroborate these findings.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^d30152eb]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are among the most commonly prescribed and used medications worldwide. However, they are associated with safety and tolerability concerns. There are a number of factors that need to be considered in the selection of an NSAID, including its potency, selectivity for the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic interactions, and the overall impact of these features on tolerability and safety. In addition to the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs, the negative effects of inhibiting prostanoid production on other body systems should be considered. Emerging factors, including biomarkers, may assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate doses and types of NSAIDs. Finally, the individual's clinical background, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered as important determinants that may exacerbate adverse reactions to NSAIDs. The risk factors for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs are summarized in Table 1. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The long-term use of higher doses of NSAIDs represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events;, therefore, the lowest dose of an NSAID should be used, particularly in patients with other known risk factors.

Current knowledge of factors affecting the safety and tolerability of NSAIDs, including the impact of selectivity, dose, and pharmacokinetics, is being used to guide the development of novel formulations of NSAIDs that address some of these tolerability concerns. For example, a novel immediate-release diclofenac formulation, which has a short half-life, acidic profile, and COX-2 selectivity, has been developed that allows for the use of lower doses (thus reducing systemic exposure and the potential for adverse events) together with rapid attainment of C max, providing sustained analgesia with a rapid onset. Strategies to mitigate the risks and maximize the therapeutic benefits associated with NSAIDs should continue to be employed, such as use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time, use of immediate-release formulations, avoidance of known drug interactions (eg, concomitant use with corticosteroids, low-dose aspirin, or other antiplatelet/anticoagulation events), and limited use of NSAIDs with high gastrointestinal toxicity. Additional strategies for minimizing the risks associated with NSAIDs in individuals with gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular risk factors are summarized in Table 2.

What are NSAIDs?

NSAIDs are used to treat pain and redness, swelling, and heat (inflammation) from medical conditions such as different types of arthritis, menstrual cramps, and other types of short-term pain.

Who should not take NSAIDs?

Do not take NSAIDs:

if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reaction with aspirin or any other NSAIDs.
right before or after heart bypass surgery.

Before taking NSAIDS, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have liver or kidney problems
have high blood pressure
have asthma
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are considering taking NSAIDs during pregnancy. You should not take NSAIDs after 29 weeks of pregnancy
are breastfeeding or plan to breast feed.

Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements. NSAIDs and some other medicines can interact with each other and cause serious side effects. Do not start taking any new medicine without talking to your healthcare provider first.

### Cyclooxygenase-2: a major therapeutic advance? [^8deb6a19]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The introduction of the highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (Coxibs) has resulted in the greatest new drug use ever. The hypothesis on which these drugs were developed was that COX-2-specific inhibitors would retain the advantageous aspects but restrict the deleterious effects of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Current practice and evidence suggests that bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract is reduced to the level of placebo and that dyspepsia persists, and in other areas (particularly renal side effects), COX-2-specific inhibitors still have classic NSAID problems.

However, none has specifically addressed the upper versus lower GI risk of COX-2 selective and non-selective compounds or the interaction at both the GI and CV level of either class of drugs with low-dose aspirin. To this end, a multidisciplinary group of experts convened to review current evidence, with the aim of developing statements and guidance devoted to these specific issues, to help clinicians make evidence-based decisions when selecting anti-inflammatory agents for the individual patient.

### An evidence-based approach to prescribing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. third Canadian consensus conference [^114d1a2f]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To revisit our previous evidence-based recommendations on the appropriate prescription of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) with particular emphasis on cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs).

Methods

Needs assessments were conducted among Canadian physicians to determine their educational needs surrounding NSAID/coxibs. A survey of patients with arthritis was also conducted. Consensus participants reviewed articles relating to NSAID/coxibs in peer-reviewed journals between January 2000 and December 2004. At the consensus meeting, held January 21–23, 2005, participants discussed selected topics, after which recommendations were formulated and debated. Results. At the time of the meeting, it was agreed that emerging cardiovascular data were not clear enough to decide whether unanticipated cardiovascular events associated with coxibs represent a class effect or an effect of an individual drug. However, publications that appeared shortly after the meeting, as well as data presented at both the Joint Meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration, February 16–18, 2005, and Health Canada's Expert Advisory Panel on the Safety of Cox-2 Selective NSAID, June 9–10, 2005, clarified that all available coxibs do carry some degree of cardiovascular risk, denoting a class effect. Our consensus group made the following specific recommendations: (1) Patients should be fully informed about treatment options, including the need to balance between cardiovascular risks and gastrointestinal (GI) benefits of NSAID/coxibs. (2) Coxibs are as effective as nonselective NSAID and superior to acetaminophen for the symptoms of arthritis. Topical NSAID may also be beneficial. (3) Coxibs are associated with fewer severe GI complications than nonselective NSAID. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed if an NSAID must be used in a patient at increased GI risk. (4) The renal/blood pressure (BP) impact of coxibs is similar to that of NSAID. (5) In individuals at risk, creatinine clearance and BP should be determined at baseline and shortly after treatment begins. (6) In the geriatric population, use of nonpharmacological therapies should be maximized, and special caution is required before prescribing oral NSAID/coxibs. (7) Patients taking rofecoxib have been shown to have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Current data suggest that this increased cardiovascular risk may be an effect of the NSAID/coxib class. (8) Although the data are limited, coxibs may be more cost-effective for patients at high GI risk than nonselective NSAID plus proprietary PPI.

Conclusion

Coxibs continue to be an option in the treatment armamentarium. Given the evolving cardiovascular information, physicians and patients should weigh the benefits and risks of NSAID/coxib treatment. This concern emphasizes the need to routinely reassess patients' risks. These recommendations, which were formulated according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, are intended to be used as guidelines to supplement, but not replace, the physician's judgment in clinical decision-making.

Literature searches

Literature searches were carried out to identify clinical studies, case reports, or review articles relating to the potential effects of NSAIDs on clinical outcomes in human patients with COVID-19 or similar SARS-related coronaviruses. The literature search covered the period from March 2020 to July 2021. The following search string was used to search Embase and Medline:

("COVID 19"/exp OR "COVID-19" OR "SARS-related coronavirus"/exp OR "SARS-related coronavirus" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome"/exp OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome") AND ("ibuprofen"/exp OR ibuprofen or NSAID)) AND ("case report"/de OR "clinical article"/de OR "clinical trial"/de OR "human"/de).

The articles retrieved from the two databases were independently reviewed for relevance by three reviewers. All primary research articles presenting clinical or pharmacoepidemiologic data on NSAID use in the context of COVID-19 were included. Data on outcomes, study population, type of NSAID and dose regimen, and statistical methodology were extracted. Relevant review articles were also checked for additional studies not identified by the literature search.

### Do selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors eliminate the adverse events associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy? [^858389a0]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Among the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective for relieving pain, but they are also associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events. Both the beneficial and harmful effects of NSAIDs result from inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme. Recognition of the two distinct COX isoforms prompted development of drugs that selectively block the activity of COX-2, thus providing pain relief and reducing inflammation while sparing COX-1, the enzyme apparently responsible for most protective prostaglandin synthesis in the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum. The results of preclinical and clinical studies indicate that COX-2 inhibitors exhibit high selectivity in inhibiting COX-2, provide excellent pain relief, and cause significantly less GI toxicity than do conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Although they represent a significant advance over nonselective NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors are not without limitations. They do not completely eliminate GI toxicity or the renal side effects associated with use of conventional NSAIDs. Moreover, in cases of inflammation or ulceration in the GI tract, COX-2 inhibition may delay ulcer healing. Finally, case reports and the results of animal experiments suggest that COX-2 inhibitors may adversely affect ovulation and cause a tendency towards prothrombotic events.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed and used, especially to treat patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Since their introduction as a therapeutic class, a large body of literature has accumulated on the side-effects of these drugs. NSAIDs, through their inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, can affect the renal and cardiovascular systems. However, the majority of reported side-effects are related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system, and the occurrence of these GI events adds significantly to the disease burden. Several factors have been identified that contribute to the risk of an NSAID-associated GI event. However, when considering risk, especially in clinical trials or observational studies, it is necessary to distinguish between baseline risk and NSAID-attributable risk, since this distinction can affect the results and conclusions of the study; NSAID-attributable risk is present in subjects who have few or no risk factors for upper GI toxicity. Safer NSAIDs, such as the new specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, when targeted to the appropriate patient (i.e. those with NSAID-attributable risk), should lead to improved outcomes and reduced costs.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of low back pain [^0ef6ea2c]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is amongst the top ten most common conditions presenting to primary care clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Further, it accounts for a significant amount of health care expenditure; indeed, over one third of all disability dollars spent in the United States is attributable to low back pain. In most cases, acute low back pain is a self-limiting disease. There are many evidence-based guidelines for the management of LBP. The most common risk factor for development of LBP is previous LBP, heavy physical work, and psychosocial risk factors. Management of LBP includes identification of red flags, exclusion of specific secondary causes, and comprehensive musculoskeletal/neurological examination of the lower extremities. In uncomplicated LBP, imaging is unnecessary unless symptoms become protracted. Reassurance that LBP will likely resolve and advice to maintain an active lifestyle despite LBP are the cornerstones of management. Medications are provided not because they change the natural history of the disorder, but rather because they enhance the ability of the patient to become more active, and in some cases, to sleep better. The most commonly prescribed medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxants. Although NSAIDs are a chemically diverse class, their similarities, efficacy, tolerability, and adverse effect profile have more similarities than differences. The most common side effects of NSAIDs are gastrointestinal. Agents with cyclo-oxygenase 2 selectivity are associated with reduced gastrointestinal bleeding, but problematic increases in adverse cardiovascular outcomes continue to spark concern. Fortunately, short-term use of NSAIDs for LBP is generally both safe and effective. This review will focus on the role of NSAIDs in the management of LBP.

### Postoperative pain management in enhanced recovery pathways [^3c53821a]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, ketorolac, and celecoxib, produce analgesia by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme and disrupting prostaglandin synthesis. NSAIDs are effective treatments for postoperative pain and important adjuncts in a multimodal analgesia regimen for the treatment of postoperative pain. When used in conjunction with opioids in the postoperative period, NSAIDs are associated with reduced opioid consumption and improved pain control., Combining NSAIDs with acetaminophen produces an additive or potentially synergistic analgesic effect. In addition, NSAID use may be associated with a reduced risk of opioid-related side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and sedation., Although NSAIDs are generally well-tolerated, they are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding, and renal impairment. The use of NSAIDs that selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, such as celecoxib, may reduce the risk of gastrointestinal events and bleeding. However, COX-2 inhibitors can increase the risk of cardiovascular adverse events and are typically avoided after cardiac surgery. Some studies suggest that NSAIDs may result in bone nonunion after spinal fusions, although the overall body of evidence remains inconclusive. Due to the lack of strong evidence that short term use of NSAIDs in the perioperative setting affects bone fusion, the ERAS Society continues to recommend NSAID use after spinal surgery. Similarly, there is ongoing debate regarding the association between NSAID use and increased risk of anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgery. Despite these potential risks, many ERPs will recommend the use of NSAIDs unless contraindicated given the strong evidence supporting their efficacy in the treatment of postoperative pain.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^1f124db6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^f0723a33]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Social media is a major influence in healthcare today, including the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19. There is a reasonable possibility of patients' opinions being affected by information that is not scientifically founded. At every opportunity, the importance of basing treatment decisions on consultation with healthcare professionals rather than unfounded information on social media should be emphasized.

Since the start of the pandemic, major health authorities across the world have published updated guidelines on clinical management of COVID-19 in an effort to combat misinformation. They consistently support the use of NSAIDs for treatment of COVID-19 symptoms, on the basis that there is no evidence of these drugs contributing to worsened outcomes. The WHO published its latest guidance in January 2021. This document recommends that patients with mild COVID-19 "be given symptomatic treatment such as antipyretics for fever and pain, adequate nutrition and appropriate rehydration", and states "at present, there is no evidence to indicate that there are severe adverse events in patients with COVID-19 as a result of NSAIDs". On its website, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides information specifically on COVID-19. In the section for healthcare professionals, the question "Do NSAIDs worsen the course of disease for people with COVID-19?" is addressed. In June 2021, the text stated "CDC is currently not aware of any evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs and worsening of COVID-19" and that they were continuing to monitor the situation. On March 19, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wrote they were "not aware of any scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs with worsening of COVID-19 symptoms". They also reminded readers of the following warning: "the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections".

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention and treatment of cancer [^49b399b7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective inhibitors, are amongst the most popular medications worldwide. Whilst their anti-inflammatory effect is well known, recent studies have demonstrated an unexpected effect in both the prevention and treatment of several types of cancer. The anticancerous effect of NSAIDs is believed to be mainly due to the inhibition of COX-2, which is overexpressed in many types of cancer and may play a major role in tumourigenesis. In this review, we will describe the possible mechanisms for NSAIDs anticancer effect and summarize the major clinical studies in cancer prevention and treatment. We will also discuss the effect of the recent reports of adverse cardiovascular effects on anticancer research of the selective COX-2 inhibitors.

### Elevation of cardiovascular risk by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^a1ce0a4d]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently used medications. NSAIDs profoundly modify prostaglandin homeostasis through inhibition of the enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX), especially COX-2. COX-2 inhibition is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes as demonstrated by recent trials using this type of drug. This review explores the latest available data, including recent, randomized, clinical trials, controversies, and pathophysiology of the adverse effects of COX-inhibition.

Absorption, distribution, and elimination

In addition to dose, the therapeutic activity and side effects of NSAIDs depend on their absorption, distribution, and elimination; these pharmacokinetic parameters can differ substantially between different NSAIDs. As with any analgesic class, the rate of absorption is a key factor in the selection of an NSAID; those with rapid absorption are preferable for most patients, particularly those with severe or acute pain. For example, celecoxib, which has a relatively slow rate of absorption, can be administered at standard doses to effectively treat osteoarthritis pain, but is not ideal for treatment of acute pain as it takes considerable time for absorption and often requires a loading dose to achieve clinically meaningful analgesia.

The distribution of NSAIDs in injured tissues, blood, and other areas of the body is a particularly crucial consideration for ensuring activity at the site of inflammation, as well as reducing the risk of side effects unrelated to therapeutic activity on COX enzymes throughout the body.NSAIDs can be classified as acidic or non-acidic based on their chemical structure, and the acidity of the drug can have an effect on its distribution. NSAIDs with acidic functional groups (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen) and with a high degree of protein binding have been shown to selectively accumulate and persist at sites of inflammation,–while non-acidic NSAIDs (eg, acetaminophen, celecoxib, rofecoxib) tend to be distributed homogenously throughout the body. Acidic NSAIDs with a high degree of protein binding may remain in inflamed tissues or synovial fluid for a longer time than in the plasma (Figure 4). For example, diclofenac 75 mg (enteric-coated) reaches peak concentrations in the synovial fluid that exceed plasma concentrations at 4 hours after oral administration in patients with arthritis; these high and persistent synovial levels are maintained above or near the expected IC 80 for COX-2 for up to 12 hours after dosing, with rapid disappearance of diclofenac from the plasma, even after repeated dosing. The persistence of certain NSAIDs (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen) in the synovial fluid is associated with a sustained therapeutic effect despite relatively rapid clearance from the plasma, vascular wall, and kidneys, indicating that accumulation at sites of inflammation may allow for continued anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The localization of COX activity to inflamed tissue and the resulting ability to use lower doses than might otherwise be required also minimizes COX inhibition at sites associated with potential side effects (eg, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal adverse effects).

### COXIBs and non-selective NSAIDs in the gastroenterological setting: what should patients and physicians do? [^ded3e2f5]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Although adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs occur in only a small proportion of users, the widespread use of these drugs has resulted in a substantial overall number of affected persons who experience serious gastrointestinal complications. Dyspeptic symptoms are estimated to occur in 10–60% of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users and lead to discontinuation of treatment in 5–15% of rheumatoid arthritis patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is now well established that the point prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in patients receiving conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy ranges between 10 and 30%, representing a 10- to 30-fold increase over that found in the general population. One out of 175 users of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the USA will be hospitalized each year for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal damage. The mortality of hospitalized patients remains about 5–10%, with an expected annual death rate of 0.08%. The selective COX-2 inhibitors consistently show comparable efficacy to that of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but have a reduced propensity to cause gastrointestinal toxicity. In many cases, the gastric effects of therapeutically active doses of COX-2 inhibitors are indistinguishable from placebo. The safety benefits of COX-2 inhibitors given alone appear similar to those of combined therapy with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and gastroprotective agents. These findings warrant the consideration of COX-2 inhibitors as first-line therapy in patients requiring long-term pain control.

### New dogmas or old? [^3e115d05]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) provides frameworks for the systematic review of study methodology and results. Thus, EBM frameworks facilitate assessing a study's ability to produce unbiased and accurate results and applying the results to the management of individual patients. Using EBM frameworks, published literature about risk factors for serious NSAID-associated gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, GI safety of COX-2 selective NSAIDs, and GI safety of co-therapy of proton pump inhibitors and NSAIDs are reviewed. This article concludes with evidence-based recommendations concerning which patients are at high risk for serious NSAID-associated GI disorders and which therapies are most effective in reducing serious NSAID-associated GI disorders.

### Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for cancer pain in adults [^a63a0e8a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common symptom with cancer, and 30% to 50% of all people with cancer will experience moderate to severe pain that can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Non-opioid drugs are commonly used to treat cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) cancer pain treatment ladder, either alone or in combination with opioids. A previous Cochrane review that examined the evidence for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or paracetamol, alone or combined with opioids, for cancer pain was withdrawn in 2015 because it was out of date; the date of the last search was 2005. This review, and another on paracetamol, updates the evidence.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of oral NSAIDs for cancer pain in adults, and the adverse events reported during their use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to April 2017, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and two online study registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, single-blind, or open-label studies of five days' duration or longer, comparing any oral NSAID alone with placebo or another NSAID, or a combination of NSAID plus opioid with the same dose of the opioid alone, for cancer pain of any pain intensity. The minimum study size was 25 participants per treatment arm at the initial randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently searched for studies, extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality and potential bias. We did not carry out any pooled analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

Eleven studies satisfied inclusion criteria, lasting one week or longer; 949 participants with mostly moderate or severe pain were randomised initially, but fewer completed treatment or had results of treatment. Eight studies were double-blind, two single-blind, and one open-label. None had a placebo only control; eight compared different NSAIDs, three an NSAID with opioid or opioid combination, and one both. None compared an NSAID plus opioid with the same dose of opioid alone. Most studies were at high risk of bias for blinding, incomplete outcome data, or small size; none was unequivocally at low risk of bias. It was not possible to compare NSAIDs as a group with another treatment, or one NSAID with another NSAID. Results for all NSAIDs are reported as a randomised cohort. We judged results for all outcomes as very low-quality evidence. None of the studies reported our primary outcomes of participants with pain reduction of at least 50%, and at least 30%, from baseline; participants with Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved (or equivalent wording). With NSAID, initially moderate or severe pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks in four studies (415 participants in total), with a range of estimates between 26% and 51% in individual studies. Adverse event and withdrawal reporting was inconsistent. Two serious adverse events were reported with NSAIDs, and 22 deaths, but these were not clearly related to any pain treatment. Common adverse events were thirst/dry mouth (15%), loss of appetite (14%), somnolence (11%), and dyspepsia (11%). Withdrawals were common, mostly because of lack of efficacy (24%) or adverse events (5%).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of NSAIDs alone or in combination with opioids for the three steps of the three-step WHO cancer pain ladder. There is very low-quality evidence that some people with moderate or severe cancer pain can obtain substantial levels of benefit within one or two weeks.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastrointestinal toxicity [^66f437ef]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Toxic effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract, primarily complicated gastric and intestinal ulcers, are the most common undesirable effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. During the last several years, there have been several advances, both in the laboratory and clinically, toward reducing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs' gastrointestinal toxicity. Some of these important developments are the delineation of mechanisms of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, identification of groups at highest risk for development of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal complications, recognition of co-therapies that could reduce nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity, and, most recently, development of classes of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with improved gastrointestinal safety profiles. Many of these advances have occurred during the last year. This review focuses on several of the important recent observations that have improved understanding and safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the gastrointestinal tract.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^c262007f]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review identified 43 studies, comparing 36 RCTs (7900 patients with OA at any joint) and 7 observational studies (218 074 participants). Topical NSAIDs reduced pain and improved function in patients with OA. Diclofenac patches were the most effective topical NSAID for pain relief. No serious AEs were observed in randomised trials or observational studies in the general population. However, confirmation of the CV safety of topical NSAIDs still warrants further observational study.

What is already known on this topic?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for the treatment of osteoarthritis by many guidelines.
There are a number of topical NSAIDs. However, their relative efficacy remains largely unknown because there are few head-to-head comparative trials.
The safety of topical NSAIDs remains unclear, especially its systemic side effects such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events.

What are the new findings?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective to reduce pain and improve function in osteoarthritis.
Among all available topical NSAIDs, diclofenac patches were most effective for pain relief and piroxicam was the best option to improve function.
Other than salicylate gel, topical NSAIDs are safe. They are not associated with increased local or systemic adverse effects such as gastrointestinal and renal events; this can be concluded from both randomised trials and observational studies.

Introduction

Chronic pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as "pain that persists beyond normal tissue healing time, which is assumed to be 3 months". Chronic pain is one of the most prominent causes of disability worldwide and represents a major challenge for public health. Patients with chronic pain report that this has a significant impact on their work and daily function. The presence of inflammation is a common underlying mechanism of chronic pain. Inflammation can occur in the affected organ and/or nerves. Low-grade inflammation, both local and systemic, is also the hallmark of many chronic, progressing, and painful conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Existing guidelines recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) as the first-line analgesic agent.–However, this is not an ideal choice for chronic inflammatory pain, because paracetamol lacks anti-inflammatory activity and has been shown to be less effective than alternative nonopioid options in chronic conditions involving connective tissue.–In addition, although traditionally seen as a better-tolerated analgesic option, there are safety concerns with the use of paracetamol, particularly at dosages > 3 g/day, for extended periods (eg, several years).–

### The role of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids in the gastrointestinal tract [^4d995f1c]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are generally prescribed to ameliorate symptoms associated with acute pain and chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. Recent epidemiologic studies and clinical trials indicate that use of NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors are associated with a reduced risk of certain malignancies, especially gastrointestinal cancer. The cyclooxygenase enzymes are the best known targets of NSAIDs; this diverse class of compounds blocks conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids. Prostaglandins and other eicosanoids derived from COX-1 and COX-2 are involved in a variety of physiologic and pathologic processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Recent efforts to identify the molecular mechanisms by which COX-2-derived prostanoids exert their proneoplastic effects have provided a rationale for the possible use of NSAIDs alone or in a combination with conventional or experimental anticancer agents for the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal cancers.

### Efficacy of cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors [^205aa999]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The clinical efficacy of NSAIDs is primarily related to the inhibition of COX-2 activity, whereas much of the toxicity, particularly gastrointestinal toxicity, is related to COX-1 inhibition. In vitro and in vivo assays indicate that both COX-2-specific inhibitors and conventional NSAIDs are equally effective in inhibiting COX-2, suggesting that the clinical efficacy of COX-2-specific inhibitors should be similar to that of conventional NSAIDs. Multiple studies in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute pain have now confirmed that the clinical efficacy of COX-2-specific inhibitors is similar to that of conventional NSAIDs.

### The effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on tissue healing [^5e586027]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Non-selective (NSAIDs) and selective (COX-2) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Their role after orthopaedic surgery has been infrequently described and remains controversial because of unclear effects on soft tissue and bone healing. This study critically reviews the available literature to describe the effects of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors on soft tissue and bone healing.

Methods

A Medline search was performed using NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors and tissue healing. The combined search yielded 637 articles. Following exclusion, 44 articles were deemed relevant with 9 articles on soft tissue healing and 35 articles on bone healing. The available evidence is based primarily on animal data (39 studies), with considerable variation in study methods.

Results

In regard to soft tissue healing, there is insufficient evidence of a detrimental effect when using either NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors at standard doses for ≤ 2 weeks. For soft tissue to bone healing, a limited number of studies demonstrate impairment in healing. However, with respect to bone healing, indomethacin appears to have a clear detrimental effect, with less substantial evidence for other NSAIDs.

Conclusions

Short-term, low-dose use of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors does not appear to have a detrimental effect following soft tissue injury, but is inhibitory in cases involving bony healing. However, additional well-controlled human studies are necessary to draw more definitive conclusions regarding their role. Clinically, the prudent use of anti-inflammatory medications following sports medicine injuries and surgeries appears to be a reasonable option in clinical practice unless bone healing is required.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^7d5a760e]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Inflammation is common in many chronic pain conditions where the burden of disease is high. NSAIDs are an effective therapy for such conditions, but appropriate risk evaluation is important when selecting an NSAID in order to balance efficacy and risk. This practice advisory serves to update previously published guidelines, and in particular offers PCPs a simplified approach to choosing an appropriate NSAID for pain management based on recent evidence and according to the risk profile of individual patients. In this regard, all NSAIDs have a safety profile that requires consideration of GI, CV and renal risk. Whereas GI and CV risk were previously acknowledged according to COX-1 and COX-2 selectivity, respectively, it is apparent that this is too simplistic and appropriate risk management requires consideration of the individual (ie, non-class) effects of each NSAID. Having chosen an appropriate NSAID, there is an ongoing need for patient monitoring and risk assessment.

What is the most important information I should know about
medicines called Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

NSAID medicines may increase the chance of a heart attack or
stroke that can lead to death. This chance increases:

with longer use of NSAID medicines
in people who have heart disease

NSAID medicines should never be used right before or after a
heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)."

NSAID medicines can cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach
and intestines at any time during treatment. Ulcers and bleeding:

can happen without warning symptoms
may cause death

The chance of a person getting an ulcer or bleeding
increases with:

taking medicines called "corticosteroids" and "anticoagulants"
longer use
smoking
drinking alcohol
older age
having poor health

NSAID medicines should only be used:

exactly as prescribed
at the lowest dose possible for your treatment
for the shortest time needed

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^9b4f858c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity — phenotypes and management: There are 4 primary categories of NSAID reactions (AERD, NSAID-induced urticaria and angioedema, NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease, and single NSAID-induced reactions), and a selective COX-2 inhibitor may be used as an alternative analgesic in any NSAID hypersensitivity phenotype when an NSAID is needed; in suspected AERD, clinical history is often sufficient and an oral aspirin challenge is not required, but an oral aspirin challenge is suggested when diagnosis is uncertain, and aspirin desensitization followed by therapy can be used to control nasal polyp regrowth and allow cardioprotection or NSAID use; in NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease, the approach is to control underlying urticaria and patients controlled on H1-antihistamines or omalizumab may be able to tolerate NSAIDs; in the NSAID-inducible cutaneous phenotype, patients may react to all COX-1 inhibitors and an aspirin challenge is suggested to identify such patients when tolerance to other NSAIDs is uncertain; single NSAID reactions are not related to COX-1 inhibition and are thought to be IgE-mediated (immediate) or related to drug-specific T‑cell delayed hypersensitivity (delayed); for patients with a history of aspirin allergy in acute coronary syndrome without features of AERD, we suggest a 2-step aspirin challenge.

### Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for fibromyalgia in adults [^38324237]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia, despite being considered not to be effective.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy, tolerability (drop-out due to adverse events), and safety (serious adverse events) of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for fibromyalgia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from inception to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing any oral NSAID with placebo or another active treatment for relief of pain in fibromyalgia, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)) or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC), serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events; secondary outcomes were adverse events, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and outcomes relating to sleep, fatigue, and quality of life. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

Our searches identified six randomised, double-blind studies involving 292 participants in suitably characterised fibromyalgia. The mean age of participants was between 39 and 50 years, and 89% to 100% were women. The initial pain intensity was around 7/10 on a 0 to 10 pain scale, indicating severe pain. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. The duration of treatment in the double-blind phase varied between three and eight weeks. Not all studies reported all the outcomes of interest. Analyses consistently showed no significant difference between NSAID and placebo: substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction) (risk difference (RD) -0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.04) 2 studies, 146 participants; moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction) (RD -0.04 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.08) 3 studies, 192 participants; withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.09) 4 studies, 230 participants; participants experiencing any adverse event (RD 0.08 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.19) 4 studies, 230 participants; all-cause withdrawals (RD 0.03 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.14) 3 studies, 192 participants. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. Although most studies had some measures of health-related quality of life, fibromyalgia impact, or other outcomes, none reported the outcomes beyond saying that there was no or little difference between the treatment groups. We downgraded evidence on all outcomes to very low quality, meaning that this research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect could be substantially different is very high. This is based on the small numbers of studies, participants, and events, as well as other deficiencies of reporting study quality allowing possible risks of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There is only a modest amount of very low-quality evidence about the use of NSAIDs in fibromyalgia, and that comes from small, largely inadequate studies with potential risk of bias. That bias would normally be to increase the apparent benefits of NSAIDs, but no such benefits were seen. Consequently, NSAIDs cannot be regarded as useful for treating fibromyalgia.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^e44504b2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are strongly recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and they remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management of OA. A large number of trials have established their short-term efficacy, and oral NSAIDs are the initial oral medication of choice in the treatment of OA, regardless of anatomic location, and are recommended over all other available oral medications. While the guideline did not address the relative merits of different NSAIDs, there is evidence suggesting that certain agents may have more favorable side effect profiles than others, and safe use includes appropriate patient selection with regular monitoring for potential adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects and potential drug interactions; doses should be as low as possible, and NSAID treatment should be continued for as short a time as possible.

Medication Guide for Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

(See the end of this Medication Guide for a list of prescription NSAID medicines.)

What is the most important information I should know about medicines called Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including:

· Increased risk of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This risk may happen early in treatment and may increase:

· with increasing doses of NSAIDs

· with longer use of NSAIDs

Do not take NSAIDs right before or after a heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)".

Avoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack.

· Increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), stomach and intestines:

· anytime during use

· without warning symptoms

· that may cause death

The risk of getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with:

· past history of stomach ulcers, or stomach or intestinal bleeding with use of NSAIDs

· taking medicines called "corticosteroids", "anticoagulants", "SSRIs", or "SNRIs"

### Epidemiologic assessment of the safety of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^33f0dfd7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The use of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation (UGIB), acute liver injury, acute renal injury, heart failure, and adverse reproductive outcomes. This article summarizes the effects of various factors, such as NSAID dose, duration of treatment, patient age, and ulcer history, on the incidences of these adverse side effects. We used the UK General Practice Research Database to study further the principal safety concern related to NSAIDs, namely, UGIB.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^00aa58d8]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

The accumulation of NSAIDs at sites of inflammation and accompanying therapeutic effects are also affected by their pharmacokinetic properties (including extended-release or immediate-release formulations). Acidic NSAIDs with short plasma half-lives (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen) may be associated with tolerability benefits compared with drugs with a long plasma half-life due to rapid clearance from the plasma and non-targeted tissues, allowing for recovery of COX activity in other tissues (eg, production of vasoprotective prostanoids by endothelial COX-2) even while the drug continues to actively inhibit COX-2 at sites of inflammation. The use of excessively high doses or slow-release formulations of these analgesics could negate these benefits., Further studies using in vivo markers of COX-2 inhibition (such as urinary metabolites of PGE 2 and PGI 2) should ideally be conducted to verify this hypothesis. Persistence in the plasma is also a key factor with respect to the gastrointestinal safety and tolerability of NSAIDs.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^d6bdb4cb]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several potential limitations to this literature review. This was a narrative literature review, and systematic principles were therefore not followed. As part of the review, the risk of bias in the included studies was not assessed. In addition, the published studies vary considerably in several ways, including geographical setting, medical setting (hospitalized patients, outpatients, primary care), number of patients included, medications and doses (e.g. prescription and OTC doses), outcomes assessed, and statistical methods applied. However, these differences add strength by ensuring the data provide insight from multiple different perspectives. In particular, studies have been identified from multiple regions of the world, providing a global aspect of the challenge and, importantly, showing the same responses are reported regardless of ethnicity.

In summary, from observational studies conducted to date, there is no evidence of an association between the use of NSAIDs and increased susceptibility to COVID-19 or increased disease severity, and no plausible causative mechanism by which NSAIDs would increase susceptibility to or the severity of COVID-19 illness. This is reflected in the current recommendations from major public health authorities across the world, which support NSAID use for analgesic or antipyretic treatment during COVID-19. Although further data (e.g. from randomized controlled trials) are required to fully elucidate the relationship between NSAID therapy and COVID-19 severity, there is no basis on which to restrict or prohibit use of these drugs by consumers or patients to manage their health conditions and symptoms during the pandemic. As NSAID users often have clinical characteristics associated with worsened outcomes in COVID-19, restricting access or prohibiting use of these drugs during the pandemic may have a negative impact on patients who consequently are likely to use opioids or subtherapeutic treatment options.

### Mitigating the cardiovascular and renal effects of NSAIDs [^9688eb35]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are principal pharmacologic agents for symptom relief in patients with arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Cardiovascular risk is associated with all NSAIDs, excluding aspirin. Selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX)-2 could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) intact. It has been speculated that this imbalance of homeostatic prostanoids might increase the risk for thrombotic events. The goal of this review is to provide physicians guidelines to mitigate cardiovascular and nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review to determine what information is available to guide treatment decisions in this patient population.

Results

Selective inhibition of COX-2 could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of TXA2 intact. Increasing degrees of selectivity for COX-2 are associated with augmented cardiovascular risk, whereas increasing degrees of selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-1) are associated with augmented gastrointestinal risk. Some NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) can interfere with the cardioprotective effects of aspirin by competitively binding to COX-1 enzyme, resulting in increased TXA2 production Naproxen may differ from other NSAIDs in sustaining functionally important degrees of inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 activity throughout the dosing interval.

Conclusion

It is of paramount importance to consider individual health factors when choosing therapy with NSAIDs.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^78458e56]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January 2020. Soon afterwards (on March 11, 2020), the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a pandemic. It has been estimated that around 35% of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, clinical manifestations include fever, cough, body aches and pains, headache, sore throat, gastrointestinal symptoms, acute respiratory disease, pneumonia, and loss of smell or taste –. Symptoms range in severity from mild to extremely severe, and patients with severe symptoms may require hospitalization and ventilation. In July 2021, the total number of global deaths related to COVID-19 had almost reached 4 million. Global data on hospitalization rates are lacking but, in the USA between February 2020 and March 2021, there were an estimated 97.1 million symptomatic illnesses and 5.6 million hospitalizations related to COVID-19. In the early stages of the pandemic, best practice for managing hospitalized patients was undefined. Since then, treatment guidelines have been developed that include recommendations on the use of medications known to be beneficial –.

### The development of COX2 inhibitors [^44bcd6fe]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

Aspirin, arguably the world's favourite drug, has been around since the late nineteenth century, but it wasn't until the late 1970s that its ability to inhibit prostaglandin production by the cyclooxygenase enzyme was identified as the basis of its therapeutic action. Early hints of a second form of the cyclooxygenase that was differentially sensitive to other aspirin-like drugs ultimately ushered in an exciting era of drug discovery, culminating in the introduction of an entirely new generation of anti-inflammatories. This article reviews the story of this discovery and looks at the future of cyclooxygenase pharmacology.

### Update on cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^723d82a7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs represent the most commonly used medications for the treatment of pain and inflammation, but numerous well-described side effects can limit their use. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were initially touted as a therapeutic strategy to avoid not only the gastrointestinal but also the renal and cardiovascular side effects of nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, in the kidney, COX-2 is constitutively expressed and is highly regulated in response to alterations in intravascular volume. COX-2 metabolites have been implicated in mediation of renin release, regulation of sodium excretion, and maintenance of renal blood flow. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about both renal and cardiovascular side effects that are attributed to COX-2 selective inhibitors.

Biomarkers to predict drug responses

The use of biochemical markers of COX inhibition may assist clinicians in the rational selection of an appropriate NSAID dose to achieve efficacy; this dose should be the lowest effective dose to limit the risk of adverse events. However, differences in the efficacy and tolerability of NSAIDs have been observed between individuals, resulting from genetic factors that affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of NSAIDs (Figure 6). For example, cytochrome (CYP) enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of approximately 70%–80% of all drugs, including several NSAIDs, and interindividual differences in CYP450 expression can therefore result in altered metabolism of some NSAIDs. A number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genetic sequence of CYP2C9 have been described, and the product of one of these altered genes, CYP2C9*2, is associated with reduced metabolism of celecoxib and an accompanying increase in CYP2C9*2 plasma concentration within 4 hours of administration in healthy individuals.

In addition to interindividual variability in COX inhibition, the individual's clinical background, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should also be considered as important predictors of the risk of adverse reactions due to NSAIDs. Together, these factors should be used to select an NSAID and dose that will be both effective and well tolerated, and to help guide individualized treatment strategies.

Studies are ongoing to verify the feasibility of using of biochemical markers of COX isozyme inhibition ex vivo and in vivo together with genetic biomarkers to identify individuals at accelerated risk of developing cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events by NSAID administration.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain in women with endometriosis [^527d89f6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that affects women and can lead to painful symptoms and infertility. It greatly affects women's quality of life, impacting their careers, everyday activities, sexual and nonsexual relationships and fertility. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most commonly used as first-line treatment for women with pain associated with endometriosis.

Objectives

To assess effects of NSAIDs used for management of pain in women with endometriosis compared with placebo, other NSAIDs, other pain management drugs or no treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials (October 2016), published in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, as well as MEDLINE (January 2008 to October 2016), Embase (date limited from 1 January 2016 to 19 October 2016, as all earlier references are included in CENTRAL output as a result of the Embase project), registers of ongoing trials and the reference lists of relevant publications. We identified no new randomised controlled trials. Unless we identify new evidence in the future, we will not update this review.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) describing use of NSAIDs for management of pain associated with endometriosis in women of all ages.

Data Collection and Analysis

In the 2009 update of this review, two review authors (CA and SH) independently read and extracted data from each of the included studies. We analysed cross-over trials using the inverse variance method of RevMan to calculate odds ratios for binary outcomes.

Main Results

We identified no new trials for the 2016 update. This review includes two trials, but we included only one trial, with 24 women, in the analysis. The overall risk of bias was unclear owing to lack of methodological detail. Using the GRADE method, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias and for imprecision (wide confidence intervals and evidence based on a single small trial). Comparison of NSAIDs (naproxen) versus placebo revealed no evidence of a positive effect on pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 3.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 17.69; one trial, 24 women; very low-quality evidence) in women with endometriosis. Evidence indicating whether women taking NSAIDs (naproxen) were less likely to require additional analgesia (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.29; one trial, 24 women; very low-quality evidence) or to experience side effects (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.47; one trial, 24 women; very low-quality evidence) when compared with placebo was inconclusive. Studies provided no data on quality of life, effects on daily activities, absence from work or school, need for more invasive treatment or participant satisfaction with treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Owing to lack of high-quality evidence and lack of reporting of outcomes of interest for this review, we can make no judgement as to whether NSAIDs (naproxen) are effective in managing pain caused by endometriosis. No evidence shows whether any individual NSAID is more effective than another. As shown in other Cochrane reviews, women taking NSAIDs must be aware that these drugs may cause unintended effects.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^207e06bc]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although novel compounds are being developed (eg, COX-inhibiting nitrous oxide donors) to improve safety and tolerability, it is unlikely that an ideal oral NSAID that avoids all potential side effects will be available in the near future. Thus, strategies are needed to reduce the risks associated with currently available NSAIDs. Drug choice should be driven by the clinical and demographic features (eg, age) of the patient, and the lowest effective dose of drug should be used for the shortest period of timeto reduce the risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects related, at least in part, to drug exposure.

The development of whole-blood assays of COX isozyme inhibition in vitro has proved useful for differentiating NSAIDs based on their pharmacodynamic features, such as COX-2 versus COX-1 selectivity (ie, experimental COX isoenzyme selectivity),–while ex vivo assessment after NSAID dosing allows evaluation of COX isozyme selectivity achieved at circulating drug levels. Additionally, the use of biochemical markers of COX isozyme inhibition in vivo, such as the assessment of major enzymatic urinary metabolites of the parent prostanoid, permits assessment of the actual inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis following NSAID dosing. The use of these biomarkers of COX inhibition have provided a mechanistic interpretation of the efficacy, adverse events, and interindividual variability associated with NSAID treatment.–

This review provides an overview of these and other key aspects that differentiate orally administered NSAIDs, with a focus on the role of these factors in establishing the safety and tolerability of individual NSAIDs for analgesia. Characterization of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between these compounds and their relationship with the administered oral dose may allow for better tailoring of NSAID therapy to individual patient needs.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^277d9cef]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The potential for NSAIDs to adversely affect the occurrence or severity of COVID-19 via upregulated expression of ACE-2 has been disputed, with several studies reporting that previous and concurrent use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which are widely known to cause upregulated expression of ACE-2, has no impact on COVID-19 frequency or severity –. Recent experimental data suggest that NSAIDs do not affect ACE-2 expression or viral entry into host cells in humans and mice. Instead, the key effects of NSAIDs appear attributable to the modulation of the inflammatory and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, as shown in mice studies where NSAIDs limit the production of proinflammatory cytokines and may reduce levels of neutralizing antibodies. Investigation of this effect in humans, and whether the timing of NSAID use affects COVID-19 pathogenesis, is an important area for further research.

To clarify the relationship between NSAID use and outcomes relating to COVID-19, we performed a comprehensive review of the published literature evaluating associations between NSAID use and COVID-19 outcomes related to disease susceptibility or severity.

### Do selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of atherothrombosis? Meta-analysis of randomised trials [^7affb3d2]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX 2) inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the risk of vascular events.

Design

Meta-analysis of published and unpublished tabular data from randomised trials, with indirect estimation of the effects of traditional NSAIDs.

Data Sources

Medline and Embase (January 1966 to April 2005); Food and Drug Administration records; and data on file from Novartis, Pfizer, and Merck.

Review Methods

Eligible studies were randomised trials that included a comparison of a selective COX 2 inhibitor versus placebo or a selective COX 2 inhibitor versus a traditional NSAID, of at least four weeks' duration, with information on serious vascular events (defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death). Individual investigators and manufacturers provided information on the number of patients randomised, numbers of vascular events, and the person time of follow-up for each randomised group.

Results

In placebo comparisons, allocation to a selective COX 2 inhibitor was associated with a 42% relative increase in the incidence of serious vascular events (1.2%/year v 0.9%/year; rate ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.78; P = 0.003), with no significant heterogeneity among the different selective COX 2 inhibitors. This was chiefly attributable to an increased risk of myocardial infarction (0.6%/year v 0.3%/year; 1.86, 1.33 to 2.59; P = 0.0003), with little apparent difference in other vascular outcomes. Among trials of at least one year's duration (mean 2.7 years), the rate ratio for vascular events was 1.45 (1.12 to 1.89; P = 0.005). Overall, the incidence of serious vascular events was similar between a selective COX 2 inhibitor and any traditional NSAID (1.0%/year v 0.9%/year; 1.16, 0.97 to 1.38; P = 0.1). However, statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.001) was found between trials of a selective COX 2 inhibitor versus naproxen (1.57, 1.21 to 2.03) and of a selective COX 2 inhibitor versus non-naproxen NSAIDs (0.88, 0.69 to 1.12). The summary rate ratio for vascular events, compared with placebo, was 0.92 (0.67 to 1.26) for naproxen, 1.51 (0.96 to 2.37) for ibuprofen, and 1.63 (1.12 to 2.37) for diclofenac.

Conclusions

Selective COX 2 inhibitors are associated with a moderate increase in the risk of vascular events, as are high dose regimens of ibuprofen and diclofenac, but high dose naproxen is not associated with such an excess.

### Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for neuropathic pain [^94fd9eb1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although often considered to be lacking adequate evidence, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the management of neuropathic pain. Previous surveys found 18% to 47% of affected people reported using NSAIDs specifically for their neuropathic pain, although possibly not in the United Kingdom (UK).

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of oral NSAIDs for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, when compared to placebo or another active intervention, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 29 May 2015, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and an online trials registry.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of two weeks duration or longer, comparing any oral NSAID with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently searched for studies, extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We did not carry out any pooled analysis.

Main Results

We included two studies involving 251 participants with chronic low back pain with a neuropathic component or postherpetic neuralgia; 209 of these participants were involved in a study of an experimental NSAID not used in clinical practice, and of the remaining 42, only 16 had neuropathic pain. This represented only third tier evidence, and was of very low quality. There was no indication of any significant pain reduction with NSAIDs. Adverse event rates were low, with insufficient events for any analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support or refute the use of oral NSAIDs to treat neuropathic pain conditions.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^54e172c3]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including COX-2 selective drugs, are often used for acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, including osteoarthritis, trauma, overuse syndromes, and compression fractures. Although these medications are often well tolerated in the young and otherwise healthy patient, the chronic use of these medications can lead to multiple medical problems, most commonly related to the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, concerns about cardiovascular adverse effects have been raised, particularly in the COX-2 drugs. Dosing and duration of therapy should be adjusted for comorbidities. CBC and renal and hepatic function should be checked at intervals of 3 to 6 months, depending on the patient.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute renal colic [^74c439da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urolithiasis (urinary stones) is a common disease with an increasing incidence globally. It often presents with renal colic, which is characterised by acute and intense abdominal pain. The first step in the management of renal colic is pain control. Various medications, including narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antispasmodics, and others, have been used for this condition. NSAIDs are amongst the most commonly used drugs for renal colic. They act by reducing inflammation and lowering the pressure inside the urinary collecting system. This review updates a previous Cochrane Systematic Review (Afshar 2015), focusing exclusively on NSAIDs.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the management of pain in adults with acute renal colic.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, trial registries, and conference proceedings up to 25 August 2023. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised (or quasi-randomised) controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of NSAIDs in the management of renal colic adult patients (i.e. study participants over 16 years of age). We included studies that compared NSAIDs versus placebo, one NSAID versus another, or different doses or routes of administration of the same NSAID.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes included pain up to one hour after treatment as measured by a validated patient-reported tool, the need for rescue medication up to six hours after treatment, and serious adverse events up to one week after treatment. Secondary outcomes included pain recurrence, significant pain relief, and minor adverse events. We performed meta-analysis using the random-effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Our search identified 29 RCTs for inclusion in the review. The 29 studies involved a total of 3593 participants who were randomly allocated to treatment with an NSAID or placebo. The mean age of participants ranged from 27 to 47 years across the studies. Participants used a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) to indicate the extent of their pain. NSAIDs versus placebo NSAIDs may reduce renal colic pain in 30 minutes compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) -3.84 cm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.41 to -1.27; I² = 95%; 3 studies, 250 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of NSAIDs on the need for rescue medication (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.53; I² = 73%; 4 studies, 280 participants; very low-certainty evidence). NSAID versus NSAID Piroxicam may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD 0.01 cm, 95% CI -1.50 to 1.52; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 144 participants; low-certainty evidence). Parecoxib likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to ketoprofen (MD 0.03 cm, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.65; 1 study, 337 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Lornoxicam likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to other NSAIDs (MD -0.22 cm, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.24; I² = 12%; 2 studies, 170 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ketorolac may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 60 minutes (MD 0.23 cm, 95% CI -1.16 to 1.62, 1 study, 57 participants; low-certainty evidence) and need for rescue medication within 120 minutes (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.73 to 4.24; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to diclofenac. Intravenous (IV) ketorolac may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to IV ibuprofen (MD 1.36 cm, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.87; I² = 84%; 2 studies, 361 participants; low-certainty evidence). IV ketorolac may result in less chance of significant pain relief within 30 minutes compared to IV ibuprofen (RR 0.17, 95 CI 0.04 to 0.73; 1 study, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ketoprofen likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD -0.43 cm, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.32; 1 study, 80 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ketoprofen on significant pain relief within 40 minutes compared to diclofenac (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.78; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Indomethacin likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD 0.20 cm, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.30; 1 study, 83 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Pirprofen may result in a large reduction in the need for rescue medication within 30 minutes compared to indomethacin (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.82; 1 study, 205 participants; low-certainty evidence). Intravenous NSAIDs likely result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to intramuscular NSAIDs (MD -0.34 cm, 95% CI -1.19 to 0.51; I² = 42%; 2 studies, 134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Intravenous NSAIDs may reduce the need for rescue medication within 30 minutes compared to rectal NSAIDs (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.88; 1 study, 116 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain regarding the potential harms of NSAIDs. Risk of bias We judged the risk of bias in the studies to be moderate to high. This was due to a high proportion of unknown risk judgments for concealment bias and a high risk of selective reporting bias.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs may reduce pain in adult patients with renal colic compared to placebo. Comparing one NSAID against another, IV ketorolac may be less effective than IV ibuprofen, and pirprofen may result in less need for rescue medication than indomethacin. The intravenous route of administration is probably similar to the intramuscular route but may be better than the rectal route. The evidence is uncertain regarding the potential harms of NSAIDs. We were not able to perform subgroup analysis based on our predefined criteria because there were no eligible studies.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^d35b3ca2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common reason for patients to visit their family physician and the numbers seeking treatment for pain is anticipated to rise as the population ages and chronic conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA), increase. In the United Kingdom (UK), annually, more than 17 million prescriptions are written for anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. In addition, over-the-counter analgesic (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol) use is substantial, with 44% of patients consuming more than the recommended dosage on the label. Musculoskeletal pain is common and disabling, especially in the elderly population, whose number and proportion is estimated to double by 2030, compared to the 2000 figure. Prescribing pain medications within this particular population requires the skill of a knowledgeable physician to navigate through the numerous variables (e.g. physiologic changes, co-morbidities, and co-therapies) that make the elderly a heterogeneous and complex population to treat.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^0fde6243]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A number of review articles and editorials have been published on the possible effects of NSAIDs on the risk or severity of COVID-19. A predominant theme of these publications is the lack of evidence to suggest a mechanism by which NSAIDs (particularly ibuprofen) can worsen outcomes of COVID-19 infection. In fact, the hypothesis involving upregulation of ACE-2 appears to be contradicted by new evidence that NSAIDs do not affect expression of this enzyme. The importance of basing therapeutic recommendations on robust evidence rather than speculative hypotheses has been emphasized. The most recent editorial we identified, published in May 2021, concluded "NSAID use with COVID-19 appears to confer no increased risk of poorer outcomes".

To further increase complexity, recent data show genetic variations of cytochrome P450 liver oxidative enzyme systems can influence the metabolism of NSAIDs, potentially affecting their elimination from the body, their tissue concentrations, and the greater risks of adverse events. Genetic variations differ between ethnic groups, meaning, for example, that the risk of higher-than-expected plasma drug levels may be greater in some populations than others. Future implementation of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice could, therefore, help optimize the use of NSAIDs in all patients including those with COVID-19.
