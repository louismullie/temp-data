## Question

Propafenone for new-onset supraventricular arrhythmia in septic shock

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether propafenone is appropriate for new-onset supraventricular arrhythmia in septic shock, and if so, how to weigh benefits, risks, dosing, and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the specific arrhythmia phenotype in septic shock. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence comparing propafenone to amiodarone. Next, I will review guideline positions and FDA labeling for propafenone, especially contraindications and proarrhythmic risk. After that, I need to check safety signals and hemodynamic considerations in shock. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline monitoring and alternatives, including beta-blockers and electrical cardioversion when indicated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. New-onset atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias are common in septic shock, with incidences up to roughly 46% in some cohorts, and they are associated with worse outcomes, though causality is debated and likely reflects both disease severity and hemodynamic consequences of the arrhythmia itself [^111U4D3w] [^1111NViP] [^111MUuQ7]. Wait, let me verify the prognostic signal: multiple studies link new-onset AF to longer ICU stay and higher mortality, but confounding is substantial, so I should be cautious about inferring causality when judging treatment effects [^111U4D3w] [^111MUuQ7].

> Next, I should review the pivotal randomized evidence. The PRASE trial enrolled 209 septic shock patients with new-onset supraventricular arrhythmia and LVEF greater than 35%, comparing intravenous propafenone (70 mg bolus then 400–840 mg/24 h) versus amiodarone (300 mg bolus then 600–1800 mg/24 h) [^112ZaFHj]. Hold on, I should verify the key outcomes: there was no significant difference in sinus rhythm at 24 hours (72.8% propafenone vs 67.3% amiodarone), but propafenone achieved faster conversion (median 3.7 vs 7.3 hours) and substantially less recurrence (52% vs 76%), with no difference in ICU mortality or vasopressor needs, which is clinically meaningful for rhythm stability even if the 24-hour success rate is similar [^112ZaFHj] [^115N5APQ]. I should double-check the subgroup signal: patients with dilated left atrium had slower conversion with propafenone, suggesting that amiodarone may perform better in that phenotype, which tempers a blanket endorsement of propafenone for all-comers [^112ZaFHj].

> Now, I need to align this with guidelines and labeling. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP AF guideline advises against flecainide or propafenone in patients with prior MI, significant structural heart disease, or HFrEF due to harm, including increased mortality in vulnerable substrates, which is a critical constraint in many ICU patients with sepsis-related myocardial injury or dysfunction [^111eDEA8] [^114Dn56e]. The ESC SVT guideline similarly recommends avoiding propafenone in patients with ventricular dysfunction or severe fibrosis, reinforcing caution in septic shock where myocardial depression is common [^112KvGSr]. FDA labeling lists heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and significant conduction disease as contraindications, and warns about proarrhythmic effects including ventricular arrhythmias and torsade, which are particularly concerning in unstable patients [^116pK94D] [^112gvHBa]. But wait, what if the patient has preserved LV function and no structural disease? In that narrower subgroup, guidelines allow propafenone for rhythm control in SVT/AF, which is consistent with the PRASE inclusion criteria and supports a selective approach rather than routine use [^116nvQHh] [^115qsRZ7].

> I will now examine safety and hemodynamic considerations. Propafenone has negative inotropic and beta-blocking effects and can worsen hypotension, slow AV conduction, and precipitate bradycardia, all of which can destabilize septic shock physiology; these effects are dose-related and more likely with higher exposure or preexisting conduction disease [^115Y3P8p] [^116pK94D]. Hold on, I should verify proarrhythmic risk: across trials and labeling, new or worsened ventricular arrhythmias occur in a minority but can be life-threatening, and early events cluster in the first 1–2 weeks, so continuous ECG monitoring is prudent when initiating therapy in the ICU [^112gvHBa] [^1117gSge]. I need to ensure I account for drug interactions and organ dysfunction: propafenone is hepatically metabolized and protein-bound, and accumulation in liver dysfunction or polypharmacy increases toxicity risk, which is common in septic shock [^112m3x8c].

> Let me consider dosing and administration if, after careful selection, propafenone is used. The PRASE regimen used a 70 mg IV bolus followed by 400–840 mg/24 h continuous infusion, which provides a template for ICU use with close monitoring; oral regimens of 150–300 mg TID are standard outside the ICU but are not appropriate for acute management in shock [^112ZaFHj] [^113fcCdJ]. I should confirm that patients receive concomitant AV nodal blockade when treating atrial flutter to mitigate 1:1 conduction risk, and that electrolytes and QRS/QT are monitored during infusion, given propafenone's conduction effects and proarrhythmic potential [^114V5RS4] [^112gvHBa].

> Next, I should review alternatives and when to prioritize them. Amiodarone remains a reasonable first-line agent in many ICU patients because it is less negatively inotropic and is guideline-supported in structural heart disease and acute heart failure contexts, though it is slower to convert and has more recurrence in PRASE, so trade-offs must be individualized [^111W1t6o] [^112ZaFHj]. Beta-blockers, particularly ultra-short-acting agents like esmolol or landiolol, are effective for rate control and may reduce arrhythmia burden in sepsis, with randomized data showing improved heart rate targets without clear mortality benefit; they are especially attractive when tachycardia is sympathetic-driven and ventricular function is preserved, but hypotension remains a key limitation in shock [^111c663b] [^112xJ8wT]. For hemodynamically unstable patients, synchronized electrical cardioversion is the most reliable way to restore rhythm and should not be delayed when instability is present, with antiarrhythmic pretreatment considered to reduce immediate recurrence in selected cases [^111wzG5W].

> I should double-check the bottom line and make sure I am not overstating. Propafenone is not categorically contraindicated in septic shock; it can be considered in carefully selected patients with preserved LV function, no significant structural heart disease or ischemia, and no conduction system disease, where faster cardioversion and lower recurrence may offset its negative inotropic and proarrhythmic risks, provided there is close hemodynamic and ECG monitoring and a low threshold to stop therapy if instability emerges [^112ZaFHj] [^116nvQHh]. Conversely, it should be avoided in patients with LVEF less than about 35%, prior MI, significant conduction disease, marked hypotension, or high vasopressor requirements, where amiodarone or electrical cardioversion are safer strategies, and beta-blockers may be preferred for rate control when tolerated [^111eDEA8] [^111W1t6o] [^111c663b].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical safeguards are explicit. Before choosing propafenone, obtain echocardiography to confirm LV function and exclude structural disease, check ECG for conduction abnormalities, correct electrolytes, and review drug interactions; initiate in a monitored setting with continuous ECG and frequent blood pressure checks, titrate vasopressors proactively if hypotension emerges, and reassess rhythm and hemodynamics within hours to decide on continuation or switch to alternatives [^112gvHBa]. If the patient deteriorates hemodynamically or develops QRS widening, bradycardia, or ectopy, stop the infusion and pivot to amiodarone or cardioversion as indicated, documenting the rationale for the chosen strategy in the context of sepsis physiology and evolving myocardial dysfunction [^1143hJsj].

---

Propafenone is **not recommended** for new-onset supraventricular arrhythmias in septic shock because of its negative inotropic effects and risk of hemodynamic collapse [^116pK94D]. The PRASE RCT showed no superiority of propafenone over amiodarone for 24-hour sinus rhythm restoration and found faster cardioversion but more hypotension with propafenone, limiting its use in unstable patients [^112ZaFHj]. Current guidelines and expert consensus **favor amiodarone or electrical cardioversion** for rhythm control in septic shock, reserving propafenone only for carefully selected, hemodynamically stable patients without structural heart disease or ischemia, and with close monitoring [^111W1t6o] [^115qsRZ7].

---

## Pharmacological considerations of propafenone in septic shock

Propafenone is a class IC antiarrhythmic with **negative inotropic and beta-blocking effects** that can reduce cardiac output and worsen hypotension — features that are particularly hazardous in septic shock [^115Y3P8p]. Its use is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock, marked hypotension, and significant structural heart disease, all of which are common in septic shock [^116pK94D].

---

## Clinical evidence: PRASE randomized controlled trial

The PRASE trial compared propafenone with amiodarone in septic shock patients with new-onset supraventricular arrhythmias and LVEF > 35% [^112ZaFHj]. Key findings include:

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in 24-hour sinus rhythm restoration (72.8% propafenone vs 67.3% amiodarone; p = 0.4).
- **Secondary outcomes**: Faster median time to cardioversion with propafenone (3.7 vs 7.3 hours; p = 0.02) but lower recurrence with propafenone (52% vs 76%; p < 0.001).
- **Safety**: More hypotension with propafenone, necessitating cautious use in hemodynamically unstable patients [^notfound].

## Comparison with alternative antiarrhythmic agents

| **Attribute** | **Propafenone** | **Amiodarone** | **Beta-blockers (e.g. landiolol)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | - Moderate <br/> - Faster cardioversion but no superiority at 24 hours [^112ZaFHj] | - Moderate <br/> - Slower cardioversion but sustained rhythm control [^112ZaFHj] | Effective for rate control; limited rhythm-control data [^111c663b] |
| Safety | - Negative inotropy <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Contraindicated in shock [^116pK94D] | - Fewer hemodynamic effects <br/> - Preferred in shock [^111W1t6o] | - Short-acting <br/> - Titratable <br/> - Minimal negative inotropy [^112GFzUj] |
| Guideline recommendation | Not recommended in shock | First-line in shock | Consider for rate control in stable patients [^notfound] |

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend propafenone as first-line therapy** for new-onset supraventricular arrhythmias in septic shock. Amiodarone or electrical cardioversion are preferred due to their favorable hemodynamic profiles and established safety in critically ill patients [^111W1t6o] [^1143hJsj]. Propafenone may be considered only in carefully selected, hemodynamically stable patients without structural heart disease or ischemia, and with close monitoring [^116nvQHh].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Propafenone's safety profile in septic shock is concerning due to frequent hypotension and negative inotropic effects, which can exacerbate shock and organ dysfunction [^115Y3P8p]. Although the PRASE trial reported faster cardioversion, the lack of superiority in 24-hour rhythm restoration and higher hypotension rates limit its routine use in septic shock [^112ZaFHj].

---

## Practical recommendations and clinical approach

Given the limited evidence and potential risks, the following **practical approach is recommended**:

- **First-line therapy**: Amiodarone or electrical cardioversion for hemodynamically unstable patients [^111W1t6o] [^1143hJsj].
- **Second-line therapy**: Beta-blockers (e.g. landiolol) for rate control in stable patients without contraindications [^111c663b].
- **Propafenone**: Consider only in hemodynamically stable patients without structural heart disease or ischemia, with close monitoring [^116nvQHh].

---

Propafenone is **not recommended for routine use** in septic shock because of negative inotropy and hypotension risk; reserve it for carefully selected, stable patients without structural heart disease or ischemia, with close monitoring. Amiodarone or electrical cardioversion remain the preferred options for rhythm control in septic shock.

### Propafenone versus amiodarone for supraventricular arrhythmias in septic shock: a randomised controlled trial [^112ZaFHj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute onset supraventricular arrhythmias can contribute to haemodynamic compromise in septic shock. Both amiodarone and propafenone are available interventions, but their clinical effects have not yet been directly compared.

Methods

In this two-centre, prospective controlled parallel group double blind trial we recruited 209 septic shock patients with new-onset arrhythmia and a left ventricular ejection fraction above 35%. The patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either intravenous propafenone (70 mg bolus followed by 400–840 mg/24 h) or amiodarone (300 mg bolus followed by 600–1800 mg/24 h). The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients who had sinus rhythm 24 h after the start of the infusion, time to restoration of the first sinus rhythm and the proportion of patients with arrhythmia recurrence.

Results

Out of 209 randomized patients, 200 (96%) received the study drug. After 24 h, 77 (72.8%) and 71 (67.3%) were in sinus rhythm (p = 0.4), restored after a median of 3.7 h (95% CI 2.3–6.8) and 7.3 h (95% CI 5–11), p = 0.02, with propafenone and amiodarone, respectively. The arrhythmia recurred in 54 (52%) patients treated with propafenone and in 80 (76%) with amiodarone, p < 0.001. Patients with a dilated left atrium had better rhythm control with amiodarone (6.4 h (95% CI 3.5; 14.1) until cardioversion vs 18 h (95% CI 2.8; 24.7) in propafenone, p = 0.05).

Conclusion

Propafenone does not provide better rhythm control at 24 h yet offers faster cardioversion with fewer arrhythmia recurrences than with amiodarone, especially in patients with a non-dilated left atrium. No differences between propafenone and amiodarone on the prespecified short- and long-term outcomes were observed.

The study PRASE was published by Martin Balik and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the PRASE study, the trial question was: what is the role of propafenone in patients with septic shock who had new-onset arrhythmia? In the PRASE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PRASE study, the population was: 209 patients (80 female, 129 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with septic shock who had new-onset arrhythmia and a LVEF > 35%. The key exclusion criteria were severe LV systolic dysfunction; history indicating an AV block > 1st degree; high dose vasopressor therapy represented by noradrenaline > 1.0 mcg/kg/min; dependence on a pacemaker or status after Maze procedure. In the PRASE study, the interventions were: n = 104 propafenone (70 mg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 400–840 mg/24 hour) n = 105 amiodarone (300 mg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 600–1,800 mg/24 hours). In the PRASE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in proportion of patients with sinus rhythm 24 hours after the start of infusion (72.8% vs. 67.3%; RR 1.08, 95% CI -1.4 to 3.56). In the PRASE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in median time to cardioversion (3.7 hours vs. 7.3 hours; AD -3.6 hours, 95% CI -6.68 to -0.52) Significant decrease in arrhythmia recurrence (52% vs. 76%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.08) No significant difference in death in the ICU (36.5% vs. 41%; RR 0.89, 95% CI -0.04 to 1.82). In the PRASE study, the conclusion was: in patients with septic shock who had new-onset arrhythmia and a LVEF > 35%, propafenone was not superior to amiodarone with respect to proportion of patients with sinus rhythm 24 hours after the start of infusion.

### Echocardiography guided management of atrial fibrillation [^112bhXpu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography guided AF treatment

Since DC cardioversion of AF is associated with a high rate of recurrence (> 70%), concomitant administration of an antiarrhythmic drug is warranted in most patients. However, although the success rate of the rhythm control strategy reaches 70–90%, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs is fraught with side effects, including a depressant impact on myocardial contractility.

The cardiac depressant effect of sotalol, flecainide, and beta-blockers raises concerns when used in patients with AF. Amiodarone, the least cardio-depressant antiarrhythmic agent, has been historically preferred by cardiologists treating patients with "structural heart disease". This may not be the best choice for critically ill patients with septic shock, normal-to-moderately reduced LVEF ≥ 35% and a non-dilated LA, where treatment with propafenone resulted in more frequent SR at 24 h (+ 16%) and less recurrence of arrhythmia (-24%) than in the amiodarone group. The effects of short-acting beta-blockers in AF patients with septic shock included in major trials alluded to similar benefits. Current algorithms for AF management recommend against cardiac depressant medications such as vernakalant, calcium channel blockers, propafenone, flecainide, and beta-blockers in patients with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF < 35%), for which the treatment with amiodarone and/or digoxin is reserved (Fig. 2).

Amiodarone versus beta blockers

Six retrospective comparative studies compared amiodarone with beta blockers (Table 1, Additional file 1: Tables S5 and S6). Most studies did not report on doses or modes of administration. A large study of 39,693 patients with sepsis reported that patients treated with amiodarone were more likely to be critically ill with septic shock than patients treated with beta blockers. After adjustment for confounding, beta blockers were associated with lower mortality than amiodarone (RR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.59–0.77). However, only 60% of patients were on an ICU. Therefore, this study's results may not be applicable to a broad ICU population. The study was also judged as being at a serious risk of bias due to confounding (Additional file 1). Balik et al. showed higher but not statistically significant ICU mortality in patients receiving amiodarone (40%) than in patients receiving metoprolol (21%). A conference abstract by Jaffer et al. also reported no statistically significant difference in mortality. Four studies compared conversion rates between amiodarone and beta-blockers. Three studies showed no statistically significant difference in cardioversion rates between the treatments. Balik et al. did not adjust for confounding factors such as illness severity. Two studies did not report on the methods used for the analysis. No meaningful conclusions from the results of Brown et al. could be made with only 6 patients receiving amiodarone. Figure 2 shows rhythm control risk ratio results for studies comparing amiodarone with beta blockers. Although Fig. 2 enables a crude comparison of results, the studies were too heterogeneous for this to depict a true comparison. It should also be noted that only studies which reported numerators and denominators for the rhythm control outcome could be included in Fig. 2.

### Incidence and prognostic impact of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with septic shock: a prospective observational study [^114jh1rp]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Although new-onset of AF, as reemphasized by the present data, is a frequent and major problem in ICU patients, no evidence-based data regarding the treatment of AF for this patient group are available. In the current study, restoration of SR was possible in 85% of the patients. In the majority of patients, amiodarone was used, but was frequently combined with electrical cardioversion or other drugs. On the other hand, in 12 patients, restoration of SR was possible without the use of amiodarone. Although amiodarone seems to be an effective drug for restoration of SR, we do not know whether the outcome is positively affected by this measure. Previous studies on AF in non-critically ill patients have impressively demonstrated that restoration of SR patients does not automatically imply an improvement in clinical outcome. Furthermore, prophylactic intravenous administration of amiodarone for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias after pulmonary surgery has been associated with an increased risk for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, prospective randomized controlled studies are necessary to evaluate the use of amiodarone in critically ill patients.

The present study contains several limitations. Presumably, the number of patients was too low to demonstrate a significant association between new-onset AF and mortality rate in septic shock patients. Further, due to the limited number of patients, it was not possible to perform a multivariate analysis to identify independent risk factors for the development of AF in septic shock patients. Moreover, therapy of AF was not performed according to a fixed protocol. Therefore, the failure rate to restore SR has to be appraised with caution.

Junctional tachycardia — ongoing management is organized as drug therapy first, with beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil (Class IIa); flecainide or propafenone (use in the absence of structural heart disease [SHD]) (Class IIb); and if ineffective or contraindicated, catheter ablation (Class IIb).

### Propafenone hydrochloride [^111zQWG4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 	Proarrhythmic Effects

Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride tablets be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride tablets supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

In a U.S. uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter trial in subjects with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these subjects experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the trial. However, in 4 of the 9 subjects, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 subjects that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all subjects had a recurrence of SVT during the trial which could have been a change in the subjects' arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death.

5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects

Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride tablets be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride tablets supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

About 2.3% (11/474) of all subjects had a recurrence of SVT during the trial which could have been a change in the subjects' arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death.

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116nvQHh]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline — Ongoing management of SVT of unknown mechanism: Oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil is useful for ongoing management in patients with symptomatic SVT who do not have ventricular pre-excitation during sinus rhythm (Class I, B-R). Electrophysiology study with the option of ablation is useful for the diagnosis and potential treatment of SVT (Class I, B-NR). Patients with SVT should be educated on how to perform vagal maneuvers for ongoing management of SVT (Class I, C-LD). For patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic SVT and are not candidates for, or prefer not to undergo, catheter ablation, flecainide or propafenone is reasonable (Class IIa, B-R); trials have used propafenone 450 mg/day to 900 mg/day or flecainide 100 mg/day to 300 mg/day, and in one randomized controlled trial the probability at 12 months of effective (defined as < 2 attacks of arrhythmia) and safe treatment was 86% for propafenone and 93% for flecainide; however, these drugs are contraindicated in these patient groups with structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease.

The figure specifies that flecainide or propafenone "should be combined with AV nodal–blocking agents to reduce risk of 1:1 conduction during atrial flutter", and notes to ensure adequate anticoagulation or exclude left atrial thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography before conversion.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^111MUuQ7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Outcomes of new-onset AF in patients with sepsis were described in five studies. All studies consistently reported worse outcome in patients with new-onset AF as compared to patients with preserved sinus rhythm, although only two studies used multivariate analyses to adjust for baseline imbalances. Even then, residual confounding in both studies is likely since only limited numbers of covariables were collected and time-dependent variations in the evolution of disease severity prior to the onset of AF were ignored. Methodologically advanced analytical approaches are necessary to demonstrate genuinely independent associations with morbidity and mortality. In the end, therefore, it still remains somewhat elusive to what extent new-onset AF in patients with sepsis truly impacts outcome. However, given the consistency of the findings across settings and biological plausibility, a relation that is (at least in part) causal seems likely.

Additional morbidity and mortality following the development of AF in patients with sepsis may be explained by the decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure that occurs in most patients due to reduced left ventricular filling. This is particularly the case in the presence of rapid ventricular response rates. The resulting hemodynamic compromise may impair the recovery of organ function in patients with severe sepsis or shock. Furthermore, AF has been associated with the development of intracardiac thrombi, posing a subsequent risk of systemic embolization and stroke. Harm, however, may also result from the indiscriminate use of anticoagulants in patients with AF, particularly in an ICU setting. Unfortunately, there are presently no evidence-based guidelines for the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis in these patients.

Taken together, the management of new-onset AF in critically ill patients with sepsis poses a major clinical challenge. It may therefore be desirable to start pharmacological prophylaxis in an attempt to prevent this complication rather than to be reactive, provided that it is possible to adequately identify patients who are at highest risk for developing AF during sepsis. A recent study investigating the effect of esmolol in patients with septic shock gives support to the feasibility of such approach. Although reducing heart rate is likely to improve cardiovascular function, treating sinus tachycardia - and thereby possibly preventing AF - in patients with sepsis remains controversial, however, and further research is necessary before any recommendations regarding pharmacological prophylaxis can be made.

### Landiolol is effective for the treatment of tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock in patients during septic shock therapy [^113YZxZc]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the blood pressure drops to a low level after an infection. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia to complicate its course. Beta (β)-blockers are often administrated to manage supraventricular tachyarrhythmias observed in patients presenting with sepsis. A 74-year-old woman presenting with sepsis demonstrated AF tachycardia characterised by severe hypotension. She was refractory to conventional therapy including verapamil and digoxin; therefore, treatment using landiolol (an ultrashort-acting β-blocker) was initiated. Her clinical course was followed over 48hours, and she showed a significant improvement in her heart rate and blood pressure without any adverse effect. Landiolol can rapidly control the accelerated heart rate associated with AF in critically decompensated patients presenting with septic shock.

### Propafenone (propafenone hydrochloride) [^1117gSge]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In a U.S. uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter trial using the immediate-release formulation in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the trial. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the trial which could have been a change in the patients' arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsades de pointes, asystole, and death.

Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening or new appearance of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST trial [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrhythmia is present throughout treatment.

5.2	Unmasking Brugada Syndrome

### Incidence and prognostic impact of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with septic shock: a prospective observational study [^113TmzYs]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Success rate to restore SR and recurrence of AF

Electrical cardioversion was performed in 17 of 49 patients with AF, but was combined in all cases with additional drug therapy. Amiodarone was the drug used most frequently (36/49 patients), followed by digitalis glycosides (31/49) and ß-blockers (25/49), indicating that the majority of patients received a combination of antiarrhythmic drugs.

In 42 out of the 49 patients with new-onset AF, SR was successfully reconstituted, including 23 out of 26 patients without septic shock and 19 out of 23 patients with septic shock. Only one of the seven patients, who could not be converted to SR, did not receive amiodarone.

Failure to restore SR was associated with an increased ICU mortality. ICU mortality was 5 out of 7 patients who could not be cardioverted to SR in contrast to 9 out of 42 successfully cardioverted patients (P = 0.015).

Recurrence rate of AF was high (42.9%), with no significant difference between AF in patients with septic shock and AF patients without septic shock (48% versus 38%, P = 0.57).

### Propafenone hydrochloride (propafenone) [^113EatnP]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Proarrhythmic Effects:

Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and Torsade de Pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone ER capsules be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy, to determine whether the response to propafenone ER capsules sup­ports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret.

In a 474 patient U.S. uncontrolled, open label multicenter trial using the immediate release formulation in patients with symptomatic SVT, 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in four of the nine patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the nine patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients' arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone HCl for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased PVCs, VT, VF, Torsade de Pointes, asystole, and death.

In the RAFT study, there were five deaths, three in the pooled propafenone ER capsules group (0.8%) and two in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall propafenone ER capsules and propafenone HCl immediate release database of eight studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone HCl and 4% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied.

Study endpoints

Primary endpoint

The primary endpoint (PE) was a multi-component endpoint defined by achieving HR response (3 subsequent hourly HR values at 80–94 bpm or < 80 bpm and not clinically relevant), HR maintenance (defined as not recording 3 subsequent hourly HR values > 94 bpm or < 80 bpm after achievement of HR response), and no increase in vasopressor requirements during the first 24 h after treatment. Vasopressor response was defined as no increase of noradrenaline equivalent dose at 24 h compared to the treatment start. HR values < 80 bpm were not deemed as response failure if the investigator considered the HR to be not clinically relevant (i.e. not assessed as relative bradycardia, without hemodynamic compromise). Individual endpoints, i.e. HR response (with or without maintenance) and vasopressors response, were also evaluated separately.

Secondary endpoints

Secondary endpoints included change in vasopressor requirements over the study period (dose and duration); 28-day/ICU mortality; duration of ICU/hospital stay; and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The incidence rates of bradycardic episodes requiring intervention, adverse events (AEs), and SAEs were secondary safety endpoints.

Statistical analyses

Primary efficacy analysis

Absolute and relative frequencies of patients who achieved the PE were calculated. The comparison of study groups was conducted using a weighted Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel framework with two stratification factors: the presence of AF and site. The hypothesis that landiolol group is superior to control group in the proportion of patients who reached the PE was demonstrated if the lower limit of two-sided 95% confidence interval of difference pL–pC was above zero, where pL and pC are percentages of patients who reached the PE in landiolol and control groups, respectively. The PE was measured within 24 h after treatment initiation. Patients who died or were discontinued due to administration of beta-blockers during the first 24 h without reaching the PE were included in the analysis with the outcome that the PE was not reached.

Secondary efficacy and safety analyses

Secondary efficacy and safety analyses are fully described in the SAP (see electronic supplementary material).

Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were defined post hoc for exploratory purposes and are specified in the SAP (see electronic supplementary material).

### Landiolol for heart rate control in patients with septic shock and persistent tachycardia. A multicenter randomized clinical trial (landi-SEP) [^112xJ8wT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Titrated administration of the highly selective, ultra-short-acting beta1-blocker landiolol in patients with septic shock and persistent tachycardia was effective in reducing and maintaining HR without increasing vasopressor requirements within the first 24 h. There were no differences in adverse events and clinical outcomes, such as 28-day mortality, duration of ICU/hospital stay or time of survival, between patients treated with landiolol vs. sole standard of care. These results, in the context of previous trials, do not support a treatment strategy of stringent HR reduction (< 95 bpm) in an unselected septic shock population with persistent tachycardia. Subgroup analysis showed a trend for lower mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation but reverse trend for higher mortality in patients with sinus tachycardia. Further investigations are needed to identify septic shock patient phenotypes that benefit clinically from HR control.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) of unknown mechanism — ongoing management (primary recommendations): I B-R oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil is useful for ongoing management in patients with symptomatic SVT who do not have ventricular pre-excitation during sinus rhythm; I B-NR electrophysiological (EP) study with the option of ablation is useful for the diagnosis and potential treatment of SVT; I C-LD patients with SVT should be educated on how to perform vagal maneuvers for ongoing management of SVT; IIa B-R flecainide or propafenone is reasonable for ongoing management in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic SVT and are not candidates for, or prefer not to undergo, catheter ablation.

5.5	Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure

Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta-blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In the U.S. trial (RAFT) in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1%) patients receiving propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules (all doses) compared with 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. Proarrhythmic effects more likely occur when propafenone is administered to patients with heart failure (NYHA III and IV) or severe myocardial ischemia [see Contraindications (4)].

In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release, new or worsened congestive heart failure has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia. These events were more likely in subjects with pre-existing heart failure and coronary artery disease. New onset of heart failure attributable to propafenone developed in less than 0.2% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia and in 1.9% of patients with paroxysmal AF or PSVT.

5.6	Conduction Disturbances

Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first-degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

In a U.S. trial (RAFT) in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules, sinus bradycardia (rate less than 50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules and placebo.

5.7	Effects on Pacemaker Threshold

Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly.

5.8	Agranulocytosis

Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy, and upon discontinuation of therapy the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^1111NViP]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Table 1
Overview of included studies

a When studies differentiate between sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, the number of patients with sepsis equals the number of all patients with sepsis including patients with severe sepsis and septic shock; b see Additional file 2 for a detailed appraisal of the individual studies; c Walkey 2013 only excluded patients after cardiothoracic surgery in a sensitivity analysis for identification of the risk factors, therefore we used this study only for the analysis of risk factors; d the number of patients with sepsis excluding patients with cardiothoracic surgery or endocarditis during the sepsis hospitalization. AF: atrial fibrillation; ICD-9-CM: International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification; ICU: intensive care unit; n/a: not available.

Table 2 shows the incidence of new-onset AF in patients with sepsis by various stages of disease progression. The weighted mean incidence of new-onset AF was 8% (range 0 to 14%), 10% (4 to 23%) and 23% (6 to 46%) in patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, respectively. Not all studies reported the incidences of new-onset AF for the various disease stages separately. Three studies reported only a combined incidence for patients with either sepsis or severe sepsis (mean 5%, range 3 to 10%); one study reported an incidence for patients with either severe sepsis or septic shock (28%); and another two studies reported an incidence for patients with sepsis of unspecified severity (mean 28%; range 25 to 50%). In contrast, a single large study that was not formally restricted to the ICU setting only, and that used International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to detect episodes of new-onset AF, reported an incidence of 5% in hospitalized patients with severe sepsis and 6% in patients with septic shock. No studies reported the number of recurrent AF episodes per ICU admission, their duration, or their hemodynamic consequences. Two studies reported the therapeutic interventions that were performed in response to AF onset in patients with sepsis, including electrical cardioversion (31%) and the initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone (73%), digoxin (63%), bêta blockers (51%), and other/unspecified medications for rate-control (52%) or pharmacologically cardioversion (12%).

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^1155q2de]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

We searched the literature from 1966 through 2013 using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. In our query we used compound search strings for both the determinant (atrial fibrillation) and domain (sepsis) (see Additional file 1 of the online supplemental digital content for full specification of our search query). Only articles published in English, Dutch, French or German were considered for this review. We screened titles and abstracts of identified articles and included all studies describing the incidence, risk factors or outcome of new-onset AF, atrial flutter or other supraventricular tachycardia occurring during ICU stay in adult patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients with a supraventricular tachycardia that was not further specified or of unknown origin were included because we expected a high percentage of AF among these patients. Furthermore, we also included reports that primarily focused on patients with severe sepsis and septic shock but that were not specifically restricted to the ICU setting, because we expected a high proportion of critically ill patients to be represented in these studies. We excluded reports that primarily included patients following cardiotomy, that contained no original data, that were published only in abstract form, or that provided no clear definition of the patients or the arrhythmia being studied. Institutional Review Board approval was not sought since our study did not involve human research.

Quality assessment

Studies that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated for their methodological quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. The following items were assessed: study design, sample size, domain definition, determinant parameterization, risk factor parameterization and outcome parameterization. We scored all items on a four-point scale from low to high.

Characteristics of included studies

Nine studies were conducted in speciality ICUs such as surgical, trauma, or medical. Five studies were conducted in mixed ICUs and one study in a general ICU. The type of ICU was not specified in 10 studies. Eleven studies included patients with sepsis or septic shock as primary diagnoses. Four studies were conducted in a noncardiac surgical population. Two studies included noncardiac and cardiac surgery patients and one study was conducted in surgical population; however, the type of surgery was not specified.

Nineteen studies investigated the treatment effects of pharmacological treatments, two studies looked at prophylactic treatments, and two studies investigated electrical treatments. One study reported on both pharmacological treatments and anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis. One study on anticoagulation was included in the review.

Overview of the primary study evidence by intervention and study design can be found in Additional file 1: Tables S12.

Definitions used for NOAF

Studies varied in how they reported and defined NOAF. Five studies defined NOAF as having AF with a heart rate of > 100 beats per minute and two studies used a heart rate threshold of > 120 beats per minute. Seven studies reported different time periods for which NOAF must be sustained, ranging from 30 s to 24 h. Six studies specified in which instances AF would be considered as 'new onset'. For example, when a patient had no prior history of AF, without previous history of atrial tachyarrhythmias and antiarrhythmic drug use, and AF not present on admission. Ten studies did not provide any definition for NOAF.

### Landiolol for heart rate control in patients with septic shock and persistent tachycardia. A multicenter randomized clinical trial (landi-SEP) [^116BqUp1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Ethics

The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The study protocol was approved by the relevant independent ethics committee at each participating center. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or patient's legal representative(s) before any intervention. The final study protocol and the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) are available in the electronic supplementary material (ESM). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee regularly reviewed the trial data.

Trial design and objectives

The LANDI-SEP trial was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled phase IV trial in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock and persistent tachycardia (HR ≥ 95 bpm). The study was conducted at 20 sites in 7 European countries. The primary objective of the trial was to compare an HR response and its maintenance thereof without an increase in vasopressor requirements within the first 24 h of treatment between landiolol and control groups. Further assessments of efficacy and safety in the two study groups were set as secondary objectives.

Patients

Eligible to the study were adult patients (> 18 years) in the ICU with septic shock as defined by the Sepsis-3 Criteria, with persistent tachycardia (HR ≥ 95 bpm) despite a hemodynamic optimization phase of at least 12 h but a maximum of 36 h in which they received treatment according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines. Patients with any form of compensatory tachycardia, as determined by the Investigator, were not eligible. Selection criteria are fully stated in supplemental Table 2-Study protocol. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to landiolol or control group according to the randomization list generated by the study statistician. The presence of AF in the hemodynamic optimization period was used as a stratification factor. Treatments were assigned to individual patients based on block stratified randomization to ensure random assignment to treatments and balanced distribution of both treatment arms within each stratum. The intervention was open label due to the absence of a specific study treatment in the control group.

### Treatment strategies for new onset atrial fibrillation in patients treated on an intensive care unit: a systematic scoping review [^111U4D3w]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

New onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF), usually defined as atrial fibrillation (AF) occurring in patients with no known history of AF, is a common arrhythmia in critically ill patients. NOAF occurs in 5–11% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and up to 46% of patients with septic shock. NOAF in critically ill patients can cause cardiovascular instability and is associated with increased risk of thromboembolism, increased mortality and length of ICU stay, and higher healthcare costs.

Guidelines for management of AF do not directly apply to critically ill patients. NOAF in patients treated on an ICU differs from AF in patients in the community in terms of causes of rhythm disturbance, risks and effectiveness of treatments. The lack of evidence for managing NOAF in patients treated on an ICU means treatment practice differs widely.

We conducted a scoping review to provide an overview of current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological, electrical, and other non-pharmacological NOAF treatments, prophylactic strategies, and acute anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in critically ill patients. We also aimed to describe commonly used definitions of NOAF in patients treated on an ICU and suggest recommendations and barriers for future research.

A recent scoping review described the incidence, risk factors, outcomes and management strategies related to NOAF during critical illness. It included patients with pre-existing AF and studies conducted outside ICUs. Our review focusses on the comparative evidence for treatment of NOAF in patients treated on an ICU.

### Revisiting propafenone toxicity [^113hpqJS]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Propafenone is a Vaughan Williams class 1c antiarrhythmic medication widely used for treatment of arrhythmias. Although the long-term safety of propafenone use has not been established, it is commonly used for treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with no structural heart disease. Propafenone is well known as pill-in-the-pocket treatment for its effect in terminating paroxysmal episodes of atrial fibrillation. Herein, we discuss an unusual adverse reaction to propafenone in a patient who presented with symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension. The aim of this article is to increase physician awareness for propafenone toxicity and its management, with a focused literature review on propafenone pharmacotherapy.

### Symptomatic arrhythmia recurrence as an outcome in clinical trials of antiarrhythmic drug therapy [^11654QRx]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment, and developing new antiarrhythmic therapies remains a challenging problem. Documenting symptomatic arrhythmia recurrence using patient-activated ECG recording has been a useful tool to test new pharmacologic therapies. This technique has been used successfully to test immediate-release verapamil in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; flecainide acetate in patients with atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; immediate-release propafenone in patients with atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; d, l-sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation; digoxin in patients with atrial fibrillation; azimilide dihydrochloride in patients with atrial fibrillation; and sustained-release propafenone in patients with atrial fibrillation. These studies have contributed to understanding efficacy and have led to regulatory approvals in the United States to label drugs as effective for supraventricular arrhythmias.

### Does early vasopressin in septic shock improve outcomes? An important piece to this emerging puzzle has arrived [^111HFoNG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

In this month's Annals of Pharmacotherapy, the largest observational study assessing the early versus later use of vasopressin has been published. When this new study is combined with the other available observational studies, there are 2 important outcomes to focus on. When all the observational studies are pooled together, no reduction in new onset arrhythmias is seen (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41–1.95) with early versus late vasopressin use while the reduction in renal replacement therapy just missed statistical significance (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.32–1.00). Early vasopressin likely does not reduce new onset arrhythmias versus later use but might reduce the need for renal replacement therapy.

Atrial fibrillation — flecainide and propafenone efficacy, dosing, and safety caveats: Randomized trials and a Cochrane analysis established efficacy of flecainide and propafenone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in AF. In the Flec‑SL trial, flecainide prevented episodes of paroxysmal AF in 31% over 4 months versus 9% with placebo. Sustained‑release propafenone 425, 325, and 225 mg twice daily extended median time to AF/AFL/SVT versus placebo (> 300, 291, and 112 days versus 41 days; P < 0.001). Patients with prior MI or significant structural heart disease "should not take" flecainide or propafenone, and individuals on these agents "should be concomitantly taking an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent" to reduce risk of 1:1 atrial flutter.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114655rs]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Oral flecainide/propafenone pill‑in‑the‑pocket for recent‑onset atrial fibrillation — Single oral doses of flecainide and propafenone are effective for conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm, with 3 to 4 hour conversion rates of 58% to 68% for flecainide (18%–29% for placebo) and 45% to 57% for propafenone (17%–29% for placebo). A beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is generally given at least 30 minutes before dosing to prevent 1:1 atrioventricular conduction during atrial flutter (AFL). In 268 patients with stable AF of recent onset treated in the emergency department, those successfully treated (n = 210) were discharged with a pill‑in‑the‑pocket plan; over 15 ± 5 months, single‑dose flecainide or propafenone was successful in 94% of episodes, with adverse effects in 6%–17%. Because of these risks and typical first‑dose inpatient observation, the pill‑in‑the‑pocket strategy should only be used for highly selected patients and after it first has been observed to be safe and effective in an inpatient setting.

We have found that new-onset AF is a very common complication in septic shock patients that is associated with an increased ICU length of stay among surviving patients. Higher SOFA scores observed in septic shock patients with new-onset AF may indicate an association between severity of illness and the occurrence of AF. The observation of increasing CRP levels before onset of AF may support the hypothesis that systemic inflammation is an important trigger for the development of AF in critically ill patients. Success rate to restore SR by antiarrhythmic drugs and electrical cardioversion was high, and failure to restore SR was associated with increased mortality.

### Propafenone hydrochloride (propafenone HCl) [^114qMnx8]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Propafenone hydrochloride is indicated to:

prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease.
prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease.
treat documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening. Initiate treatment in the hospital.

Usage Considerations:

The use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) or in patients exclusively with atrial flutter or PSVT has not been evaluated. Do not use propafenone hydrochloride tablets to control ventricular rate during AF.
Some patients with atrial flutter treated with propafenone have developed 1:1 conduction, producing an increase in ventricular rate. Concomitant treatment with drugs that increase the functional atrioventricular (AV) nodal refractory period is recommended.
The use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation has not been evaluated.
Because of the proarrhythmic effects of propafenone hydrochloride, its use with lesser ventricular arrhythmias is not recommended, even if patients are symptomatic, and any use of the drug should be reserved for patients in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
The effect of propafenone on mortality has not been determined [see Boxed Warning].

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — propafenone for cardioversion: reported cardioversion of recent-onset AF ranged from 56% to 83%, and oral propafenone was as efficacious as flecainide but superior to oral amiodarone and quinidine plus digoxin. Limited data suggest reduced efficacy in patients with persistent AF, in conversion of atrial flutter, and in patients with structural heart disease. Adverse effects are uncommon but include rapid atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, intraventricular conduction disturbances, hypotension, and bradycardia on conversion. Available data on propafenone loading in organic heart disease are scant; this agent should be used cautiously or not at all for conversion of AF in such cases and should be avoided in patients with HF or severe obstructive lung disease.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation [^111wzG5W]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Acute atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm encountered in clinical practice and is commonly seen in acutely ill patients in critical care. In the latter setting, AF may have two main clinical sequelae: (1) haemodynamic instability and (2) thromboembolism. The approach to the management of AF can broadly be divided into a rate control strategy or a rhythm control strategy, and is largely driven by symptom assessment and functional status. A crucial part of AF management requires the appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis. In patients who are haemodynamically unstable with AF, urgent direct current cardioversion should be considered. Apart from electrical cardioversion, drugs are commonly used, and Class I (flecainide, propafenone) and Class III (amiodarone) antiarrhythmic drugs are more likely to revert AF to sinus rhythm. Beta blockers and rate limiting calcium blockers, as well as digoxin, are often used in controlling heart rate in patients with acute onset AF. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the management of AF in the critical care setting.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) — decisions when starting therapy emphasize that, after the Cardiac Arrhythmias Suppression Trial (CAST), patient-centred decision-making is important because powerful and effective AADs can be potentially dangerous, especially in structural heart disease. In malignant ventricular arrhythmias, AADs predominantly serve as adjunct therapy to implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) to prevent electrical storm and frequent shocks rather than to suppress and cure arrhythmias. AADs preserve an important role as symptomatic therapy or to prevent deterioration of cardiac function and are a valuable tool for preventing transformation of well-tolerated arrhythmias into malignant arrhythmias. AADs have a narrow therapeutic window with a small plasma concentration interval between the lowest effective and first toxic dose, with potential proarrhythmic effects, and there is a high degree of inter-subject variability in their drug actions. For practical reasons, this consensus includes rate-controlling drugs. Multiple factors interact with drug effects, including age, gender, genetics, temperature, drug–drug interaction, triggering factors, neurohormonal changes, disease state and severity, and disease-induced substrate remodelling, and some AADs have multiple electrophysiological and pharmacologic effects depending on route of administration, plasma levels, and active metabolites, with examples including propafenone, quinidine, and amiodarone.

### Landiolol for heart rate control in patients with septic shock and persistent tachycardia. A multicenter randomized clinical trial (landi-SEP) [^112GFzUj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock-related inflammation results in hypovolemia and a reduction of cardiac output. To maintain vital organ perfusion, massive sympathetic activation through the release of catecholamines is triggered leading to tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and increase in inotropism. Current treatment guidelines recommend intravascular fluid administration and vasopressor therapy as the first step of hemodynamic management. However, in some patients, elevated heart rate (HR) persists, which may reflect sympathetic overstimulation. Persistent tachycardia impairs preload and coronary perfusion and is associated with mortality and morbidity in a range of clinical conditions. The threshold of 95 beats per minute (bpm) was reported as a predictive cut-off value to differentiate between survivors and non-survivors, while the range of 80−94 bpm is recognized as adequately balancing improved cardiac function and preserved systemic hemodynamics. These findings suggest that adequate HR control may improve the outcome of septic shock patients with tachycardia.

Beta1-selective beta-blockers, such as esmolol and landiolol, are considered suitable for the management of tachycardia in septic patients, as their administration resulted in improved stroke volume, lactate levels, a reduction of noradrenaline requirements, improvements in organ function, and survival rates. Due to their pharmacological properties, short-acting beta1-blockers in combination with vasopressors seem to be most appropriate approach to control HR during sepsis without systemic adverse effects. Other antiarrhythmic agents, such as ivabradine or amiodarone, showed HR reduction in clinical trials in septic shock patients but may lack the beneficial pleiotropic effects of beta-blockers, which include attenuating sympathetic overstimulation, increasing microcirculatory blood flow, blunting the inflammatory response, metabolic changes, and sepsis-associated coagulopathy. Beta-blockers were associated with superior clinical outcomes in a large retrospective study evaluating atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment in sepsis. Non-selective beta-blockers are generally longer acting and may therefore be less suitable in the acute phase of sepsis. The widespread use of beta-blockers is restrained due to possible induction of hypotension and bradycardia. High-quality data on the safety and efficacy of beta-blockade during septic shock are missing and recommendation on HR management in the current sepsis treatment guidelines remains limited. Landiolol has a shorter elimination half-life (4 min) than esmolol (9 min) and higher selectivity for beta1 receptors, resulting in lower negative inotropic effects and reduced impact on blood pressure (BP).

### Clinical review: treatment of new-onset atrial fibrillation in medical intensive care patients – a clinical framework [^1113zPmY]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation occurs frequently in medical intensive care unit patients. Most intensivists tend to treat this rhythm disorder because they believe it is detrimental. Whether atrial fibrillation contributes to morbidity and/or mortality and whether atrial fibrillation is an epiphenomenon of severe disease, however, are not clear. As a consequence, it is unknown whether treatment of the arrhythmia affects the outcome. Furthermore, if treatment is deemed necessary, it is not known what the best treatment is. We developed a treatment protocol by searching for the best evidence. Because studies in medical intensive care unit patients are scarce, the evidence comes mainly from extrapolation of data derived from other patient groups. We propose a treatment strategy with magnesium infusion followed by amiodarone in case of failure. Although this strategy seems to be effective in both rhythm control and rate control, the mortality remained high. A randomised controlled trial in medical intensive care unit patients with placebo treatment in the control arm is therefore still defendable.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, maintenance therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating flecainide or propafenone for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF and no previous myocardial infarction, or known or suspected significant structural heart disease, or ventricular scar or fibrosis.

### Landiolol for heart rate control in patients with septic shock and persistent tachycardia. A multicenter randomized clinical trial (landi-SEP) [^116zWRij]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The protocol did not require detailed hemodynamic monitoring or advanced echocardiography. The lack of the insight into the hemodynamic profiles of individual patients could have led to the enrolment of patients with tachycardia, who did not benefit from HR reduction. Due to the lack of universally accepted criteria for the definition of non-compensatory tachycardia, methods of identification of such patients were at the investigator's discretion. Observed decreases in BP in the early phase of landiolol treatment and increases in vasopressor doses suggest that some patients with compensatory tachycardia were indeed included. The lack of cardiac output measurement and orientation on achieving target HR prevented investigators to individualise treatment targets (e.g. to titrate landiolol to optimise cardiac output). While the incidence of hypotension was low in both study groups, we hypothesize that due to the adherence to the HR goal, investigators were more likely to increase vasopressor dose in these patients than to reduce landiolol dose. The stringent approach of targeting a fixed HR does not take full advantage of the titratability of an ultra-short-acting beta-blocker like landiolol and may have been too aggressive in patients with higher HR. The protocol allowed the enrolment of patients with other than sinus rhythm or pre-admission beta-blocker therapy, which might have also influenced the individual responses to treatment. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed higher mortality risk for the landiolol group (47.2% [34/72]) compared to the control group (39.7% [29/73]) in patients with sinus tachycardia, while the opposite was observed in patients with AF (34.6% [9/26] vs 41.7% [10/24]) (supplemental Table 12). This finding, albeit not statistically significant, could also reflect the benefit of improved diastolic filling time in patients with the absence of the atrial kick. The use of inotropic agents was rare in our study with only nine patients in each group receiving dobutamine, levosimendan, or milrinone. In the Japanese study, around 40% of patients were administered dobutamine and phosphodiesterase III inhibitors in the landiolol group. In the single-center study by Morelli et al. that reported a significant decrease in 28-day mortality using esmolol in a similar patient population, 49.4% of patients received levosimendan.

### Brugada syndrome, manifested by propafenone induced ST segment elevation [^11545FSH]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 43 year old man who was diagnosed with Brugada syndrome after propafenone administration for chemical cardioversion of new onset atrial fibrillation. Brugada syndrome has been described in the medical literature and is thought to be responsible for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths in patients without ischaemic heart disease. This syndrome has not yet been extensively discussed in the emergency medicine literature despite its importance. Emergency physicians should consider Brugada syndrome in patients who present to the emergency department with right bundle branch block and ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads, which is the classic electrocardiographic pattern of this syndrome.

### Impact of patient characteristics on the efficacy and safety of landiolol in patients with sepsis-related tachyarrhythmia: subanalysis of the J-land 3S randomised controlled study [^112c3thp]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We also found marked differences in the percentages of patients with new-onset arrhythmias or adverse events between the landiolol and control groups among patients with ARDS. New-onset arrhythmia occurred in one of 19 patients in the landiolol group and in five of 12 patients in the control group, while adverse events occurred in ten of 19 and 11 of 12 patients, respectively. β-receptor stimulation has been reported to contribute to the induction of arrhythmia in ARDS. Thus, we speculate that landiolol attenuated β-receptor stimulation, without increasing the risk of adverse events in patients with ARDS. β-blockers are generally contraindicated or administered with caution in patients with respiratory diseases because of the risk of bronchospasm. It is interesting to note that esmolol was associated with an increase in stroke volume, maintenance of mean arterial pressure, and reduced the norepinephrine requirements in patients with septic shock, and a recent study revealed that administration of β-blockers improved oxygen saturation without affecting the mean arterial pressure or an increase in norepinephrine doses in patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Changes in hemodynamic factors were not assessed in our study, so future studies may need to evaluate the impact of landiolol on these factors in patients with septic shock and improve the prognosis of patients with ARDS. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to note that landiolol was efficacious and did not exacerbate adverse events in patients with ARDS in the present study.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^111f9c8q]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of critical illness, with a reported incidence that varies from 4 to 9% in general intensive care unit (ICU) patients to 32 to 50% in postcardiotomy patients. Furthermore, new-onset AF predicts mortality in patients who are hospitalized for heart failure as well as various other critical conditions, although it is possible that AF in these cases is primarily a marker of disease severity rather than a direct cause of death. Nonetheless, the development of AF is associated with a sudden reduction in cardiac output and rise in filling pressures and it is, therefore, possible that increased mortality is due to the adverse consequences of AF on cardiac function. In addition, chronic AF is associated with thromboembolic complications, and it is plausible that some of these risks also affect critically ill patients with an acute episode of AF.

Although cardiac arrhythmias in the general ICU population have been described since the early 1990s, most authors have studied unselected cohorts of patients, with neither exclusion of subjects who had a cardiac reason for admission nor those with a known history of chronic or paroxysmal AF. As a consequence, the true incidence and prognosis of new-onset AF in patients presenting with sepsis remains unknown.

Sepsis is characterized by a systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines, high levels of circulating stress hormones, autonomic dysfunction, and may be complicated by organ dysfunction. In addition, intravascular volume shifts and cardiovascular compromise will frequently lead to hypotension and elevated lactate levels. All of these features of sepsis are possible triggers for the development of AF.

If AF causes poor outcome it might be desirable to start antiarrhythmic prophylaxis in critically ill patients with sepsis in an attempt to prevent this complication. Current guidelines advise the use of beta blockers or amiodarone to prevent postoperative AF in patients following cardiac surgery and it is conceivable that a preemptive strategy could also be effective in patients with (severe) sepsis. Identification of patients at highest risk for AF is therefore important. We aimed to gain better understanding of the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset AF in critically ill patients with sepsis.

Atrial fibrillation — class IC antiarrhythmic agents in structural heart disease or recent myocardial infarction are associated with harm: "the Vaughan Williams class IC antiarrhythmic agents flecainide and encainide were associated with an increased mortality rate in patients with recent MI; most patients also had LVEF < 50%". In CAST-II, "moricizine also increased the mortality rate within the first 14 days of treatment", and in CASH, "propafenone was associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality". Accordingly, "IC agents are best avoided in patients with AF who have a previous MI or significant structural heart disease, including HFrEF".

### Diagnosis and management of common types of supraventricular tachycardia [^112eWmd4]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia refers to rapid rhythms that originate and are sustained in atrial or atrioventricular node tissue above the bundle of His. The condition is caused by reentry phenomena or automaticity at or above the atrioventricular node, and includes atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. Most persons with these tachyarrhythmias have structurally normal hearts. Sudden onset of an accelerated heart rate can cause palpitations, light-headedness, chest discomfort, anxiety, dyspnea, or fatigue. The history is important to elicit episodic symptoms because physical examination and electrocardiography findings may be normal. A Holter monitor or event recorder may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Vagal maneuvers may terminate the arrhythmia; if this fails, adenosine is effective in the acute setting. Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil) or beta blockers (metoprolol) can be used acutely or as long-term therapy. Class Ic antiarrhythmics (flecainide or propafenone) can be used long-term. Class Ia antiarrhythmics (quinidine, procainamide, or disopyramide) are used less often because of their modest effectiveness and adverse effects. Class III antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol, or dofetilide) are effective, but have potential adverse effects and should be administered in consultation with a cardiologist. Catheter ablation has a success rate of 95% and recurrence rate of less than 5%, and causes inadvertent heart block in less than 1% of patients. It is the preferred treatment for symptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

### Unmasking of Brugada syndrome by an antiarrhythmic drug in a patient with septic shock [^114UtcRg]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic Brugada syndrome patients often display concealed Brugada-type electrocardiogram patterns that result in under-diagnosis of this syndrome. These patients include individuals of both genders and a wide range of ages. They are as likely as non-Brugada patients to have normal longevity or to suffer from a critical illness. Here we report a case of septic shock in which Brugada-type electrocardiogram patterns were induced by pilsicainide administration for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. This case report suggests that some drugs used in the treatment of septic shock can unmask the Brugada-type electrocardiogram pattern and induce lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

### Efficacy and safety of landiolol, an ultra-short-acting β 1-selective antagonist, for treatment of sepsis-related tachyarrhythmia (J-land 3S): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^111c663b]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Background

Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation frequently occur in patients being treated for sepsis or septic shock and have a poor prognosis. Treatments for tachyarrhythmias are often ineffective or contraindicated in this setting. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of landiolol, an ultra-short-acting β-blocker, for treating sepsis-related tachyarrhythmias.

Methods

We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 54 hospitals in Japan. Patients admitted to the intensive care units who received conventional treatment for sepsis, according to clinical guidelines for the management of sepsis, and who subsequently developed a tachyarrhythmia, were enrolled. The main inclusion criteria were 20 years of age or older, diagnosis of sepsis according to Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock criteria, administration of catecholamine necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure at 65 mm Hg or more for at least 1 h, and heart rate of 100 beats per min (bpm) or more maintained for at least 10 min without a change in catecholamine dose with diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or sinus tachycardia. Only patients who developed these symptoms and signs within 24 h before randomisation, and within 72 h after entering an intensive care unit, were prospectively assigned to receive conventional sepsis therapy alone (control group) or conventional sepsis therapy plus landiolol (landiolol group) in an open-label manner. Landiolol hydrochloride was intravenously infused at an initial dose of 1 μg/kg per min within 2 h after randomisation and the dose could be increased per study protocol to a maximum of 20 μg/kg per min. Patients in both groups received conventional therapy (Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2016), including respiratory and fluid resuscitation, antimicrobials, and catecholamines. The treating physicians were required to stabilise the patient's haemodynamic status before randomisation. Randomisation was done using a central randomisation system and dynamic allocation with the minimisation method by institution, heart rate at randomisation (≥ 100 to < 120 bpm or ≥ 120 bpm), and age (< 70 years or ≥ 70 years). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with heart rate of 60–94 bpm at 24 h after randomisation. Patients without heart rate data at 24 h after randomisation were handled as non-responders. The primary outcome was analysed using the full analysis set on an as-assigned basis, while safety was analysed using the safety analysis set according to the treatment received. This study was registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center Clinical Trials Information database, number JapicCTI-173767.

Findings

Between Jan 16, 2018 and Apr 22, 2019, 151 patients were randomly assigned, 76 to the landiolol group and 75 to the control group. A significantly larger proportion of patients in the landiolol group had a heart rate of 60–94 bpm 24 h after randomisation than in the control group (55% [41 of 75] vs 33% [25 of 75]), with a between-group difference of 23.1% (95% CI 7.1–37.5; p = 0.0031). Adverse events were observed in 49 (64%) of 77 patients in the landiolol group and in 44 (59%) of 74 in the control group, with serious adverse events (including adverse events leading to death) in nine (12%) of 77 and eight (11%) of 74 patients. Serious adverse events related to landiolol occurred in five (6%) of 77 patients, including blood pressure decreases in three patients (4%) and cardiac arrest, heart rate decrease, and ejection fraction decrease occurred in one patient each (1%).

Interpretation

Landiolol resulted in significantly more patients with sepsis-related tachyarrhythmia achieving a heart rate of 60–94 bpm at 24 h and significantly reduced the incidence of new-onset arrhythmia. Landiolol was also well tolerated, but it should be used under appropriate monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate owing to the risk of hypotension in patients with sepsis and septic shock.

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^115AQrPo]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac rhythm disturbance encountered in critically ill patients in the general medical or surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Depending upon the study population, AF is reported to occur at frequencies ranging from 8.3% to 46%, the latter being associated with patients who have undergone cardiac surgery or were admitted for treatment of sepsis. The occurrence of AF potentially leads to thromboembolism or haemodynamic compromise. Risk factors for the development of AF in critically ill patients have been predominantly derived from cardiothoracic surgical patients. Data on risk factors for atrial fibrillation in the non-cardiothoracic surgery ICU population are scarce.

Defined risks include: use of catecholamines and positive inotropic drugs, high severity of disease index scores, sepsis, cardiovascular disease, electrolyte disturbances, advanced age, elevated markers of inflammation, hypoxia, and high central venous pressures. Whether part of the patient's prior history, new in onset or recurrent, AF has been shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU. Of note, new-onset AF has been associated with increased diastolic dysfunction, vasopressor use, and a greater cumulative positive fluid balance, although similar data are not widely available for recurrent AF in the ICU.

Amiodarone is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of AF in the ICU. Two randomised controlled trials have shown amiodarone to be effective in converting AF into sinus rhythm in this setting. The efficacy of amiodarone has also been confirmed by other studies showing that it is effective at both converting AF into sinus rhythm and controlling ventricular rate, while being haemodynamically well tolerated. Many dosing regimens have been described with no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effect of variation in amiodarone use on dysrhythmia recurrence in patients with new-onset AF admitted to a non-cardiothoracic ICU.

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^113Bqf7J]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

PROARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS

Flecainide, like other antiarrhythmic agents, can cause new or worsened supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular proarrhythmic effects range from an increase in frequency of PVCs to the development of more severe ventricular tachycardia, e.g., tachycardia that is more sustained or more resistant to conversion to sinus rhythm, with potentially fatal consequences. In studies of ventricular arrhythmia patients treated with flecainide, three-fourths of proarrhythmic events were new or worsened ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the remainder being increased frequency of PVCs or new supraventricular arrhythmias. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. In studies of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmia (108 with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 117 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation), there were 9 (4%) proarrhythmic events, 8 of them in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Of the 9, 7 (including the one in a PSVT patient) were exacerbations of supraventricular arrhythmias (longer duration, more rapid rate, harder to reverse) while 2 were ventricular arrhythmias, including one fatal case of VT/VF and one wide complex VT (the patient showed inducible VT, however, after withdrawal of flecainide), both in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and known coronary artery disease.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of the timing of mortality. These did not reveal any statistically significant differences in mortality rates between the various time periods, as indicated by the 90-day mortality rate (Supplement Fig. 2), hospital mortality rate (Supplement Fig. 2), or pooled mortality rate (Supplement Fig. 2), which represents the longest period for which mortality data were available. The overall bias was judged as moderate-to-high as all studies were performed in an open-label fashion (Fig. 4). No evidence of significant publication bias (Supplement Fig. 3) was observed.

### Propafenone hydrochloride (propafenone) [^112m3x8c]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The symptoms of overdosage may include hypotension, somnolence, bradycardia, intra-atrial and intraventricular conduction disturbances, and rarely convulsions and high grade ventricular arrhythmias. Defibrillation as well as infusion of dopamine and isoproterenol have been effective in controlling abnormal ventricular rhythm and blood pressure. Convulsions have been alleviated with intravenous diazepam. General supportive measures such as mechanical respira­tory assistance and external cardiac massage may be necessary.

The hemodialysis of propafenone in patients with an overdose is expected to be of limited value in the removal of propafenone as a result of both its high protein binding (> 95%) and large volume of distribution.

### Propafenone hydrochloride (propafenone) [^111R3tBb]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Effects on Pacemaker Threshold:

Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of artificial pacemakers. Pacemakers should be monitored and programmed accordingly during therapy.

Hematologic Disturbances:

Agranulocytosis (fever, chills, weakness, and neutropenia) has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first two months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever and/or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial three months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Patients should be instructed to report promptly the development of any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills.

### Does atrial fibrillation deteriorate the prognosis in patients with septic or cardiogenic shock? [^114Cc9uT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risk of mortality in various clinical conditions. However, the prognostic role of preexisting and new-onset AF in critically ill patients, such as patients with septic or cardiogenic shock remains unclear. This study investigates the prognostic impact of preexisting and new-onset AF on 30-day all-cause mortality in patients with septic or cardiogenic shock. Consecutive patients with sepsis, or septic or cardiogenic shock were enrolled in 2 prospective, monocentric registries from 2019 to 2021. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier, multivariable logistic, and Cox proportional regression analyses. In total, 644 patients were included (cardiogenic shock: n = 273; sepsis/septic shock: n = 361). The prevalence of AF was 41% (29% with preexisting AF, 12% with new-onset AF). Within the entire study cohort, neither preexisting AF (log-rank p = 0.542; hazard ratio [HR] 1.075, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.848 to 1.363, p = 0.551) nor new-onset AF (log-rank p = 0.782, HR = 0.957, 95% CI 0.683 to 1.340, p = 0.797) were associated with 30-day all-cause mortality compared with non-AF. In patients with AF, ventricular rates > 120 beats/min compared with ≤ 120 beats/min were shown to increase the risk of reaching the primary end point in AF patients with cardiogenic shock (log-rank p = 0.006, HR 1.886, 95% CI 1.164 to 3.057, p = 0.010). Furthermore, logistic regression analyses suggested increased age was the only predictor of new-onset AF (odds ratio 1.042, 95% CI 1.018 to 1.066, p = 0.001). In conclusion, neither the presence of preexisting AF nor the occurrence of new-onset AF was associated with the risk of 30-day all-cause mortality in consecutive patients admitted with cardiogenic shock.

### Mortality in septic patients treated with short-acting betablockers: a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116s2Utg]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart rate control in atrial fibrillation using betablockers is already a well-established therapeutic approach. Interestingly, secondary analysis concerning cardiac rhythm at randomization indicated no significant effect on mortality, which may indicate a different response in patients with both sepsis and atrial fibrillation. However, this subgroup analysis is limited by the small sample size as well as considerable heterogeneity. The latest randomized controlled trials provided relatively homogenous inclusion criteria and study protocols, starting betablocker therapy after initial fluid resuscitation and titrating the drug to a target HR between 80 and 94 bpm. Interestingly, at least two of the Esmolol studies used levosimendan or milrinone. Hence, one may hypothesize that concomitant use of inotropes may be beneficial. Unfortunately, further data on this issue is lacking. While some trials delivered promising results while treating patients with esmolol, the largest multi-centered trials did not report a significant mortality reduction in the treated populations using landiolol. This is further supported by the results of our primary analysis. Based on these observations, two possible hypotheses could be postulated. First, esmolol may be more beneficial than landiolol, although the pharmacological properties of landiolol demonstrate superior selectivity, potency, and additional beneficial pharmacokinetic effects when compared to esmolol. However, one could hypothesize that less beta 1 -selectivity could also be beneficial. Notably, 25.4% of the patients treated with landiolol in the LANDI-SEP study presented serious drug-related adverse events, including hypotension and bradycardia. Secondly, the discrepancy between the results could be a problem of correct patient identification. Monitoring stroke volume would indicate any significant benefit or compromise from heart rate reduction as the tachycardia may be due either to sympathetic stimulation or compensatory to a sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy impaired cardiac function. The use of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in this population is currently under investigation in the ongoing HyperBetashock trial (NCT04748796) although LVEF has its own limitations due to reduced afterload attributed to the distributive shock in sepsis. One might suggest that other echocardiography measurements of diastolic dysfunction, such as septal relaxation e' or speckle tracking, which remain afterload-independent, may be superior. Of the seven studies included in our meta-analysis, only three provided data on echocardiography. Of these, only Wang J. et al. used additional diagnostic methods. Using the proper tools to assess cardiac dysfunction may play a pivotal role in selecting patients who may benefit from beta 1 -blockade. Based on current data, however, these hypotheses remain purely speculative but are worth exploring in future investigations. Furthermore, the potential correlation between the efficacy of heart rate reduction and catecholamine usage or mortality remains a topic of particular interest. However, due to the incomplete availability of individual data, this could not be addressed in the present analysis.

Intravenous diltiazem or verapamil can be effective for acute treatment in patients with hemodynamically stable SVT and have been shown to terminate SVT in 64% to 98% of patients; a slow infusion of either drug up to 20 minutes may lessen the potential for hypotension, and these drugs should be used only in hemodynamically stable patients, not in tachycardia due to VT or pre-excited AF and not in suspected acute heart failure. Intravenous beta blockers are reasonable for acute treatment in patients with hemodynamically stable SVT (Class IIa, C-LD).

### Successful conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation by sequential administration of up to three antiarrhythmic drugs [^111LGo4y]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Short-term conversion attempt of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) in the emergency room fails too often. Many patients and doctors still prefer pharmacological to electrical solutions in such cases.

Hypothesis

Sequential administration of up to 3 antiarrhythmic drugs of different classes of action (amiodarone, propafenone, and quinidine) may achieve conversion in such patients.

Method

One hundred and forty consecutive patients with recent-onset AF were transferred to the intensive cardiac care unit after a failed 2-h conversion attempt in the emergency room. First-line drug for conversion was continued up to a full dose, and was chosen by AF etiology, or in recurrent AF episodes, empirically. In nonresponders, the failed drug was replaced by a drug of another class, and if the second-line drug failed it was replaced by a drug of the third-line. Electrical cardioversion was the final solution for nonresponders.

Results

Sixty percent of patients reached sinus rhythm by the first-line drug therapy, 34% by the second-line, and 4% by the third-line. Seventy-five percent of patients achieved conversion within 26 h, and 95% of patients achieved conversion within 40 h. Three patients were electrically cardioverted due to hemodynamical instability. Two episodes of Torsade de Pointes ventricular tachycardia were self-terminated.

Conclusion

Sequential usage of up to 3 antiarrhythmic drugs of different classes of action provides almost complete success in conversion of recent-onset AF in patients refractory to short-term conversion attempt in the emergency room.

### How to enhance acute outcome of electrical cardioversion by drug therapy: importance of immediate reinitiation of atrial fibrillation [^111HiwPB]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Introduction

In almost 20% of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), electrical cardioversion is unsuccessful because of shock failure (i.e., no single sinus beat) or immediate reinitiation of AF (IRAF; recurrence within 2 min). Relative prevalence of shock failure and IRAF are not well known because data on outcome of electrical cardioversion therapy mostly do not distinguish shock failure from IRAF.

Methods and Results

In this review, the role of pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs on prevention of shock failure and total outcome of the cardioversion procedure are investigated. Quinidine and propafenone seem to be effective in preventing IRAF. Verapamil given in addition to Class I or III drugs may strengthen the preventive effects of these drugs than if they were given alone. Ibutilide prevents shock failure, although neither ibutilide nor dofetilide seems to be effective in preventing IRAF.

Conclusion

Pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs may enhance cardioversion outcome predominantly by preventing IRAF. Different antiarrhythmic drugs within the same Vaughan-Williams class have different effects on shock failure and IRAF.

### Incidence and prognostic impact of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with septic shock: a prospective observational study [^117MH2zJ]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of new-onset atrial fibrillation

In all patients admitted to the ICU, a continuous three-lead electrocardiogram was registered. In case of sudden increase in heart rate (> 110 beats/min) or loss of interval between one R wave and the next R wave (RR-interval) regularity, a 12-lead electrocardiogram was derived. The diagnosis of AF was then made if irregular ventricular activity and chaotic atrial activity with no apparent P waves were present.

Treatment of new-onset atrial fibrillation

All patients with new-onset AF received treatment to re-establish SR consisting of either electrical cardioversion or medical therapy (amiodarone, ß-blockers, digitalis glycosides), or a combination of these approaches. Treatment of new-onset AF was not performed according to a fixed protocol, but according to the decision of the responsible intensivist. Type of AF therapy and success of the therapy with respect to restoration of SR were recorded in all patients.

Diagnosis of septic shock

The diagnosis of septic shock was based on the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference. The presence of the following criteria were required for the diagnosis of septic shock: (i) systemic inflammatory response syndrome; (ii) evidence of infection; (iii) organ dysfunction; (iiii) circulatory failure requiring vasopressor therapy with norepinephrine for (> 0.1 μg/kg/min) more than five hours to maintain mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg despite adequate volume substitution.

Statistical analysis

For continuous variables, the median and range are reported, whereas for categorical variables, the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentage are given. The characteristics of different groups were compared using the exact Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and Fisher's-exact test for categorical variables. Changes of CRP plasma levels, number of leucocytes and maximum daily temperature over time were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and, if significant, Dunnett's method was used to compare the variables with the baseline value (value observed three days before onset of AF).

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to create the survival curves for septic shock patients with new-onset AF and for septic shock patients with maintained SR. The survival curves were compared using the log-rank test.

For all analyses, a P -value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure arrhythmia management — supraventricular rhythm control — notes that given its relatively rapid onset of action and superior safety profile in HF, intravenous amiodarone for life-threatening arrhythmias during acute HF has gained widespread acceptance, and in acutely ill HF, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter may impose hemodynamic decompensation requiring aggressive therapy; poorly tolerated SVT may be better treated acutely by synchronous cardioversion at relatively low energies (e.g., 50 to 100 J biphasic), verapamil may be effective for recurrent AV node–dependent SVTs but care should be taken due to negative inotropic effects, and intravenous amiodarone may be more effective at rate control of AF or atrial flutter and may restore sinus rhythm; in HF, amiodarone alone or with electrical cardioversion is effective at slowing the heart rate and achieving cardioversion, and for unstable arrhythmia cardioversion is appropriate with amiodarone preferred for longer-term administration and generally well tolerated hemodynamically.

2 Methods

The design of the J-Land 3S study is published in full elsewhere, together with its study protocol. This study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice, and was approved by the ethical review boards at all participating sites. This study was registered on the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center - Clinical Trials Information database (JapicCTI-173767).

2.1 Patients

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in more detail in our previous report. Patients (≥ 20 years old) hospitalised at one of 54 hospitals in Japan who developed sepsis according to the Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2016 (J-SSCG 2016)and the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)were eligible if their HR was maintained at ≥ 100 beats/min for ≥ 10 min without a change in catecholamine dose and was accompanied by a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and/or sinus tachycardia. Only patients whose symptoms and signs could be confirmed within 24 h before randomisation and within 72 h after entering an intensive care unit could be registered. The attending physicians were required to stabilise the patient's hemodynamic status before randomisation. Written, informed consent was obtained from the patient or next of kin. Patients who subsequently developed a tachyarrhythmia and met the eligibility criteria were registered and eligible for randomisation.

2.2 Study design

Following enrolment, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either conventional sepsis therapy alone (control group) or conventional sepsis therapy plus landiolol (landiolol group). Randomisation was stratified by HR at the time of randomisation (≥ 100 to < 120 beats/min or ≥ 120 beats/min) and age (< 70 years or ≥ 70 years). Patients in both groups were to be treated in accordance with the J-SSCG 2016 recommendations, including respiratory and fluid resuscitation, antimicrobials, and catecholamines, as deemed necessary. Prohibited and approved concomitant drugs are listed in the prior report.

Supraventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation — transient AF concept and updated long-term risks — A prior position paper stated that atrial fibrillation (AF) may be related to acute causes and may not recur and applied the term 'transient' AF to diverse precipitants; however, subsequent data indicate these statements need revision. New-onset AF maintains prognostic significance after ICU discharge, patients with AF-precipitating factors have a consistent risk of long-term recurrences even if transient factors resolve, the recurrence risk does not differ between those with and without precipitating factors, and the risks of stroke and heart failure are elevated. Reported mortality after new-onset AF during acute illness at 30–60 days ranges from 15.8% to 72%. Other organized supraventricular arrhythmias (SVT) in critical illness are less common than AF, often lead to haemodynamic imbalance, and may require DC cardioversion.

### Incidence and prognostic impact of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with septic shock: a prospective observational study [^112ax682]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrhythmias are well-known complications in postoperative and critically ill patients. In the past, the main concern has been focused on arrhythmias after cardiac and noncardiac thoracic surgery. Following coronary artery bypass grafting, the reported incidence of atrial arrhythmias range from 10 to 65%. Following noncardiac thoracic surgery, the incidence of atrial arrhythmias range from 9 to 29% and was associated with a higher ICU admission rate, longer hospital stay and greater 30-day mortality.

In recent years increasing attention has been devoted to atrial arrhythmias after noncardiac, nonthoracic surgery. Brathwaite and colleagues pointed out a high incidence (10%) of new-onset atrial arrhythmias in patients undergoing major non-cardiothoracic surgery. Seguin and colleagues focused on new-onset atrial fibrillation and observed an incidence of 5% on a noncardiac surgical ICU. Both working groups demonstrated that new-onset atrial arrhythmias in this patient group are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In agreement with former studies, Seguin and colleagues identified sepsis and septic shock as a risk factor for the development of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF).

Interestingly, apart from the results presented by Seguin and colleagues, who included a subgroup of 23 patients with septic shock, no further prospectively acquired data about the incidence and prognostic impact of new-onset AF in patients with septic shock are available.

Therefore, the main purpose of the present study was to assess the incidence of new-onset AF in patients with septic shock, admitted on a noncardiac surgical ICU, and to evaluate its prognostic impact with respect to mortality and length of ICU stay.

Further, there is increasing suspicion that inflammation per se is a main trigger for the development and maintenance of AF. Therefore, we analyzed inflammation parameters before and after occurrence of new-onset AF.

Finally, no data regarding the treatment of new-onset AF in critically ill patients are available to date. Thus, we describe the success rate to restore sinus rhythm (SR) using antiarrhythmic drugs and electrical cardioversion in this patient group.

PROARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS

Flecainide acetate, like other antiarrhythmic agents, can cause new or worsened supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular proarrhythmic effects range from an increase in frequency of PVCs to the development of more severe ventricular tachycardia, e.g., tachycardia that is more sustained or more resistant to conversion to sinus rhythm, with potentially fatal consequences. In studies of ventricular arrhythmia patients treated with flecainide acetate, three-fourths of proarrhythmic events were new or worsened ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the remainder being increased frequency of PVCs or new supraventricular arrhythmias. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. In studies of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmia (108 with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 117 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation), there were 9 (4%) proarrhythmic events, 8 of them in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Of the 9, 7 (including the one in a PSVT patient) were exacerbations of supraventricular arrhythmias (longer duration, more rapid rate, harder to reverse) while 2 were ventricular arrhythmias, including one fatal case of VT/VF and one wide complex VT (the patient showed inducible VT, however, after withdrawal of flecainide), both in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and known coronary artery disease.
