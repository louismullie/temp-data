## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which empiric antibiotic regimen to start for a post–cardiac arrest ICU patient who, three days later, has fever, leukocytosis, and a new left-sided consolidation on chest radiograph. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether this represents hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Then, I should verify risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens and whether the patient is in septic shock. Next, I will review guideline-concordant empiric coverage requirements, including MRSA, Pseudomonas, and other gram-negatives. After that, I need to check each proposed regimen against those requirements and identify any gaps or redundancies. Finally, I will consider dosing, duration, de-escalation, and what to do if the patient is already receiving prophylactic antibiotics post-arrest, before stating the best option and why the others are suboptimal.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its implications. Fever, leukocytosis, and a new consolidation three days after ICU admission following cardiac arrest strongly suggest hospital-acquired pneumonia, and if the patient is mechanically ventilated, this meets criteria for ventilator-associated pneumonia; importantly, post–cardiac arrest patients have a high incidence of early pneumonia, often related to aspiration and ventilator-related complications, which supports a low threshold for empiric therapy when clinical and radiographic criteria align [^1156pEGh] [^1111FC82].

> Wait, let me verify the severity and MDR risk before choosing antibiotics. I initially thought "early-onset" might imply low MDR risk, but hold on, I should not jump to conclusions; in VAP/HAP, risk for resistant pathogens is driven by patient-specific factors and local epidemiology rather than timing alone, and patients with septic shock or high mortality risk warrant broader empiric coverage, including two antipseudomonal agents and MRSA coverage, whereas those without shock or high-risk features may receive single antipseudomonal therapy plus MRSA if risk factors exist [^113Kktz9] [^114KScDn] [^111CaxNu].

> I need to ensure the empiric regimen covers the right pathogens. Guidelines consistently recommend empiric coverage for S. aureus (including MRSA when risk factors are present), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli, with dual antipseudomonal therapy reserved for patients with septic shock, high risk of mortality, prior IV antibiotics within 90 days, or settings with high resistance prevalence; vancomycin or linezolid are appropriate MRSA choices when indicated, and aminoglycosides should not be used as sole antipseudomonal therapy [^11411vru] [^114KScDn] [^111nQ6HH].

> Now, I will examine Option A, vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin. Vancomycin covers MRSA, which is appropriate if MRSA risk is present, but ciprofloxacin monotherapy for Pseudomonas is inadequate because of resistance risk and suboptimal lung penetration; guidelines advise against fluoroquinolone monotherapy for Pseudomonas and recommend combining two agents when risk is high, so this regimen under-covers gram-negatives and is not aligned with best practice in a high-risk ICU patient [^114KScDn].

> Next, I should review Option C, meropenem, linezolid, and levofloxacin. Meropenem provides excellent broad gram-negative coverage, including Pseudomonas, and is appropriate as a single antipseudomonal backbone when combined with MRSA coverage; linezolid is an appropriate MRSA agent; levofloxacin adds antipseudomonal activity and can be justified as dual coverage in high-risk patients, though I should confirm that dual antipseudomonal therapy is truly indicated here; given the post–cardiac arrest context, mechanical ventilation, and ICU setting, dual antipseudomonal coverage plus MRSA is reasonable, and this regimen meets those criteria without redundancy or major gaps [^11411vru] [^114KScDn] [^111nQ6HH].

> Hold on, I should verify Option D, ertapenem, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin. Ertapenem lacks reliable Pseudomonas activity, so it is not appropriate for empiric HAP/VAP coverage when Pseudomonas is a concern; ceftriaxone does not cover Pseudomonas either; clindamycin offers no gram-negative coverage and is inappropriate for empiric pneumonia therapy in this context; thus, this combination fails to cover key pathogens and should not be selected [^11411vru] [^114KScDn].

> Let me consider dosing and pharmacokinetics briefly, even though the question focuses on agent selection. In critically ill patients, I should ensure adequate dosing of beta-lactams, often favoring extended or continuous infusion to optimize pharmacodynamics, and adjust for renal function; for example, meropenem is commonly dosed 2 g IV every 8 hours in severe infections, with consideration of extended infusion in septic shock, while vancomycin or linezolid dosing should follow local protocols and renal function, and levofloxacin, if used, should be dosed per renal function and local resistance patterns [^notfound].

> I should double-check duration and de-escalation plans. Standard duration for HAP/VAP is 7 days, with shorter courses acceptable if the patient improves clinically and there are no complications; obtaining lower respiratory tract cultures before antibiotics allows de-escalation at 48–72 hours based on sensitivities, which reduces resistance and toxicity; I need to ensure cultures are sent before starting therapy in this scenario [^116jHgUu] [^112j9FAN] [^113JD73m].

> But wait, what if the patient already received prophylactic antibiotics after cardiac arrest. A short 2-day course of amoxicillin–clavulanate reduces early VAP in post-arrest patients managed with targeted temperature management, yet it does not obviate the need to treat a new, confirmed pneumonia; if new fever and consolidation appear, I should treat as HAP/VAP with guideline-concordant empiric therapy and not assume prior prophylaxis provides ongoing protection [^116BjwoS] [^1156pEGh].

> Putting this together, Option C is the best choice because it provides reliable antipseudomonal coverage with meropenem, appropriate MRSA coverage with linezolid, and adds levofloxacin for dual antipseudomonal therapy in a high-risk ICU patient with new consolidation; Options A and D are suboptimal due to inadequate gram-negative coverage or inappropriate agents, and I should obtain cultures promptly and plan for de-escalation at 48–72 hours based on results and clinical response [^11411vru] [^114KScDn] [^113JD73m].

---

The correct answer is **C. Meropenem, linezolid, and levofloxacin**. This regimen provides broad-spectrum coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in a post–cardiac arrest ICU patient, including MRSA, Pseudomonas, and other multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms. Options A and D are inadequate because they lack reliable MRSA or antipseudomonal coverage, respectively. Start antibiotics promptly, obtain cultures, and de-escalate based on results [^11411vru] [^114KScDn] [^113JD73m].

## Pathophysiology and risk factors for pneumonia after cardiac arrest

Patients recovering from cardiac arrest are at **high risk for early-onset pneumonia** due to aspiration, impaired host defenses, and mechanical ventilation [^1156pEGh]. Aspiration during arrest or intubation introduces oral and gastric flora into the lower respiratory tract, while ischemia–reperfusion injury and therapeutic hypothermia blunt immune responses, increasing susceptibility to infection [^1156pEGh]. Mechanical ventilation further elevates the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is common in this population [^1156pEGh].

## Clinical guidelines for empiric antibiotic therapy in HAP/VAP

Empiric antibiotic selection for HAP/VAP should be guided by **local antibiograms**, patient-specific risk factors, and severity of illness [^11411vru]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommend empiric coverage for the following pathogens:

- **Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)**: Recommended for patients with risk factors for MRSA or in settings with high MRSA prevalence [^111nQ6HH].
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli**: Essential for all patients with HAP/VAP, particularly in ICU settings [^114KScDn].
- **Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms**: Consider in patients with recent antibiotic exposure or healthcare exposure [^115wTfTW].

---

## Analysis of antibiotic options

| **Option** | **Antibiotics included** | **Coverage analysis** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin | - Vancomycin covers MRSA <br/> - Ciprofloxacin covers some gram-negatives, including Pseudomonas | - Ciprofloxacin resistance among Pseudomonas is rising <br/> - No coverage for ESBL producers <br/> - Inadequate for severe HAP/VAP |
| C | Meropenem, linezolid, and levofloxacin | - Meropenem covers gram-negatives, including Pseudomonas and ESBL producers <br/> - Linezolid covers MRSA <br/> - Levofloxacin adds gram-negative and atypical coverage | - Potential for drug interactions and side effects <br/> - Requires monitoring for adverse effects |
| D | Ertapenem, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin | - Ertapenem covers some gram-negatives but not Pseudomonas <br/> - Ceftriaxone covers some gram-negatives but not Pseudomonas <br/> - Clindamycin covers anaerobes and some gram-positives | - Inadequate Pseudomonas coverage <br/> - No MRSA coverage <br/> - Inappropriate for severe HAP/VAP |

---

Option C is the **most appropriate** because it provides comprehensive coverage for MRSA, Pseudomonas, ESBL producers, and atypical pathogens, aligning with current guidelines for severe HAP/VAP in ICU patients [^11411vru] [^114KScDn].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting option C

Recent studies and guidelines support **broad-spectrum empiric therapy** for severe HAP/VAP, particularly in ICU patients with risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms. Combination therapy with a beta-lactam (meropenem), a glycopeptide (linezolid), and a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) is recommended to ensure adequate initial coverage and improve outcomes [^11411vru] [^114KScDn].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Obtain cultures**: Before initiating antibiotics, obtain respiratory cultures (endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage) to guide de-escalation [^1111FC82].
- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Meropenem and levofloxacin can cause gastrointestinal upset, CNS effects, and hematologic abnormalities; linezolid carries risks of myelosuppression and serotonin syndrome.
- **De-escalation**: Adjust therapy based on culture results and clinical response to minimize antibiotic resistance and toxicity [^113JD73m].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The correct answer is **C. Meropenem, linezolid, and levofloxacin**. This regimen provides broad-spectrum coverage for severe HAP/VAP in a post–cardiac arrest ICU patient, including MRSA, Pseudomonas, ESBL producers, and atypical pathogens. Options A and D are inadequate due to gaps in MRSA or antipseudomonal coverage. Start antibiotics promptly, obtain cultures, and de-escalate based on results.

### Early pneumonia and timing of antibiotic therapy in patients after nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112excyE]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

In all patients diagnosed to have a confirmed pneumonia within 7 days, we evaluated which of the three required criteria (clinical suspicion, presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray scan, and bacteriological finding considered to cause pneumonia; see Methods) was the last to become positive. The last criterion becoming positive was a bacteriological finding in 31 of 39 patients (79.5%), an infiltrate on chest X-ray scan in 4 of 39 patients (10.3%), and clinical suspicion in 0 of 39 patients (0%). In four patients (10.3%) an infiltrate on chest X-ray scan and a bacteriological finding considered to cause pneumonia were found on the same day. Of note, in none of the four patients in which a positive chest X-ray image was the last criterion becoming positive was a chest X-ray scan performed the day before. This may indicate a potential delay in diagnosis for those patients, caused by the fact that chest radiography was not performed daily in our ICU. There was no difference regarding the incidence of confirmed pneumonia between survivors and nonsurvivors (37.8% vs. 23.1%, p = 0.125). Similarly, confirmed or probable pneumonia was found as often in survivors as in nonsurvivors (60.5% vs. 51.7%, p = 0.333). Patients with confirmed pneumonia had a longer ICU stay (14.0 (8.5–20.0) vs. 8.0 (5.0–14.0) days, p < 0.001) and hospital stay (23.0 (11.5–29.0) vs. 15.0 (6.5–25.0) days, p = 0.016) compared with patients without pneumonia, while there was no difference regarding the time to extubation (6.5 (3.6–9.4) vs. 4.5 (3.5–8.4) days, p = 0.204) (Fig. 2). The rate of tracheotomy was higher in patients with confirmed pneumonia compared with patients without pneumonia (28.2 vs. 12.6%, p = 0.026).

Advanced life support — post–cardiac arrest care considerations clarify scope and context: The recommendation does not cover situations where antibiotics are used for confirmed or suspected infections; both included RCTs enrolled only out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who were treated with targeted temperature management (32° C to 35° C [89.6° F to 95° F]); pneumonia occurs in about 50% of intensive care unit patients after cardiac arrest but is unlikely to contribute to mortality, and the incidence would mean using prophylactic antibiotics in large numbers of patients without specific benefit.

Definitions and standard care on our ICU

All original chest radiographies performed within the first 7 days of hospitalization were analyzed by a single experienced radiologist (MF) for new or progressive infiltrates. This radiologist was blinded to all clinical data (e.g. microbiological findings) and only interpreted the original chest X-ray images in batches. Chest radiographies were classified into one of four categories — new or progressive infiltrates were: (category 1) definitely present, (category 2) probably present, (category 3) unlikely, or (category 4) excluded. According to published criteria of the International Sepsis Forum Consensus Conference we distinguished between confirmed pneumonia and probable pneumonia. Confirmed pneumonia was diagnosed when new radiographic infiltrates on chest radiography were present (category 1) in combination with clinical suspicion and the isolation of a pulmonary pathogen from a lower respiratory tract sample. Bacteriological findings considered to cause pneumonia are summarized in Additional file 1. For microbiological confirmation, semiquantitative Gram staining was performed on each specimen. Semiquantitative cultures were processed according to standard culture procedures. The microbiological investigation was defined positive if in the Gram staining two or more (oil immersion (×1000) per field) bacteria were found and the culture was positive. We excluded Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and Streptococcus agalactiae to be a causative agent for pneumonia. Clinical suspicion was assumed when at least one of the following criteria was present: purulent sputum; auscultation findings suspicious for pneumonia; or hypoxemia (Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO₂)/Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) < 240). Probable pneumonia was diagnosed without a microbiological confirmation in the presence of a new or progressive infiltrate on chest radiography (category 1) when pneumonia was clinically present (defined as purulent sputum plus at least one of the criteria of suspicious auscultation findings or hypoxemia). We also diagnosed a probable pneumonia when pneumonia was clinically present (see earlier), a suspicious pulmonary pathogen from a lower respiratory tract sample could be isolated (see earlier), and chest radiography revealed a probable infiltrate (category 2). Early pneumonia was defined as confirmed pneumonia or probable pneumonia within 7 days.

Treatment of OHCA patients admitted to our ICU is strictly standardized. Treatment goals and procedures and further definitions are provided in Additional file 2.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE MANAGEMENT IN THE ICU

In patients who are successfully resuscitated from CA, early lower respiratory tract infections are common and may affect up to 60% of patients. These infections may occur because of initial aspiration during or after CA or because of complications of mechanical ventilation. Diagnosing infections among CA survivors is challenging because of the development of a systemic inflammatory response after ischemia and reperfusion, with the risk of overexposure of these patients to unnecessary antibiotic administration and subsequent risk of drug-resistant organisms. Whether early infectious complications may also affect patient outcome remains controversial.

Early prophylactic antibiotics have been considered a reasonable therapeutic intervention in CA survivors to reduce the risk of early infections. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis identified 3 RCTs and 8 observational studies investigating the role of early antibiotic administration on the outcomes of patients after CA. No benefits on survival, neurological outcome, duration of mechanical ventilation, or length of hospital stay were observed in patients treated with early antibiotics compared with others. In addition, the incidence of pneumonia was not significantly reduced by the early antibiotic prophylaxis. More recently, a large randomized trial conducted in France randomized out-of-hospital CA survivors with an initial shockable rhythm and treated with temperature control at 32° C to 34° C to receive either intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (1 g/200 mg every 8 hours) or placebo for 48 hours after admission. The incidence of early pneumonia was lower with antibiotic prophylaxis than with placebo; however, no differences in late pneumonia, ventilator-free days, ICU length of stay, or 28-day mortality were observed between groups. These results suggest that a strategy of early and short (ie, 2 days) prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the occurrence of early pneumonia in CA survivors; these benefits are balanced with the concerns for antimicrobial resistance when prophylactic antimicrobials are prescribed in this setting.

### Early pneumonia and timing of antibiotic therapy in patients after nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^115ec6pT]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

While early pneumonia is common in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), little is known about the impact of pneumonia and the optimal timing of antibiotic therapy after OHCA.

Methods

We conducted a 5-year retrospective cohort study, including patients who suffered from OHCA and were treated with therapeutic hypothermia. ICU treatment was strictly standardized with defined treatment goals and procedures. Medical records, chest radiographic images and microbiological findings were reviewed.

Results

Within the study period, 442 patients were admitted to our medical ICU after successfully resuscitated cardiac arrest. Of those, 174 patients fulfilled all inclusion and no exclusion criteria and were included into final analysis. Pneumonia within the first week could be confirmed in 39 patients (22.4%) and was confirmed or probable in 100 patients (57.5%), without a difference between survivors and non-survivors (37.8% vs. 23.1% confirmed pneumonia, p = 0.125). In patients with confirmed pneumonia a tracheotomy was performed more frequently (28.2 vs. 12.6%, p = 0.026) compared to patients without confirmed pneumonia. Importantly, patients with confirmed pneumonia had a longer ICU- (14.0 [8.5–20.0] vs. 8.0 [5.0–14.0] days, p < 0.001) and hospital stay (23.0 [11.5–29.0] vs. 15.0 [6.5–25.0] days, p = 0.016). A positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≥ 10.5 mbar on day 1 of the hospital stay was identified as early predictor of confirmed pneumonia (odds ratio 2.898, p = 0.006). No other reliable predictor could be identified. Median time to antibiotic therapy was 8.7 [5.4–22.8] hours, without a difference between patients with or without confirmed pneumonia (p = 0.381) and without a difference between survivors and non-survivors (p = 0.264). Patients receiving antibiotics within 12 hours after admission had a shorter ICU- (8.0 [4.0–14.0] vs. 10.5 [6.0–16.0] vs. 13.5 [8.0–20.0] days, p = 0.004) and hospital-stay (14.0 [6.0–25.0] vs. 16.5 [11.0–27.0] vs. 21.0 [17.0–28.0] days, p = 0.007) compared to patients receiving antibiotics after 12 to 36 or more than 36 hours, respectively.

Conclusions

Early pneumonia may extend length of ICU- and hospital-stay after OHCA and its occurrence is difficult to predict. A delayed initiation of antibiotic therapy in OHCA patients may increase the duration of the ICU- and hospital-stay.

### Prevention of early ventilator-associated pneumonia after cardiac arrest [^116BjwoS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients who are treated with targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm are at increased risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The benefit of preventive short-term antibiotic therapy has not been shown.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving adult patients (> 18 years of age) in intensive care units (ICUs) who were being mechanically ventilated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to initial shockable rhythm and treated with targeted temperature management at 32 to 34°C. Patients with ongoing antibiotic therapy, chronic colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria, or moribund status were excluded. Either intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (at doses of 1 g and 200 mg, respectively) or placebo was administered three times a day for 2 days, starting less than 6 hours after the cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was early ventilator-associated pneumonia (during the first 7 days of hospitalization). An independent adjudication committee determined diagnoses of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Results

A total of 198 patients underwent randomization, and 194 were included in the analysis. After adjudication, 60 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia were confirmed, including 51 of early ventilator-associated pneumonia. The incidence of early ventilator-associated pneumonia was lower with antibiotic prophylaxis than with placebo (19 patients [19%] vs. 32 [34%]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.92; P = 0.03). No significant differences between the antibiotic group and the control group were observed with respect to the incidence of late ventilator-associated pneumonia (4% and 5%, respectively), the number of ventilator-free days (21 days and 19 days), ICU length of stay (5 days and 8 days if patients were discharged and 7 days and 7 days if patients had died), and mortality at day 28 (41% and 37%). At day 7, no increase in resistant bacteria was identified. Serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

A 2-day course of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate in patients receiving a 32-to-34°C targeted temperature management strategy after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm resulted in a lower incidence of early ventilator-associated pneumonia than placebo. No significant between-group differences were observed for other key clinical variables, such as ventilator-free days and mortality at day 28.

### Prophylactic antibiotic use following cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111baJGx]. Resuscitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of prophylactic/ early antibiotics (intervention group) compared with clinically driven/ delayed antibiotics (control group) on patient and infectious outcomes in adult cardiac arrest patients admitted to hospital.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1946-current), EMBASE (1947-current) and the Cochrane library (inception-current) on 8th May 2018. Additional citations were identified through forward and backward citation tracking.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-texts. We included observational and interventional primary research studies with a concurrent or retrospective control group that were relevant to our study objective.

Data Extraction

We extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for randomised controlled trials or the GRADE tool for risk of bias in observational studies. Overall evidence quality for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE system.

Data Synthesis

Databases searches and citation tracking identified 6825 citations, of which ten citations containing 11 studies (3 randomised controlled trials, 8 observational studies) were eligible for inclusion. Data were summarised in meta-analyses using random-effect models. The intervention was not associated with increased survival (odds ratio 1.16, 95% CI 0.97–1.40), survival with good neurological outcome (odds ratio 2.25, 95% CI 0.93–5.45), critical care length of stay (mean difference -0.6, 95% CI -3.6 to 2.4) or incidence of pneumonia (odds ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.23–1.46). Findings were generally consistent between observational studies and randomised controlled trials.

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis following cardiac arrest is not associated with a change in key clinical outcomes. Further high-quality trials may be needed to address this important clinical question. Review registration: PROSPERO CRD42016039358.

Predictors of pneumonia

Numerous variables available within 3 days after hospital admission (Table 2 and Additional file 3) were dichotomized according to pneumonia diagnosis. Patients with confirmed pneumonia and patients with confirmed or probable pneumonia had higher levels of the maximum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on day 1 compared with patients without pneumonia. Maximal PEEP correlated negatively with the minimal PO₂/FiO₂ value of the same day (day 1, r = −0.614; day 2, r = −0.629; day 3, r = −0.650; p < 0.001 for all). ROC analysis for the PEEP level on day 1 with regard to the occurrence of confirmed pneumonia and sensitivity and specificity analysis are presented in Additional file 4. Overall, 73.0% of patients had a maximum PEEP value on day 1 below 10.5 mbar which was identified as optimal cutoff. Maximum PEEP values ≥ 10.5 mbar on day 1 were associated with an increased risk for the occurrence of confirmed pneumonia in univariate logistic regression analysis (OR 2.621 (95% CI 1.370–5.014), p = 0.004).

Introduction: Patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrests with shockable rhythm are at high risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [1]. Despite retrospective trials suggesting a benefit of short-term (48h) antibiotics in this setting [2], it is not recommended. The primary objective was to demonstrate that systematic antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce incidence of early VAP (< 7 days). The impact on incidence of late VAP and on Day 28 mortality was also assessed.

Methods: Multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trial. ICU patients > 18 years, mechanically ventilated after out-of-hospital resuscitated cardiac arrest related to initial shockable rhythm and treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia were included. Moribund patients and those requiring extracorporeal life supports, with ongoing antibiotic therapy, known chronic colonization with multiresistant bacteria or known allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics were excluded. Either IV injection of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1g/200mg) or placebo was administered 3 times a day for 2 days. All pulmonary infections were recorded and blindly confirmed by an adjudication committee.

Results: In intention to treat analysis, 196 patients were analyzed, (treatment group n = 99; mean age 60.5 ± 14.4 years, sex ratio = 4, SOFA score 8.7 ± 3.1). Global characteristics of cardiac arrest were similar (no flow = 3.5min vs 3.8min, low-flow = 21.8min vs 18.2min). 60 VAP were confirmed incl. 51 early VAP, 19 in treatment group vs 32 in placebo group (HR = 0.546; IC 95% = [0.315; 0.946]) (Fig. 1). Occurrence of late VAP (4% vs 5.1%) and Day 28 mortality (41.4% vs 37.5%) was not affected by the study procedure.

Conclusions: Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreases incidence of early VAP in patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to shockable rhythm and should be recommended.

### Early-onset pneumonia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114KXX6a]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Early-onset pneumonia (EOP) is a common complication after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Currently, EOP diagnosis is difficult because usual diagnostic tools are blunted by the features of post-cardiac arrest syndrome and therapeutic hypothermia itself. When the diagnosis of EOP is suspected, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be considered following bronchopulmonary sampling. The onset of EOP increases the length of mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit stay, but its influence on survival and neurological outcome seems marginal. Therapeutic hypothermia has been recognized as an independent risk factor for this infectious complication. All together, these observations underline the need for future prospective clinical trials to better delineate pathogens and risk factors associated with EOP. In addition, there is a need for diagnostic approaches serving the accurate diagnosis of EOP.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^115D2oHa]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers of inflammation such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein have been investigated as prognostic tools of mortality or poor neurological outcome in this setting. – However, because the reperfusion injury is characterized by an inflammatory response, C-reactive protein increases both in patients with infections and in patients without infections after CA. Similarly, procalcitonin levels did not differ between patients with and those without infections after CA. Thus, although both C-reactive protein and procalcitonin may provide additional information on post-CA infection, the information must be interpreted within the clinical context because there are insufficient data to use either one in isolation to guide therapy. In addition, despite systematic reviews suggesting that procalcitonin levels can guide antibiotic discontinuation in general critical care patients, thereby reducing both antibiotic exposure and short-term mortality, the role of such a procalcitonin-guided approach in patients after CA remains undefined.

Given the paucity of research in infectious complications in CA survivors in the ICU, more research is needed to fully understand the role of fever and inflammation in relation to infections and outcomes in this population. Additional randomized trials on the role of antibiotic prophylaxis are important, and studies may target other patient populations (ie, in-hospital arrest), other countries (ie, different bacterial ecology), and different antibiotic strategies. Further research on the role of new biomarkers to rapidly identify patients with infections and to guide discontinuation of antibiotics or prolonged antibiotic administration is warranted. This research is especially important in those treated with hypothermic temperature control, considering that their ability to respond to infections may be different.

Infectious Disease Statements

Empirical antibiotics may be used in patients who are treated with temperature management to a hypothermic target after CA to reduce the incidence of pneumonia (89.5%, 17/19).
Do not use C-reactive protein and procalcitonin to guide antibiotic initiation or duration of therapy (85%, 17/20).

Lung ultrasound (LUS) in critically ill adults with fever — LUS cannot visualize the entire lung and in mechanically ventilated patients evaluation is even more limited, and in immunocompromised individuals LUS may be insufficient to rule out pulmonary parenchymal disease and CT imaging is preferable. In experienced hands, LUS can be superior or complementary to conventional chest radiography for evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, or other thoracic processes and potentially carry a lower risk because patient transport would not be needed. It can be considered when sufficient expertise is available as a safe imaging modality in patients with fever and an abnormal chest radiograph, regardless of respiratory symptoms, whereas the role of LUS without an abnormal chest radiograph has not been studied in clinical trials and its role is unclear; in such situations, its use could be considered on case-by-case basis.

Imaging studies in critically ill adults with fever — For patients who develop a fever during intensive care unit (ICU) stay, we recommend performing a chest radiograph (best practice statement). For patients who have recently undergone thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic surgery, we recommend performing CT (in collaboration with the surgical service) as part of a fever workup if an etiology is not readily identified by the initial workup (best-practice statement). For critically ill patients with fever in whom other diagnostic tests have failed to establish an etiology, we suggest performing an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT if the risk of transport is deemed acceptable (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). The panel found insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation regarding the use of WBC scans for patients with fever without an established etiology. For critically ill patients with fever and no abdominal signs or symptoms or liver function abnormalities, and no recent abdominal surgery, we recommend against the routine use of a formal abdominal ultrasound or point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) as an initial investigation (best practice statement).

The scans showed bilateral scattered ground glass opacities consistent with mild-to-moderate infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for further monitoring on day 4 of hospitalization. Pain increased in her extremities and tense anasarca developed; however, because compartment pressures were 18 mm Hg in her right arm and 15 mm Hg in her left arm, she did not meet criteria for a diagnosis of compartment syndrome. Apart from edema and tachypnea while on 2 L nasal cannula, her cardiopulmonary examination was otherwise normal. On hospitalization day 5, she suffered a cardiac arrest; spontaneous circulation returned after 2 rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. She was intubated at the time of cardiac arrest and empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime. Because of concern for microvascular thrombi in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection, an argatroban infusion was started. Although the patient had remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable up to this point, shock rapidly developed, and she required vasopressor support with norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and stress-doses of hydrocortisone. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for oliguric renal failure.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia

Question

What is the appropriate treatment approach for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)?

Recommendation

Initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP requires consideration of patient-specific culture data, recent antibiotic exposure, the local antibiogram, and timing of when infection developed. Common regimens for hospital-acquired infections are vancomycin plus either cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam or in cases of severe penicillin allergy, aztreonam, although no specific regimen is generally superior. Empiric anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended. We recommend de-escalation of antibiotic treatment when culture data are available. Seven days of treatment is sufficient for most patients. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) nasal swab testing should be used to determine the need for empiric coverage.

Discussion

Evidence suggests mortality is lower when the initial antibiotic therapy is effective, even when switched to adequate therapy after culture data become available. Therefore, it is important to initiate appropriate antibiotics when there is strong clinical suspicion of VAP. There is no evidence of superiority of one specific empiric regimen over another and appropriateness is targeted in context of the hospital antibiogram and specific patient risk factors.

Trauma is a risk factor for staphylococcal infections, specifically traumatic head injury and road traffic injuries.MRSA nasal swab testing is useful because of its high negative predictive value for MRSA carrier status and if negative can obviate the need for MRSA coverage, as evidenced by recent data in the trauma population. Anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended due to lack of evidence of benefit and some evidence of harm. Empiric coverage is specifically tailored to S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and Gram-negative bacilli.

High-level evidence shows no benefit with treating longer than 7 days in most patients with exceptions limited to severe lung disease, severe immunosuppression, concomitant ARDS, and multidrug resistance. To de-escalate an antibiotic regimen, it is important that culture data be obtained at the time of diagnosis. Duration of therapy of 7 days and antibiotic de-escalation recommendations are consistent with the ATS/IDSA guidelines of 2016.

- Decrease the incidence of infection‚ as manifested by febrile neutropenia‚ in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti- cancer drugs associated with a significant incidence of severe neutropenia with fever.
- Reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

1. 2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy RELEUKO is indicated for reducing the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
2. 5 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia RELEUKO is indicated for chronic administration to reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of neutropenia in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia‚ cyclic neutropenia‚ or idiopathic neutropenia. Therefore, to ensure a sustained therapeutic response administer RELEUKO daily for up to 2 weeks or until the ANC has reached 10‚000/mm3 following the expected chemotherapy-induced neutrophil nadir. The duration of RELEUKO therapy needed to attenuate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may be dependent on the myelosuppressive potential of the chemotherapy regimen employed. Continue administration of RELEUKO until the ANC remains greater than 1, 000/mm3 for 3 consecutive CBCs or exceeds 10, 000/mm3 after a radiation-induced nadir. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of RELEUKO that increase the ANC beyond 10‚000/mm3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit.

In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy‚ discontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days‚ with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy During the period of administration of RELEUKO for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue RELEUKO if the leukocyte count rises to > 100, 000/mm3.

Materials and methods

In this multicenter, multi-national, observational study, patients admitted consecutively to the ICUs of 10 academic hospitals (8 in Canada and the United States and 2 in Europe) between 1 January 2003 and 20 November 2004 were screened for eligibility. The study protocol had been reviewed and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (protocol PCT-7; file number # I010023). Patients 18 years of age and older requiring mechanical ventilation with the new diagnosis of pneumonia within the last 48 hours were included. We excluded patients who were enrolled in a clinical study prior to baseline PCT sampling, had cardiogenic shock, had burns greater than 20% of total body surface, or were likely to die within 48 h, and postoperative patients following bone marrow transplant (within the last 6 months), coronary artery bypass grafts (within the last 7 days), and solid organ transplants (within the last 14 days). Patients were followed for 28 days after discharge from the ICU. The study was approved by local Institutional Review Boards/Ethics Committees of each participating institution and informed consent was obtained from the patients' next of kin.

Pneumonia was defined as the presence of new or progressive infiltrate(s), consolidation, cavitation, or pleural effusion on chest radiographs and the new onset of at least two of the following signs or symptoms: 1) cough; 2) production of purulent sputum or a change in the character of sputum; 3) auscultatory findings on pulmonary exam of crackles and/or evidence of pulmonary consolidation (dullness on percussion, bronchial breath sounds); and/or 4) the presence of acute or progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxemia. In addition, at least one of the following criteria had to be fulfilled to establish the diagnosis of pneumonia: 1) fever, defined as body temperature > 38°C (100.4°F) taken orally; > 38.5°C (101.2°F) tympanically; or > 39°C (102.2°F) rectally or via pulmonary artery (PA) catheter; and/or 2) elevated total white blood count (WBC) > 10,000/mm 3, or > 15% immature neutrophils (bands), regardless of total WBC, or leukopenia with total WBC < 4,500/mm 3. Microscopic examination of the Gram stained respiratory secretions had to show the presence of microorganisms, with ≥ 25 polymorphonuclear cells and ≤ 10 squamous epithelial cells per field at 100× magnification (low-power, 10× objective).

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was a composite of HAP and all-cause mortality 28 days after inclusion. This composite outcome was chosen to manage the statistical competition between HAP and mortality (i.e. to avoid considering early mortality without HAP as a favorable outcome).

According to European guidelines, HAP was defined as pneumonia that occurred 48 h after hospitalization and required at least two clinical signs (body temperature > 38 °C; leukocytosis > 12,000 cells per mL, leucopenia < 4000 cells per mL, or purulent pulmonary secretions) with the appearance of a new infiltrate or worsening of an existing infiltrate on chest radiography, plus semi-quantitative or quantitative positive respiratory fluid cultures. Respiratory samples were obtained before starting any new antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia. HAP were sub-categorized as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in ICU patients who have been mechanically ventilated for at least 48 h at the time of diagnosis; as ventilated-HAP, if the diagnosis was made more than 48 h after extubating, but invasive ventilation was required for the treatment, or as HAP if the diagnosis was made more than 48 h after extubating and no invasive ventilation was required for the treatment. Early- and late-onset HAP were defined as HAP occurring less than five days and five or more days after hospital admission, respectively.

Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis was defined with the criteria above, without radiographical signs of new pneumonia.

An adjudication committee composed of intensivists, blinded to the trial-group assignment and not involved in patient recruitment, reviewed all respiratory infection diagnoses. The adjudicators had access to the clinical data, serial results of biological and microbiological analyses, and chest X-rays to confirm or exclude new or persistent infiltrates (the adjudication charter provided by the sponsor is available in ESM 2). The adjudication committee members concluded HAP, tracheobronchitis, or no respiratory infections. The primary endpoint analysis was based on the final diagnosis made by two adjudication committee members who had access to clinical evaluation, bacteriological documentation, chest-X ray, and concomitant antimicrobial therapy. In case of disagreement between the two adjudication committee members, a radiology expert reviewed the chest X-rays before arbitrage by a third adjudication committee member.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric gram-negative coverage and number of anti-Pseudomonas agents: The evidence indicated that approximately 35% of HAP cases are caused by gram-negative bacilli, and the panel agreed this dictates that all empiric regimens target P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli; the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Regarding whether to use one or 2 antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa, the panel concluded that HAP patients with factors increasing the likelihood of gram-negative infection, including Pseudomonas, or increased risk for mortality should receive antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa, whereas patients without these factors should receive only one such antibiotic. A high risk for mortality was defined as requiring ventilatory support due to pneumonia and having septic shock.

### Pulmonary leucostasis syndrome presented by unilateral pulmonary infiltrates [^1177cvvV]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old woman presented with suspected acute myelogenous leukaemia with a leucocyte count of 80×10⁹/L. On admission, she had high fever and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray demonstrated unilateral consolidations of right lung suggestive for pneumonia and broad spectrum antibiotics were started. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and despite the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary leucostasis and treatment with leucapheresis the patient died within 2days after admission from progressive respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. Autopsy showed diffuse leucostasis in the pulmonary capillaries. The present case illustrates that pulmonary leucostasis may be presented by unilateral chest X-ray abnormalities and without clear neurological symptoms (headache and blurred vision). Clinicians should be aware of this since delayed treatment may increase mortality.

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 h prior to admission and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that 'it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed'. Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled-out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischaemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia/bronchitis should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 h that increases in intensity during exercise and inspiration. In addition, he has mild fever and an increasing productive cough over the last 3 days. He is haemodynamically stable and the initial physical examination reveals rales over the base of the right lung. ECG shows T-wave inversion in V3–V6, which were already noted on the ECG performed 3 years ago. A chest X-ray shows an infiltrate in the right lung suggestive of pneumonia. Your intern is about to order blood cultures (plus legionella and pneumococcus antigen in the urine) and prescribe antibiotics when the hs-cTn T level is reported from the laboratory as elevated. Your intern now asks you if the patient needs treatment for pneumonia, NSTEMI, or both.

Recently published guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are reviewed for recommendations regarding diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy to assess the implications for development of future clinical trials. Despite some differences (mostly related to likely pathogens), there is a general agreement about the recommended approach to management. All of the reviewed guidelines invariably recommend early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of excessive antimicrobials by deescalation of therapy on the basis of microbiological culture results and the clinical response of the patient. Developers of future clinical trials will need to be mindful of these recommendations to maintain best practice care for each investigator.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^114xWhbT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This manuscript brings to light an understudied, underrecognized, and underappreciated clinical challenge: the hospitalized patient with severe pneumonia who is not responding to initial treatment. Clinical studies are needed to bring more robust evidence and to hopefully identify different non-response phenotypes.

We propose a common criterion that spans from sCAP to HAP/VAP, identify the most relevant risk factors, and provide a clinical pathway to investigate these patients in a timely manner to facilitate optimizing care.

The decision-making process consists of two key-components: the comprehensive search for an accurate diagnosis and treatment modification as needed to match the revised diagnosis. The former will ensure that clinicians are not missing an important diagnosis responsible for the initial treatment failure, and the later will offer a concrete approach to make the treatment successful.

In summary, there is an urgent need for better data on the epidemiology of pneumonia non-responders and how best to optimize the therapeutic approach in order to secure the best outcomes for all patients.

An 85-year-old man was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with a 10-day history of severe breathlessness, fever and cough. The patient was known to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had been receiving corticosteroids in the preceding 18 months. He had been treated for tuberculosis 2.5 years previously. On examination he was febrile, tachycardic with a respiratory rate of 46/min. Auscultation revealed bilateral crepitation's and wheeze. Chest radiograph revealed patchy infiltrates on right lung. The patient developed respiratory depression and was mechanically ventilated. His sputum and endotracheal aspirates revealed Nocardia brasiliensis on culture which was found to be co-trimoxazole resistant. Once this became known imipenem was substituted for co-trimoxazole but unfortunately condition of the patient did not improve and he died following a cardiac arrest.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy in the critically ill [^115wEh7d]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Vincent and colleagues discussed some of the key issues related to antibiotic management in the critically ill, including problems associated with timing, duration, and dosing of antibiotics. In particular, the authors highlighted the importance of early diagnosis of infection and controversies about the use of combination or monotherapy and the duration of therapy. We agree that decisions regarding the use of antibiotics should be made on an individual basis, e.g. according to the severity of the disease and local microbiological patterns. However, some issues should be taken into account in determining an antibiotic therapy.

Vincent et al.'s review covered all infections in the critically ill but, with regard to the duration of antibiotic treatment, the authors referred to a guideline for the management of sepsis and septic shock only. Dichotomy according to nosocomial or community-acquired infection seems necessary to make better decisions. Moreover, severe nosocomial infections like sepsis due to resistant Gram-negative bacteria and mild infections like community-acquired pneumonia caused by a susceptible microorganism may need different guidelines. Non-intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia has recently been proposed as a new clinical entity, as epidemiological data seem to be different between patients acquiring hospital-acquired pneumonia in the intensive care unit versus general wards.

Among others, the consciousness state of the critically ill seems important for the initiation or discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most frequent intensive care unit-related infection in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, and comatose patients present a high risk of early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia. For comatose patients who required mechanical ventilation, antibiotic prophylaxis at intubation lowers the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. In patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, there appears to be a higher risk of recurrence following short-course therapy, i.e. a 7–8-day course.

Doctors in Western countries may say that it takes seven days to cure a common cold with medication but it will take a week to get better without it, but this advice does not apply to developing countries like China. Subsequent bacterial infections may prolong a common cold to as long as one month. The use of antibiotics varies substantially, even among developed countries. This discrepancy is particularly important for pediatric patients and the elderly with poor health. In conclusion, for antibiotic medication, general recommendations should be tempered by awareness of many local and specific factors in order to get the best effect from medicines.

### A previously healthy 18-year-old male with fever, arrhythmia, and shock [^11114JWJ]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A male individual aged 18 years with no significant past medical history presented with fever, headache, dry cough, and chest pain. On clinical examination, he had tachycardia and hypotension needing intravenous fluid resuscitation and inotropic support. A chest radiograph revealed streaky lung opacities, and he was treated with antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia complicated by septic shock. Significant elevation of cardiac enzymes was noted, and there was a continued need for inotropes to maintain normotension. He also developed intermittent bradycardia, with serial electrocardiograms showing first-degree atrioventricular block, low-voltage QRS complexes, and ST-T wave changes and telemetry demonstrating junctional and ventricular escape rhythm. A complete workup for sepsis and acute myocarditis were performed to find the etiologic agent. Intravenous immunoglobulins were started to treat myocarditis, with eventual clinical improvement. He was eventually diagnosed with an unusual etiology for his illness. He was noted to still have intermittent ventricular escape rhythm on electrocardiograms on follow-up 2 weeks after discharge but continues to remain asymptomatic and in good health.

A man in his 60s with stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung status postchemotherapy and radiation therapy presented with mixed septic and obstructive shock with multiorgan dysfunction. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and diffuse concaved ST elevation. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. CT thorax was notable for dense left lung consolidation with pleural effusion. Emergent pericardiocentesis and percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy were performed which successfully drained 500mL of purulent pericardial fluid. A left chest tube was placed and revealed a large volume of empyema. Both pericardial and pleural fluid cultures yielded similar strains of Streptococcus anginosus The patient was initially treated with empiric broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics which were eventually de-escalated to intravenous ceftriaxone based on microbiology culture and sensitivity. Unfortunately, the patient developed pulseless electrical activity arrest on day 10 of intensive care unit stay and expired despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric antipseudomonal therapy — For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend prescribing antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For those with factors increasing the likelihood for Pseudomonas or other gram-negative infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days) or a high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting that risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. All other patients with HAP who are being treated empirically may be prescribed a single antibiotic with activity against P. aeruginosa, and we recommend not using an aminoglycoside as the sole antipseudomonal agent (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks add that if a patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended, and that the 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA may be modified by individual units.

Re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis of pneumonia

Assuming local guidelines are followed, inappropriate antibiotic therapy is seldom the cause of clinical failure in CAP but is more common in HAP/VAP, since the later is associated with a higher risk of MDR pathogens, particular in settings with high baseline MDR rates. ATS/IDSA guidelines addressing both CAP and HAP/VAP have identified risk factors for MDR organisms (Fig. 2). Communication between the microbiology lab, pharmacists, and clinicians is very important to promptly identify patients with inappropriate antibiotics. In addition to the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy, it is crucial to re-evaluate its adequacy. Drug dose should be reassessed as critically ill patients experience marked pharmacokinetic changes in both the volume of distribution and drug clearance rates compared to less sick patients. In addition, antibiotic administration, namely intermittent dosing vs continuous perfusion in time dependent drugs, and antibiotic lung penetration should be checked. A thorough history of the present illness can also raise the possibility of uncommon bacterial and fungal causes of severe pneumonia that may not respond to some empiric antibiotic regimens (Fig. 2). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is greater recognition of viral causes of severe pneumonia not responsive to empiric pneumonia therapy, including influenza (with or without bacterial co-infection), RSV, and finally HSV and CMV reactivation which have uncertain clinical impact.

Septic complication

Non-response could also be the result of concomitant sepsis either directly related to pneumonia or independent of a pulmonary infection. Septic complications because of pneumonia include secondary lung infection, parapneumonic pleural effusion, empyema, lung abscess, and necrotizing pneumonia. Loculated or persistent effusions frequently need a chest tube for source control, often in collaboration with interventional radiology and thoracic surgery. Other septic complications not directly due to pneumonia but that could mimic a non-responding pneumonia include endocarditis, Lemierre syndrome, acalculous cholecystitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, or other hospital-acquired infections.

Two recent major guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) recommend consideration of local antibiotic resistance patterns and individual patient risks for resistant pathogens when formulating an initial empiric antibiotic regimen. One recommends against invasive diagnostic techniques with quantitative cultures to determine the cause of VAP; the other recommends either invasive or noninvasive techniques. Both guidelines recommend short-course therapy be used for most patients with VAP. Although neither guideline recommends use of procalcitonin as an adjunct to clinical judgment when diagnosing VAP, they differ with respect to use of serial procalcitonin to shorten the length of antibiotic treatment.

### Endofungal mycetohabitans rhizoxinica bacteremia associated with rhizopus microsporus respiratory tract infection [^116vdfm2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Four days after leaving the hospital, the patient sought treatment at an outpatient oncology clinic, reporting generalized weakness and fatigue. We performed blood and urine analyses and began a regimen of oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily). On day 6 after discharge, we noted a positive blood culture result, with a gram-negative rod. The urine culture grew 30,000 CFU/mL of Klebsiella pneumoniae. When evaluating the patient during clinical rounds, we performed repeat blood and urine cultures and recommended inpatient management, which was refused. We administered 1 intravenous dose of meropenem (1 g) at that visit and 1 dose of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g) the next day.

On day 8 after discharge, the patient sought emergency treatment for worsening foot and ankle pain. Her leukocyte count was 0.44 × 10³ cells/uL. Bacterial identification of the positive blood culture was still pending. Results of repeat blood and urine cultures and COVID-19 PCR testing (nasopharyngeal) were negative; chest radiograph showed right-, middle-, and lower-lobe airspace opacification (Figure 1, panel A). We began piperacillin/tazobactam and performed an arthrocentesis, which showed crystals but revealed a negative Gram stain. Shortly thereafter, the patient reported acute numbness and weakness of her right leg. She subsequently developed dyspnea, respiratory distress, and altered mental status. We intubated her and conducted magnetic resonance imaging, which showed an acute infarct of the left medial parietal lobe, with hemorrhagic transformation (Figure 1, panel B). We transferred the patient to the intensive care unit, where she was febrile (38.2°C) and required 2 vasopressors. We administered vancomycin, caspofungin, and isavuconazole. The next day, hypotension worsened, requiring 3 vasopressors. Leukocyte was 0.16 × 10³ cells/uL. On hospital day 3, we obtained a tracheal aspirate for cultural analysis. Later that day, pulseless electrical activity occurred; the patient suffered cardiac arrest and died.

### A case of explosive community-acquired pneumonia and septic shock caused by Acinetobacter pittii [^116jaXKR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

The patient is a 50-year-old male, with a height of 172 cm and a weight of 80 kg. He has a long history of outdoor labor, with no prior health issues, no history of smoking or alcohol consumption, no underlying medical conditions, and no history of hospitalization. Eighteen hours before admission, he developed a high fever of 39 °C with no obvious cause, accompanied by chills. Self-medication with cold medicine did not alleviate his symptoms (specific medication unknown), and he developed shortness of breath. At the local hospital, due to hypoxemia, he underwent tracheal intubation and was transferred to our hospital. Upon admission, the patient was under drug-induced sedation, his face was pale, his hands and feet were cold, his body temperature was 38.2 °C, his heart rhythm was regular, heart rate was 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 72/53 mmHg (maintained with norepinephrine at 80 µg/kg·h). Auscultation revealed wet rales in both lungs during inhalation. The ventilator settings were AC/PC (PC 15 cmH₂O, PEEP 7.0 cmH₂O, 80% oxygen concentration), and tidal volumes fluctuated around 500 ml. Laboratory tests revealed: CRP 198.15 mg/L, PLT 34 × 10⁹/L, PCT > 100.00 ng/ml, metabolic acidosis (pH 7.306, PCO₂ 34.8 mmHg, bicarbonate 16.8 mmol/L, lactate 5.0 mmol/L), renal insufficiency (Cr 133 μmol/L), and cardiac insufficiency (BNP 3463.2 pg/ml, myoglobin 1111.0 ng/ml, troponin 0.080 ng/ml). There was also a high inflammatory response (IL-6 4856.48 pg/ml, IL-10 131.66 pg/ml, IL-8 1030.99 pg/ml). The electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities, and cardiac ultrasound indicated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 49%. A chest CT scan showed large areas of consolidation in both lungs, more pronounced in the right lung (Fig. 1). A brain CT scan was normal, while bronchoscopy revealed congestion of the mucosa in both bronchi. Upon admission, his APACHE II score was 28, and SOFA score was 22. He was diagnosed with "severe pneumonia, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction". Treatment included Imipenem-cilastatin 1 g q8h combined with moxifloxacin 0.4 g qd for anti-infection (Fig. 2), methylprednisolone 80 mg q12h for anti-inflammation, restrictive fluid resuscitation, improvement of cardiac function, expectorant therapy, and collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for high-throughput sequencing and microbial culture. On the 4th day of hospitalization, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) detected Acinetobacte r pittii (sequence count: 257,029, relative abundance: 52.92%, gene coverage: 58.36%) (Fig. 3). After 7 days of hospitalization, Imipenem-cilastatin and moxifloxacin were discontinued, and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h was started for anti-infection therapy. On the 15th day of hospitalization, the patient was successfully extubated, but 2 days post-extubation, the patient experienced recurrent paroxysmal convulsions, most notably in the jaw, lasting for about 30 min. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed clear fluid, with 0 white blood cells and no abnormalities in bacterial culture. Electroencephalography, electromyography, brain MRI, and NGS for autoimmune encephalitis were all negative. A repeat chest CT scan showed a cavity-like lesion in the lower right lung, raising suspicion of fungal infection. Multiple tests for fungal galactomannan, β-D-glucan, and fungal cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative. Multiple sputum cultures revealed Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible to all antibiotics, while NGS of the sputum detected Acinetobacter pittii with high sequence counts. Multiple blood cultures were negative. Laboratory tests suggested highly virulent Acinetobacter pittii. The patient was diagnosed with "fulminant community-acquired pneumonia (Acinetobacter pittii)". On the 17th day of hospitalization, based on drug sensitivity, treatment was switched to doxycycline. After 20 days of treatment, a follow-up chest CT showed improvement in the lung cavities.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy (MSSA coverage), ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider administering antibiotics with activity against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem) for initial empiric treatment of patients with HAP with no risk factors for MRSA infection and not being at high risk of mortality.

Regarding medical management for ventilator-associated pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antipseudomonal coverage, ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using two antipseudomonal antibiotics from different classes for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP in the following situations:

- patient with risk factor(s) for antimicrobial resistance

- units where > 10% of Gram-negative isolates are resistant to an agent being considered for monotherapy

- units where local antimicrobial susceptibility rates are not available.

Procalcitonin (PCT) plus clinical criteria — diagnostic accuracy and panel stance for suspected HAP/VAP indicate high misclassification and no survival benefit from a PCT-guided escalation protocol. The false-negative and false-positive rates of serum PCT testing plus clinical criteria are 33% and 17%, respectively; assuming a prevalence of HAP/VAP of 50%, then for every 1000 patients with suspected HAP/VAP who are evaluated with serum PCT plus clinical criteria, 165 patients (16.5%) would be incorrectly diagnosed as not having HAP/VAP and 85 patients (8.5%) will be incorrectly diagnosed as having HAP/VAP. A recent trial randomized ICU patients to a PCT-guided antibiotic escalation protocol vs standard of care showed that the PCT-guided protocol did not result in survival improvement, but resulted in a higher number of ventilator-days and prolonged ICU stay. The panel agreed that the frequency of such undesirable consequences due to misleading PCT results was unacceptable and, therefore, recommended not using PCT to guide antibiotic initiation.

Methods

Study population

This study is a secondary analysis of the data collected from a prospective observational study conducted from November 2012 to November 2013 at a 2500-bed university-based hospital in Thailand. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and outcomes of healthcare-associated pneumonia in the authors' hospital. Our hospital has two sections: a private section and a general section. In the general section, we have around 2200 inpatient beds. The Department of Medicine has 462 inpatient beds comprise 160 general medical ward beds, 186 private beds, 76 special disease beds (such as stroke unit, bone marrow transplant unit) and 40 critical care beds (15 general ICU beds, 10 critical respiratory care beds and 15 cardiac care beds). This study was performed in 8 general medical wards affiliated with the Department of Medicine (160 beds).

Each general medical ward had a 20-patient capacity. Patients were managed by a medical team consisted of an attending physician, 1 third year resident in general internal medicine, 2 first year residents in general internal medicine and 3 to 4 interns rotated to work in the Department of Medicine. Attending physicians were board certified in internal medicine, with minimal critical care training. The medical team were rotated monthly. There were approximately 4 nurses and 4 nurse assistants doing nursing care for the patients.

Due to a shortage of ICU bed, patients who required mechanical ventilation were often admitted directly to a general medical ward. Patients mechanically ventilated on the wards were managed by the same attending physicians that treated non-ventilated patients on the wards. Upon request, some patients were continuous monitoring with electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry.

Consecutive patients admitted to 1 of 8 general medical wards affiliated with the Department of Medicine, were potentially eligible for this study. Patients that met all of the following criteria were included: age > 18 years, admitted from outside the hospital for presumed pneumonia with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain, or dyspnea), and presence of new infiltrate on chest radiograph. Patients that were pregnant, that were enrolled in another trial, that had received immunosuppressants or long-term corticosteroid therapy, that had concomitant acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, that had undergone tracheotomy, or that had a preexisting medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 3 months were excluded. Enrolled patients were excluded during the follow-up period if patients were subsequently transferred to the ICU within 5 days after admission or the etiology of pneumonia was found to be mycobacteria or fungi.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — antibiotic duration is informed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) data; the evidence suggests that antibiotic therapy for ≤ 7 days does not reduce the benefits of antibiotic therapy while shorter courses almost certainly reduce antibiotic-related side effects, C. difficile colitis, the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, and costs, so antibiotic therapy should be prescribed for ≤ 7 days, and the recommendation is strong.

### What is ventilator-associated pneumonia and why is it important? [^116BgErf]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common infections acquired among hospitalized patients. HAP is associated with excess mortality and increased medical care costs. The rise in HAP due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria has resulted in more common administration of inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, with an associated increased risk of hospital mortality. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) refers to HAP occurring in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. VAP is the most common nosocomial infection among patients with acute respiratory failure. Physicians treating patients with HAP and VAP should be aware of the predominant local pathogens associated with these infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. This will allow more appropriate initial antibiotic selection in order to optimize treatment regimens and clinical outcomes. Additionally, clinical strategies aimed at the prevention of HAP and VAP should be employed in all hospital settings caring for patients at risk for these infections.

Use of procalcitonin (PCT) to decide whether to initiate antibiotics in suspected HAP/VAP: For patients with suspected HAP/VAP, we recommend using clinical criteria alone, rather than using serum PCT plus clinical criteria, to decide whether or not to initiate antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Interstitial and parenchymal lung pathology — We suggest that a systematic approach incorporating bedside ultrasound may be a primary diagnostic modality for the intensive care unit (ICU) patient with respiratory failure. Grade 2B. The table lists this topic as 2-B with Conditional Strength of Recommendation and Level of Quality of Evidence B. Supporting statements note that the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound to diagnose alveolar consolidation exceed 90%, that a protocol results in a diagnostic accuracy rate exceeding 90% for common ICU respiratory failure etiologies, and that interstitial syndrome shows multiple vertical "B" lines with well-defined spacing (7 mm apart) while coalescent "B" lines less than 3 mm apart are typical of pulmonary edema or confluent bronchopneumonia; the evidence is graded as "moderate" quality.
