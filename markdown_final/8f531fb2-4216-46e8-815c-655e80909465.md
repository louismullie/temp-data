## Question

For de novo mCSPC with high risk and high volume, what is the most aggressive treatment option — chemotherapy, ADT, or a particular AR-targeted agent — according to the most recent data and survival benefit?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option provides the most aggressive initial systemic treatment with the greatest survival benefit for de novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer that is high-risk and high-volume — chemotherapy, ADT, or a particular AR-targeted agent — based on the most recent data. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how high-risk/high-volume de novo mCSPC is defined and why ADT alone is inadequate. Then, I should compare treatment categories: ADT alone, ADT plus docetaxel, ADT plus an AR pathway inhibitor (ARPI), and triplet therapy with ADT, docetaxel, and an ARPI. Next, I will review the pivotal ARASENS trial and its high-volume subgroup outcomes, verify PSA depth data, and examine toxicity. Finally, I should cross-check contemporary guideline endorsements and conclude with a practical recommendation and caveats about patient fitness for chemotherapy and alternatives if docetaxel is not appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why intensification is crucial. De novo high-volume mCSPC typically carries a worse prognosis, and while ADT is the historical backbone, monotherapy is no longer sufficient for patients with adequate life expectancy who can tolerate intensified regimens; guidelines explicitly advise against ADT monotherapy in M1 patients likely to benefit from combination therapy, underscoring the need for early intensification in this setting [^111V3dwT] [^117Rjpj8].

> Wait, let me verify whether ADT alone could still be justified for "aggressive" disease if symptomatic palliation is the goal; hold on, I should not jump to conclusions. Although immediate ADT is appropriate for symptomatic M1 disease to avert serious sequelae, when discussing the most aggressive and survival-maximizing approach in high-volume de novo mCSPC, expert guidelines recommend against ADT monotherapy when combination therapy is feasible and acceptable to the patient [^114LmN5i] [^115jQh9Q].

> I will now examine ADT plus docetaxel as a doublet, since I initially thought this might be the most aggressive standard; but wait, I need to check whether this is still optimal. While ADT plus docetaxel improves survival over ADT alone, the ARASENS trial demonstrated that adding darolutamide to this doublet further improves overall survival, indicating the doublet is no longer the optimal "most aggressive" choice when a triplet is feasible [^114Yg4cG] [^117Rjpj8].

> Next, I should review ADT plus an ARPI without chemotherapy. Let me consider darolutamide plus ADT in ARANOTE to see if this doublet could rival a triplet in high-volume disease; I should confirm the maturity of OS data. ARANOTE showed a significant rPFS benefit for darolutamide plus ADT versus ADT alone with an HR of 0.54, but OS was immature and not statistically significant at the primary analysis, making this less aggressive than chemo-containing regimens for de novo high-volume disease despite being a valid doublet option endorsed across guidelines for mCSPC broadly [^1167E5Kk] [^115bNmYh] [^112UX7r2] [^111V3dwT].

> Hold on, I should verify the highest level of evidence for the aggressive triplet approach. The phase III ARASENS trial randomized men with mHSPC to ADT and docetaxel with darolutamide versus placebo and showed a significant overall survival improvement with an HR of 0.68, reflecting about a 32% reduction in risk of death; this was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with low risk of bias and consistent benefit across clinically relevant subgroups, firmly establishing ADT plus docetaxel plus darolutamide as the most aggressive and effective upfront systemic option where docetaxel is appropriate [^114Yg4cG] [^117Rjpj8].

> I should double-check the high-volume subgroup and depth of response data because that drives the rationale in this phenotype. In prespecified and post hoc analyses from ARASENS, benefit was maintained in high-volume disease, and deep PSA responses were more frequent with darolutamide triplet; I almost misremembered the undetectable PSA rate, let me verify the exact figures. In high-volume patients, undetectable PSA at any time occurred in 62% with darolutamide triplet versus 26% with the control, and undetectable PSA at 24 weeks correlated with improved outcomes, reinforcing that triplet therapy achieves deeper and more prognostically favorable responses in this subgroup [^113SegqU] [^117Rjpj8].

> Next, I should review guideline endorsements to ensure my recommendation aligns with contemporary standards. Canadian CUA/CUOG 2025 guidelines explicitly recommend offering darolutamide with ADT and docetaxel and more broadly recommend triplet therapy over ADT plus docetaxel alone in patients who can safely tolerate docetaxel, with additional statements supporting the use of darolutamide across mCSPC and endorsing enzalutamide-based triplets for de novo metastases as well; EAU guidance also supports ADT plus darolutamide in M1 patients fit for the regimen, collectively converging on triplet intensification as the preferred aggressive strategy when chemotherapy is appropriate [^112W2KFv] [^112RN1Wb] [^111V3dwT] [^113X2VaD] [^111T2VsS].

> I need to ensure tolerability is acceptable for an "aggressive" approach; let me check safety signals for darolutamide in the triplet context and as monotherapy with ADT. In ARASENS, overall adverse event profiles were similar between arms with most toxicity driven by overlapping docetaxel, and darolutamide's safety has been consistently favorable across programs; notably, ARANOTE reported low fatigue rates with darolutamide plus ADT at 5.6%, and long-term safety datasets in nmCRPC and mCRPC also reinforce a generally favorable tolerability profile without new safety signals, which supports selecting darolutamide for the triplet platform [^114Yg4cG] [^1167E5Kk] [^113Exa9E] [^111wNWzD].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot safely receive docetaxel due to comorbidity or preference; I should verify appropriate alternatives. In patients not fit for chemotherapy, doublet intensification with ADT plus an ARPI such as darolutamide, enzalutamide, or apalutamide remains guideline-concordant and superior to ADT alone, though it is less aggressive than triplet therapy; if chemotherapy becomes appropriate later, sequential intensification can be considered, but the maximal upfront survival gain in high-volume de novo disease is with the triplet [^115jQh9Q] [^115bNmYh] [^112UX7r2] [^112UqsrA].

> In conclusion, after reviewing disease biology, comparative efficacy, subgroup depth of response, and safety, and cross-checking contemporary guidelines, the most aggressive and evidence-based initial regimen for de novo high-risk, high-volume mCSPC is triplet therapy with ADT, docetaxel, and darolutamide, as demonstrated by ARASENS with a significant overall survival benefit and reinforced by multiple guideline endorsements; if docetaxel is not appropriate, an ADT plus ARPI doublet is the preferred alternative, with counseling that its aggressiveness and survival impact in high-volume de novo disease are generally less than the triplet [^114Yg4cG] [^117Rjpj8] [^112W2KFv] [^112RN1Wb] [^111V3dwT].

---

For de novo high-risk, high-volume mCSPC, the most aggressive and evidence-based option is the **triplet therapy** regimen of ADT plus docetaxel plus an ARPI [^117Rjpj8], with **darolutamide preferred** based on ARASENS showing a 32% OS reduction (HR 0.68) [^114Yg4cG] and consistent benefit in high-volume disease [^113SegqU]. This regimen is **guideline-endorsed for fit patients**, with darolutamide favored for its low drug–drug interactions and favorable tolerability [^111T2VsS] [^112RN1Wb] [^111wNWzD] [^112W2KFv]. If docetaxel is unsuitable, use ADT plus an ARPI (abiraterone [^1156qYL6], enzalutamide [^112UX7r2], or apalutamide [^115bNmYh]) [^117Rjpj8] [^1167E5Kk].

---

## Evidence supporting triplet therapy

- **ARASENS trial**: ADT + docetaxel + darolutamide vs ADT + docetaxel + placebo showed a 32% OS reduction (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.57–0.80; p < 0.001) [^114Yg4cG].

- **High-volume benefit**: OS benefit was consistent in high-volume disease (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.57–0.82) [^117Rjpj8].

- **PSA responses**: Higher undetectable PSA rates [^113SegqU] and delayed PSA progression with darolutamide.

- **Tolerability**: Similar adverse events to placebo [^114Yg4cG]; low drug–drug interaction potential.

---

## Guideline recommendations

CUA/CUOG 2025 recommend **triplet therapy** for fit patients with high-volume mCSPC [^112W2KFv], and **EAU 2025** recommend **ADT + darolutamide** for M1 patients fit for the regimen [^111T2VsS] [^115jQh9Q].

---

## Alternative regimens

Alternatively, **ADT + an ARPI** is recommended for patients unable to receive docetaxel, using abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide [^1156qYL6] [^112UX7r2] [^115bNmYh] [^117Rjpj8] [^1167E5Kk].

---

## Clinical considerations

Key clinical considerations include **patient selection**, based on performance status, comorbidities, and preferences [^116uy2D1], and **monitoring**, with regular assessment for adverse events and therapy adjustments as needed.

---

- **Triplet therapy** with ADT, docetaxel, and darolutamide is the most aggressive, evidence-based approach for de novo high-risk, high-volume mCSPC, with strong survival benefit and favorable tolerability [^117Rjpj8].

The ARASENS trial recruited 1,306 men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. It investigated the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and systemic therapy docetaxel in combination with a third novel drug, darolutamide, compared with placebo on overall survival. Triple therapy with ADT, docetaxel, and darolutamide resulted in improved overall survival rates compared with ADT, docetaxel, and placebo (HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.80; p < 0.001). The side effect profile for both treatments was similar. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was assessed to have a low risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool.

### Deep and durable prostate-specific antigen response to darolutamide with androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel, and association with clinical outcomes for patients with high- or low-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: Analyses of the randomized phase 3 ARASENS study [^113SegqU]. European Urology (2024). High credibility.

The addition of darolutamide to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel significantly improved overall survival (OS) in the ARASENS study (NCT02799602). This report focuses on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses and their association with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: ARASENS is an international, double-blind, phase 3 study involving patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Patients were randomized to receive either darolutamide at a dose of 600 mg orally twice daily (n = 651) or a placebo (n = 654), with both groups undergoing ADT and receiving docetaxel. The study compared the proportion of patients with undetectable PSA levels (< 0.2 ng/ml) and evaluated the time to PSA progression (≥ 25% relative and ≥ 2 ng/ml absolute increase from nadir) between the groups using prespecified exploratory analyses. Additionally, PSA outcomes based on disease volume and the association between undetectable PSA levels and key outcomes, such as overall survival, and times to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and PSA progression, were analyzed in post hoc analyses.

- **Key findings and limitations**: The findings indicate that the proportion of patients achieving undetectable PSA levels was more than doubled with darolutamide compared to placebo, with 67% versus 29% in the overall population, 62% versus 26% in the high-volume subgroup, and 84% versus 38% in the low-volume subgroup. Moreover, darolutamide was associated with a delay in the time to PSA progression when compared to placebo, with hazard ratios of 0.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–0.31) in the overall population, 0.30 (95% CI 0.24–0.37) in the high-volume subgroup, and 0.093 (95% CI 0.047–0.18) in the low-volume subgroup. Achieving undetectable PSA levels at 24 weeks correlated with longer overall survival, reflected by a hazard ratio of 0.49 (95% CI 0.37–0.65) in those receiving darolutamide.

### Oral cyclophosphamide for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a scenario of limited health care resources [^113pBZxD]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

In prior non-contemporary studies, oral cyclophosphamide was shown to be an active treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, it is currently underutilized in routine clinical practice due to the lack of survival benefit and the emergence of more effective treatments.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed our institutional database to identify patients with mCRPC treated with cyclophosphamide. The prostate-specific antigen decrease ≥ 50% from baseline (PSA50) response was determined as the proportion of patients achieving a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline ≥ 50% from baseline. Radiographic responses and progression were evaluated by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3. Survival estimates used the Kaplan-Meier method, and correlations were made with the Chi-square test for categorical variables.

- **Results**: From January 2011 to January 2023, 341 patients with mCRPC received oral cyclophosphamide at a tertiary cancer center in São Paulo, Brazil. The most common regimen (95%) was 100 mg once daily for 21 days on, followed by 7 days off. At prostate cancer diagnosis, the median age was 64.4 years (IQR, 59.4–70.8); 61.9% had metastatic de novo disease, and 55.5% had a Gleason score ≥ 8. The median number of previous treatment lines was three (IQR, 2–4). Any PSA decline was observed in 33.4%, and 13.2% had a PSA50 response. Median response duration was 2.1 months (IQR, 1.4–3.8). Ten patients (3%) were treated for ≥ 1 year. The PSA50 response was associated with no prior docetaxel use and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1.

- **Conclusion**: Oral cyclophosphamide demonstrates some level of activity in mCRPC, but its use is limited due to the availability of more effective treatments and lack of significant survival benefit.

### A randomized, open-label, cross-over phase 2 trial of darolutamide and enzalutamide in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: patient preference and cognitive function in ODENZA [^114Fczni]. European Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Darolutamide and enzalutamide are second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors with activity in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and different toxicity profiles.

ODENZA is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, cross-over, phase 2 trial designed to assess preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either darolutamide 1200 mg/d for 12 weeks followed by enzalutamide 160 mg/d for 12 weeks or enzalutamide followed by darolutamide. In both arms, the second treatment was given in the absence of cancer progression.

- **Objective**: The primary endpoint was patient preference between the two drugs, as assessed by a preference questionnaire (p-value calculated with the Prescott test). After week 24, patients entered an extension period during which they received their preferred treatment until progression or toxicity.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: The main secondary objectives included reasons for patient preference, response at week 12, tolerance of each drug, and measurement compared with baseline of cognitive outcomes assessed using tablet questionnaires. Overall, 249 patients, with a median age of 72 years, were randomized. Among the 200 patients who fulfilled the preplanned criteria for the evaluation of the primary endpoint of preference, 97 (49% [41; 56]), 80 (40% [33; 47]), and 23 (12% [7; 16]) chose darolutamide, chose enzalutamide, and had no preference, respectively.

### Natural course of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in the era of intensified androgen deprivation therapy in the hormone-sensitive setting [^1139oY5J]. The Prostate (2024). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) intensification (ADTi) (i.e. ADT with androgen receptor pathway inhibitor or docetaxel, or both) has significantly improved survival outcomes of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). However, the impact of prior ADTi in the mHSPC setting on the disease presentation and survival outcomes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is not well characterized. In this study, our objective was to compare the disease characteristics and survival outcomes of patients with new mCRPC with respect to receipt of intensified or nonintensified ADT in the mHSPC setting.

- **Methods**: In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study, eligibility criteria were as follows: patients diagnosed with mCRPC, treated with an approved first-line mCRPC therapy, and who received either intensified or nonintensified ADT in the mHSPC setting. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined from the start of first-line therapy for mCRPC to progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria or death, and overall survival (OS) was defined from the start of first-line therapy for mCRPC to death or censored at the last follow-up. A multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model was used, adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: Patients (n = 387) treated between March 20, 2008, and August 18, 2022, were eligible and included: 283 received nonintensified ADT, whereas 104 were treated with ADTi. At mCRPC diagnosis, patients in the ADTi group were significantly younger and had more visceral involvement.

### When you get to the fork in the road, take it: The challenges in managing patients with advanced prostate cancer [^112yyXu5]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

As is the case with most solid tumors, the heterogeneity of the disease biology of prostate cancer presents clinicians managing this disease with daily challenges. However, in contrast to other common cancers such as breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, there are unique challenges in prostate cancer management, including the variety of clinicians who manage aspects of the disease (urologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists) and the striking absence of prospective comparative data to inform the optimal sequence of systemic therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant disease.

The purpose of this review is to attempt to assist practicing oncologists with sorting through the myriad of prostate cancer disease subsets and the challenges in making therapeutic decisions in multiple data-free zones given the absence of level 1 comparative clinical trials in the metastatic hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant states.

### Exploring the flare phenomenon in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: Enzalutamide-induced PSMA upregulation observed on PSMA PET [^115XvpKu]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Androgen receptor-targeting agents, particularly enzalutamide, show promise in enhancing prostate cancer diagnostic and therapeutic strategies by modulating prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA).

- **Methods**: A retrospective clinical cohort study investigated 9 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer on enzalutamide. PSMA PET/CT scans were obtained before and after enzalutamide initiation to assess PSMA expression changes. Lesions and organs at risk were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively.

- **Results**: The flare phenomenon was characterized by a significant increase (≥ 20%) in the SUV max of existing lesions or the appearance of new PSMA-positive lesions. Exposure to enzalutamide led to a significant PSMA expression increase in 56% of assessed lesions (n = 42), with new lesions detected in 1 patient (11%). PSMA expression in organs at risk remained largely unaffected, indicating a tumor-specific response.

Enzalutamide induces PSMA upregulation in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, potentially enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Further exploration of the flare phenomenon's clinical implications is warranted.

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^112ikkL6]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the European Union, with 78,800 deaths recorded in 2020. The mortality rate for PCa in 2020 was 10.0 per 100,000, declining by 7.1% since 2015. These favorable trends reflect improvements in treatment strategies. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a cornerstone of PCa treatment for several decades. More recently, androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARpI), including androgen receptors targeted agents (ARTA) such as enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide, as well as steroidogenesis inhibitors like abiraterone, have profoundly impacted the management of advanced prostate cancer. They have been shown to delay progression, increase overall survival (OS), and improve quality of life in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive PCa (mCSPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), or non-metastatic castration-resistant PCa (nmCRPC). Combined with ADT, they have become the standard of care in these indications.

After the AFFIRM study results, enzalutamide was initially approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) in 2012 for patients with mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel treatment. Enzalutamide's indication for treatment was expanded to include mCRPC patients who had never received chemotherapy in 2014. Enzalutamide was licensed by the U.S. FDA in 2018 for use in patients with nmCRPC as a result of the promising findings of the PROSPER trial. Following the findings of the ARCHES trial, the FDA approved enzalutamide for patients with mCSPC in December 2019.

### EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG guidelines on prostate cancer [^1157CY6Q]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of prostate cancer, specifically concerning the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic chemotherapy, the EANM/EAU/ESTRO/ESUR/ISUP/SIOG 2025 guidelines recommend offering additional life-prolonging treatment options. These include abiraterone, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, radium-223, and olaparib in cases of DNA homologous recombination repair alterations. This recommendation applies to patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who are progressing after docetaxel chemotherapy.

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^112HCsQy]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of metastatic disease as well as non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). This systematic review aims to determine outcomes and toxicity in patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) treated with enzalutamide in the primary or salvage settings.

- **Method**: We performed a systematic review focusing on the role of enzalutamide in the treatment of nmCSPC, using the PubMed/Medline database. Articles focusing on androgen receptor inhibitors in nmCSPC were included, while articles discussing exclusively metastatic or castration-resistant PCa were excluded.

- **Results**: The initial search retrieved 401 articles, of which 15 underwent a thorough assessment for relevance. Ultimately, 12 studies with pertinent outcomes were meticulously examined. Among these, seven studies were dedicated to the investigation of enzalutamide in the primary setting, while the remaining five publications specifically addressed its use in salvage settings. Regardless of the treatment setting, our data revealed two distinct therapeutic strategies. The first advocates for the substitution of enzalutamide for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), based on the premise of achieving equivalent, if not superior, oncological outcomes while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. The second, adopting a more conventional approach, entails augmenting the effectiveness of ADT by incorporating enzalutamide.

- **Conclusion**: Enzalutamide has considerable potential in the treatment of nmCSPC, whether as a replacement for ADT or as an adjunct to enhance oncological outcomes.

### Real-world overall survival with abiraterone acetate versus enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^1143Q7Dq]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

This study has some limitations. As this was a retrospective cohort study of the Medicare population, findings may not be applicable to the general population. Given the lack of specific diagnosis codes for mCRPC, assumptions were made in selecting patients with mCRPC based on clinical input and initiation of treatment with abiraterone and enzalutamide during a period when both were approved for mCRPC only and before public disclosure of the abiraterone clinical trial findings in mCSPC.

Furthermore, this study may be limited by residual confounding as we were unable to adjust survival outcomes by several potentially confounding clinical factors (e.g. performance status, laboratory measurements, tumor grade, and metastatic disease burden) due to their unavailability in the Medicare data. Our analysis utilized Medicare claim data which are inherently subject to inaccuracies in the coding of diagnoses and therapies. In addition, claims data do not provide information about the causes of change in treatment. However, as inaccuracies in data tend to bias the results to the null, it is possible our study misestimated the survival detriment associated with abiraterone.

Variables such as time from first PC diagnosis to metastatic diagnosis and time from ADT to index date may be truncated because claims data were available after patients became eligible and were enrolled in Medicare. Finally, a filled pharmacy claim does not guarantee that the patient used the prescribed treatment.

In conclusion, in the Medicare chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC population, patients initiating 1L abiraterone…

### Efficacy and safety of darolutamide in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy and docetaxel in Black patients from the randomized ARASENS trial [^117GDPcY]. The Oncologist (2024). High credibility.

Prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and can be treated with hormonal therapy, including androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), is called metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Based on results from the phase III ARASENS study, darolutamide is an approved treatment for mHSPC when used in combination with ADT and docetaxel (chemotherapy). This report provides information on the effect of darolutamide, ADT, and docetaxel in the 54 Black patients in ARASENS. In these patients, darolutamide was well tolerated and lowered the risks of patients dying and their cancer progressing. These results are consistent with the overall ARASENS population.

### Current systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer [^1142vLEs]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Low credibility.

This review aims to explore the evolving landscape of treatments available for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) patients. In less than a decade, evidence has chronologically demonstrated that:

- **Systemic treatment intensification with docetaxel**: Improves outcomes, including survival, in men with mCSPC.
- **Combining androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a second-generation androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI)**: Further improves outcomes.
- **Triplet systemic therapy**: The combination of ADT, an ARPI, and docetaxel further enhances outcomes, including survival.

Radiotherapy to the prostate, combined with ADT alone, is now recommended for men with low-volume mCSPC. The combination of prostate radiotherapy and intensified systemic treatment, including abiraterone, may be synergistic, as suggested in the PEACE-1 trial. The role of metastases-directed local therapies, mostly stereotactic radiotherapy, is currently being assessed in phase 3 trials. Furthermore, integrating biomarkers, such as BRCA2 gene alterations, PTEN loss, and PSMA expression, into decision-making processes is not yet established, though trials are underway. It is important to note that most available evidence was obtained in men with de novo metastases, while the role of treatment intensification in those with metastatic relapse after definitive local treatment is less well established. Treatment intensification is now the standard of care for patients with de novo mCSPC as it leads to improved outcomes.

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: A systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^113iB1RY]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of metastatic disease, as well as non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). This systematic review aims to determine outcomes and toxicity in patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) treated with enzalutamide in the primary or salvage settings.

- **Method**: We performed a systematic review focusing on the role of enzalutamide in the treatment of nmCSPC, using the PubMed/Medline database. Articles focusing on androgen receptor inhibitors in nmCSPC were included, while articles discussing exclusively metastatic or castration-resistant PCa were excluded.

- **Results**: The initial search retrieved 401 articles, of which 15 underwent a thorough assessment for relevance. Ultimately, 12 studies with pertinent outcomes were meticulously examined. Among these, seven studies were dedicated to the investigation of enzalutamide in the primary setting, while the remaining five publications specifically addressed its use in salvage settings. Regardless of the treatment setting, our data revealed two distinct therapeutic strategies. The first advocates for the substitution of enzalutamide for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), based on the premise of achieving equivalent, if not superior, oncological outcomes while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. The second, adopting a more conventional approach, entails augmenting the effectiveness of ADT by incorporating enzalutamide.

- **Conclusion**: Enzalutamide has considerable potential in treating nmCSPC, offering alternative therapeutic options and possibly reducing treatment-related toxicity.

### Functional assessment in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with darolutamide: Results from the DaroAcT study [^113okdEJ]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Androgen receptor inhibitors (ARIs) are approved for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer; however, some patients may experience symptoms and side effects that hinder their physical functioning. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) tests are used to assess physical functioning in older adults and are recommended assessments for patients with prostate cancer, despite lacking validation in this setting.

DaroAcT (NCT04157088) was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2b study designed to evaluate the effects of the ARI darolutamide (lead-in phase) and darolutamide versus enzalutamide (randomized phase) on physical functioning in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Only the lead-in phase, in which participants received darolutamide 600 mg twice daily, was completed. The TUG and SPPB tests were used to assess physical functioning.

The lead-in phase enrolled 30 participants. During 24 weeks of treatment, 8 (32.0%) of 25 evaluable participants exhibited clinically meaningful worsening in TUG from baseline (primary endpoint). At the week 24 visit, 5 (21.7%) of 23 participants had worsening in TUG time, and 8 (33.3%) of 24 participants had worsening in SPPB score. Because only 48% of participants had the same outcome on the TUG and SPPB tests, the study was terminated without initiating the randomized comparison.

Most participants showed no clinically meaningful worsening in physical functioning after 24 weeks of darolutamide treatment, but poor agreement between tests was observed.

### Safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with darolutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^116hwBmW]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The favorable safety and tolerability profile of long-term darolutamide treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are consistent with those previously reported from early phase studies and in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Extended treatment with darolutamide in the open-label phase of the ARAMIS trial, with a median treatment duration of 25.8 months, showed minimal increase in the incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from the darolutamide double-blind period of 18.5 months. These increases disappeared when adjusted for longer exposure, and no new safety signals were observed.

The randomized, crossover, phase 2 ODENZA trial compared darolutamide and enzalutamide in 200 patients with mCRPC for treatment preference and cognitive outcomes. Darolutamide was preferred by 48.5% of patients compared to 40.0% for enzalutamide (P = 0.92). A clinically meaningful benefit in episodic memory and less fatigue was observed in patients receiving darolutamide compared with those receiving enzalutamide. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons and meta-analyses have shown a lower risk of adverse events and similar efficacy with darolutamide versus apalutamide and enzalutamide.

In conclusion, long-term treatment with darolutamide in this small group of patients with mCRPC was well tolerated.

### Safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with darolutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^114dSm4f]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

In patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, darolutamide was well tolerated for 25 months, but minimal long-term safety data are available.

- **Methods**: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for patients receiving darolutamide for a median of 38 months (n = 13) are described in this pooled analysis of individual patient data from phase 1/2 studies.

- **Results**: All patients reported TEAEs (mostly grade 1/2). The most common TEAEs were diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea. Serious TEAEs were reported in six patients (none related to darolutamide). All treatment-related TEAEs (n = 5) were grade 1.

- **Conclusions**: Long-term darolutamide treatment was well tolerated; no new safety signals observed.

- **Tweetable abstract**: In patients with mCRPC, long-term darolutamide treatment was well tolerated and no new safety signals were observed. These findings are consistent with previous reports, demonstrating a favorable safety and tolerability profile of darolutamide.

### Real-world overall survival comparison of enzalutamide and abiraterone in first- and second-line setting of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^114wZE7y]. The Prostate (2025). High credibility.

In total, 3497 mCRPC patients were treated with first-line (n = 2215) or second-line (n = 1282) abiraterone or enzalutamide.

For the first-line comparison, data from 1372 abiraterone-treated and 843 enzalutamide-treated patients were available. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 66% for enzalutamide and 62% for abiraterone. The median OS of 29.3 months (95% CI: 26.3–32.6) was significantly longer for enzalutamide compared to abiraterone, which had a median OS of 25.0 months (95% CI: 23.1–27.2) (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74–0.96; p = 0.008). The difference was even more pronounced in the subgroup of patients who did not receive further therapies (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69–0.91; p = 0.001).

### Epidemiology of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in veterans nationwide [^116TNUQt]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). Low credibility.

There is limited research on the burden and outcomes of patients diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which may result in limited understanding of the disease and lead to suboptimal disease management. Using a validated algorithm to identify mCRPC disease onset, this study offers the first comprehensive description of mCRPC among veterans nationwide.

- **Methods**: The study used data from the Veterans Health Administration's Corporate Data Warehouse. Participants were identified using the Prostate Datacore, which uses structured data and natural language processing to identify veterans with prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, and mCRPC. We calculated prevalence and age-adjusted incidence rates of mCRPC from 2005 to 2022 and performed Mann-Kendall trend tests to analyze statistical trends within the time series data. We performed a time-to-event analysis to calculate the median time to mCRPC by disease course, as well as a survival analysis from the date of mCRPC diagnosis to death.

- **Results**: We identified 44,246 patients with mCRPC. Prevalence, incidence, and survival increased each year, with the highest prevalence in the western United States. In 2022, the age-adjusted incidence rate was 5 per 1,000 prostate cancer cases. Median time to mCRPC from prostate cancer diagnosis was 5.68 years in patients with de novo disease and 10.98 years in patients with disease progression from localized stages. Median overall survival increased from 1.23 years (95% CI, 1.19–1.27) in 2005 to 2011, to 1.75 years (95% CI, 1.70–1.80) in 2012.

### Comparison of standard-dose and reduced-dose treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide: a rapid review [^111dQpi3]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Retrospective analyses of two studies investigated the impact of starting enzalutamide at ≤ 50% dose on metastatic prostate cancer outcomes. Of 111 patients treated in the first study, 32 received a low dose (≤ 80 mg/day) and 79 received the standard dose (160 mg/day). Men who received low-dose enzalutamide had poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and more comorbidities, although baseline PSA doubling time and distribution of metastases were similar between the groups. The study found that men receiving low-dose enzalutamide had better longevity (restricted mean attained age: 89.1 years in low-dose enzalutamide vs. 83.3 years in standard dose patients, p = 0.025), as well as fewer adverse events.

In a similar analysis of 59 patients with metastatic prostate cancer aged ≥ 75 years, 43 men received low-dose enzalutamide (≤ 80 mg/day) and 16 received the standard dose (160 mg/day). PSA response (reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline) was observed in 18 (45%) and 10 (67%) patients receiving low and standard-dose enzalutamide at 12 weeks (p = 0.15), respectively. No significant difference in overall survival (OS) or PSA progression-free survival (PFS) was observed between the two groups.

### Comparison of standard-dose and reduced-dose treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide: a rapid review [^116JVD7N]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

This review identified peer-reviewed evidence that reported on primary outcomes related to reduced-dose enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide in men with metastatic prostate cancer. The findings suggest that each drug could be given at lower than the registered dose without potential loss of antitumor activity and with a probable decrease in toxicity due to off-target effects.

There is an unmet need for assessing the potential benefits of lower-dose anticancer treatments, particularly in frail or comorbid patients who may experience substantial toxicity when given registered doses. The development of anticancer drugs continues to rely on historical paradigms for cytotoxic chemotherapy (maximum tolerated dose, MTD), which is rarely reconsidered after approval or labeling. Modern targeted therapies bind to specific molecules, and often there is no increase in efficacy beyond a certain dose, making the MTD concept irrelevant for a new generation of anticancer agents. Phase I trials of enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide do not show evidence of a relationship between increased drug exposure and efficacy near the labeled dose, suggesting that lower doses of these drugs may have near-equivalent efficacy in metastatic prostate cancer.

Cancer care is challenged by high drug expenditures and an aging population, and it is important to identify safe, effective, less expensive dosing regimens. There is substantial financial toxicity associated with the 'utamides' to patients (where medication costs are not covered) and to healthcare payers.

### Initial management approach for localized/locally advanced disease is critical to guide metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer care [^115U9b6R]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Currently, several therapies are available for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but there are no specific clinical factors to personalize treatment. We first sought the prognostic value of duration on androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) in patients receiving androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitors (ARSI) for mCRPC.

- **Methods**: A multicenter cohort of mCRPC patients who started ARSI between July 2011 and October 2021 was identified. Based on their initial disease burden and duration on ADT for HSPC, primary progressive (PP) men were classified into four groups: low/intermediate-risk localized disease (LOC) and high-risk localized/locally advanced disease (LAD) and short-term (ST) < 24 vs. long-term (LT) ADT ≥ 24 months, whereas de novo (DN) mHSPC were subdivided into short-time vs. long-time to CRPC.

- **Results**: We included 919 mCRPC patients with a median age of 77 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 71–82]. Median ADT duration in HSPC was 24 months (IQR = 14–40). Median follow-up was 91 months (IQR = 62–138), and median OS and PFS from ARSI start were 20 (IQR = 10–32) and 10 months (IQR = 5–19), respectively. In PP developing metastatic disease (n = 655, 71.3%), LOC and LAD with ST ADT had a greater than almost double-risk of death compared to LT ADT (LOC/ST: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.01; 95% CI 1.54–2.64; LAD/ST: HR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.34–2.24; p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis including age, prognostic cohort, Gleason, ECOG, radical radiotherapy, and prostatectomy, groups with ST ADT were associated with worse OS compared to LT ADT.

### Seminal papers in urology: Darolutamide and survival in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [^117VqraW]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

The study examines the impact of darolutamide, a novel drug, on survival rates in patients with non-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Significant benefits were observed, particularly when darolutamide was combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), showing improved survival rates compared to ADT alone. Smith et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the survival rates of standard therapy — ADT plus docetaxel — with the addition of the androgen-receptor pathway inhibitor, darolutamide, to these two drugs. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in March 2022.

Adult patients over the age of 18, with prostate cancer confirmed through histology or cytology and radiologically proven metastasis, were eligible to participate in the trial. Inclusion criteria also required an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 to 1.

- **Primary outcome measure**: Overall survival was defined as the duration from randomization to death, regardless of cause.
- **Secondary outcome measures**: These included the time to progression of the disease to castrate-resistant status, initiation of systemic chemotherapy, and less subjective outcomes like worsening symptoms, measured through pain scores.

All patients recruited for the study underwent ADT or orchidectomy within 12 weeks before randomization and had also received six cycles of docetaxel. Additionally, oral steroids were administered to prevent hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retention, as per clinician discretion.

Randomization to either the darolutamide group or the placebo group was conducted in a 1:1 ratio and adjusted for metastasis stage.

### Current landscape in first-line treatment of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness focused review [^116PGkhK]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common neoplastic disease. Most PCa cases are diagnosed in asymptomatic patients with early-stage disease: 69% have localized disease, 13% have regional lymph node involvement, and 8% have distant metastasis (U.S. SEER data). However, stage distribution at diagnosis may differ in developing countries, possibly due to reduced access to mass screening compared to developed countries.

Metastatic PCa (mPCa) is a critical stage given its incurable nature and association with morbidity (e.g. complications such as skeletal-related events and urethral obstruction) and mortality (metastasis-free survival is used as a surrogate outcome for overall survival (OS) in localized PCa). mPCa is initially responsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a stage referred to as metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Consequently, ADT has been the cornerstone of mPCa treatment for decades. However, despite an initial response to ADT, progression typically occurs within 1–2 years of ADT initiation. Progression despite ADT is a hallmark of metastatic androgen deprivation-resistant prostate cancer (mARPC), from which most PCa deaths result.

The mCSPC therapeutic landscape has changed significantly over the past decade with the introduction of combination therapies (i.e. ADT plus androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs), with or without docetaxel). Combination strategies have consistently shown benefit in OS over ADT, and guidelines have been updated accordingly, recommending combination therapy as the standard of care (SoC).

### Functional assessment in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with darolutamide: Results from the DaroAcT study [^11622xan]. The Oncologist (2025). High credibility.

The DaroAcT study was designed as a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 2b study comparing darolutamide with enzalutamide in participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who had not been previously treated with darolutamide, enzalutamide, or apalutamide. The study was structured into two phases.

The first phase was a lead-in phase to assess study feasibility, including compliance and variability associated with the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) assessments. During this phase, 30 participants were to be treated with darolutamide 600 mg (2 × 300 mg tablets) twice daily, a dosage based on the phase 3 ARAMIS study in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). The primary analysis of the lead-in phase was to occur when at least 30 participants had been in the study for ≥ 24 weeks, unless participants discontinued due to withdrawal, death, or were lost to follow-up.

The second planned phase was to begin after the primary evaluation of findings from the lead-in phase. In this phase, 120 additional participants were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or enzalutamide 160 mg once daily. Participants were to receive treatment until toxicity or disease progression, and the study was to continue until ≥ 52 weeks after the initial dose of study treatment was administered to the last participant, unless discontinued due to death, withdrawal, or being lost to follow-up. After the end of study treatment, further therapy for each participant was at the discretion of the investigator. All participants were required to have CRPC and to continue to receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) of the investigator's choice.

### Extended safety and tolerability of darolutamide for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and adverse event time course in ARAMIS [^111f8x7K]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) are usually asymptomatic and seek treatments that improve survival but have a low risk of adverse events. Darolutamide, a structurally distinct androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi), significantly reduced the risk of metastasis and death compared to placebo in the ARAMIS trial. We assessed the extended safety and tolerability of darolutamide and the time-course profile of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to ARi as well as androgen-suppressive treatment.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients with nmCRPC were randomized 2:1 to darolutamide (n = 955) or placebo (n = 554). After trial unblinding, patients could receive open-label darolutamide. Tolerability and TEAEs were assessed every 16 weeks. Time interval-specific new and cumulative event rates were determined during the first 24 months of the double-blind period.

- **Results**: Darolutamide remained well tolerated during the double-blind and open-label periods, with 98.8% of patients receiving the full planned dose. The incidence of TEAEs of interest in the darolutamide group was low and ≤ 2% different from that in the placebo group, except for fatigue. When incidences were adjusted for exposure time, there were minimal differences between the darolutamide double-blind and double-blind plus open-label periods. The rate of initial onset and cumulative incidence of grade 3/4 TEAEs and serious TEAEs were similar for darolutamide and placebo groups over 24 months.

- **Conclusion**: Extended treatment with darolutamide was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed.

### Functional assessment in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with darolutamide: Results from the DaroAcT study [^114yzFQV]. The Oncologist (2025). High credibility.

Androgen receptor inhibitors (ARIs) are approved for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer; however, some patients may experience symptoms and side effects that hinder their physical functioning. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) tests are used to assess physical functioning in older adults and are recommended assessments for patients with prostate cancer, despite lacking validation in this setting.

- **Methods**: DaroAct (NCT04157088) was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2b study designed to evaluate the effects of the ARI darolutamide (lead-in phase) and darolutamide vs enzalutamide (randomized phase) on physical functioning in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Only the lead-in phase, in which participants received darolutamide 600 mg twice daily, was completed. The TUG and SPPB tests were used to assess physical functioning.

- **Results**: The lead-in phase enrolled 30 participants. During 24 weeks of treatment, 8 (32.0%) of 25 evaluable participants exhibited clinically meaningful worsening in TUG from baseline (primary endpoint). At the week 24 visit, 5 (21.7%) of 23 participants had worsening in TUG time, and 8 (33.3%) of 24 participants had worsening in SPPB score. Because only 48% of participants had the same outcome on the TUG and SPPB tests, the study was terminated without initiating the randomized comparison.

- **Conclusion**: Most participants showed no clinically meaningful worsening in physical functioning after 24 weeks of darolutamide treatment, but poor agreement between tests was observed.

### Systemic therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115EoiU4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

In terms of medical management for prostate cancer, particularly concerning the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the 2025 ASCO guidelines recommend considering several options. These options include clinical trials, cabazitaxel plus carboplatin, carboplatin monotherapy, best supportive care, and hospice care. These recommendations apply to patients who were previously treated with androgen deprivation therapy, androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, and docetaxel, yet continue to experience disease progression.

### Real-world evaluation of primary versus secondary prevention of skeletal-related events in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^114QHKca]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

We show that in a large, contemporary cohort of mCRPC decedents, very few patients receive primary preventative BTAs for prevention of SREs. Instead, we found that the majority of real-world practice is to prescribe BTAs after the first SRE or within the last year of life. Many patients never receive BTA. Consideration for the introduction of BTA early, during the first-line of therapy for mCRPC, may be a more effective preventative strategy in this patient population.

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^112ajPPp]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

According to the EAU guidelines, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may be offered to patients as monotherapy in selected cases with biochemical recurrence (BCR). Intensification of ADT with enzalutamide or replacement of ADT by enzalutamide are two pathways currently under investigation in this setting.

Tombal et al. were the first to investigate enzalutamide monotherapy as the front-line treatment in patients with localized prostate cancer and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). In a phase 2 multicenter open-label single arm study, 67 patients (35 M0, 10 M1, and 22 Mx) received enzalutamide monotherapy until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity.

To assess the efficacy of enzalutamide, they used a PSA response defined as an 80% PSA drop over pretreatment values. Of the 42 patients who remained on enzalutamide up to the 3-year visit, 38 (90.5%) maintained a PSA response. At 3 years, there was a small decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) compared to baseline, which was lower than the mean BMD decrease reported for long-term ADT. Nine out of 67 patients (13.4%) experienced adverse events possibly related to enzalutamide, leading to discontinuation during or after the 3-year period. Gynecomastia and fatigue were the two most frequent adverse events reported, affecting 49.3% and 38.8% of patients, respectively (all grades). During the 3 years, grade ≥ 3 toxicity was reported in 34% of patients. The open-label single arm design and the small and heterogeneous study population are among the limitations of this study. However, it provided a rationale for further investigation of enzalutamide monotherapy in the non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) setting.

### Extended safety and tolerability of darolutamide for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and adverse event time course in ARAMIS [^113Exa9E]. The Oncologist (2024). High credibility.

Patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) are usually asymptomatic and seek treatments that improve survival but have a low risk of adverse events. Darolutamide, a structurally distinct androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi), significantly reduced the risk of metastasis and death versus placebo in ARAMIS. We assessed the extended safety and tolerability of darolutamide and the time-course profile of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to ARis as well as androgen-suppressive treatment.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients with nmCRPC were randomized 2:1 to darolutamide (n = 955) or placebo (n = 554). After trial unblinding, patients could receive open-label darolutamide. Tolerability and TEAEs were assessed every 16 weeks. Time interval–specific new and cumulative event rates were determined during the first 24 months of the double-blind period.

- **Results**: Darolutamide remained well tolerated during the double-blind and open-label periods, with 98.8% of patients receiving the full planned dose. The incidence of TEAEs of interest in the darolutamide group was low and ≤ 2% different from that in the placebo group, except for fatigue. When incidences were adjusted for exposure time, there were minimal differences between the darolutamide double-blind and double-blind plus open-label periods. The rate of initial onset and cumulative incidence of grade 3/4 TEAEs and serious TEAEs were similar for darolutamide and placebo groups over 24 months.

Extended treatment with darolutamide was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed.

### Current landscape in first-line treatment of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness focused review [^111AwdBP]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Contemporary treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) has evolved significantly over the past decade with the introduction of upfront combination therapies, such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs), with or without docetaxel, previously reserved for more advanced stages of the disease. However, the evidence is still controversial regarding the benefit of triple combinations beyond high-volume disease (HVD) compared to double combinations, particularly those consisting of ADT+ARPIs. Additionally, financial considerations regarding net benefits make these treatment regimens an unfavorable option from a cost-effectiveness standpoint, especially in resource-limited contexts.

Considering the lack of head-to-head trials for the direct comparison of triplets vs. ADT+ARPIs in different subgroups, as most evidence of specific combination superiority comes from indirect comparison in meta-analyses, and the questionable cost-effectiveness profile triplets have shown, we propose that the role of triplets is reserved for synchronous, HVD mHSPC in a resource-rich setting. Consequently, our work proposes a treatment algorithm that weighs the overall survival (OS) benefit according to the clinical risk of each patient subgroup and the availability of clinical resources.

In this scenario of abundant options, future research will focus on clarifying the selection of the most appropriate treatment for each patient according to their clinical characteristics and re-evaluating the cost-effectiveness of treatments as new drug developments emerge.

### Darolutamide in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer from the phase III ARANOTE trial [^1167E5Kk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

For patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), delaying progression to castration-resistant disease is important not only for overall survival (OS) but also for patients' quality of life. Darolutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with docetaxel improved OS versus ADT and docetaxel in patients with mHSPC. The ARANOTE trial evaluated darolutamide and ADT without chemotherapy in patients with mHSPC.

- **Methods**: In this global phase III trial, patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo, with concomitant ADT. The primary endpoint was radiological progression-free survival (rPFS).

- **Results**: From March 2021 to August 2022, 669 patients were randomly assigned (darolutamide n = 446; placebo n = 223). At the primary cutoff date (June 7, 2024), darolutamide plus ADT significantly improved rPFS, reducing the risk of radiological progression or death by 46% versus placebo plus ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71]; P < 0.0001). The benefits were consistent across subgroups, including high- and low-volume disease. OS results were suggestive of benefit with darolutamide versus placebo (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.12]), and clinical benefits were seen across all other secondary endpoints, including delayed time to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.51]) and time to pain progression (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96]). Adverse events were similar in the two groups. Notably, the incidence of fatigue was lower in patients receiving darolutamide (5.6%).

### Oral cyclophosphamide for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a scenario of limited health care resources [^113cqAZn]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Prior noncontemporary studies have demonstrated that oral cyclophosphamide is an active treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Despite this, cyclophosphamide is currently underutilized in routine clinical practice due to the lack of observed survival benefits and the emergence of more effective treatments.

We conducted a retrospective review of our institutional database to identify patients with mCRPC treated with cyclophosphamide. We determined the prostate-specific antigen decrease of ≥ 50% from baseline (PSA50) response as the proportion of patients achieving a decline of ≥ 50% from baseline PSA levels. Radiographic responses and progression were evaluated by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria. Survival estimates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method, and correlations with categorical variables were assessed through the Chi-square test.

From January 2011 to January 2023, a total of 341 patients with mCRPC were treated with oral cyclophosphamide at a tertiary cancer center in São Paulo, Brazil. The most common regimen (95%) consisted of 100 mg once daily for 21 days, followed by 7 days off. At the time of prostate cancer diagnosis, the median age of patients was 64.4 years (IQR, 59.4–70.8); 61.9% of patients had metastatic de novo disease, and 55.5% had a Gleason score of ≥ 8. The median number of previous treatment lines was three (IQR, 2–4). Any decline in PSA levels was observed in 33.4% of patients, while a PSA50 response was observed in 13.2% of patients. The median duration of response was 2.1 months (IQR, 1.4–3.8). Notably, ten patients (3%) were treated for ≥ 1 year. The PSA50 response was associated with no prior use of docetaxel and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.

### Reproducible preclinical models of androgen receptor driven human prostate cancer bone metastasis [^115max3Z]. The Prostate (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PC) frequently develop metastases in distant organs, especially bone. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the nearly universal treatment for PC that recurs following local treatment. ADT is initially effective and leads to extended survival, but lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) almost always develops. About 80% of the time, castration resistance is dependent upon reacquired androgen receptor signaling. Several resistance mechanisms exist, including AR amplification and mutation, expression of constitutively active AR splice variants such as AR-V7, GR-mediated bypass, and increased endogenous autocrine or paracrine-mediated androgen availability. In addition, lineage plasticity relieves a requirement for AR signaling and is associated with loss of AR expression, rendering tumor cells unresponsive to androgen blockade. This results in the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and double-negative prostate cancer.

The progression to androgen indifference by PCs is characterized by various clinicopathological features such as rapid progression following ADT, visceral metastasis, lytic bone metastasis, and low pretreatment PSA levels. Importantly, aggressive variants frequently contain mutations in two or more of the tumor suppressor genes, including PTEN, TP53, and RB1. To accurately recapitulate various patient cohorts, models should replicate the resistance characteristics that evolve following androgen receptor signaling inhibitor treatment.

### Seminal papers in urology: Darolutamide and survival in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [^111EFZY2]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

There was a 32.5% reduction in the risk of death for patients who received darolutamide compared to those who received a placebo, representing a significant improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.80; P < 0.001). The overall survival rate at four years was 62.7% in the darolutamide group and 50.4% in the placebo group. Patients allocated to receive darolutamide with ADT and docetaxel also performed better in secondary outcomes than those in the placebo group.

The adverse event rate was similar in the two groups. The most commonly reported adverse event was alopecia, followed by neutropenia, fatigue, and anemia. In the darolutamide group, 13.5% of patients with adverse events led to drug discontinuation compared to only 10.5% in the placebo group.

### Darolutamide in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer from the Phase III ARANOTE trial [^1139nS6u]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

For patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), delaying progression to castration-resistant disease is critical for both overall survival (OS) and quality of life. Previous research demonstrated that darolutamide combined with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel improved OS compared to ADT and docetaxel alone in mHSPC patients. The ARANOTE trial investigated the effectiveness of darolutamide and ADT, excluding chemotherapy, in patients with mHSPC.

In this global Phase III trial, patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or a placebo, both with concomitant ADT. The primary endpoint was radiological progression-free survival (rPFS).

From March 2021 to August 2022, 669 patients were randomly allocated (darolutamide: n = 446; placebo: n = 223). At the primary cutoff date (June 7, 2024), darolutamide plus ADT significantly improved rPFS, demonstrating a 46% reduction in the risk of radiological progression or death compared to placebo plus ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71]; P < .0001). This benefit was consistent across various subgroups, including patients with both high- and low-volume disease. OS results suggested a benefit of darolutamide over placebo (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.12]). Clinical benefits were observed across all secondary endpoints, such as delayed time to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.51]) and delayed time to pain progression (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96]). Adverse events were similar between the groups. Notably, the incidence of fatigue was lower in patients receiving darolutamide (5.6%).

### Safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with darolutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^111wNWzD]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Darolutamide is a structurally distinct and highly potent androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi) that demonstrated strong efficacy and a consistently favorable safety and tolerability profile in the phase 3 ARAMIS and ARASENS studies in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) and patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Darolutamide, in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) or ADT and docetaxel, respectively, reduced the risk of death by more than 30% compared with placebo.

In ARAMIS, most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) commonly associated with ARi therapy showed a ≤ 2% difference between darolutamide and placebo, and discontinuation rates due to TEAEs were low and similar to placebo (8.9% vs. 8.7%). The overall incidence of TEAEs was also similar between darolutamide and placebo in ARASENS, with the highest incidences of TEAEs occurring during the overlapping docetaxel treatment period.

Among patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), darolutamide was well tolerated for up to 25 months in the previously reported ARADES, ARAFOR, and Japanese phase 1/2 studies. ARADES was a phase 1 dose-escalation/phase 2 randomized dose-expansion study (NCT01317641/NCT01429064) of 136 patients in whom darolutamide was administered twice daily (BID) at doses of 200, 300, or 700 mg. The ARAFOR study (NCT01784757) was a food-effect study that enrolled 30 patients who received darolutamide 600 mg BID. A Japanese phase 1 study (NCT02363855) included nine patients who received darolutamide 300 mg BID.

### Functional assessment in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with darolutamide: Results from the DaroAcT study [^1128XVHm]. The Oncologist (2025). High credibility.

Androgen receptor inhibitors are approved to treat patients with advanced prostate cancer, but they are associated with symptoms and side effects that may hinder physical functioning. In the DaroAcT study of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, most participants treated with darolutamide (an androgen receptor antagonist) showed no clinically meaningful worsening in physical functioning. However, there was poor agreement of results between the two tests used to measure physical functioning: the Timed Up and Go test and the Short Physical Performance Battery test. These results highlight the need to identify the best tools that accurately assess the impact of treatments on physical functioning in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

### Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and combination treatment outcomes: A review [^117Rjpj8]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is currently an incurable disease. Despite a high response rate to androgen-deprivation therapy, most cases progress to castration-resistant disease, the terminal phase. This review provides a summary of the most recent evidence and emerging management strategies, including treatment intensification with combinations of therapies. It also provides recommendations on applying the evidence in clinical practice to encourage appropriate treatment to improve survival outcomes among patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

- **Observations**: Androgen-deprivation therapy is the backbone of treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer; however, it is insufficient alone to provide sustained disease control and long-term survival. The addition of an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and/or docetaxel significantly improves survival, as demonstrated by several international phase 3 randomized clinical trials. Triplet therapy, composed of androgen-deprivation therapy plus an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor plus docetaxel, has been shown to improve overall survival over androgen-deprivation therapy plus docetaxel. In the ARASENS trial (darolutamide), the hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.68 (95% CI, 0.57–0.80) in the overall population; 0.71 (95% CI, 0.59–0.85) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.35–1.05) in patients with de novo and recurrent disease, respectively; 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57–0.82) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.41–1.13) in patients with high-volume and low-volume disease, respectively.
